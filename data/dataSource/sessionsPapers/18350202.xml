                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a market-gardener at Tottenham, Middlesex. The prisoner was in my service in November last. On the 5th of November I had lost 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I had lost money before, but did not distrust the prisoner—I cannot exactly say how much I lost altogether—in consequence of suspicion, I examined her clothes after she was gone to bed, between ten and eleven o'clock on the 5th of November—(we had no regular agreement for any wages)—I found £7 or £8 in her pocket—the money was in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and there was some silver—she was asleep—I awoke her, and told her I felt very uncomfortable, that I missed the money, and I said, "There is only you and your brother in my house"—(his name is Walker, he is a half-brother)—she said, "I hope you do not distrust me, Mrs. Cambridge"—my answer was there was only her and her brother in the house—I said, "Do you think your brother's key opens my box?"—she said, "I do not know, his key is in the box, and you can try it"—I did so, and it would not fit it—I told her I was defici<lb/>ent in my payments; I was going to take the money to London with me next morning, and did not know what I should do for want of it, and asked if she had any she could lend me—she said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "Three or four sovereigns"—I had not at that time told her I had discovered the money in her pocket—I asked her if I should hand her pocket to her—she said yes, if I pleased—I handed her her pocket—she took out a purse, and wished to give me what I had asked for, but she wished to keep the remainder, as I thought, out of my sight; it appeared so—she gave me four sovereigns—I save she had more, and said to her, "It is well for you, Isabella, that you have got more money than you knew of; I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020006"/>
               <p>afraid this is all my money which I have lost at different times"—she said, "It is, Mrs. Cambridge, I am sorry for it, but it is your money: if you will promise you will never tell any one of it, I will never repeat the offence again"—she bore a most excellent character before, and I told her I would forgive her, I never would tell any body of it, nor would I ever tell her herself of it, provided she never would repeat the offence again—the money was restored to me, and there the matter ended—I left my house next morning (the 6th) between one and two o'clock, and went to Covent-garden—I left her in bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you left the house, had you any conversation with her, or any intimation, from which you could collect that it was her intention to leave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—I used to keep the money which I lost in a small box, which was locked inside a larger box, which stood in my bed-room—I kept my tea in a canister on the chimney-piece in the kitchen—she knew I kept it there—I always kept it there—it was unlocked—I had taken tea out of that canister on the 5th—I had bought the tea on Tuesday, the 4th—I had not felt any inconvenience or sickness after taking tea on the 5th—I returned to my house about one o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th—the prisoner was then gone—I took tea about six o'clock that afternoon—as near as I can say, we commenced taking tea about six o'clock—John Walker, her half-brother, took tea with me—he had not been to market with me—I had left him at home when I went, and found him there when I returned—I took the tea out of this canister, which was in the place where it was accustomed to be—I took the tea from the canister myself, and made it myself—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after taking it, I felt a violent sickness—I felt no pain only from the violent retching—I sent Walker to my neighbour's, to go for the doctor, as I thought he would not be able to go so far himself—he was ill too—I com<lb/>plained first, and be complained in not more than two or three minutes—nobody took tea but him and myself—Mr. Moon if my medical man—he lives about a quarter of a mile from my house—Mr. Moon was not able to come himself, but sent his assistant, who came in about half an hour, I should think—I was getting worse before he arrived—the sickness was not accompanied with much pain—the assistant gave me warm water—I went to bed, and after twelve or one o'clock, I began to get better—the warm water threw off from my stomach what was there—Mrs. Budd, who worked on my ground, sat up with me that night—I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday following—she came to my house—I did not expect her—I asked her if she could tell me any thing of the circumstance which had takes place—if she knew any thing of what had been put in the tea—she said she did not—I cannot exactly say whether I began with that, or whether I spoke to her about her absence—I asked if she knew any thing of what had been put in the tea—she said, she did not know any thing about it—I asked her what was her reason for leaving my house—she said she could not account for it—I asked her if she thought I had used her ill—she said, "No"—Mrs. Budd's name was not mentioned at that time—she did not con<lb/>tinue in my service after she came back on Sunday—the reason she came was, I had got a neighbour of mine to say I wished to speak to her—I did not know where she was to be found—I sent her a message, and she came—she staid about a quarter of an hour—I cannot recollect when I saw her next—I should think it was in about a fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she come to you, or you go to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Her brother had a letter—she came to my house—I asked her if she had any thing more to say, if</p>

               <p>she knew any thing about it; and she said she really did not know any thing about it—I saw her again a month ago last Monday—she came to my house of her own accord, and said, she came to speak to me—that she had something to say to me, as she felt very uncomfortable—she said, "I met Mrs. Budd to-day, and she told me all about respecting the poison"—she said, on the morning when you left my house, Mrs. Budd was working in the fields taking up potatoes—she had to come home for some sacks, and in coming home for them, she took the key from a certain place where we leave it—she opened the door, came in, and got the arsenic—she had it all ready in her pocket, and that she mixed it along with the tea—she said, Mrs. Budd did that, (Mrs. Budd had attended me on the night of my sickness,) and she was sorry she had not got more to finish me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before she made this statement, had you expressed any suspicion to her about Mrs. Budd being likely to have done such a thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had had no quarrel or difference with Mrs. Budd of any sort—I do not re<lb/>member her saying any thing more—I did not say any thing to the prisoner about this statement—she went away to her lodging, I believe—I do not remember that I saw her again till she was taken into custody—I had a man-servant, named Shepherd, sleeping in my house formerly, while the prisoner was in my service, and before November, I directed him not to sleep in the house any longer, from observations I had made of his and the prisoner's conduct—I was very much troubled with rats at the time—I had corn in the house—I discharged Shepherd from sleeping in the house, about a month before this happened—I had purchased some arsenic to destroy the rats, which I placed between the joists and boards of the upper room in the washhouse—it was concealed between the joists and rafters of the wash-house, in three different papers—the prisoner knew I had it there—I told her as a caution, at any time if she was cleaning, if she should meet with this small parcel, to be sure and not meddle with it, for it was poison—I showed it to her in that place—the room was not locked—any one who knew where it was could get at it. My medical gentleman took a portion of the tea out of the canister—a neighbour took another portion of it, and the rest was thrown into the fire—I am sure it was the remainder of the same tea as I had taken that afternoon—Mr. Delanor, a farmer, took the other portion—when Mr. Moon came, I looked at the tea in the canister, and saw it was quite white with something—if my attention had been called to the tea before I had made it, I should have discovered it in a moment—I had no suspicion when I made the tea, and no reason to look at it par<lb/>ticularly, when I put it in the pot.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know it would be a breach of duty to hold out encouragement to prisoners, or threaten them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know better—I have been an officer fourteen years—I said it was a very serious charge, and she might say what the pleased—she began to tell me, crying very much—I said, "I understand you have said it was Mrs. Budd put the poison into the canister"—she said, "Yes, it was—I will tell you all about it"—she then said, that in consequence of Mrs. Cambridge and herself having words on the 5th of November, she went out of her mistress's house into the garden, crying very much, when she met Mrs. Budd—that Mrs. Budd asked her, "Girl, what are you crying about?" and she answered, that her mistress and her had been having words, and she felt very uncomfortable—that Mrs. Budd then said to her, "Oh, never mind her, girl, don't cry; get some stuff, and do for her"—that she told Mrs. Budd she did not know how to do that—then Mrs. Budd told her she would tell her how to do it, and she would get her some stuff to put into the tea-canister of Mrs. Cambridge with the tea—and she told Mrs. Budd she could not do that, as her brother and herself always took tea with Mrs. Cambridge—Mrs. Budd, she said, told her then, that she might make any excuse, and take her brother with her, and go into the village on an errand, while Mrs. Cambridge took tea—I then asked her if that was the truth, and she said it was, and that Mrs. Budd was the person who put the stuff into the canister—that was all the conversation I had with her on the road to the watch-house—she remained in the watch-house that night—I fetched her next day, the 20th, from the watch-house at Edmonton, to Dr. Robinson's, the magistrate of Tottenham—I asked her, as I conveyed her to Dr. Robinson's, if she had any thing more to say—if she had spoken the truth about it, as it was a very serious charge to charge another person—she stated, that she had told the truth, and the whole truth—that was all that passed before she was under examination—after the examination was over on the 20th, the parties were ordered to attend next day, and she was remanded till next day—the prisoner asked the magistrate if she might be allowed to speak to me in private—it was after the other witnesses were gone—Mrs. Budd had been among the witnesses under examination—the prisoner had heard what Mrs. Budd stated—the magistrate allowed the prisoner to speak to me in private—I stepped out with her into the next room—she cried, pot her hand on my shoulder, and said, all she had said about Mrs. Budd was false—she said she had done it herself, she had put the arsenic into the tea herself, and no one else—I asked her how she could think of doing such a thing, when</p>

               <p>she knew her own brother would have to take part of it—she said she knew it, but she could not help it—she was very sorry, but she could not help it—I said it was a very serious thing—she said she put it in at the time Walker was cleaning shoes in the wash-house—I took her before the Justice, and communicated to him what she had said—I was present at the last examination, before she was committed—Dr. Robinson was the com<lb/>mitting magistrate—the last examination was at his own house—he took down the deposition himself—the prisoner was asked if she had any thing to say, and she made a statement, which Dr. Robinson reduced to writing in my presence, as she delivered it—it was then read over to her, and she put her mark to it—Dr. Robinson wrote his name on one side of it, and I put my name to it as the attesting witness—he did not put his name to it till I had witnessed it by his directions—this is the statement she made (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there was no threat or inducement held out to her before she made it—I heard it read over to her before she put her mark to it—the put her mark to the same paper as was read over to her (<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, being first cautioned, and informed by me that she was not bound to answer any questions, and that what she said would be put down in writing and produced in evidence against her at her trial; and no promise of favour, nor any threat, menace, or undue terror having been made use of to induce the prisoner to say any thing, but she now volun<lb/>tarily, and of her own free will says—That in consequence of my having robbed my mistress, after she had gone to market on the 6th of November last, my mind was so uneasy, I could not stop there, and after she had forgiven me for the robbery I could never look her in the face—there was arsenic in the house, which my mistress had to poison rats—I took a quantity of it out of the paper, and put it into the tea-canister with the tea—I knew I was doing wrong all the time, but I could not help myself—I felt that something was possessing me all the time, it must have been the devil—I felt as if I wanted to stop myself from doing it, but I could not—I did it between eight and nine o'clock that morning—Theo<lb/>philus Shepherd did not know any thing about it, and what I have said about Mrs. Budd is all false—the reason I charged Mrs. Budd was, I thought it would save me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Tottenham. I was sent for to Mrs. Cambridge on the night of the 6th of November, but I did not see her myself till the 7th—my assistant went—there was very slight general indisposition on the 7th—I saw her between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—she gave me a description of what her sensations had been—I should think she was not at all recovered from the symptoms she described to me—she never suffered pain, from what I understood—but the vomiting continued—she complained much of sickness—that still continued when I saw her, and the vomiting—she also complained of lassitude—the pulse was rather lower than usual—her tongue very dry, and a little furred—I questioned her particularly as to the commencement of her illness—she stated she was taken ill soon after swallowing some tea—the first symp<lb/>tom she felt was sickness—my assistant is not here—she gave me a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020014"/>
               <p>description of her sensations from the time she was first attacked; I should say she was labouring under irritation of the stomach—I am acquainted with the action of arsenic—the symptoms she described, and those I observed, were such as I should expect from a person having im<lb/>bibed arsenic—one symptom would be to lower the pulse—the heat of the skin and fur on the tongue arose from irritation of the stomach—it is the ac<lb/>tion of the stomach—the symptoms were so slight when I saw her, that had hers been an individual case, and I had seen nobody else labouring under similar symptoms, and not heard the history of it, I should not have sup<lb/>posed her to have taken arsenic—I heard the history of it from herself—and from the account she gave, and the observations I made, I am still of opinion that the symptoms are to be accounted for by her taking arsenic—the symptoms she described might have been produced by taking arsenic—con<lb/>fining myself merely to the symptoms, I should not have been able clearly to have detected arsenic—they were not to that degree that are usually seen—that would depend on how soon the offending matter would be thrown from the stomach; it being taken in solution, and sickness following immediately, I have no doubt the whole of it was thrown off her sto<lb/>mach, it would leave such symptoms as I found when I saw her—the whole of the ejections from the stomach had been thrown away when I saw her—the sickness being continued, but being unaccompanied with pain, and twenty-four hours having passed, I conclude no arsenic could have remained—I took about two ounces of tea from the tea-canister myself—the tea in the canister was covered with something—I could not positively say by looking at it what it was that was mixed with it, nor by the taste of it; I had very little doubt of it, but could not speak positively—arsenic has no smell—I believe it is also tasteless—I took it home to my house to send it to town by my brother, who is a professional man, was going to town the following day—he went, but forgot it—I then requested my assistant to forward it to a gentleman in town, to have it tested, which he did—he is not here—I have no doubt that the portion which was after<lb/>wards analyzed was the portion I got from the canister—I cannot identify it as the same—a portion was preserved, but afterwards thrown away, as I understood no prosecution was to follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What proportion, in your judgment, did the matter which was mixed with the tea in the canister, bear to the tea itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps about one-sixteenth in weight—arsenic is very heavy—I should think there were five or six ounces of tea in the canister—twenty grains of arsenic are sufficient to produce death—that depends on the constitution—I believe four and a half grains have been known to do it—I observed, perhaps, forty grains on the surface of the tea.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of William Brown, a linen-draper, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On the 22nd of Janu<lb/>ary, I slept in the shop, which fronts the street, and goes back<lb/>wards—I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I am the only person who slept there—the windows and doors were all safe—there is a back window facing the garden—I put the shutter up to that window, put a bar across it, and bolted it—the window is a large square in the shape of a door—it is large enough to admit a man through it—it opens, and has a rail before it with a sort of door to it—the window is more than one square, but there is one square in it which opens—there are about twelve squares to the window—one of them will open large enough to admit the body of a man—the other windows and doors were all properly secured—the dwelling-house is over the shop, and the family sleep up stairs—nobody could have come down, and done any thing to the window after I was in bed—about two o'clock in the morning of the 22nd, I heard a noise, similar to rats—it continued about half an hour—I then heard it where the rats are not ge<lb/>nerally in the habit of coming—that excited my suspicions—I still listened, and heard a hem from a human voice—I was not certain whether it was in the next house, or in the shop—I sat up in bed, and listened very atten<lb/>tively—I got hold of the rattle, and turned one notch round, and said, "Is there any one there?"—every thing was then still, which I thought strange, as making a noise does not make the rats quiet—I then got a piece of serge which laid close to me, and threw it towards where I heard the noise—I still heard some noise, and turned the rattle round again, and said, "Is there any one there?"—I received no answer—the counter just comes in contact with my head as I sit in bed—I still heard the noise—I waited till it came over the fan-light, and I was looking down the counter, and by the re<lb/>flection of the light from the fan-light, I thought I saw something move—I sprang up, and inquired who was there, but received no answer—I immedi<lb/>ately jumped upon him, and seized on him, I struck his head with the rattle, which broke—I then struck him with the handle of the rattle, and he called out "Murder"—I dragged him out of the shop into the passage, and gave the alarm—it was the prisoner—the family got up—I got a light, and exam<lb/>ined the back window—before the light was brought down, I dragged him to the place where I first struck him, and when the light came, I saw where he had got in—the window was wide open, and the shutter down—the sin<lb/>gle pane of glass was thrown wide open—it was all quite secure when I went to bed—it is large enough for the prisoner to get in, and he could not have got in at any other place—there are several gardens behind the house—there is a railing to our garden, and the other gardens have a wall to them—it was snowy weather—it had been snowing that night, and there was</p>

                  </hi>. On the 27th of January, I was going along the Co<lb/>burg-road, in the parish of Camberwell, at half-past six o'clock in the evening—I heard footsteps behind me, and the prisoner Wilton passed on a few yards before me—I was on the left hand side of the road, and he on the right—I saw him come across the road to meet me—he met me and seized me by the collar and throat—I was dressed as I am now—he snatched my bundle from me, which I was carrying in my hand, at the same time as he took me by the collar—I immediately turned round, and called, "Stop thief"—he ran down a turning in the Coburg-road—there was another man behind me—I saw them both running together—I had not seen that per<lb/>son before Wilson came up—I only heard footsteps behind me—it was done very quick—it did not occupy above a minute or two—there was a gas-lamp about a dozen yards from me—it threw the light on Wilson's face—I could not see the other man's face, nor could I describe his dress—the bundle contained a gown—it was tied up in a silk handkerchief—there were some pieces of silk in the bundle with the dress—it was one or two pieces of silk pinned up together—I have seen the handle since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live at Park-terrace, Islington. On the evening of the 26th of January, about ten minutes past nine o'clock, I was in the City-road—a caravan standing there drew my attention—I stopped for a moment—I felt a rustling behind me—I suspected I had lost something—I turned round immediately, and observed the prisoner thrusting my handkerchief into his breast—I collared him and charged him with the robbery, and endeavoured to drag him from the people—I got him some distance, and intended to give him in charge—he said he had not stolen it, but that boy had, pointing to another person, who I should not think could have taken it, my handkerchief having been on the other side—I had taken my handkerchief at the same time I collared him—I dragged him about ten yards—he made great resistance, and endeavoured to throw me—he forced himself back into the crowd—the caravan had then gone some little distance—when he found he could not throw me, he stooped down, thrust his head between my legs, and threw me down with great violence—my head was very much injured, and cut in two places—I was stunned, but as soon as I recovered, I seized him again, and I suppose when he tossed me, I had struck him with my knee, as he was then rising—I made a grasp at him, and dragged him some distance—he made strong resistance, and several of the mob came up, and felt me round my pockets, three of them got hold of me, and struck me—I called to the policeman, and the persons about me called out, "Go it, go it," as if it were a fight—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020022"/>
               <p>I called till the officer came and took him—I delivered the handkerchief to the officer—the treatment I received was so severe, that I have been under medical hands; and on Saturday last I was bled—they struck me on the sides, and down the arm, in endeavouring to rescue the prisoner—this is my handkerchief.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Whiteaves, a silversmith, in Fleet-street. On the 26th of March, 1834, the prisoner came to master's house, and brought this silver sugar-basin and tea-caddy, with a silver inkstand, a fold<lb/>ing eye-glass, and some silver coin—the whole weighed 60 ounces 2 penny<lb/>weights, which I bought of him—we put it in our window—I afterwards saw the sugar-basin and caddy in possession of the last witness—it is a remarkable sugar-basin—I never saw one like it before—I am certain it is the sugar-basin the prisoner sold us—he said he lived near Newbury, in Berks—I never knew him live in London—I knew him before—when he came in, he said, "How do you do? Here are a few articles I have to sell, which the persons in the country are necessitated to sell in consequence of the badness of the times"—in consequence of his saying that, and having bought, some articles before of him, I did not suspect him—he did not mention who the country people were—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for it as old silver—he came again, on the 6th of January, to sell another quantity of plate, and we detained him on account of having had information from Makepeace—we told him we should give him into cus<lb/>tody in consequence of our buying plate of him stolen from Colonel Bla<lb/>grave—his answer was, "I am not the thief"—I said we detained him to clear our own character, as there was some imputation cast on the charac<lb/>ter of the house—I said, "I hope you will be able to clear your cha<lb/>racter"—he hesitated a good deal, and I said, "But you say nothing"—he replied, "I have enough to do to think"—we took Colonel Blagrave's arms off the plate.</p>

The Angel-bridge crosses the Wash, and Water-lane turns down by the side of it—my farm is opposite the Fleece—if a person went down Water-lane about half a mile, and then turned to the left down Journeyman-green, there is then a gate which was nailed up, and a bridge—if a person went through that gate, and through three meadows, and three other gates, it will lead to the back of my stack-yard—when you get to the end of the meadows there is a cow-yard, but that had not been entered—a cart had stopped at the end of the last meadow, and there turned round, about fifteen or twenty yards from where the hay was, and across the cow-yard, which was littered up with haulm—on Friday, the 9th of January, I had thirty-six trusses of hay loaded on a cart, with a new tilt over it, under the shed—it was bound, and ready for market—I saw it safe at seven o'clock that evening—at four o'clock the next morning, my man called me up, and said the hay was gone—I found the cart empty about six o'clock, and have not seen any of the hay since.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of January, I received notice of the loss of this hay—I went with Morison to Water-lane—I saw the track of a cart drawn by one horse—I saw it just at the corner, turning down from the high road towards the farm—the track was very recent—it went round down Journeyman-green, across the meadows—the first gate was open, and the others also—when the cart had got to the end of the meadows, it appeared to have turned round, and there were the impressions of a cart, which appeared to have gone back across the same fields, down the same lane, and turned into the road towards Lon<lb/>don—the near hind shoe of the horse which had drawn the cart appeared to have been recently turned up for roughing, and the off hind shoe had two stumps behind it—the hind shoes made different impressions—I saw no<lb/>thing about the fore-shoes any more than common—Forster had some horse-shoes in his possession afterwards, which appeared to me as if they would have made the impressions I saw on the ground—I did not see them fitted to the marks.</p>

About six o'clock on the evening of the 12th of January, my shop was perfectly safe—there was a crack in one pane of glass in the window, but no part of it was out—the window was full of women's shoes—it was safe at half-past six o'clock—I was at work in the room adjoin<lb/>ing—my attention was called by a customer coming in, to inquire the price of some shoes in the window, about seven o'clock—I then saw the window, which was cracked before, had been broken, and six pairs of shoes were missing, which were close to the glass—the gas was lighted in the shop long before this—I gave information to the police directly, and on Tuesday morning, Ford the policeman gave me information—I saw two odd shoes at the station-house about half-past eight o'clock the next morning—I am positive they had been in my window the night before, and I had not sold them—I went with the policeman to a pawnbroker's in Vauxhall-road, and there saw another pair, which I am certain had been in my shop at six o'clock the night before—I had sold none of that description—the selling price would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair, or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure the window was not broken at six o'clock—when I found it broken, a hand could be put in and take the shoes out, it was quite large enough for that.</p>

On Saturday night, the 7th of January, I took George Jackson into custody—I and Giblet went to his father's house at Northolt, and asked if he was at home—I went into the house, but did not see him at first—we searched the house, and took the candle to go into the bed room, and either his father or mother blew the candle out—we got another light, and searched under the bed—we found the prisoner George between the bedstead and the wall, naked, except his shirt—we told him he was our prisoner—he came out and dressed himself—we told him he and his brother were together after this mutton—that we had got a warrant out against him and his brother for taking the sheep—he said nothing—I took him to Hanwell cage that night—on the Monday night following I took the other prisoner, between Westend and Northolt, about half-past eleven o'clock I met him in the road with another—when he saw me coming, he jumped across the road to the other side—I went across, caught hold of his collar, and said, "Jackson, you are my prisoner"—the other man ran away—he said, "What do you want me for?"—I said, "You know what I want you for, for Mr. Smith's sheep"—I took him to the Plough at Northolt, and asked him whether he was the man who killed the sheep—he said, no, he was not the man who had killed it—I said, "You know who did kill it"—he said he should not like to transport any body—he told me William Harris killed the sheep—I took him to the cage—next morning I took Harris—I was before Lord Montford, the magistrate, when the pri<lb/>soners were examined—I heard them examined—I saw his Lordship write down what they said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live at Enfield. I had two wheels in my yard on the 6th of January—I missed them on the 7th—these are them—I made the wood-work—this one has had the iron put on since—I went in search of them, and found this one in the town, fixed to a barrow which Thomas Norton had—I asked who made his barrow—he said a man named Hyat—I said the wheel was mine—he said, "You are wrong, I saw the man making it"—I called him a liar—he went on his business round the town with greens, and his brother was with him—I then got Mead, the constable, who went with me to Baker-street, and he went into the prisoner's house—he called me in—I saw the barrow at the back door, and said that was the barrow and wheel which I had seen in the town—this was on the 21st of January—Mead then asked them to take the wheel out of the barrow, which they did, and he brought it out of the house; but he first asked if they had not got another wheel—William Norton said he had no other, but there was an<lb/>other barrow there, and I might look at that—I did, but that wheel was not mine—we came out together—the officer took them to the cage, and in about twenty minutes he brought me this second wheel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Kilminster. On the 10th of January, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Milton-street, carrying a bundle, containing the articles stated—when I got to Sun-court, it was snatched from my arm by a man who stood at the corner—he ran up the court—I followed him—I believe it was Young, but I will not be positive—I had a slight glance of his features—he put the bundle under his left arm—as soon as he turned the first corner, a person joined him, who had a flannel jacket on—they seemed talking, but I could not hear what they said—that was about fourteen yards from the place where I lost my bundle—they then ran, and I followed them, till I fell down some steps—the one in the flannel jacket then came back, and spoke to a woman—I lost the bundle entirely—the prisoners were taken in about a week—I believe they are the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Colonel in the Columbian service, and live with my mother, at No. 4, Edge ware-road, in the parish of Pad<lb/>dington. The prisoners were servants to my mother—Hickien was the cook, and Hopwood the house-maid—in October, I missed several articles, and accused the prisoners of it—they denied all knowledge of it—I re<lb/>ceived two anonymous letters afterwards, and requested my mother to dis<lb/>charge them, but it was not done—on account of information I received in one of the letters, and other information which I received afterwards, I went down to Tooting, in Surrey, last Tuesday week, in company with an officer, to the house of Mr. Ricardo, and requested to speak to Fanny Hendy, who was in his service—the officer told her who he was, and asked her if she had not a box—she immediately said she had, and gave it up, locked—it was forced open in my presence—it contained a variety of articles, and among the rest, those stated in the indictment, which belong to me—we came to town—the officer took the box, and next morning two officers came and took the prisoners into custody at my mother's house—Hickien went into the front parlour, and the other into the back parlour, where I was—I told her I was very sorry for her, for I believed she was a very good girl when she came into my mother's service, and that she had been cor<lb/>rupted by the other—I asked if she knew Fanny Hendy—she said she did not—I asked if she never went out for a holiday with such a person—she said she went out with a young woman, but did not know her name—their trunks were searched, but nothing found belonging to me—we went into the other parlour, where the other officer and Hickien, the cook, were—some questions were asked respecting the box found at Tooting—they denied all knowledge of it—one of the officers said, "Perhaps you will recollect the contents of the box, if I read you a list of the articles," which he did—Hickien then said, "Well, Sir, since you have found out about the box, I confess that we did take the things, but we throw ourselves on your mercy, and if you will forgive us, you shall never hear of our doing wrong again"—she said they had merely taken the books to read, and after I had made a disturbance about them they were afraid to put them back—I said, "Then I suppose you took the linen and other things to read too;" and that I had missed so many things I could not forgive them—the property is worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at the lowest value.</p>

On Tuesday, the 20th of Ja<lb/>nuary, in consequence of information which I received about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I proceeded to Pearl-court, Church-street, St. Giles, with Matthews and Denton, my brother constables—there are two rooms in the house, one at the bottom, and one at the top—I found the outer door open—I proceeded up stairs, and found the room door closed—I put my shoulder against it, and forced it open—I found a chair had been placed behind it to keep it close—I did not notice, but I have no doubt it was on the latch—it required the weight of my body to get it open—I saw the two prisoners standing close to the fire-place—there was a large, clear coke fire—my attention was then called away by a dog attacking me from under the bed—I beat it off with my staff—I turned round then,</p>

               <p>and my brother officers had secured the prisoners—Flynn said, "What do you want here? what is it you want?"—I told her she knew what we wanted as well as I did myself—she replied, "Thank God, you have not seen us do any thing; you cannot hang us"—I commenced searching, and while I was searching, Hamlet said, "Thank God, you cannot hang us; you saw us doing nothing"—I searched on the hearth, near the fen<lb/>der, and found a mould—it was closed—I took it up, and found it was warm—I opened it, and found a base shilling in it, quite hot, having been recently coined—I gave the mould to Matthews, with the shilling in it, in the state I found it—on searching further in the ashes, I picked up four more base shillings and two iron spoons—on the hearth were some bits of metal, apparently recently melted—I gave them to Matthews—on the shelf I found a paper bag of plaster of Paris—I gave that to Matthews—I told the prisoners to prepare themselves to go with me—Hamlet said, "Am I to go? I have done nothing"—Flynn replied, "You know you must go—and all that is found in the room"—I then left Denton in charge of the room—Matthews and I took the prisoners to Bow-street—I returned in about a quarter of an hour by myself, and found Denton still there—on searching more minutely on the hearth of the fire-place, I found a small file, which I produce—Denton found a shil<lb/>ling on the coke, within the fire-grate, on the fire—it was on a piece of coke on the top of the fire which was not burnt—we left the room, and gave the shilling to Matthews at Bow-street—I saw nothing of Flynn's husband—he has been transported—her two children were in the room, one is about eight, and the other about four years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 77, Cruflford-street, Russell-square, in the parish of St. Pan crag. The prisoner was my footman—he came into my service on the 24th of November last—I had the plate stated in the indictment, at that time—when I hire a new servant, I count over the plate which I give into his charge, and give him an inventory—I did so when the prisoner came—I have the plate always brought up to my bed-room at night by the house maid—she takes it down the following morning, and delivers it to the footman—on the morning of the 20th of December, the house-maid took the plate-box out of my room—I had some of it in use on my breakfast-table, and at lunch—the prisoner waited at both those meals—I have a son a proctor, who resides in Doctors' Com<lb/>mons—I very frequently go and dine with him—when he has a party larger than usual, he requires some of my plate; and I had a box made for the purpose of sending it backwards and forwards—it is a smaller box than the one which is carried up to my bed-room—when I went to dine with my son, it was the prisoner's duty to accompany me, to wait at table—on the 20th of December, I was engaged to dine with my son—the prisoner had notice to attend me, as usual, to wait at table—there was no plate re<lb/>quired to go to Doctors' Commons that day—after taking lunch, I went out to take a walk with a friend, about two o'clock, and returned about four o'clock—I then saw a man standing in my passage—I asked the cook who he was—she was in the passage—the prisoner was down stairs—the man went up into the drawing-room—he was a glazier, and went up to mend a window which the man-servant had broken—the cook accompanied him—I saw her in the drawing-room with him—she was holding him a light—I went up stairs to dress about five o'clock, while the man and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a proctor, and reside at Doctors' Commons. In consequence of information of this robbery on the 21st of December, I caused handbills to be printed, and received in<lb/>formation on the 5th of January from Bourke and Thompson—I accom<lb/>pained them to North Audley-street—I arrived at a house about eleven o'clock, and while there I heard a ring at the bell—Bourke weat down stain immediately—I followed him—Thompson was waiting in the street—I found the prisoner in the passage—I seized him by the collar, and said, "Daniel O'Donnell"—he said, "Yes, Sir," acknowledging his name—I said, "Are you not ashamed of having robbed my mother of her plate?"—his reply was, "Yes, I am, Sir"—I then gave him in charge of the policeman.</p>

Mr. Moore said, "Are you not ashamed of yourself for robbing my mother of her plate?"—he said, "Yes, I am"—I then opened the door—Thompson was standing outside, and we took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler at Marylebone police-office. On the prisoner being examined, I was taking him to prison the second time, when he was re-committed—I did not hold out any threat or pro<lb/>mise to him—on being locked up in a cell with many prisoners, he said it was very uncomfortable there being so many, and I took him to another lock-up place, and put him by himself—he then asked me if I knew whether a man named Griffiths was taken into custody—I said I did not know; I believed not—he said, "He ought to be—I am sorry for it—he is the man who has brought me into this trouble—he advised me to com<lb/>mit the offence for which I am placed here"—I then left him—on going to him again, he asked for some refreshment; which I accordingly allowed him—he requested to know at what time he should go away in the van, and which way we should go; whether we should go directly from there to the prison—I told him the route we took—he said, "I should like to go another way if you could make it convenient;" and not at all being out of the way, I said I would go that way, not knowing at the time his reason—when I called him out of the lock-up place, I wanted to know his motive for wishing to go round a particular way—he said, "Why, I with to show you where I took the plate to; where we sold it"—I said, "I do not want to know any thing about that"—he said, "I wish to show you where the plate was taken to, that that fellow, Griffiths, should be taken into custody"—we went the way he wished to go, and he pointed to a house where he said they went to with the plate, which was in Broad-street, Bloomsbury—he said, "The plate was not sold there—it was taken from us, and carried by a boy; and from there we went down a street—if you will allow me to wait a moment, I will point out the street to you," being still in the road to Bow-street, where I had to call for more prisoners—he showed me the house where the plate was sold, and told me what part of the house, and what he got for it—I then went on to the prison with him; and, at the third examination, he was very anxious to know whether Griffiths was taken into custody—I said I believed not—he asked several times whether Griffiths was in the office—I said I did not know—at last some friends outside gave him information that Griffiths was in the office—he asked me if he was going to be committed, as he ought to be—I said, "I know nothing about it;" and just as we were going away, I took him some refreshment—he said, "When we go down again in the van, I will show you where we threw the box;" but, at the time of starting, he said, "I wish to explain to you where we went to, and probably I can describe it better than I can show it—on coming out from the house where I showed you where we sold the plate, and got the money for it, we turned to the right hand after coming out of the house, which led us into Long-acre—there is a new house building in Long-acre, opposite the end of the street; and there is a hoard round it; and when we got to that, we threw the box over the hoard"—he said <hi rend="italic">"we"</hi> all the time—I said, "<hi rend="italic">We?"</hi> he said, "I mean that vagabond, Griffiths—we threw the box over the hoard,"—I afterwards went to make inquiry, and found Thomas Langthorpe, in consequence of information—he lived at</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this the only field in plough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some part of the farm was wheat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Old Broad-street, in the parish of St. Peter-le-Poor, in the City. On Tuesday afternoon, the 27th of January, I left my shop about four o'clock—I rent the wholehouse—it is my dwelling-house but I let out part as offices—I returned about twenty minutes or half-past four o'clock, and observed the prisoner Lock in the middle of my shop, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020089"/>
               <p>is the darkest part of the shop—it was quite daylight—I went into the shop, and Lock retired to the head of the cellar stairs—it was darker there than where I first saw him—I said, "Who is there?"—he made no reply—I repeated the question again, and said, "What do you want? come out, and let me see what you are like"—after some hesitation, I saw him take two bars of solder out of his left hand breeches pocket, and put them down by his side against the cellar stairs—he then came to me, at I stood in the middle of the shop—I saw two more bars of solder in his right hand breeches pocket—I asked him what business he had there—he said he had been to ease himself, and shrunk his shoulders up as if he was ill—I said, "It appears you came to load yourself instead of easing your<lb/>self"—I took him towards the shop door, then collared him, and drew the two bars of solder out of his pocket—he then began begging for mercy and said one of my men bad given him the solder—I said he was one of a gang which infested plumbers' shops, and I would make an example of him and give him in charge—I had about 12cwt. of solder in a pile in my shop, and from that pile I missed about 1cwt., which is six casts—a cast is four bars together—I went into the cellar, and found Crawder concealed in the dust-bin, and observed some solder bars there—that was not the place they should have been in—I kept some of my solder in the counting-house, but never kept any in the cellar—Crowder worked for me last summer—I lost more solder than I found, either in the cellar or on Lock—feeling it could not all be taken at one time by one man, mode me look in the cellar—I found three casts close to where Crowder was concealed in the cellar—the solder found is mine.</p>

In consequence of in<lb/>formation which I received of the loss of the tea-trays, I went lo the pri<lb/>soner's house on Uxbridge-moor on Monday the 19th of January, about six o'clock in the evening—I found him at home—I asked if he had bought any tea-trays since Christmas—he said "No"—I asked him if he had found any—he said, "No," what tea-trays he had got, he had bought of a man named Greenwell, on the Moor—I was in his house at this time, and saw two waiters and a small tray on the mantel-piece—I asked him to allow me to look at one of those on the mantel-piece—he said, "Yes'—I took it in my hand and said it answered the description of the trays stolen from Grainge's—he said, "Well, I will tell you the truth; I found them under some stuff that covers my charcoal in the yard"—he brought me another tray from the corner of the room, or from a cupboard in the same room—I afterwards showed them to Rogers, who identified them—I did not take him into custody till next day—he came up with me that night into Uxbridge of his own accord, he followed me—I showed them to Rogers in his presence—the Moor is nearly half a mile from the prosecu<lb/>tor's—I took the trays to my own house till next morning, and he went</p>

               <p>home again—next morning I went before the magistrate and got a search-warrant, but found nothing more—I communicated this to the magistrate in the prisoner's presence—he was remanded till the next day; and while he was in custody, he was in the parlour at the Chequers, (he was ordered to be there all night by the magistrate), he told me that on the Saturday after Christmas-day a person named William Newman, with Gowlett and Robinson, brought a bundle of trays to a public-house on the Moor, where he was having a pint of beer—I know the parties he named, they live with girls who keep them—they go about the country—they are generally at lodging-houses up the Chequers'-yard—he said they came with a bundle of trays tied up in a large shawl-handkerchief, and asked him if he would buy them—he said, no, he would have nothing to do with them—he said his brother-in-law, William Smith, bought them for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and took them to his (the prisoner's) house—there he untied them, and there might be twenty or twenty-one little ones—he could not exactly say how many large ones—that Smith took them and hid them under some stuff which covered his charcoal, and next day, or the day after, Smith took them out from under the stuff, and untied them, and he bought four trays and a gun of Smith—that Smith himself and a person named Mayden went to Colebrook—he said Smith hired a cart at the public-house to take the trays, and said he was going to Redburn fair, instead of which he drove towards Watford—that he told him he sold some at Marple fair—that he returned in two days afterwards, and he and Smith went to Colebrook and sold two waiters for sixpence and a glass of gin and water to Neal, who keeps the Red Lion at Colebrook, and I should find them there—I went and found them—I produce the four trays found at the prisoner's house—Ewer was asked before the ma<lb/>gistrate if he had any thing to say—he made a statement, and signed it—I saw him sign it, and saw the magistrate put his name to it—I heard it read to him before he put his name to it, and next day he made another statement—some part of that was taken down—Mr. Dagnall was the ma<lb/>gistrate—I was in the room while the magistrate wrote—I did not look over it to know whether it was read correctly to the prisoner—Mr. Bowers, the clerk, is here.</p>

He said, "It is one we have had for some time, we bought it at Pontifex's, in St. Martin's-lane." I took it away with the male prisoner, and Mr. Peaton identified it—the female prisoner did not come home while I was there—there was a man there very much afflicted, who I understood to be her husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went with Keys to the house—we found the male prisoner there—I waited, I suppose, two hours, till the female prisoner came home—she came into the shop and took off her cloak—I was in the shop—I asked her if her name was Hickman—the said it was—I then told her I had been searching her house for some pro<lb/>perty supposed to be stolen, that we had found it, and she must go with me to the office—she said she was certain she had no property in her house but what she had come honestly by, and she was very willing to go to the office, as she could account for every thing—we then left her house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know it was her house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother officer asked</p>

               <p>the young man if his name was Hickman—he said, "Yes." As I was going along with the female prisoner, I told her we had found a copper, and asked how she accounted for the possession of it—she said, "O, the copper is it? I came honestly by it, I bought it of Mr. Pugh, in Greyhound-yard, Holborn"—I said no more, having heard her son tell my brother officer that they had bought it at Pontifex's—I had searched the house and found no other copper there—when we arrived at the office the magistrate had left, and the prisoners were locked in separate cells which adjoined out another. I heard the female prisoner call out to the male prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, it is the copper they have brought us here for; you know we bought that at Pugh's, in Greyhound-yard, Holborn, for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about the 14th of last month"—the male prisoner replied, "I have told a lie about the copper, mother—I told them we bought it at Pontifex's in St. Martin's-lane, where we had sold the old pieces of brass"—she said, with an oath, "That will not do, you fool"—immediately after that a man came into the yard, whom we had seen at the house in Boston-place—he called out "Hickman." Mrs. Hickman answered, "Is that you?" calling him by a name which I for<lb/>get—he said, "Yes"—the then said, "They have got us here locked up about a copper; will you go down to Pugh's in Greyhound-yard, Holborn, and ask him for the bill of it? it cost 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was bought about the 14th of last month"—she repeated these words several times, and asked him if he understood it; he said he did, and went away; he was gone perhaps two hours; when he came back, and called again, "Hickman," to let them know he had returned—I was waiting in the office, they could not see nor hear me; the man then said, "Mrs. Hickman, what was the use of send<lb/>ing me on such a fool's errand as that? Pugh knows nothing about a cop<lb/>per, he does not know at all what you mean; he does not understand you; he says he never sold you any copper"—she then said, "Aye, I was in liquor when I told you that—you must go up to the old man," meaning her husband, in Boston-place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he was her husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but the son had called him father two or three times, and told him what our business was—he was in the parlour behind the shop—he is afflicted with apoplexy, I believe, and has lost the use of his side, and his speech—he was scarcely able to walk—I should say decidedly he was not able to carry on the business of the house—he could not give directions, because he could not speak; but he seemed to understand every thing.</p>

               <p>but I could find no bill of the copper on either of them—I asked him if he had a bill for the copper at all—he again made a sort of noise, meaning "No"—I said, "Nor ever had, I suppose?"—he again made the same noise.</p>

On the 26th of January, I went to drink at the Duke of York, in High-street, Shadwell, at eleven o'clock at night—I had met with Ann Robinson, a dress-maker, and went in there, and called for a quartern of gin and a pint of beer—I took out my money, paid for it, and then had a five-shilling piece and a sixpence left—as I was rather in liquor, Robinson</p>

                  </hi>. I was at a trial here on Tuesday; on account of my brother; I am a farmer, and live at Edmonton. On the 10th of January I was on the Edmonton-road, about ten o'clock in the morning—I met the prisoner coming from London, with a horse and cart, within about one hun<lb/>dred yards of the six mile stone—the cart was loaded partly with dung—I and my brother were riding in a gig—I got out, and asked the prisoner what he was loaded with—he said, "Dung"—I said, "Any thing else?"—he said, "No"—I asked if he had been to London for dung—he said "Yes," and he had loaded in Holborn—he said, "We sometimes take tur<lb/>nips, and sometimes greens; and when we have nothing else to do, we go and fetch dung"—I sent my brother for the constable—I walked by the side of the prisoner's cart—when we got to Tanner's End, the prisoner was met by his father, Thomas Tarsey, who lives there—the father and the prisoner, and the horse and cart, all went into the yard, and the horse was taken out—Camp, the constable, then came, and the cart was overhauled—there was a little long dung taken off first, and then there was a sack, with some corn in it; then there was a layer of dung, and then a sack or two, and then the other articles stated—among other articles, we found some posting bills of Mr. Chaplin's—this is one of them—it is of the Defiance fast coach—we found two sacks, about two quarters of oats, four trusses of hay, this head-stall, and these other things, belonging to Mr. Chaplin, and a great many other things which are not Mr. Chaplin's—the prisoner's father went away with the horse from the cart, and I believe, was not seen any more—the prisoner was taken.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. William Chaplin, the large coach proprietor—he is proprietor of the Angel-yard, behind St. Clement's On Sunday, the 11th of January, I went to the watch-house at Edmonton, and saw this property—one sack has the name of Chaplin on it, and one the name of Wright—this sack, marked Chaplin, I am sure is Mr. Chap<lb/>lin's—Mr. Wright was the proprietor of the White Horse, in Fetter-lane, and Mr. Chaplin bought the sacks of him—I see to the whole ma<lb/>nagement of the Angel-yard—these oats are Archangel and Irish, mixed, and tares in them—I have compared what were found in the cart, and what was on our premises, and I have no doubt they are the same—there were three bridles missing, such as these, but I could not swear to them—our watchman has run away—some one came about four o'clock in the morning, to the yard, who was supposed to be the prisoner—I have brought one rug to match with these which were found, they are the same—he could not have got these way-bills but at the Angel.</p>

I know nothing of the prisoner; but on the 31st of Janu<lb/>ary I lost this paper—on the 29th, a gentleman, who resides in the lower part of my premises, informed me that there were two suspicious looking characters in my passage—I set a watch on the landing of my house, where this property and some other was placed—on the Saturday the lad who I set to watch, gave me an alarm—I went out, and saw the prisoner run<lb/>ning, and the lad after him—he took him and brought him back—he had thrown the property down—my street-door was open, but there is another inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the beadles of St. Pan-cras. On Monday evening, the 26th of January, between six and seven o'clock, I was passing along Zion-terrace to Argyle-place—I saw a num<lb/>ber of people collected—I went up stairs in a house in Argyle-place, in the front room, first floor, and saw five or six persons there, and a man lying dead on the bed—the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed, near the corpse—I asked her how the man came by the cut in his side, which I could see, (it was bound up, but I put the wadding on one side and saw it)—she said, by cutting a piece of wood to put on the fire—I asked her if</p>

               <p>she was a married woman—she said she was married to Jenkins, the de<lb/>ceased—I asked her where the knife was—Phoebe Davidson came up stairs, and took the knife out of the cupboard—I asked Davidson if that was the knife—she said it was—I said, "Can you swear to its being the knife?"—she said, "Yes, it is; is it not <hi rend="italic">George?</hi> "(speaking to the prisoner,) and the prisoner said it was—I produce that knife—I then asked the prisoner to tell me whether she actually was a married woman or not, and she replied that she was not—I asked her if she and Jenkins had had any quarrel—she said they had, on the Saturday night, about Phoebe Davidson—she said the quarrel was because Davidson would not come up to sup with them—Davidson lodged down stairs—I found so many people there, I said nothing further, but desired them not to bury the body until an inquest was held—I went down stairs, and went to a neighbouring beer-shop, and not feeling satisfied, I sent for Campbell, a sergeant of police—he came, and we both went to Dr. Jones that night, and from what Dr. Jones told us, we felt ourselves in duty bound to take the prisoner into cus<lb/>tody—I went to the station-house, and then returned and got the de<lb/>ceased's clothes, which I have here—there is a cut in the clothes—it has gone through the great-coat—the prisoner said the clothes were hanging up behind the door, and I found them there—the cut has gone through the great-coat and two waistcoats, in the place corresponding with where the man was cut in the side, and it corresponds with the knife—his shirt was cut also in the same place—there was no under-coat—the shirt has been found since—I did not see it found—there was no appearance of any wood being cut in the room.</p>

"You told me last night, you always lived very happily together?"—she said, "Oh no, he has often beat me, and left me weltering in my blood: as my late landlady, who lived next door, can testify."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Judd-street. I was not acquainted with the deceased before the accident—on Saturday, the 24th, between ten and twelve o'clock in the evening, I saw him at No. 1, Argyle-place—the prisoner came to my house for me to go—she seemed very much distressed—I went with her, and found the deceased in the front room, up stairs—I do not recollect whether he was in bed—he stated that he had cut himself in cutting wood—the prisoner was with me—on ex<lb/>amining, I found an oblique would, extending between the seventh and eighth rib on the left side, about three quarters of an inch long—it appeared to be made with a sharp instrument penetrating obliquely from the left side to the right—it had entered on the left side—there was only blood on the</p>

               <p>shirt—the bleeding of the wound had ceased—his pulse was affected, but I do not conceive it was from the blood lost, but rather from the shock or fear in his mind from the accident—I did not think seriously of the wound—having dressed it, to cheer him up, I told him to consider himself more frightened than hurt—being an oblique wound, it was impossible to state what would be the result, as I could not see to what depth it had gone—I then gave him some ammonia, &amp;c, with an idea of accelerating the pulse, to raise the pulse to bring on re-action—the next morning, about eight o'clock, I was surprised to find him at my house, which is about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards from where he lived—I found his pulse con<lb/>siderably accelerated and fuller—he complained of pain in his stomach—I have learnt since that he had taken something to injure him—I imme<lb/>diately ordered him to be bled, to produce fainting—I ordered him to be sent to bed, and kept quietly, and to take two ounces of castor oil—I intended him to be bled till it produced that effect on the pulse—that is a general rule when we order bleeding, to faint—my assistant bled him in my shop instantly—he was to walk home after he had rallied from the fainting—my assistant is in the habit of bleeding, under my direction, four and five times a week—I have found a good effect from bleeding for incipient inflammation—the pulse was fuller than it was the night before—the characteristic pulse is a small pulse, but a quick pulse—this was on Sunday morning—I saw him twice that day—in addition to that he was ordered to have a mustard poultice applied all over his stomach—this was at eight o'clock in the morning—he died at six o'clock the following day—he did not die from any internal bleeding, but from peritoneal inflammation—(I examined the body after death, on Tuesday morning, at eight o'clock)—I did not inform him he was dying, and I cautioned the prisoner against letting him know my opinion—I told her twenty hours after the accident, that there was not the slightest chance of his recovery—that was after the bleeding—I did not see him take any brandy, or any spirits—I did not learn such a thing had been ad<lb/>ministered till the inquest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you say the treatment you resorted to after seeing him on Sunday morning, was under circumstances of entire ignor<lb/>ance on your part, as to what he had been doing himself, or what he had taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought he had taken nothing but what I ordered him—there was nothing about the wound on Saturday which led me to conclude the result would be fatal—I could not conclude that, as was evident from the nature of the wound—the immediate cause of death was inflammation about the internal parts in which he had received the incision—the peritoneum, when wounded, takes inflammation very soon indeed—a wound, externally, if sufficient to produce inflammation, without the peritoneum being wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is the character of peritoneum inflammation, you say, to give a low, quick pulse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We understand, by the pulse I describe, a quick, small pulse; that is, a sort of pulse I should desire a patient to be bled with under those symptoms.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You opened the body, and I ask you, was the wound, it your judgment, the cause of his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—there was effusions of fluid into the cavity of the chest—not of blood—it is the nature of in<lb/>flammation, for that description of fluid to flow, much more than can be ta<lb/>ken up, and so it remains in the cavity—I have not a doubt the wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the pulse rise after what he went through in your shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly; I took about twenty ounces of blood from him, besides what he lost from the wound—he only came to me once; I was astonished to find him there—many individuals, after losing blood to a considerable extent, are perfectly capable of walking a considerable distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having received a severe wound on Saturday night, and losing twenty ounces of blood, should he have gone out in the cold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There would not be any objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The considerable effusion you named was not blood, but arising from the peritoneal inflammation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that effusion was the cause of his death, and that appeared to have been caused by the perito<lb/>neal inflammation which was caused by the wound—it was not by the bleeding, or any other cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The wound might have existed, and yet in<lb/>flammation might not have appeared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it possible—the very process by which it was to be healed would be inflammation—I think if he had had raw spirits, or brandy-and-water, the inflammation would have been more likely to have a fatal tendency—I did not know of his taking spirits, until the inquest.</p>

On Saturday even<lb/>ing I went out with the prisoner at eight o'clock, and returned again shortly after—I did not go out with the deceased—I came home with the prisoner about half-past ten or near eleven o'clock—we had met the deceased when we were out—I did not go up stairs with them when I came in—I remained in ray own room—they both came into my mother's room with me—it must be near upon eleven o'clock—they seemed to be on the best of terms—both went up stairs very friendly together—they had been up stairs near upon half an hour when I heard a loud talking—I could not distinguish voices at all—they were both talking, and he more than her, as if quarrelling—I heard something very heavy fall on the floor—I thought at the time it must have been a chair or table—I could not say which it was—soon after that, I heard her run down stairs and go out—she did not call at our door as she went by—she went out of doom—I heard her return in about ten minutes with Mr. Jones—I saw Jenkins again between eleven and twelve o'clock on Sunday morning—I heard him go out before I saw him—I went into the room, he was in bed—I asked how he was—he said he was very bad—that was the last time I saw him—she had come into our room on Sunday morning, and my mother asked her at the same time how she came to do it, and she said she was in a great passion, and she would serve any man so who called her a bad name (mentioning a very bad name)—she said he had been having a great many words with her concerning a young woman (Phoebe Davidson) who would not come up to supper, and he had put her apron on the fire, and was going to tear her new bonnet which she had just had made—she had made the bonnet herself, I went out with her to buy the stuff—she said he had his hand up to strike her, and she told him if he hit her again she would hit him—she told me he had hit her several times—he had often beat her before, I know—they appeared on very friendly terms that night—she always showed great affection for him, and was very sorry for what had taken place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to James Henry Henderson, a solicitor, of No. 31, Bloomsbury-square. I saw the prisoner in the hall on Tuesday evening, the 27th of January, about a quarter before six o'clock—the door was then shut—he had just brought a note, which he had given to the housemaid—I had not seen him give her the note, but she told me in his presence that he had given her the note—I left him in the passage, while I went with the note into Mr. Henderson's room—I re<lb/>turned into the passage—he was still standing there, a little further into the hall, and more under the light, it shone more on his countenance—I have not the slightest doubt of his person—I went down stairs, returned up stairs, and the prisoner was in the act of opening the street door—Mr. Henderson had just come from his office door into the hall—the prisoner had a bundle of clothes on his arm, and a hat in his hand, and he had a hat on his head—as he pulled the door too after him, Mr. Henderson pull<lb/>ed it open—I ran out after him, being sure he had got what he ought not to have—I saw him, when I got to the door, running—he ran across the cor<lb/>ner of the square, and dropped a cloak and hat—I pursued him till he came to Southampton-row, and there he was stopped by a policeman—I lost sight of him in turning the corners, but immediately caught sight of him again—he had dropped the other clothes at the street door—I gave him in charge—Mr. Henderson, when he ran out, took up the cloak and hat.</p>

On the 19th of January, the prisoners came to me about four o'clock in the afternoon—I was about two hundred yards from the green-yard—Lake, who gave his name William Blake, told me they had brought a cow to the green-yard; and the woman (meaning my wife) had put it into the green-yard—I after<lb/>wards went to the green-yard with the prisoners, and found the cow there—I asked them where they had brought it from—Lake said, they</p>

On the 31st of December Stephen Reed was employed to cart some osiers—Welch, who was convicted yesterday, was his servant—I saw the osiers in the cart when they were being unloaded—I saw Ansell with them—he was not in our employ, nor in Reed's—I saw them unloaded in my father's yard at Edmonton, where they are deposited—43 bundles were unloaded; there ought to have been 47—I had not given directions for any part of them to be unloaded elsewhere—I manage my father's business—I went to see them unloaded, in consequence of in<lb/>formation; I went to the prisoner's premises about in hour afterwards—the constable afterwards took John Vardon into custody, and Ansell was taken into custody afterwards—I went to the prisoner's house; he keeps the William the Fourth beer-shop, at Edmonton, and is a turnip-buncher, and ties up turnips for the market—thin osiers are much used for that purpose—I went down his yard, through the turnip-bunching shed, and found one bundle of osiers—a great many of them were thin, sufficiently to bunch turnips with—there were several persons about, but not employed in bunching turnips—they appeared such osiers as had been on our ground—I then went round to inform Camp—he and the prisoner came together to where I had found the one bundle—I asked the prisoner if they be<lb/>longed to him—he said no, they did not—I said, "Do you know they belong to my father?"—he said, "I do not know who they belong to"—the constable said, "There are three more bundles misting; will you allow us to search further?"—he said, "Yes"—we searched in a stable he did not point it out, but we came to a stable door, it was then opened, and we there saw the three other bundles, making the four which were missing—Camp asked the prisoner if they were hit—he said "No"—we</p>

On the 31st of December, Welch asked me to go with him, and I went with him after some osiers, down the marsh, to Mr. Pott's ground, with a cart—we put forty-seven bundles of osiers into the cart, and drove with them towards Edmonton—while we were going along, we came by Vardon's beer-shop, and we put down four bolts of osiers at his house—I put them out of the cart, and Vardon's son took them in—he stood close by the cart while I put them down—the prisoner was not pre<lb/>sent—he was inside the house—he never saw me put them down—I did not sit down in the house—we went and had a pot of beer before we put the osiers down, and after they were taken in we had one pint more be<lb/>tween us—the prisoner fetched the last pint—we did not pay for it—I never paid, and I did not see Welch pay—I saw Vardon put his hand in his right hand pocket, and pull out some money to give Welch—I cannot say how mueh—Welch started off, and never said a word to me—I then ran, and overtook him driving towards Edmonton—while I was driving on, I saw the men who cut Mr. Pott's osiers come by—Bennett was one of them—the other, Baynes, I think—when we got to Edmonton, Welch said to me, "Go and open the gate"—we took no more osiers out till we delivered them in Mr. Pott's yard—young Mr. Pott was in the yard—he said no<lb/>thing to me—I was not there all the while the cart was unloading—they were all taken out of the cart—there were forty-three bundles—there had been forty-seven, but four were left at Vardon's—I was taken into custody about half an hour afterwards—I was examined before the Justice, and told what I have now—I was ordered to prison, to be a witness here, and have been so to this time—I went before the Justice with the prisoner—he said, as we went, "Whatever you do, do not say I am in it, and I will employ you a counsellor"—I made answer, "I do not want a counsellor, I mean to speak the truth; I am brought into it, and know nothing about it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Hart-street, Grosvenor-square. The prisoner was in my service on the 29th December—I sent him to the corn-chandler's to get me a truss of hay—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it, and he was to take it to the stable, to feed the horse—I asked him the next day, whether he had bought the hay—he said he had—I told him he must go with me to the corn-chandler's, for I did not think he had bought it, as there was none left—he went with me as far as the corner of North Audley-street, when he slipped through a public-house, and I did not see him again till he was taken, about a fortnight afterwards, I think.</p>

I felt something at my pocket, and at the same time the prisoner brushed by me with his hands rather before him—I felt and missed my handkerchief—I pursued him—he began to run, and threw the hand<lb/>kerchief down—I immediately secured him.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a partner in my business in Oxford-street, named Griffiths Thomas—I have another business in Duke-street, Manchester-square, of my own—Thomas and I are linen-drapers and haberdashers—my business in Duke-street is a linen-draper's—the prisoner was in the occasional employ of our firm as clerk and book-keeper—he came about twice a week, in the evening, to keep our accounts—he has been much better off—he was in a very respectable business in Friday-street, and married my first cousin—I believe he has four children—he has through misfortunes been reduced in circumstances—we dealt with Messrs. Lainson and Co., Bread-street, wholesale Manchester-warehousemen, for goods—we owed them 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is our custom to have a discount off our accounts—I gave the prisoner this cheque (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 30th of October, and I took the precaution to cross the name of Jones, Lloyd, and Co, on the cheque in large letters—I told him to pay it to Messrs. Lainson and Co.——the names of Jones, Lloyd, and Co. on the cheque are now struck through, and "Bank of England" written over it—that was not on the cheque when I gave it to him—I knew nothing of that being written on it till the cheque was returned from my bankers, which was about the beginning of January, directly after the bankers balanced—on the 17th of January, I called on the prisoner—it was after I had received the cheque from the bankers—I had drawn his attention to those words being struck out a week or ten days before that, when we were going over the cheques which had been returned, at my house—the cheque was then before me—I said it appeared strange that "Jones, Lloyd, and Co." was marked out, and "Bank of England" was written across it—he said he dare say Lainson and Co. had an account with, or might have bought money in the Bank of England—I said, "This cheque appears very strange not to have come into our banker's until the 23rd of December," which was marked on it, when I had given it to him on the 30th of Octobers—he said Lainson and Co. were rich people, and he dare say it was locked up in their iron chest, they not having occasion for it—I believe my partner called on Lainson and Co.—I had not the least knowledge that the cheque had not reached Messrs. Lainson's before I called on the prisoner on the 17th of January, and asked him to pay me for some flannel, which was a private transaction be<lb/>tween him and myself—he said he was very sorry, he had certainly sold them and received the money, but had no money to give me, and said he had made use of the money—the amount was between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he appeared to be very much agitated, and said he was very sorry, he had been guilty of great ingratitude towards me, and he said he supposed I was aware of other circumstances—I said I certainly was aware I had given him a cheque of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Johnson and Bulmer—he said he had not the money to pay me for the flannels, but he had a bill in his pocket for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and he should have another at the beginning of the week, and I was welcome to that—he put it on the table—a little time after I said, "You had better put your name on the bill before I take it"—I told him it was better for him to tell me the amount at once—to confess what he had taken at once—he said he would write the particulars down—he took a pen in his hand and then said, "I am very nervous, indeed"—he said his hand</p>

               <p>shook so much he would be obliged to me to write it down—he called over several names—I have a list in my pocket, which I took down from his dictation—this is it—that was the first time I learnt that this cheque had not been applied to its proper purpose—here is the name of "Lainson, 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on the list—that is one of the sums he mentioned having re<lb/>ceived and not paid.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what passed between you, do not you believe he had reason to suppose that, for a time, he might have appropriated the cheque to his own purpose, and afterwards make it good to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not the least idea he could have contemplated that—he has never appropriated cheques, and afterwards repaid them, with my permission—I remember, last October, giving him a cheque fox 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in favour of Morley, of Gutter-lane—I did not learn afterwards, from himself or Morley, that he had ap<lb/>propriated that cheque to his own purpose—I was not aware of it at all, up to this moment—I never had any conversation with him afterwards about it—Morley sent up to me for the account, after I had given him the cheque—I sent a young man to call on the prisoner and know why he had not paid that cheque, and he said he would go directly and pay it—I be<lb/>lieve that was a transaction of my own—I have no entry of my own trans<lb/>actions in this book—I believe about two days elapsed between my giving him that cheque, and finding it was not paid—I expected he would pay it at his convenience, in a day or two—I was not particular to a day—to the best of my belief, it was less than a week—I swear, to the best of my be<lb/>lief, it was not more than a week—I will not positively swear it was not three weeks—when I brought it to his mind, he did not say, "I will go and make it good—I will go and pay it directly"—I have no book here in which that cheque was entered—this did not happen, in any other instance, ex<lb/>cept Morley's—the next transaction which occurred, was on the 4th of January, this year; a bill from Lucock and Co., of Leeds, was presented at Brooks and Co's. for payment—it was drawn by Lucock and Co. on Brooks and Thomas—it became due on the 4th of January, and was pre<lb/>sented to Brooks and Thomas—the amount might be 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it had been presented before for acceptance—it was presented for payment, al<lb/>though we had not accepted it—we had refused acceptance because it was not correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in September, 1834, give the prisoner a cheque to pay into Glynn's, on account of Lucock, of Leeds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have it down in my banking-book as the 25th of November—it was 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure it was in November—Mr. Hardy, the agent of Lucock, applied to me in January respecting it, and said he was sure the cheque had never been paid—in consequence of that, I went to the prisoner's the first thing on Monday morning, but he was out, and when I saw him, he said he had just been down to Mr. Hardy to take the money—I spoke to him about his not paying the cheque in November, as he ought to have done, and he told me it was the fault of his clerk—he said his clerk had misunderstood him, that he told him to go and pay it into the bankers', instead of which, he</p>

               <p>had gone to the bankers, received the money, and he had kept it ever since, locked up in his desk, and he was very sorry the mistake had occurred—I found he had paid the money—I have given the copy of a letter which I have had notice to produce, to Mr. Hobler's clerk.</p>

He gave me the £20 bill, and said he did not think it was worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I did not think it was—he agreed to give me an<lb/>other bill, but no list of the debts—I cannot say whether the bill was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not mention the amount of the bill in the letter—I will swear I did not mention any sum—he said he should have another bill on the Monday or Tuesday, and would give me that—I rather think now it was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot say whether it was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you swear there was no bill referred to in the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I said there was no amount mentioned in the letter—when I took the letter from Forrester I read it over, and noticed particularly that there was no<lb/>thing of any consequence in it—I did not apply to him for the letter—we were looking over the prisoner's duplicates and things, and Forrester said, "Here is a letter of your writing"—I took it and read it—I am certain that is a copy of it, as near as possible, word for word—he gave me the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on Saturday, the 17th of January, the same day he gave me the list I have handed in, in which list this very cheque is included—I was there from ten till one o'clock—I think I made out the list about twelve o'clock—he laid the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on the table—and I took it up and put it into my pocket after I had made out the list, as I was going away—he had at that time apprised me that he had misappropriated this cheque—I took the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill because he had not any money to offer me for the flannel—he was taken up on Tuesday, the 20th of January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you given him any advice as a friend—on your oath? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had said something to him—he begged me to be merciful to him—I said I thought the best thing he could do was to go off to America, as my partner, if I was not willing to prosecute him, would do so, when he came to know it—he said, "No, I will rather stop and serve you"—I was not aware of the misappropriation at the time he offered me the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it was left on the table at my side—I considered it then my property—he had given me the statement before I took it off the desk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he mentioned the amount of the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he had—he named either 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about one or other sum—I think he said I should have a bill for about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not pay much attention to it, expecting it would be, like the first, not worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you an unwilling prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left it entirely in the hands of my partner—if I am to state whether I am or not, I certainly would rather not prosecute—my partner insists on the prosecu<lb/>tion being carried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had your conversation with the prisoner, on the subject of the flan<lb/>nel, reference to that transaction, or had it any thing to do with the misap<lb/>propriation of the money of Brooks and Thomas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing—it was quite a separate and distinct matter—I was not in a condition to forego a prose<lb/>cution without the consent of my partner—I never allowed the prisoner to misapply cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This letter speaks of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is that the amount of different items of that sum furnished to you in his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was the answer he sent in the letter, and that was all I received back—these items were sums belonging to Brooks and Thomas—that was for many small sums he had made payments of for Brooks and Thomas—I was never aware that he had misapplied cheques I had given him for any specific purpose, on account of Brooks and Thomas, before the discovery of the transaction—I never permitted him, directly or indirectly, to do so—I had done all I could to serve him up to the time in question—he acknowledged his sense of his ingratitude towards me when he confessed his guilt—I have in my bankers' book an account to show when this cheque came to them—it is written on this cheque, "23rd of December"—I never heard a word about its misappropriation between the 30th of October and the 23rd of Decem<lb/>ber—I should not have suffered him to retain it if I had known it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave you a bill, at all applicable to any thing but the flannel which you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not receive it towards the turns he had misapplied, but on my own private account for the flannel; and the bill he promised to send was to be in payment of the flannel—I have neve r accepted any sum as security for any of the items on this paper, among which is the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave that cheque to him to pay Lainson and Co., and for no other purpose—I did not direct him to receive the cheque, but to carry it to them, to pay them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and live in Cheapside.

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and live at Welton, in Northampton. I formerly lived at Lower Clapton—I have a brother who lives in Austin-friars—I came to town in the month of July last year, and went to my brother's house in Austin-friars—my brother gave me this letter on my arrival—on receiving it, I called on Mr. Hammond—he accompanied me to the Circus, in the Minories—I rang at the bell, and a female servant opened the door—I inquired if James Laurie lived there—the defendant opened a door on the right hand of the hall, and made his appearance—I believe that was before the servant answered my question—I said, "I have received a letter from James Laurie, dated No. 11, Circus, Minories; does that person reside here?"—he said, "Walk in, I can manage that business"—we went into the room on the right hand side out of which he came—Mr. Hammond accompanied me—I gave the letter to Mr. Hammond in the room—I think Mr. Hammond put the letter into Ady's hand—his attention was directed to it—I asked him if James Laurie lived there—he said yes, he did—I said, "Is he at home?"—he said, "No, he is not at home, but I can answer that letter"—I then said, "Laurie is a singular name—I knew, formerly, a Mr. Laurie, when I was at the Cambridge University, is your partner related to any of that family?"—he had said Laurie was his partner—I think that was when we first went into the house—we had the letter exposed; when he said he could answer that letter—I said, "I knew Mr. Laurie, of Cambridge, who was a nephew of the late Lord Mayor," and said, "Is your partner at all related to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020151"/>
               <p>that family?"—he said, "He is his own brother—we have been in part<lb/>nership some time, did you not know that?" <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask who he meant by his own brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sir Peter Laurie—I said, "No, I do not reside in London, I reside in Northamptonshire"—he said, "Oh that is the rea<lb/>son: every body in London knows it; we have been in partnership for some time," or "for six months"—I cannot exactly say which he said—I asked him when James Laurie would be in—he said he could not tell, he was gone out, but he could answer the letter, and he then went behind the counter to his books—I said, "Is it in your power, or James Laurie's power, to tell me of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mentioned in this letter; which I can receive on payment of a sovereign?"—he said, "It is"—Mr. Hammond then began a conversation with him, and asked him whether he was sure the James Laurie mentioned in that letter, was the own brother of Sir Peter Laurie, the late Lord Mayor—he said, "Yes, he is; have not you teen any of our circulars," or "papers?"—I forget which—he then went to the corner of the room, took some papers, and gave one to Mr. Hammond, and one to myself—Mr. Hammond again asked whether he was sure he could be in<lb/>formed of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Mr. Tebbutt could receive if the sovereign was paid, and whether if the money was not forthcoming, he would return the so<lb/>vereign—whether he would give an acknowledgment to that effect—he said he would, and gave an acknowledgment—this is the receipt he gave me—I had previously given Mr. Hammond a sovereign—Mr. Hammond handed it over the counter to Ady—Mr. Hammond had before that asked him particularly whether, in the absence of James Laurie, his partner, he was authorized to receive money on his own account?—he said, "I am."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to permit Mr. Hammond in your presence to pay that sovereign to the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The belief that I should receive the information contained in the letter, and that James Laurie was the person he represented—I do not think I should have given the sovereign if he had not represented James Laurie to be his partner, and the brother of Sir Peter Laurie—upon payment of the sovereign this paper was given me as the information—I read it, and when I saw the name of my brother, who was dead, and Mr. Lloyd, I knew it immediately referred to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock my father had presented to one of Mr. Lloyd's children—it never stood in my name, but in my brother's name, Thomas Tebbutt and John Lloyd—it re<lb/>lated to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock which my father gave Lloyd's child, which was to re<lb/>main in the funds until he attained his majority—I said to him, "This money has been had out of the funds, to the best of my belief, many years ago, and I have no interest in it whatever, therefore I will thank you to return my money"—he said, "Are you not a better lawyer than that?"—I remon<lb/>strated with him for detaining my money, but could not get it back—I told him repeatedly it did not at all concern me—he said he had only my word for that. The documents produced were here read as follows:—</p>
               <p>"To S. Tebbutt, Esq., April 28, 1834—The undersigned is able to in<lb/>form you of something to your advantage, value 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on payment to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by post, or otherwise, for his trouble.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say he would hit his nose flat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say the words he used—I do not remember the word "nose"—I never heard, before I went to get the information referred to in the letter, that there had been money standing in the names of Lloyd and Tebbutt and others, which had after<lb/>wards been claimed and sold—I knew there was a property in the name of Charles Lloyd, in the hands of trustees—Thomas Tebbutt was one of the trustees—he is dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you know that it had been in the published list of un<lb/>claimed dividends for some years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, for I believe the youth wanted the money, and when he became of age it was sold out, but I am on very slight terms with my family, and know very little about it—I am brother to the attorney in Austin-friars—I did not confer with him about the letter—he gave it to me at the inn—I believe I did not see my brother during the whole week I was in town—I am not on terms with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see such a book as this, of unclaimed dividends and property in trust in the funds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; these are the names of the trus<lb/>ees</p>

               <p>of the property—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the book</hi>)—the information was not that there had been money of that kind, but that there was—I should think the money was paid to my nephew about five or six years ago, but I have not seen him for the last ten years—I do not think I have seen him six times since he was born—I immediately demanded my money back from Ady, according to the terms the receipt was written—I went to the Lord Mayor the day after—I did not go to Gray's-inn-lane, or any where, to make inquiry—I made no inquiry of Hay ward, of Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, very seriously, on your oath, did not Mr. Ham<lb/>mond and you together, or Mr. Hammond, with your knowledge, go there for the purpose of making evidence of this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did aot—Mr. Hammond did not tell me that No. 11, Circus, was Ady's house, or that we were going to see Ady—he said, "Ady lives in the Minories"—that was all he said—it was on the road—I believe he mentioned Ady's name, after I gave him the sovereign—I gave him the money in the street—I believe, on the road, Mr. Hammond said he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Ady, add he mentioned, either at the house or just before we went there, that the information he got was not correct, and he got his money back—I did not know I was going there to see Ady—I had no idea of it—I do not remember whether Mr. Ham<lb/>mond told me it was Ady, when Ady presented himself—I cannot swear he did not—after we were in the house, Mr. Hammond and Ady had some conversation, and then I heard Ady's name—that was before the money was paid.</p>

               <p>would—he gave the information, and I think a receipt was given for it—it was asked for, I do not know whether by Mr. Tebbutt or myself, and he gave it—I am telling the substance of what passed, as far as I can recol<lb/>lect—he gave a piece of paper, with what, he said, was the information—this is the paper and the receipt—they were handed to Mr. Tebbutt—he said it did not relate to him, and asked him for the money back—Ady said he would not give it back—I do not recollect any thing passing about a lawyer—he did not return the money—he was asked for it a great many times—we stopped in the house a great while, and tried to get it; and at last went away, and made application to the Lord Mayor—the prisoner sent his servant for a policeman, because we would not go out of the house with—out the money—I think Ady attempted to lay hold of me by the collar, to force me out of the house—I had not used any violence to him—I did not approve of being taken by the collar, and I think I said if he did take hold of my collar, I should knock him down, or any man who attempted it—he shut me outside the door, and locked himself in—that was before the police<lb/>man came, I believe—I and Mr. Tebbutt went away together, and never got the sovereign back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you never mentioned Ady's name to him while you were going there; did it not occur to you, that the letter might have come from Ady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it did at the time, as it was signed "Laurie"—I do not think I told Mr. Tebbutt that I believed the letter came from Ady—I cannot say I did or did not mention Ady's name to Mr. Tebbutt before I went to the house—after the sovereign was paid, some information was given—I repeated to Ady, "Sir, are you confident that letter is the</p>

               <p>signature of James Laurie, and that James Laurie is your partner?"—that was both before and after we paid the money—after the information was given to Mr. Tebbutt, vie asked for the money back—we did not ask for it in<lb/>stantly—it might be a quarter of an hour after—I will not swear about it—I am confident it was more than two minutes—I am confident more than two minutes elapsed between our getting the information and demanding the sovereign back—I cannot swear positively, but to the best of my recol<lb/>lection, I am confident two minutes had elapsed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Ady in reply say, "Go, and make the inquiry first, and then if you do not find it satisfactory, I will give you back the money?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. I do not recollect any thing of the sort—I will not swear he did or did not say so—Mr. Tebbutt said it did not relate to him at all; and as such, he said, "Give me the sovereign back"—I told Ady we would not go out of the house without we had the money—I told him I would knock him down if he collared me—perhaps I might have told him I would hit his nose flat, but I have great doubt of it—he did not give me an opportunity of shaking my fist in his face, for he shut the door in my face—I dare say we were in the house an hour or more—it might be two or three—I cannot tell how long we were in the house before we demanded the sovereign back—I should think it was more than ten minutes—I will not swear it was more—we might have remained two or three hours after he gave the infor<lb/>mation—we were trying to get the money back.</p>

On the 3rd of February, about eight o'clock in the even<lb/>ing, I was standing at the comer of Charles-street, Hampstead-road, look<lb/>ing at a show—I felt a hand in my pocket—I looked to see who was near me, and saw the prisoner—he moved his hand from my side—I laid hold of the tail of his coat, and felt in my pocket—I missed my purse, which contained four half-crowns, five shillings, and three sixpences—I told the prisoner he had taken my purse—he said he had not, and got from me, and ran—I called, "Stop thief"—he threw something away—I followed him till he was stopped—I came up to him, and said he had robbed me—he said he had not—I said, "Then you have thrown it away," and a little girl came up and said, "Here is the purse that man threw away"—he begged of me not to expose him to the crowd, and for God's sake to forgive him, as he had a wife and two children, and was distressed—he said he lived in the next street but one, and if I would go with him he would make me any recompense—I told him it was all I had in the world—I went with him to the street he had mentioned, and then he said he lived in the City-road—an officer then came up and took him—this is my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the banking-house of Messrs. Herries, Farqu<lb/>har, and Co.—Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar is one of the partners, and he has more than one partner—Messrs. Tattersalls keep cash at our house—on the 2nd of January, between three and four o'clock, I was at the counter—this witness came in, and brought this letter—upon opening it, I found it con<lb/>fined the draft—I suspected it was not genuine—I asked Coleman in, and he was asked some questions—we were satisfied with his account, and let him go—in the course of a minute or two he came back and made a commu<lb/>nication which induced me to go out, and I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of King-street and St. James'-street, with a red pocket-handkerchief in his hand—I went out at our private-door in King-street, not the door that Coleman went out at—the prisoner seemed to be watching the door of the banking-house in St. James'-street—I went round to Coleman—the pri<lb/>soner had then left the corner, and was going in the direction of St. James'-square—we went in that direction, and overtook the prisoner in St. James'-square—Coleman accosted him, and said he was the party who had sent him with a letter to St. James-street—the prisoner said, "Not me, Sir"—Cole<lb/>man persisted in it, and said he was positive he was the man—I asked the prisoner to return with me, and I took hold of his right arm—I asked him</p>

               <p>if he had no better employ than sending porters to banking-houses—he said, "I do not know any thing about it, it was not me"—he then proceed<lb/>ed in the direction of the banking-house, and I asked where he had been for the last ten minutes—he said, "Making a call in King-street, at No. 10, but the house was shut up"—I observed, that was a gambling-house—he said it was, or "Yes"—I asked if he knew Mr. Chifney—he said he knew two gentlemen of the name of Chifney—he wished to disengage himself from my hold, and said there was no occasion for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. That was in the square—when you took hold of me, I said I would walk without your holding me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. We then proceeded to<lb/>wards the banking-house—Coleman walked with us abreast—the prisoner put his right hand into his breeches pocket, and was feeling about—some time after he drew it out, and I saw something on the pavement, on the spot which we had passed immediately before—I think it was about twelve yards from us—I had not noticed any thing when I had passed that part of the pavement.</p>

The prisoner had been in my service about seven months—he was a carter and ploughman—on the 17th of January, on my way home round my fields, I discovered a sack in a ditch of what we call the nine-acre field—the sack had my name on it, and contained beans and oats mixed—I had no doubt of the sack and its contents being mine, and I directed my servant, James Trench, to watch—the sack was covered with grass, as if to conceal it—I set Trench to watch on Saturday night, and he brought the prisoner to me between five and six o'clock on the Monday following—the prisoner said, "Master, your watchman has caught me with a little corn—I am very sorry for it—I meant to give it to my horses."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the ton of Mrs. Brent, of Deptford. I was at home, on the 14th of November, the principal part of the day—the prisoner came for the payment of a bill for two gallons of British brandy, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my mother was ill in bed—my sister paid him in my presence, and he gave this receipt, signed, "For John James Bowring, William Tindell"—Mr. Bowring afterwards called for the money, and we showed him the receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say your mother was ill, perhaps she had a large note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—she might have one—my sister paid him two sovereigns in my presence; and, to the best of my know<lb/>ledge, I gave the prisoner a pen and ink to write the receipt—I believe I saw him write it—I took it up directly after—I am sure this is the same paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have no doubt this case would not have been urged against me, but for my being as evidence against other parties—he has sworn he was not aware that the ale was in old bottles, and he knows that old bottles were used; and in consequence of that, I have no doubt, this indictment is laid against me, which I was not aware of till last night—the whole sum of money was spent in a supper; as he had promised to give a leg of mutton supper, and to stand a few bottles of wine, provided the job was hushed up—he came home that night in a great passion, and accused Clancey of laying an indictment; and I took the officer to the ticket-porters' public-house to have a glass of brandy-and-water; Clancey and Thomas came to us, and we had ale and porter, and three glasses of brandy-and-water, to prevent any thing going forward against him—the officers then wanted supper, and we went to Shoreditch, and bought 8lbs. of tripe at Mr. Bennett's, and some onions; and we went to a house to have them—I was in liquor, and west to bed; and they had the tripe and the onions cooked—I had the whole money taken from me; sad since then, Clancey has said he would pay the money by instalments, rather than I should be indicted—Mr. Bowring has more than once pressed me to join him in partnership, knowing that my friends were respectable and would support him—I can produce an sight-years' charac<lb/>ter, and never was in any difficulty before; and it is, no doubt, to prevent my appearing against him that he has instituted this.</p>

Peacock was in my employ for about three months as foreman—in consequence of information I received I spoke to Hack and Wilkinson, and the prisoners were appre<lb/>hended—Peacock was not authorized to sell on a Sunday—I do not open shop at all on a Sunday, at any time—if a regular customer sends, I may accommodate him, but then I expect to be applied to, before I allow him to serve—when I engaged him, he asked too much wages, and I said, "Remember, there is no Sunday work."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the police. In consequence of information, I watched the shop on Sunday, the 25th of January, I was on the opposite side of the street, from between six and seven o'clock till half-past eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner Fairey come opposite Mr. Putley's shop just before it struck eight by the church clock—he stood near the curb, looking towards the door, till half-past eight o'clock—he waited there half an hour—he neither rung nor knocked at the door—I observed Peacock open the door—he popped out, and took a hat-box, which Fairey had in his hand, and a basket—he turned into the shop, and was out again in a moment—he handed the basket to Fairey, who walked as fast as he could down towards London-bridge, till he came to Chapel-court—he turned up Chapel-court, and I apprehended him—I laid hold of the basket, and said, "It is all right"—I said to the constable behind me, "Take this man in charge"—I found a belly of pork very wet, as if it had just come from the pickling-tub, a piece of beef, and a piece of suet—I sent him to the station-house, and went directly to Mr. Putley's house—I rang the bell four times before it was answered, and then Peacock opened the door—I said, "We want you, I must see Mr. Putley directly"—he said he bad sold the meat—I had told him I wanted him for robbing his master—I said, "If you have sold it, what does it weigh?"—he said, "It weighed ten pounds"—that be had sold it at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. and there was the money on the desk—there was half-a-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence on the desk—I looked at the scale, and it was quite dry and clean—the prosecutor came down directly, and I took Peacock into custody—at the watch-house, Fairey said the meat was paid for—I asked him how much—he said, it weighed seven pounds, and he had given half-a-crown for it.</p>
