Mr. Huckins is the master—there is an opening from the dock into the port, out into the river—Mr. Clapp is a merchant, and is owner of the vessel—she had discharged her cargo on the other side of the dock, and had taken in another cargo, and was outward bound—we had a wooden case on board, marked N. A., No. 1, which was represented to contain silver plate—it was placed in the captain's state-room—the prisoner was a custom-house officer, and was in charge of the vessel for six or seven days—he slept in the state-room—no one else slept there—the case came on board in the morning of the 1st of August—the prisoner was on board when it came, and knew what was represented as the contents—he took an account of it as an officer—it would be mentioned in the cocket—he had a box on board, containing his own clothes, which was kept on the quarter-deck—on the Saturday after the 1st of August,</p>

               <p>between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the case in the state room, apparently safe as it was when originally placed there—I afterwards went on shore, leaving Lee, the steward, the prisoner, and five or six men on board—I returned in about an hour, when, in consequence of what Lee told me, I went down to the state-room—there was no one there—I saw the wooden case broken open, and a silver tea-pot lying out on the cabin floor—I let it lay there, and said nothing to any one—the prisoner was on the quarter-deck when I came on board—the captain came on board about nine o'clock next morning, and I told him what I had seen—I went down with an officer, and the captain and steward, and saw the case and tea-pot just as I had seen them before.</p>

               <p>—he appeared to be friendly to the opening of the fiat—he afforded every assistance to me and my father in taking possession of the property at Hatfield Hyde—the fiat is signed by the Lord Chancellor, who was then a Commissioner of the Great Seal.</p>

I never heard him say he was living as a private gentleman at Hatfield—he came to surrender before the fiat was opened, and waited till it was opened—if a man does not surrender within forty-two days he is liable to be committed—I had nothing but casual conversation with the prisoner—I only inquired about the property we were to take possession of at Hatfield Hyde—it was worth about£300 or£400, and consisted of household furniture, a farm, and stacks of hay—there were all the implements of farming there, as if he was carrying on a farm—we have since taken possession of the machinery of a flock manufactory in Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square, but we were sot aware of that at the time—it was very extensive machinery—we took possession of the premises, also, as the prisoner's premises—they were let at the time of the bankruptcy, but we have possession of them now—I do not know that his property exceeded three times his alleged debts—we took possession of about£400 worth—I should say the property in Cleveland-street, and at Hatfield, did not exceed the amount of his debts—Mr. Bradshaw was a petitioning creditor and an assignee.</p>

               <p>him to Smithfield many times, but I cannot say at what time exactly he bought pigs there in 1835—it might be more than once or twice—he bought from ten to twelve pigs of different sizes from four to seven stone—they were pigs that wanted fattening—we did not always buy when we went, but sometimes only looked over the market—the prisoner occupied premises at Pinner in 1835—a portion of the pigs were once sent down to Pinner, where he had some meadow land and a farm—there were seven acres of grass land—I have been there—he had also a house in Albany street at the same time—a quantity of pigs were once sent there in a cart and kilied—I saw them there—there might be from ten to twelve—went with him to Newgate-market with them, and they were delivered there out of the cart—I never saw them afterwards—they were more than a day or two at Albany-street, before they went to market.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-factor at Pinner. In the years 1834 and 1835 I was in the habit of supplying the prisoner with barley-meal and other things, for feeding and fattening pigs—when the prisoner's father died he left some stock on the farm—I believe the prisoner purchased some pigs after his father's death, and they were brought to pinner to be fattened—I cannot say how many at a time—I believe not so many as twenty—I should say from ten to sixteen—he used to kill them, but I do not know what became of them afterwards—he did not tell me where he sent them to—I do not believe they were consumed on the premises—I never saw them go away—he had two servants there, his wife and himself—no child—I only saw one lot of pigs come there—I have not known him purchase pigs in London—he has not told me of his purchasing any in London—I have known he has had some, but from where I do not know—he has had two or three sacks of barley-meal from me, but he used to feed</p>

               <p>them from grains a good deal—that would be more than enough to consume for pigs sufficient for his own family—he has talked to me about his mode of fattening pigs—that this and the other would be a very good thing, such as grains, toppings, pollard, barley-meal, and other things—he has never told me what he did with the pigs, and I do not know what be came of them—I believe they went from Pinner—I bought some pigs of his father's once, which came to nearly 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were for sale to any body that would give most money—he wanted me, at one time, to buy some Yorkshire hogs—I believe that was after his father's death—there was about half a dozen, not more—I did not buy them—he did not tell me where he bought them, or what became of them—I went to his place in Albany-street with him, and slept there one night—he did not show me any pigs there which he had fed and fattened.</p>

I was employed by Johnson, the messenger of the Bankruptcy Court, to take possession of the prisoner's effects at Hat field Hyde—I saw the prisoner at the Court of Bankruptcy, when the fiat was opened, and I saw him again the same day at Mr. Johnstone's house, with Mr. Sim, and I believe Mr. Humphreys—I did not hear him give instructions about the taking of the property, but after he had some con versation with Johnstone, he said he would drive me down to the place to take possession, and he did do so a short distance—he met me on the premises the same night I got there—he told me he had several writs out against him, and he had no other motive of getting through his difficulties but by surrendering to the bankruptcy—I asked him if he had got his protection—he showed it to me, and said, "I will take care of this, if I never take care of any thing else"—he said that prevented his being in fear, as he knew nobody could touch him, and he had been at hide and seek.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. M. Ghee, of Hanger-lane, Tottenham. On the morning of the 4th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I was mowing about half a mile, from Blackhope-lane. I saw Langsham pass with a truck, three or four times, which aroused my suspicions—I placed myself to watch, and saw Monday come across Mr. Collins's fields, and take up something; and then Langsham went down a lane which leads to some fields, and brought his truck against my master's place—Menday then took up something, and put it into the truck and then they came on towards Stamford-hill; my master having lost some articles. I thought they might have something belonging to him, and I followed them—Menday was about ten yards behind—I asked them to show me what they had got—Menday said, had I lost any thing—I said my. master bad lately lost some things; I should like to know what they had got; and Menday said he had got some lead, and he showed it me—I gave them in charge—Langsham said he was hired by Menday to draw the truck—Menday said the lead was his, and he bought it of a countryman—I gave the lead to the constable.</p>

On the night of the 11th of July, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was walking along Jewin-street, and I felt something at my pocket—I turned round and my handkerchief was gone—I found the prisoner quite close behind me—I seized him, and told him he had picked my pocket, as there had not been time for any body else to do it—he denied it, and asked me to search him—I found it about a yard from him in the road—he got away—I pursued him—he fell down, and I secured him, and in going along he begged me to forgive him—this is my handkerchief—he was the only person near enough to take it—there was no other person near me—there was another person at a distance, who I suspect was connected with him.</p>

On Tuesday, the 11th of July. about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night, I was in King William-street, and going along the corner of St. Swithin's-lane the pri soner snatched at my bag—the ribbon of it was twisted round my band two or three times, but he got it from me—I struggled with him for above a minute—there were two persons—when he got it he went down St. Swithin's lane—there was a pocket handkerchief and two or three shillings in it—this is my bag—I saw it again the same night at the station-house—the prisoner was caught directly—there was a light at the corner—I am quite sure he is the man—I saw him very soon after in custody.</p>

I was employed by the prosecutrix to take care of her house—I slept there on the night of the 5th of June—the chest of linen was safe in the back drawing room, which is on the ground floor, when I went to bed at ten o'clock—I slept in the north part of the house, at I considerable distance from that room, and on the first floor—there is a door leading from the drawing-room into the garden—that was fast when I went to bed—the window of the water-closet was down, but it had no fastening to it—it opens as a sash—I got up at about half-past four o'clock next morning, which was my usual time—I found the garden door open, which was fastened over night, by an iron bar across it, and a lock, but the key was in it—it had been opened from the inside—I found the water-closet window up, high enough for a man to get through—I went in to the drawing-room, and saw the box broken open—it was a very large box—it took three men to take it into the drawing-room—I looked out at the door, and there was a ladder standing at the water-closet window—it belonged to our premises, as the labourers were working there—there was a mark under the water-closet window, where somebody had got off the ladder on to the window—I traced the footsteps of a man from the road leading from Southampton, to the house, coming towards the water-closet door, and there were the steps of more than one going away from the house—I traced them over one large meadow and one small one, which leads into the turnpike road, within about twenty yards of Day's stables—I then went, and alarmed Mr. Craig, and called his servant—about six o'clock in the morning, as I was going after the patrol, I saw Day, and asked him if he would tell me where the horse police lived, and told him there had been a box broken open in Mrs. Trevelyan's house, and the things taken out—he said the patrol lived just on this side of Bedfont, but it was not any use for me to go, because they were gone to keep Ascot-heath race ground the day before—however, I went to Bedfont, and found one policeman at home—there are two stationed there, but one was gone to the races.</p>

               <p>I am acquainted with Mrs. Trevelyan—I was at the post-office when this letter was presented to her, and she delivered it to me—in consequence of what it contained, I went to see Day, and read the letter to him, he looking over the letter with me—it was in June—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mrs. Trevelyan. Madam, I have wrote to inform you that I have got some information of what you lost, if you please to go to William Day, near the White Lion, and ask him if he did find your property lodged on his premises in Birch-green, last week; he is as innocent of the robbery—I shall hear how you get on before I say any more; so no more at present from your well wisher."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Rodney-terrace, Mile-end, with my parents. On the 17th of July, I went with two of my sisters to visit the Cemetry at Kensal-green—we returned by the Harrow road—just before we got to the Windsor Castle, public-house, I saw two persons walking behind us—when we got to the corner of a lane beyond the public-house, I perceived that my bag was cut off my arm—it was dragged out of my hand by Stonehill—I had the string on my arm and was holding the bag in my hand—I observed a knife in his hand at the time he dragged the bag from me—he ran down the lane with his companion—I did not notice him</p>

               <p>but I am sure Stonehill is the person that took my bag—it contained a pocket handkerchief, two purses, and seven shillings—I spoke to Taylor and James, and they went in pursuit of the persons—the two prisoners were brought back in a short time, and I knew Stonehill to be the person who took my bag—I never had any doubt of it—he asked what he was taken for—I said, "For taking the bag, "—he said he did not do it—I had no opportunity of seeing his face before he went away with the bag—I speak to him by his dress—he had on a brown jacket then—he is not in that dress now—the man who was brought back had the same dress as the man who took the bag.</p>

               <p>the two witnesses—they asked me if I had met two men in the lane, and complained of being robbed—I pointed out the two prisoners to them sitting under the hedge in the field, about three hundred yards from the lane—I cannot say to a hundred yards—I went with James to take them—they were then standing under a tree at the end of the lane—they walked a few paces from the tree, and sat themselves down—we went towards them, and when they saw us coming they got up and walked towards us—we told them they must go with us—we took them to the young ladies, and they pointed them out as the boys they wanted.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner at the parish church of Mylon, in Ireland, fourteen years ago, in 1822—was separated after Christmas last—I was in no situation, when he married—I lived with my father and mother—the prisoner told me he was a widower—I separated because I heard that he had another wife—we had a family of four children—one is alive, the others are dead—I instituted this prosecution—the prisoner obliged me to go to the Magistrate—he said he would not give me a penny to buy bread—I had no property except a house of furniture which my father gave me, and I have worked at making worsted shoes.</p>

I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Chelsea, on the 12th of July.</p>

On the 20th of July, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was in Hampstead-road, and saw the prisoner coming out of the garden-gate of No. 34, Mornington-place, with a bag. I went up to him and said, "What have you here!"—he said, "Never mind, it is all right"—I said, "I must know what it is"—he said, "I had it given to me, it is all right"—I said, I must take him to the station-house—he dropped the bag and said, he would be d—d if he would carry it—I called another constable, took him to the station, and in his coat-pocket I found seven brass knobs, seven escutcheons, and the other articles named; and in the bag was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bs. of lead—I went back to the house with the articles, and found the door shut, but not fastened—I found the brass knobs taken from the cocks, and these fitted them—the sink was cut, and taken away—the service-pipe, and other parts of the lead, and the lead and other articles, completely fitted the places they had been taken from—I found the premises belonged to the Railroad Company—I found a screw-driver on the prisoner, and there were marks of the screw-driver on the places the things were taken from.</p>

Within these last eight or nine years my wife turned to drink very much, and going to plays to parties, and coming home at very improper hours, three and four o'clock in the morning. When I used to ask her where she used to be till that time, she told me where she liked, and then for quietness I would hold my peace, for I had to be up every morning myself at five o'clock to go to my work. I often told her, if she did not mend her maneners, I would go and do for myself; she used to tell me to go, and that I had not the spirit to do so. She several times took my name off from over the door, and put another name on. All this I put up with, for fear of having any words with her, what she was very fond of. We keep little chandler's shop. At last I was forced to go away and lake a lodging. I told my daughter that lives next door to her, (a married woman,) that I would leave her, and she told me it was the best way, as she did not mean to mend. Then I went away and took lodgings, and there I stopped for eight or nine months from her. She met me one night at I was going to my lodgings; she begged of me to come home, and that she would swear against drinking any more spirits. I told her I would not go home any more, as I had a very bad life when I was there. She promised me that she would make that all right, and leave off drinking. I told her I heard she had another husband, she told me that was a young man that lodged in the house with her, and he was gone to sea, and that she did not know him man from a woman, which I believed of her on account of her age, and that she would know herself better; and therefore I came home.

When I came home, there was scarcely any thing in the house but what she told and made away with, to keep this young man, who I was told that she was very fond of, but I put up with all this. I told her daughter that lives next door, and she told me to say nothing to her as she might mend—then she turned to drink as bad at ever, therefore I put up with that and a great deal more than I here mention, there is plenty of witnesses to prove what I mention. On about the 1st of July, she got drunk for three or four days, and then we had some words, I told her I would go where I was before and get a lodging; she told me to go, the would be</p>

               <p>very glad of it; that aggravated me, and I was obligated to go—in two or three days after I was gone this man came home, and come to lodge again with her; the neighbours told me, and one night as I was passing by the house I looked in through the joints of the shutters, and saw her sitting on the man's knee, and eating their supper. I said nothing, but I went to my daughter's and rapped at the door, and asked her to come and see the way her mother was; but she suspected something was the matter, and she would not see it. Then I went away to my lodgings, and I had a very uncomfortable night of it. On two Saturday nights after, on the 15th of July, I met her and this man going to market to buy some tea and sugar, and other things they wanted, and I watched them, but lost sight of them in the crowd of people. I met a friend, and I asked her if she had seen my wife and her lodger, she said, she did, d—n her, go home and never mind, let her go to h—I. Soon after I went home, and found the place in darkness. I thought she had stopped somewhere, for she often stopped out all night when I was at home with her. Then I took it into my head to go in through the window on the first (floor, where we did keep our bed,) to bring away some planes and tools of mine that were in the house, and when I lifted up the window and put my head in, there, to my surprise, I saw them in bed. Before I got right in they were back to back, and he pretended to be asleep. I immediately called the police, and there was none there then. I saw a man outside, and he asked what was the matter, I said, "Come in, you will do as well." I went to open the door to let him in, and she jumped out of the bed, and left the man, her lodger, in bed; however, before she was out of the room, this man I called in and I was in the room, and I said, "You sha'nt go out of here until the policeman sees your behaviour." This man told me to let her go to h—I, and not mind her, and then she got down stairs. Then the policemen came in, and I took them up stairs to let them see where she was in bed with the lodger; her daughter and son-in-law came in also; she then said I cut her with a knife in 'the back of her hand. I could take my solemn oath I had neither Knife, nor any other sort of instrument, for the policemen searched me, I had nothing in the world but my pencil that I had in my pocket, and I did not see that knife for the space of nine or ten days before this happened, which I could take my solemn oath of, and this man that was nearly as soon as I was in the house, could prove the same. The policemen did not come in for about twenty minutes after; when they came in, she gave me in charge to them. I told them I would not leave my house for no one, but to make every thing quiet I went with them; and at the station-house, she said I cut her in the hand, which I could swear she did herself on purpose to get me out of the way while her lodger stopped at home with her; and now she wants <hi rend="italic">to</hi> transport me if she can, which all the neighbours that live near at hand to her knows, and often told me I was a fool for ever coming near hand to her. She often told me she would ged rid of me, which I did not take any heed of, because she used to be in liquor, and when she used to be in liquor she would tear and scratch any man. Therefore, gentlemen, I hope you will look into this, and take it into consideration.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he said, "Did you not promise a bed?"—I said, "Yes, but I did not expect you so late—he said, "Can't I have it?"

                  </hi>. I am a publican and live in St. John-street. I was acquainted with the prisoner for three months previous to July last—I was married on the 5th of July—on the 17th the prisoner came to my home, and went into the parlour—she asked my permission to go to the water-closet—I said I had not one, but if she chose to walk into my bedroom she might—she went up stairs alone, and shortly afterwards came down again—she had some bread and cheese and a glass of ale in my bar—my wife returned home at the very moment I was putting away the refreshment, and some words occurred about the prisoner being there—I explained, and she was satisfied—my wife afterwards went up stairs and came down, and she, her sister, and the prisoner went out, and returned shortly—after my wife was sent for to go to Hatton-garden, and during her absence the prisoner made tea for me and another person, a bottle-merchant—after tea requested her to leave, as I thought there might be some unpleasantness occur between my wife and her, as she appeared jealous—she said she would leave, and went up stairs to put on her bonnet and shawl—she then came into my bar parlour, and rubbed out her address which she had put on my slate that day—I had not read it before she rubbed it out—my wife returned shortly after the prisoner left, she went up stairs, and missed the spoons from the bed-room—when I got up that morning they were safe on the dressing-table—not a soul had been up in the bed-room but myself, my wife, and the prisoner—we have no servant—next morning I missed my ring, my watch, six spoons, a veil, and two handkerchiefs after some inquiries I found the prisoner at her lodging, No. 2, Buxton-street, Clerkenwell—when I went there, the door was opened by a little girl—the prisoner was standing at a room door, and seemed confused—she said she was very ill, and was very glad I had called to see her, she had not been out, and in fact was just up—it was then between one and two o'clock in the afternoon—she did not appear ill, but seemed rather confused—I had not been in the house more than three or four or five minutes, when a young man came in who was introduced to me as her husband's brother—she had told me previously that she was married, and had introduced a gentleman to me as her husband at the room where I first met her—I said to her that I had come on very particular business, and the young man then left—I then told her I had a robbery committed at my house, and had lost such and such articles, had she seen, or did she know any thing of it she said, "I saw the spoons lying on the table, and I told Mrs. Parker what a pity it was she let them lay about in such a way, as she might be robbed"—I then asked her if she had any knowledge of it at all—she said "No, only from seeing them"—she denied taking any property from my premises—I gave information to the police, and on the Thursday following the property was shown to me at the station-house.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140069"/>
               <p>told her where—she said, "I shall give you a call"—I said, "I shall be most happy to see youat any time," and that was the reason she came to my house on this day—I had told her I was married—it was done merely out of a feeling of good fellowship towards her, and which I would do to any person I had known, to invite them to my house to partake of a cup of tea, hat I have great cause to regret it now—I certainly did not allow her to take any of these articles—I did not know they were gone till I was getting up next mornings—my wife was the first person who missed the things, and informed me of it—my wife's sister was on a visit to us at the time, and the shawl belongs to her.</p>

On the 8th of August I had been washing, and hung my things on the first floor—there was a sheet among them—I saw the prisoner run along the passage with a bag in her hand—I suspected her, and ran after her, and called to my husband—I took hold of her shoulder—she had the bag under her arm—I said she had something belonging to me in it—I left her with my husband, and went up and missed the sheet—she then threw it out of the bag—this is it—she was quite a stranger. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had picked the sheet up in a bundle, and put it into her bag without looking at it.</hi>)</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of June, I saw a brindled cow of his safe, between eight and nine o'clock at night, in a mead called the Kitchen Mead, at Bulpham-natczh—I hasped the gate of the field myself when I left it—it was not locked—on the Sunday morning, between four and five o'clock, I went to the mead again, and it was gone—I had known the cow ten or eleven years—I had taken care of her and milked her for six or seven years—she had two very large teats before, and two white spots on her back, one against the shoulder, and the other on the loin—she was in calf, and had about six weeks or two months to go, I think—she gave milk to two calves—I have since seen a skin and horns, which I know to be those of my master's cow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Walker and Co., attorneys, of New Inn, and live at No. 51, York-square, Regent's-park. On Saturday evening, the 29th of July, about half-past ten o'clock, I went to the Acton Arms, Kingsland-road, and asked for a glass of porter—I had missed my way—I saw the prisoner in the house—she called for a quartern of gin, and when the landlord asked who was to pay for it, she immediately said, "That gentleman is to pay for it"—I said I knew nothing about it; but there having the appearance of being a disturbance about it, I asked what it was—he said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and I said, "Rather than have a disturbance, take it out of the change"—I had not spoken to the prisoner—I gave a sovereign, and put the change into a wash-leather purse which I had in my hand, and placed the purse in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold; and, to the best of my belief, three half-crowns, a shilling, and sixpence in silver, in my purse—the porter disagreeing with me, I left the house—the prisoner followed me out, and took me by the arm—I requested her to leave me alone—she immediately seized me by both arms, and held me violently, passing one arm round my back, so as to take hold of my right arm, she standing on my left side—I was rather alarmed—another woman came in front of me—I believe she had been in the public-house, but I had not no ticed her—another came on my right side—(I had not seen her before;) and, in an instant, I felt my pocket unbuttoned, and a hand draw my purse from my pocket—I struggled hard, and at last got away from them—I imme diately went back to the house, and informed the landlord I had been robbed—the prisoner did not let me go till my money was taken from me.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 25th of July, about ten o'clock, there was a ring at the bell—I opened the door, and found the prisoner Grant there—he said he had come from Mrs. Smith in Regent-street, who had not ribbon enough to finish a dress—I did not exactly understand him, and said there was no such person living there—I went up stairs to a lodger to ask if she knew any thing about it, and when I came down I found the door open, and the prisoner gone—I am certain he is the boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller. On the 27th of July, I opened my box, and missed a breast-pin, and these other things—my wife accused the prisoner who was in our service of it—she denied it at first, but when my wife said she would send for a policeman, she acknowledged she had taken some of the things—this is my property—this is the printed muslin—this is the brooch and the ear-drops—some were found in her pocket in a purse—this brooch and ear-rings were found in her pocket, and they are mine.</p>

My age is 23, have lived in the wholesale druggist line ten months, can have an unexceptionable reference, and security if required; wages not so much an object as the obtaining a situation, having been out some length of time.

               <p>"To Mr. Fenton, High-street, Colchester.

On the 30th of July I was going in search of my husband, and met the prisoner in Oxford-street, about twenty minutes to four o'clock in the morning—he addressed me, and spoke to me several times before I answered him—I believe he asked me where I was going—he walked by the side of me for about twenty minutes—I kept walking on—I had a ring on my finger, and he attempted to take it off—I put my hand under my shawl, and he put his arm round me, and made another attempt, and then I took it off and put it into my mouth, he then took it with his thumb and fingers, and ran off with it—the policeman saw him running, and he took him—when he was taken, I asked for my ring—he said he had not got it—I have lost it entirely.</p>

This happened in Seymour-place—On the 8th of August, at half-past four o'clock I received information—I went out and followed the prisoner, who was nearly 200 yards from my master's—the policeman took him—I gave him in charge—he threw away the coat in running—I picked it up—it was my master's—this is it—I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Gossett, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "It is my property, "—I said, "I know better"—he said, "I know who it belongs to, it belongs to Turner," and that he had leave to be there—I then asked him to go with me to Turner's—he said he would not go—he then put his hand into his pocket, and said, "What will you take to let me go?"—I said, I must either take him to Turner's, or to the station-house—he then sprang upon me, and caught hold of me by the stock, and I was thrown down several times by him—Clitherow was standing by, and had not spoken—Gossett called to him, "Take his rattle away from him"—I had one in my pocket, but I had not shown it—Clitherow said, "I will not, let the man alone"—Gossett said, "If you won't, you b———, you may <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>, (meaning run,) if he does not let me go, will murder him"—after struggling some time, he struck me a violent blow on the nose, which obliged me to let go of my hold, and he attempted to escape by jumping over a bank out of the garden—he fell down in jumping over, which enabled me to come up with him—I took hold of him by the collar—he struck me several times about the body with his fist, and threw me down—I then got up and drew my staff out of my pocket, defending myself by striking him over the legs and arms, when he attempted to kick or hit me—I had not seen Clitherow from the time Gossett told him to go away, but while I was struggling with Gossett, he came up and took hold of me by the arm with one hand, and hold of my staff with the other—just at that time I heard a rattle spring, and supposing it to be Mr. Drewitt, a schoolmaster on the spot, I called to him to spring it again—I was then thrown down by the two prisoners with great violence, and Gossett commenced kicking me—he kicked me on the hand, and cut my thumb and two fingers—Clitherow then said, "Don't hit him any more, you have hit him enough"—Gossett then kicked me over the right eye—I called out, "Murder"—Gossett said, "You will halloo, will you?" and he then kicked me under the left eye—I then let go of my staff—I believe Gossett had hold of it at that time—he then hit me two violent blows on the head with it, while I was on the ground, and then ran away—in a few minutes I got up and pursued him, and overtook him—I was very close to him, but was so faint from the loss of blood, I was obliged to lean against a bank for support—Gossett seeing me there, turned back, and struck me a violent blow on the nose, which knocked me against the bank, and ran away—three young men met me, and led me part of the way to Mr. Teuish, a surgeon at Ho merton, who examined my wounds—I have never been on duty since—before this, Turner had told me to pay particular attention to his premises, they were so badly protected, not enclosed sufficiently to keep any body out—I saw no more of Gossett till the Monday morning, when he came to where I live, and said, "How came you to raise the report that it was me who ill-used you? I have come to clear myself, I can prove I was in bed and at home by one o'clock, and was not there"—Baker, a policeman, came in at the time to see how I was, and I gave Gossett into custody to him.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 23rd of July, Bowman was brought to my house—I examined him, and found several contused wounds on the head—two parcularly on the back of the head—a contused wound over the right eye, and a contusion under the left eye, but no wound there—that subsequently formed an abscess—two or three fingers of the right hand were lacerated, and the thumb—the body was very much bruised on both sides, but there was no fracture—I should say any man injured in so serious a way was in danger.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of July, I saw the prisoner with others in a craft belonging to Mr. Whellock—they got on the quay, and were walking towards the principal gate, when I saw one of them drunk—I asked the prisoner what he did in the craft?—he said he was employed by Mr. Whellock to watch the craft—I asked what he had to watch—he said, "Cheese"—I took him to the superintendent, who told me to search the craft—I went, and found it contained a case of fourteen bottles of Geneva—there were places for fifteen—I asked the prisoner for the key of the cabin—he gave it to me—I went and searched the cabin, and found an empty bottle, similar to those in the case—there was about a tea spoonful in it—the prisoner said he had broken the case open with another boy, who was with him, intending to take a little to drink, and put the rest back, but the other boy had drank it in his absence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Queen-street, Seven Dials. The prisoner was a stranger to me—he met me on the 6th of August, and solicited charity—he said he was very hungry, and had not eaten any thing that day—I gave him some bread and cheese, and part of a pint of beer, at the Black Horse, Queen-street, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—he laid he wanted a night's lodging—I said I would pay for a bed, or part of one—we went to bed together at half-past nine o'clock—I was awoke in the morning, and the prisoner was gone, in a suspicious way—I looked over the bed, and missed my Blucher boots—I got up, and went and looked after the prisoner, and saw him running in King-street—he had just turned the corner of Queen-street—I called out, "Stop him"—he was stopped by a person, and the constable came to me with my boots—these are my boots.</p>

I was standing at ray door, in Church street, and on the opposite side of the way I saw the prosecutor, likewise the prisoner and another, who was a head taller—the other one lifted the prosecutor's coat tail, and took the handkerchief out of the pocket—he handed it to the prisoner, who put it under the flaps of his coat—the one</p>

               <p>that committed the robbery ran away, but the prisoner walked on to go down Shoreditch—I crossed from my own door, and as he saw I was in the act of seizing him, he took the handkerchief and threw it towards me—it fell on the ground—I took it up, and took the prisoner—I then hallooed after the party who had lost it, and he went to get an officer—this is the handkerchief, as to colour, that I saw taken out of the prosecutor's pocket as he passed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I beg to say, that it really was as I represented—I bought some lavender coming along, of a boy in the street—I came to the shop, and asked for a piece of brown paper, or rather took a piece of paper from the end of the counter, and not finding one piece large enough, I took three different pieces—I laid them on the counter, and put my lavender down on it—I then asked for the box of blondes, and they were put before me—I threw them out carelessly on the counter, to see if there was the pattern I wanted—I threw these two cards on the counter, and it would appear from one of the witnesses that I picked up the lavender and threw it on the blonde—now I do not recollect the circumstance, but it might be so—I rolled the whole up together, but it was by mistake—as to the observation made, the shopman came and asked me to go up stairs with him, which I readily did, and in going up stairs I found I had something in the paper, and I begged him to say nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arbour-square, Commercial-road, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney, or Stebonheath, and am a wharfinger at the West India Dock. On Friday night, the 4th of August, I examined every door, and saw they were fast, at a little before twelve o'clock—I did not fasten the house up myself—I was awoke next morning about half-past five o'clock, and went down stairs about six o'clock—I found the yard door open—I went down stairs, and the back-kitchen door was open—the back kitchen shutters had been forced, and a piece of glass taken from the side of one of the windows—an instrument passed through to remove the latch, and the parties had there made an entry—the front-parlour door was also open, and the kitchen door was forced from within—it had been locked outside—I missed the property stated, which is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not undertake to say positively that it is worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found some phosphorus matches in the parlour—the parlours had been ransacked, and a caddy spoon taken from the tea caddy—I found the top of a lucifer-box in the parlour, and a hat in the yard, with two pieces of candle in it—I lost a hat myself, the crape was taken off it and left there—I found footmarks, but the soil was dry, and they were imperfect—there were also footmarks in Mr. Wright's garden, which is three doors off—I called in two policemen, and gave them the hat—I believe this to be the same.</p>

I was employed by the Superintendent, with Clay, to trace this robbery—Clay produced a hat to me, which I recognised as belonging to the prisoner, who I knew perfectly well—I believe it to be his hat—in consequence of that, and receiving information, I went in pursuit, and found him on Tuesday night, the 8th—I said, "There is suspicion of your having committed a burglary in Arbour-square"—he said he had heard something about it, and he had a great mind to go to the office—I took him to the station-house, and found about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and a new hat on his head—I had never seen him with that on before—the hat that was found on the premises was placed on his head, and he said himself that it fitted him, and it did exactly fit him—we took off his shoes, and went to Mr. Wright's garden, and some adjacent gardens, where marks were left very distinctly in the mould, and in two or three we found one of the shoes particularly corresponded with the marks—there is something particular about the heel of the right shoe—the tip is put on in rather a clumsy way, and leaves the leather projecting beyond the tip, and that made a nook in the mould, exactly fitting that part—the shoe is very wide, and in one footmark the toe touches the leather as well as the sole—there was the print of the sole, and where the upper leather had made an impression in the ground, as the sole was worn—I saw the shoe on his foot, but cannot say it projected then, but it is worn as if it had been on the ground—I have not a doubt this is the shoe which made the impression on the ground—I compared them on Wednesday—I had seen the same marks on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live with my father. I remember on this Thursday being near the Cut—I saw the prisoner there—he went in to swim, and then he came out, about ten minutes before the prosecutor—he went to the prosecutor's trowsers pocket, and took out something that appeared to me like silver, and a Belcher silk handker chief, red and yellow—he put it into his own pocket—there was another with the prisoner that went away—I saw the same sort of handkerchief hanging out of the prisoner's pocket—I told Smith of this—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a yard-man and book-keeper to the East India Dock Company, at the Crutched Friar's tea-warehouse. On the morning of the 27th of July I observed the prisoner Hill in the yard, about eighteen or twenty minutes before nine o'clock—he sat on the iron cannon as the clock was striking nine—about an hour after, he came into the yard the second time, and apparently went up to the counting-house box—he went within about two yards of it, then turned short round to the right, and went in the direction of the tea-chests—they were laid there with a cloth over them—he moved the cloth, and looked, and put his hand into his pocket—there were six of these chests—there were marks on them—by his removing this cloth, it enabled him to see the marks—he was not a stranger there—when a gentleman gave him a chest to clear, he had business there, to take it away—he had been employed there at times, but was not that morning—he left the yard after that—I did not see either of the other prisoners till Sealey came with the order for the teas, about a quarter before one o'clock—Sealey said, "I want six chests for Airey, in Shoreditch," and he handed this paper to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Crutched Friars, 6, 2382, Airey and Co., Shoreditch, cleared yesterday"—that corresponded with the marks on the chests—he had a kind of wine truck, be longing to Harrison, George-yard, Aldgate—I had known him as a labourer—I read the paper, "Airey, Shoreditch"—he said, "Yes, and they are going to the Swan-inn, Whitechapel"—he went away with them when they were loaded in the truck—there was no covering over them—they were only tied with a bit of cord—this was a yard belonging to the East India Dock Company.</p>

               <p>Hill a little after one o'clock in the afternoon, on the 27th of July, talking with Sealey, about two doors from where the teas were stolen, under the French-horn gate-way, that is near the warehouse; and a quarter of an hour afterwards I observed Sealey and Reeves dragging a truck, with six chests of tea on it—the truck had got out of my sight, when I saw Hill running with his coat buttoned, as hard as he could run—the teas had gone up Jewry-street—he turned down John-street, as if to meet it if it turned round—I observed the chests particularly—I took one of the numbers as they passed by—I spoke to Mr. Moule, and in consequence of what he said, I ran off towards Whitechapel—when I got to the Swan Inn, I saw Sealey with six new cords—I asked him what had become of the tea he was dragging along Crutched Friars—he said, "I don't know, they sent me for the cords, and the teas have vanished"—I asked him who employed him—he said they were total strangers to him—I am quite certain I saw him and Hill talking before, and then saw him and Reeves dragging the truck—I know that Sealey and Hill were acquainted—I asked Sealey where was the document by which he got the teas—he pulled out the document produced—I went with him to the corner of the Minories, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Peter Palmer, living at No. 13, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, about a mile and a quarter from Crutched Friars; his place of business is in Haydon-square. On the 27th of July I was there—any body going up John-street would come to Haydon-square—Hill had lent my master a cloth—on this 27th of July, Hill came to Haydon-square about ten minutes past two o'clock in a hurry, and said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>, I want that tilt"—I told him I could not well let him have it then, as I was afraid it might rain—he said he wanted it directly, as he had some furniture to move—upon that I let him have the tilt, and he went off with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the latest hour of clearing teas in the after noon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are various times, according to the different companies—the latest time in Haydon-square, Minories, is not later than twenty minutes past two o'clock—Hill had been in the habit of clearing teas—to the best of my knowledge it was his own tilt—he had lent it to my employer—my master is a little master-carman—I was not cramming the tilt down between some chests to make them steady—it was borrowed to cover over some chests of teas, and in going along from Cutler-street, some of them shook forwards, and some of the tilt shook into the hollow place—Hill did not object to that, that I know of—I cannot positively say whether it had struck two o'clock—if a man had been in the neighbourhood of Jewry-street,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the the son of David Stanley, who lives in the parish of Rotherhithe. On Sunday night, the 13th of August, I came home from work, at two o'clock in the morning, or before two—I found the street door was wide open, and the lower-sash of the window was up—I went in at the door, and I called out, but no answer was given—I called out again, but my father was asleep—I called again, and at last he made an answer, and said he would bring me a light—I then heard a female voice say, "Let me out"—my father came down stairs with a light, (I had shut the door before he came down,) and I saw the prisoner with a shawl on, two caps and a handkerchief—she had her shoes in her hand—I left her with my father, and went for a policeman—I returned in five minutes—she still had the shawl on, and the handkerchief, two caps, and a pair of child's trowsers in her possession—my sleeve-waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers were on the floor—they had been brought down two pair of stairs—and two pictures and a salt-cellar were on a table in the room—I knew the prisoner before, but she never lived in the house—the policeman took her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Jupp, a silversmith and salesman, High-street, Borough. On Saturday, the 24th of June, the prisoner Lyons came into the shop, with a little boy and Scannell—they purchased a suit of clothes for the boy, which came to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Lyons gave me what appeared a £10 Bank of England note—Scannell had very little to do with purchasing the clothes—he said he hoped it was a nice suit, as it was for a motherless child—on looking at the note I saw it was a very old date, and a bad-looking one—I said to Lyons, "How is it this note, bearing the date of 1832, has not been paid into the Bank of England?" and asked her something regarding her possession of it—I could not exactly say what it was, but I was satisfied with her answer, though I forget what the answer was—she did not ask me any questions—she gave the address Mary Lyons, and said she lived at No. 7, Cornwall-road, Blackfriar's-road—I wrote that on the face of the note—I have since been there, and found no such person living there; and I inquired at No. 7, Cornwall-place, and no such person had ever lived there—the note has been since sent to the Bank of England.</p>

In consequence of information, I went, betweeen nine and ten o'clock on Monday night, the 14th, to the house where White lives with his father, in Chesterton-street, Kennington, and saw him—I asked him if he knew any thing about the robbery over the road—he at first said no—I asked if he had pawned any thing—he said, "Yes, a piece of linen"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "From young Pownall, and pawned it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Mr. Philmer's"—I said, "Is that all you have pawned to-day?"—he said, "No, I pawned a pair of ear-rings"—I said, "Is that all?"—he said, "Yes, that is all I pawned, but Pownall has pawned a watch at the same place that I pawned the ear-rings"—I went and took Pownall, and he denied all knowledge of it—I fetched White to him, and directly he saw him he acknowledged that he had stolen the property, and pawned it; he said that he got in through the tiles, and he gave it to White to pledge—he said at first that he walked through the passage, and went up at the time the prosecutor was at break fast; but afterwards he said he got out of his father's house, which is next door, into the prosecutor's through the tiles, and that he cut seven yards of linen off in his father's room, and sent it to be pawned for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by White—at the station-house he said there was a piece of linen concealed in his father's loft—I went and searched the loft, and found this linen con cealed behind a large piece of mahogany.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker. I saw a fight take place between the deceased and the prisoner, at Lambeth—they fought about two rounds—the first blow was struck by the prisoner—at the commencement of the second round I saw the prisoner strike the deceased on the left side of his head—the deceased continued to fight after that blow—after it was over I observed him looking for his hat—he was standing by me, and I thought he was coming towards me, but he tumbled and fell, and pitched into the kennel on his knee—he did not speak after that, but merely gave a deep sigh—his head did not come in contact with the ground when he fell then—they had been down together in the scuffle—he had been down twice, but was not knocked down; it was struggling in the fight—they were both down together—no blow was struck on either side after the fight had ceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Cornwall-road. On the evening of the 14th of August, I was called to see the deceased—I found him sitting on the curb-stone, with thirty or forty people round him, supported by a policeman and others—I directed him to be taken to the nearest house—I felt his pulse and found it was fluttering—he was not able to speak to me—when I saw him in t. he house he appeared dead—I attempted to bleed him in the left arm—I obtained about half a drachm but could get no more—I did what I could to restore him, but could not—I examined him and could find no 1 external injury at all to account for death—I subsequently examined the body—on removing the scalp, I found no injury internal or external—I took off the cranium, and at the back part of the head there was upwards of an ounce of extravasated blood pressing on the brain, arising from the rupture of a vessel—that effusion was sufficient to account for death—that might have been caused by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140190"/>
               <p>excitement, or any external injury, creating an impetus to the blood and forcing an extra rush—it might be occasioned by any additional exertion on his part, or by a blow or fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you knew nothing of him before, to lead you to suppose he was a subject of apoplexy, and saw him fighting, and afterwards drop down dead, should not you naturally attribute it to the effect of fighting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless I saw certain appearances—he was a heavy man and a complete subject for apoplexy—I think it might be produced by excitement on his own part without blows—it might easily be caused by excitement, if the extravasation of blood had taken place in his falling, ten minutes afterwards would be much about the time the effusion would take place after the blow was struck—it would not take twenty minutes for the effect to be developed—it depends on how fast the extravasation took place—sometimes apoplexy comes on slow—excitement might have caused it equally the same as blows—I found the blood on the posterior part of the brain, in such a situation as a blow might be given by a person behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It must be an exceeding hard blow with a fist in such a place to produce that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why the man was an exceeding likely subject for apoplexy—vessels so full of blood might easily be ruptured by concussion alone—I think it impossible to distinguish whether his death was caused by excitement, or irritation, or blows—I should be sorry to decide that point.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Church-terrace, Waterloo road. I saw the prisoner and deceased in the act of closing at the end of the fight—I afterwards saw the deceased looking for his hat—while he was doing so the prisoner struck him unawares at the back of his head—he had left off fighting then, and was inquiring for his hat—the blow caused him to go into the road—he being a much stronger man than the prisoner was able to put the prisoner under him—he staggered from the blow but did not fall—he caught the prisoner by the collar afterwards—I am sure they had done fighting when the blow was given—the deceased expressed that he did not wish to fight, but to keep the prisoner there to give him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to state that there was no fighting after the blow was struck on the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no fighting after—there were only two rounds—there was no other man who threw the deceased. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there no man that you pointed out as having pushed the deceased into the kennel when he fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a man—that was not the prisoner—that man was not fighting with the deceased—the deceased just rolled over—the deceased remained five or ten minutes after it was over before he fell—it was not so much as twenty minutes—the policeman desired him to go away—the policeman asked the landlord to give him into custody for making a disturbance and insisting on staying there—the deceased refused to go as he was waiting for his hat—he said he was waiting for a <hi rend="italic">wonder</hi>, and it would be a wonder if he got his hat again—this conversation was about ten minutes after he had received the blow from the prisoner—he stood against the left-hand door post of the beer shop.</p>
