            . I am a constable. On the 9th of October, between twelve and one in the morning, two of our parroles brought the two prisoners to the watch house, together with the things mentioned in the indictment; Mitchel said they were his property; that he was removing them from his apartments, in St. John's Palace, Tottenham Court road, because there was a writ against him. Carter said he was his brother, and was assisting him, and said that he was going upon duty, and desired me to let him go, which I did; the justice believed what Mitchel said, and ordered me to keep the goods till the landlord was satisfied and so Mitchel was discharged. He came again the same day with a man that took upon, him the character of his landlord. I observed that the man appeared a good deal confused. I sent him and Mitchel, with the beadle, to the watch house, to look at the goods; I saw no more of that man, but Mitchel came back by himself. I went with him to go to his apartments, in St. John's palace; when we come to the fields he refused to go on; he desired me to wait for him, and he promised me he would return again, which he did. I took him to Mr. Welch's; I told him that I must detain him, for I had heard that he had broke open a house; then he said that his brother broke open the house, and that he assisted him. He went with me to take

               <p>Guitano Menini. I was going to Mount's coffee-house on Friday at eight o'clock; I was <placeName id="t17711023-12-crimeloc58">near Lord Hertford's house</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see any of their faces?</p>
               <p>Menini. No. I knew the voice of him that held my back to be Murray's; I said so before the Justice; I believe it to be the voice, I can't be certain. I never got any of my things again; there were some pieces of gold produced before Justice Welch, (the pieces of gold produced by Hawthorn the constable.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the gold of my ring, I am certain from the particular make; I know nothing of the other prisoner.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I and Fotterel, not yet taken, went out on Friday night the 11th of this month; we met at the Eagle in Eagle-street, Red Lyon-square, we went there about four or five o'clock in the evening; Murray and Freel and I went there, and Fotterel met us there: we staid till near six o'clock; we committed two robberies before we had done this Frenchman; we went up towards Marybone, we committed a robbery there; we went then to Oxford-road, and from thence to Hanover-square; we met a gentleman and robbed him there; then we went to another square I don't know the name of; as we were walking along we saw this gentleman, we resolved to attack him; this was about eight o'clock, or might be a little after; he was walking along; there was but one pistol, Freel had it; he walked before him, (we were behind him at first) and he stopped him; he held the pistol to him, and bid him stand and deliver; the old gentleman made a sort of a tussle, and Murray laid hold of him behind and pinioned his arms; he bid him whist, that is hold his tongue, or he would kill him; we could not get the money out of his pockets cleverly, and Fotterel cut the watch out of his pocket with a knife; Freel took hold of his little finger, put it in his mouth, and bit the ring off his finger; when he could get no more, Freel struck him with the pistol in his mouth. I can't tell, whether they took any money, if they got any they did not let me have any share of it. I helped to hold him, I had hold of him by the breast; then we left him and went towards our lodging in Spitalfields. I am a carver by trade; we went to a lodging-house there; we lay there till the next morning. Freel kept the watch till the Sunday morning following and the ring; Freel and I sold the watch on Sunday, with a gold one, to one Saunders a Jew, we got eight guineas for them both together; we divided it between us, two guineas a-piece; I had the ring because they esteemed me the genteelest among them; they asked me to go and sell it, which I agreed to do; Freel gave it me on the Monday, it was a gold ring with a stone with the impression of a head, it was broke in two or three pieces, the stone was out of the socket, I broke it into another piece I think, I went and sold it to a goldsmith in the Borough, I sold it the day he gave it me, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that silversmith here?</p>

I was at the ng of the prisoners and Delaney, at the Eagle in Eagle-street; I found them all together; Freel had two pistols in his pocket, one of them was charged, and Murray had one; I don't remember that Delaney had any thing in his pocket; there were some false keys taken out of one of their pockets, I don't remember whose.</p>

               <p>Murray's Defence.</p>
               <p>The gentleman swares that this watch was taken out of his pocket, the evidence swares it was cut out of his pocket. I was never acquainted with Delaney in my life; I am a silk-weaver by trade, I was just come to town to seek for business.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about the matter. Delaney owned before the justice that, the picklocks were found upon him; I have worked as a labourer to a bricklayer, and his business is of such a sort that he is obliged to be running about all day, so that he could not come here</p>

             came into my house on the 2d of October, between eight and nine at night, along with two fiddles; Murray pretended to be very drunk; they came with the fiddle playing down the court where I live. They danced in the house, and rapped all their hands on the table together to make a noise; they called for liquor to the amount of two shillings and three pence as fast as I could serve them. Rose Keefe came in a little after the music began, she sat down a little while, then she went out, she came back again, and then she went out a second time, then she gave a loud cough at the door, and they all went away except one young man, he staid behind and called for a pot of beer, I don't believe he knew any thing of their design. Murray seemed very sober, I went up stairs and found my bed-chamber door up one pair of stairs broke open, and my bureau which was in that room broke open; I missed upwards of twelve pounds, there were five drawers missing out of the bureau, I found one of the drawers afterwards, as I was shutting my window at the back of my house; there was I believe upwards of two pounds worth of good halfpence, and they took two pounds of bad halfpence; I lost a table-spoon and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.) I had been up stairs about five o'clock, when I changed the six and nine-pence for a customer. Keefe lodges in my house, upon the same floor as my room that was broke open; Keefe went about, pretending to shew us where the people lived, and she led us wrong; I found nothing again but one guinea and one halfpenny, which I can swear to; they were found in one Mrs. Smith's pocket, who is mother-in-law to Delaney.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. So the man that came in drunk, went away sober?</p>
               <p>Ferquharson. Yes; he went away sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What, he got sober by drinking more liquor?</p>
               <p>Ferquharson. I believe he only shammed drunk when he came in, for he soon appeared to be sober.</p>

            . I found three drawers and a parcel of bad halfpence near Mr. Hammond's brewhouse in Long-acre, on Thursday morning, the morning after the robbery, between three and four o'clock, (the drawers produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Richard Delaney. Freel's wife and Keefe came to my lodgings about a week before the fact was committed, and said they had a secret to impart to me; that Ferquharson had two or three hundred pounds, and they intended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230010"/> to rob him, for if they could get it, it would be the making of them; he said Mrs. Keefe lived on the same floor opposite Ferquharson's room; they said they intended to do it that night, we were disappointed, and so we fixed on the Wednesday following. Freel's wife came up to my room about five in the afternoon, and told me they would get a fiddle in the house, and said that while they were dancing below, the door might be broke open above. I went to the place where her husband lodged, I met with

Murray, Freel, and his wife, Fotterel, and me and my wife, went to the Boot near the Foundling Hospital. where we divided the money; Murray was to have had a guinea, but he had only fifteen or sixteen shillings; Freel and I sold the silver spoon to a Jew, and Freel's wife had the buckle to sell; she said she sold it for eight shillings; I had one guinea and Freel another; I took no particular notice of the guinea, but put it among more money that I had in my pocket; I afterwards gave a guinea and my watch to my wife's mother,

            . I am wife of the last witness; my husband told me Mrs. Freel wanted to speak with me; I went to her; she asked me to go and drink with her at Ferquharson's, I went with her, I think the music was there before I came in; Keefe was there only part of the time; Mrs. Freel came down at last and bid them go home, upon which they all went away. I knew nothing at that time of what was doing above stairs. I went to my room: there was my husband, Freel and his wife, and Fotterel; they shuffled about; I was frightened, I suspected there was something wrong among them; I asked my husband what he was going there for with his Irish and, I said I supposed he was going to have us all hanged; my husband upon that struck me several times, and I was obliged to go down stairs. Murray did not go up stairs, he was standing at the door; they came down after they had been up stairs some time; we walked all away together, and we walked about all night.</p>
               <p>Q. from Murray. Did not you lie that night in Jackson-alley?</p>

               <p>I had no notion that any thing of this kind was forward; I came from Ireland that very day; I am a silk weaver, the business is dead there, and so I came here to seek work. I had a letter for Freel's wife, she asked me to go and drink with her at Ferquharson's; I was in liquor; I wanted Ferquharson to let me have a lodging, but he could not; Freel promised to get me a lodging; she took me to her house, the door being shut, she took me from thence to Delaney's, we could get no lodging there, so we walked about the greatest part of the night; at last I got to a house somewhere in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230011"/> an alley, where I got to bed for two hours; I went away in the morning, and saw no more of them.</p>

               <p>- Wilkins. I am a shoemaker in Leaden-hall-street, On Saturday the 6th of July the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of boots and two pair of shoes; he gave me this bill of 8 l. (producing it) and desired me to give him the difference. I looked over the bill, and saw it was accepted; and as it had but a few days to run, I gave him 6 l. 7 s. which was the difference. I sent the bill to my banker, and their clerk received the money for it, the day it was due, of Mr. Russel's partner, on the Monday following, and Mr. Russel and hi-partner came to me, and told me it was a forged bill, and desired to know whom I had of. I told them I had it of Donaldson, one of the <rs id="t17711023-15-deflabel74" type="occupation">clerks at St. Thomas's Hospital</rs>

               <p>Q. Has there never been any transaction between the prisoner and you?</p>
               <p>Russell. No; I never remembered having seen him till before the Justice; then I supposed I must have seen him at the hospital. I know nothing of the drawer; it is all a mere fiction.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not paid by your partner?</p>
               <p>Russell. My partner, as I am informed, was sitting at a desk; the banker's clerk brought the bill, and he laid out the money for it; mine is all home trade; I never had a bill drawn upon me in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You live near St. Thomas's Hospital?</p>

               <p>Court. Does it resemble your hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Russell. The flourish is the contrary way to what I write my name.</p>

               <p>I went to see Mr. Astley ride at his school at Westminster-bridge, about the latter end of last June; about eight o'clock, when the riding was over, I went to the New-Inn; I went into a room, in which a gentleman was drinking punch; I sat down and called for six penny-worth of punch: in about ten minutes a third person came in, and called for something: we entered into conversation together: he understood that I lived in the Borough; he asked me if I knew one Mr. Russell : I told him, yes; he said he was going into Yorkshire; that he had received a bill of 8 l. at Greenwich, which he would be obliged to me to discount, if it suited me. I saw it wanted but a fortnight of being due. From the address of the man, and its being so small a sum, and seeing the name of Mr. Russell to it, I had no doubt about it; and I readily gave him cash for it, upon the receiving two shillings for the discount: he indorsed it in the name of

            . I am a waiter at the Antigallican coffee-house in Threadneedle-street, I was at the New Inn, at the foot of Westminster-bridge: I lived servant there with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230013"/> Mr. Hopkins, from the 20th of May till about the 14th of August: the prisoner used our house; he used frequently to be in company with gentlemen at our house, after the riding was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being there, and there being any thing pass about a note?</p>
               <p>Williams. I remember, at the latter end of July, two gentlemen were in the room with Mr. Donaldson; one of them was dressed in blue and gold: he desired me to go and get change for a guinea, which I did. Mr. Donaldson has told me since that he gave that gentleman cash for a note of 8 l.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller, and live at Hammersmith. I have seen Mr. Donaldson several times, and have drank with him. I was in company with him at Astley's riding school: from thence I went with him to the public house, and there I saw some money with regard to a note. I was a little how come you so, I believe; it was for eight guineas. There was a gentleman there in white, and another in blue clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what the money was paid for?</p>
               <p>Berresford. I believe something in regard to a note; and I believe there was a bottle of wine given by the prisoner; but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams there?</p>
               <p>Berresford. I believe he might be.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. Did you see this man there?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe he was in the room at that time: I have seen him there before.</p>

               <p>I am wife to Leppenwell. I went to his master's shop for a couple of loaves; I had some loaves, but I was not out of the shop. He was indebted to my husband thirteen shillings. My first husband's name was John Hall; after he died I married Leppenwell.</p>

               <p>Drummond. No; he was paid every Saturday. He lost a great quantity of bread the Saturday before, and therefore I did not pay him; I paid him the preceding Saturday. She is not the wife of Leppenwell.</p>

I said pray let it stand, it will do no harm. He went into the back room again, I saw him take the kettle off, and then he went towards the beaufet; I saw him put his hand to his pocket, but I did not see what he took. He came out in about a minute; the other man paid for his stockings, and they both went away. I went to the beaufet and missed the the spoon immediately; I had just wiped the spoon and put it in the beaufet before I went to serve them. (the spoon produced and deposed to.) I went immediately into the street and alarmed the neighbourhood; the prisoner was taken and brought into my house; we were going to search him, but the prisoner pulled out the spoon and gave it to me; he desired we would let him go.</p>

The prisoner led me across a field, first to the Foundling Hospital; then he went to Bagnigge Wells; the prisoner staid half an hour there, playing at nine pins, I waited all the time with the handkerchiefs under my arm; the prisoner bid me go into the house and get some biscuits, and he said he would hold the bundle the while: I would not give it him: as I turned round from him, to fetch the biscuits, the prisoner snatched at the bundle; but I kept it fast; he kept me till almost dark; then the prisoner went across the fields towards Smithfield, as I understand; at last I got near some water works; the prisoner seemed surprized, and said he had lost his gloves, and he believed they were tied up in the top of the parcel; he opened it, but the gloves were not there; then he ran away with the parcel as fast as he could. I ran after him, but he out-ran me; so I lost him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230016"/> I went home between seven and eight o'clock, and then I heard that the prisoner was in custody at Justice Lane's, and saw the prisoner and the handkerchiefs.</p>

About seven in the evening Mr. Bonner, a g in Oxford-road, sent for me, and informed me he had taken up a man for a fraud upon him, who he understood had robbed me, and that the man was before Justice Lane. I w Justice Lane, and there I found the prisoner had my handkerchiefs.

The prisoner came into our shop on the 11th of October, at about seven at night; he cheapened a great many stockings; he asked the price of one pair of stockings, I told him four shillings and six-pence; he said very well, and gave them to a man in company with him, who ran away; I pursued him, but he got quite away.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prosecutor. Had not I six shillings and six-pence in my pocket?</p>

I put them out of my cart at the end of the lane, and went to put my horses into the stable; I met the prisoner rolling the hogshead by my master's door, about forty yards from where I had left it. I pursued him; when he saw me, he run away; I got up to him and secured him; he desired I would let him go, and he would roll the hogshead back again and treat me with some beer.

               <p>Jane Ford. I am servant to Mr. Roberts. I have seen the prisoner several times on the wharf. I was standing on the wharf on Sunday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner with a large bundle under his left arm, wrapped in a blue coat the sleeve of which hung down; he was, when I saw him, about fifty yards from Mr. Warcup's house; I could not see his house where I stood; if I had been about ten yards further, I should have been in sight of the prosecutor's house. The prisoner, when I saw him, appeared as if coming from Mr. Warcup's house; this was while the family was at church. I had stood there about ten minutes before I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person there?</p>
               <p>Ford. No; I saw no other person whatever. Mr. Warcup came home between seven and eight o'clock; he came to my master's, and called for a candle, and said his door was broke open: I went with him, and I saw that the staple was forced out, and the padlock was gone. Mr. Warcup said a blue-coat was go; then I mentioned to him that I had seen the prisoner go out of the yard with a bundle wrapped up in a blue coat. I saw the prisoner that evening at the Hat and Feathers; and I am sure he is the same man that I saw with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Gastleton. I keep the White Hart in Goodman's Fields; the prisoner and another man came to my house on the 29th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner had a bundle upon his arm, with a blue coat upwards; he laid them down on the table in the tap-room; they sat and drank about half an hour, and they had a piece of beef, about pound or a pound and an half, on the table before them: the prisoner desired me to take care of the things till the next day. when he would call for them : he said that his wife and he had had some words, and he had brought some of his own things, and a few of her's: he gave them me: then he said there was a gentleman that lived in the neighbourhood, who would lend him a guinea, but he was not at home, and asked me to lend him 6 s. which I did, and he said he would bring me the money in the morning, and would take the things away. When Mr. Warcup came with the prisoner, I asked him if the goods, were stolen he said, No; it was only a little quarrel. One of the gentlemen said, No, don't deceive any one; they are stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you say it was only a quarrel?</p>
               <p>Warcup. I did say so as the prisoner desired I would not expose him.</p>

I took the bundle and carried it up Milford Lane: the man staid about five minutes, and then followed me: he came up the same way  - I did the things fell at the upper end of the lane; he tied them up again, and he took a neck cloth out of the bundle, and gave it me, and bid me tie it about my neck. I carried the bundle for him to Whitechapel; when I came there, he asked me if I knew any house where the bundle could be left; I mentioned the White Hart; we took the things there, and asked the woman to let us leave them there for a few shillings till the next morning, which she agreed to: it was that man that pulled out the beef that was upon the table, and he gave me two shillings and the neckcloth. Is it not likely that I should go at noon, and break open a house in my own neighbourhood, where I had been working so long. </p>

Upon the prisoner's shoving Snoakes in that manner, Snoakes struck him on the head on face; the prisoner returned the blow, and then passed about three blows between them. Reynolds, the man that waters the horses, came in much about this time; he endeavoured to keep order, and he bid the prisoner go about his business, or he would charge the watch with him; upon that, the prisoner and the two woman went away. I could not see the prisoner go out at the door, as I stood at the bar but I suppose he did not go out, Snoakes staid talking to me; he complained that the prisoner had broke his whip. In about two minutes after the prisoner was gone, Snoakes left the bar, and went out, as I thought to go home in about two minutes, Snoakes came into the house again, and said he was stabbed, and that he had received his death's wound from the foreigner; he took off his coat, and I noticed that the back of his shirt was bloody and I saw the wound between his shoulders. A surgeon was sent for, who came in a few minutes; before the surgeon came, Reynolds and Styles brought the prisoner back into the house.</p>

            . I stopt at the coach and horses between twelve and one that night to water my horses. I saw the prisoner, the deceased, and two women standing by the side of the bar; the prisoner and Snoakes were disputing about the farthing; Snoakes said nothing more than this; why don't you pay my mistress the farthing, he might, perhaps, call him dirty fellow; the prisoner said I have no money and will pay no more; he then offered to go towards the door, and Snoakes stood at the door, and he lifted up his elbow, as if he meant to prevent the prisoner's going out, without paying the farthing: the prisoner, upon this, struggled with Snoakes to get out of the house, and in the struggle Snoakes's whip was broke; Snoakes said I am sorry you have broke my whip, for I have had it two or three years; immediately upon that, Snoakes struck the prisoner a blow on the side of his head, over his eye, so that some blood ran down his cheek; the prisoner returned it, by giving him a punch on the belly, which would have knocked him down the cellar, but he caught hold of the cellar door, which is about three yards from the street door. At this time Reynolds came in, and asked what the disturbance was about, and he told them that if they did not go out of the house he would charge the watch with them; upon that, the two girls said that the prisoner was a substantial man, and lived next door to the Crown, on the other side of the bridge. He laid hold of his arm and led him: out of doors; Snoakes staid at the bar with me a minute or two: I asked him if he would go home, he said he would; we both went out together, both our coaches were at the door. I was getting up upon the box, and as Snoakes was about getting upon his box, I heard a voice, which appeared to be the prisoner's, calling out, come here, and I will pay you for your whip. I looked and saw the prisoner and the two girls about twelve or fourteen yards from the door of the Coach and Horses, crossing Palace Yard, in the direction to the passage that goes in to Bridge street; so that he was standing in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230023"/> middle of Palace Yard. I cannot pretend to say whether the prisoner and the two women were standing still or walking, when I heard the voice: we had not been out of the house above two or three minutes, before I heard the voice call out: Snoakes went directly up to the prisoner, upon hearing the voice, and said to the prisoner, what do you want with me: I saw the deceased go up to the prisoner, and as soon as he came up to him, immediately one of them fell; I could not at that time tell which it was, and immediately I saw the other run away: I saw no blows pass. I observed the women left the prisoner before the deceased got up to him. Presently the man that fell got up again, and it appeared afterwards to be Snoakes. I walked towards him, and he said for God's sake stop him, for he has stabbed me: he was holding both his hands upon his breast. Styles and I run after the prisoner; I saw him run out at the corner, towards Westminster-bridge. I called out stop thief; Reynolds ran through the passage that goes into Bridge street; Reynolds and Styles had stopped him in Bridge street, near the end of that passage, before I came up; I collared him, and we brought him back to the Coach and Horses: he was loath to go into the house; as he was going into the house the deceased met him with his hands upon his breast, and said he was a dead man; a surgeon was sent for, and he came directly. I went away and left them all in the house; I came back again in about ten minutes; then I saw the surgeon had just dressed him, and put a blister on him; I did not see the wound at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the deceased fall after the prisoner got up to him?</p>
               <p>Twine. He fell the moment the prisoner got up to him.</p>

            . I am the watering man. I was not in the house when the prisoner and Snoakes went into the Coach and Horses. I heard the prisoner and Snoakes have words together, so I went into the house, to put an end to the disturbance. I bid them all go about their business, or I would charge the watch with them. I took the prisoner by the arm, and led him out of the house. I did not see any blows pass in the house; Snoakes staid about two minutes after the prisoner was gone out, and then he gave me a penny, and bid me good night. He was just putting his foot upon the wheel, in order to get upon the box, when I heard a voice call out, come here, and I will pay you for your whip. Snoakes got down and went forward to where the voice came from, at that time I observed a man and two women standing in Palace Yard, about twelve or fourteen yards from Snoakes's coach; they were standing still, and as Snoakes got up to him the women went away; the horses interposed, so that I could not not see him when he got close to the prisoner; but within two minutes, from the time of his leaving the coach, in order to go up to the man, I saw Snoakes returning, holding his hand upon his breast, and calling out to stop the man, for he had received his death's wound; at the same time I saw the man running away. Twine and Styles ran to the corner of the yard after him; I ran through the passage into Bridge street; as soon as I got into Bridge street I saw the prisoner walking along, and Styles was close behind him; he laid hold of him, presently after I joined him, and we took him to the Coach and Horses; there we found Snoakes. I searched the prisoner, and found only some brass work about him . The deceased said I am bleeding to death, and he said you are a villain, pointing to the prisoner; and he said that if he had broke his leg or his arm, he could have forgiven him, but now it would deprive his family of his assistance, if his life was to go; and he said that the prisoner was the man that wounded him; the prisoner was by when he said this, and made no answer to it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner a wound in his face before he went out of the house?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. There was a cut over his eye as if it had been done with a knuckle; three days afterwards I saw the prisoner, and he had a black eye; the prisoner was searched at the watch-house; and there was a knife found upon him.</p>

            . I went into the yard a little before one o'clock; I bid the waterman water my horses; I stood by to see it done; I heard a disturbance in the house; I did not go in directly; presently I saw the prisoner come out and the two women; I walked, I believe, ten or twenty yards from the Coach and Horses. door, towards the passage that goes into Bridge-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230024"/> presently I saw the coachman come out, grumbling about his whip; he was going towards the passage that leads to Bridge street, the two women left him, and then I saw him turn round and stop, with his face towards the Coach and Horses: the prisoner had turned about before Snoakes came out of the house.</p>

             put his foot upon the wheel, in order to get upon his box to go home. I was going to do the same. I heard the prisoner call out, come here, and I will pay you for your whip.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Styles. There was no other man in the yard as I could see; the deceased walked to him; one of them dropt immediately as he came up to him; I could not see which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased all the way till he came up to him?</p>
               <p>Styles. Yes; quite close to him, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether Snoakes turned about, or had his back towards you or the man?</p>
               <p>Styles. I will not pretend to say that; I obobserved one fall the moment Snoakes came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you tell whether it was the man that stood still, or he that walked up to him, that fell?</p>
               <p>Styles. They both stood still, and then one immediately fell. I heard Snoakes then cry out (for I knew it was his voice) Stop him, for God's sake, for he has stabbed me with a knife. I immediately ran after the prisoner, to the farther end of Palace-yard. He crawled up that high part, and ran towards the Bridge. I struck a blow at him, but I missed him; then I seized him by the collar: he was stronger than me, and made from me; then I got hold of him again, and then Twine and Reynolds came up and laid hold of him: we took him to the Coach and Horses: he was not willing to go into the house; Twine pulled him in, and Snoakes met him at the door, with his hands to his breast; and he said to the prisoner, O you bloody minded man! you have murdered me! blood for blood! We had a hard matter to keep him from the prisoner, as he wanted to attack him. The prisoner made no answer to that, but looked very sulky: he never spoke a word to me. The watchmen took him to the watch-house. I went there soon afterwards. I saw Mr.

            . I was constable of the night; on the 7th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, Twine, Reynolds, and a watchman or two, brought the prisoner into the watch-house: as soon as he came in, he sat down, very sulky: Mr. Twine had a shirt in his hand, all over bloody, and he said the prisoner had murdered Snoakes. I searched him as he sat, and took this knife out of his right breeches pocket; it was shut, and all over blood for about two inches and an half high.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it fresh blood, or had it been there some time?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was rather dry; it had a shining colour, and looked quite fresh. I could hardly get him to tell his name.

            . I am the deceased's widow. The first night he came home he was not sensible; he desired me a few days afterwards not to wash his shirt; he said that no blows had ensued at the time the accident happened: he was sensible when he said this and was so for about a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he sensible when he said that no blow passed at the time he received the wound?</p>
               <p>Snoakes. Yes; he said that about four days before he died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jessamin. I was called to the deceased on the 7th of September, about one in the morning;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230025"/> when the person came for me, I was not gone to bed. I cedded to see the wound; upon drawing up his shirt, I found a wound a full inch in length passing from the right side of the spine, evidently made with a cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean a pointed as well as cutting instrument?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. It is hardly possible to say, because of the breadth of the wound. The wound passed across from the right side to the left, where it went in to a considerable depth I found it necessary to dilate it, which I did immediately, in order, if possible, to discover the nature of the injury; with my finger I felt the rib bare at the bottom of the wound; there was a prodigious quantity of blood flowing from the wound; from which circumstances, and the depth of the wound. I judged that it might have penetrated the cavity of the chest. I could not be certain of this point at that time. I desired to see the instrument with which the wound was inflicted, as I might form some prognostic from that; but it could not be produced at that time. I saw the deceased again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any cut in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. There was a cut in his coat and waistcoat corresponding to the wound. I attended him regularly, and finding his pulse raged, I continued to bleed him and keep him low. I imagined there was mischief within. In the course of this treatment, I separated some splinters of bone that I found loose in the wound. On the Friday after he received the wound, bad symptoms increased very fast upon him. Imagining there was a wound in the lungs, I desired a physician might be called in, and Dr. Morris attended him: he grew worse, and died on Tuesday the 17th of September. I opened the body after his decease, in the presence of Dr. Morris, and several pupils belonging to my hospital. On opening the cavity of the chest on that side where the wound was received, the plura, or membrane that lines the chest, was full of dusky inflammation; bordering upon what we call gangrene. I raised up the lungs, and perceived at the back part of the thorax a wound entering in and passing the membrane of the plura; and upon the superior lobe of the lungs, on the left side, there was a small wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your opinion that this wound was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. In my opinion it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think such a knife as that might have occasioned the wound?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form an idea what situation the body was in when it received the wound?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Could such a wound be made if the parties were standing face to face?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. I should imagine it very difficult, if the person's back was not turned. I think it most likely that the deceased's back was turned when the wound was given; it must be a very tall man else to inflict the wound in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased taller or shorter than the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. I believe about the same size.</p>
               <p>[Note, the prisoner was rather short.]</p>
               <p>Q In what condition was he as to his understanding?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. His understanding was sufficiently free, till within three days of his death.</p>

               <p>I went from home to Chiswell-street, Moorfields, to Alexander's foundery, and fetched some brass, which I was to use for Mr. Cox's work in Shoe-lane.

I had a pair of leather breeches I had fetched from cleaning; when I came to the corner of Parliament-street, with my bundle in my hand, two girls came to me and asked me to give them something to drink. I agreed to it, and they took me to the Coach and Horses; they had a glass of something; I had a farthing too little for the reckoning; I told the landlady, when I came that way again I would make her a recompence; she seemed very agreeable; when I turned about there was the coachman leant against the wainscot opposite the bar; he called me names, and said, How dare you come here to treat girls, and have no money? and things to that purpose. I said, What is that to you? He gave me a blow directly, and the blood burst over my clothes; the blood is now upon my coat and waistcoat, and the fear is in my face; the girls cried out, The gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230026"/> is used ill; Go out, and take the number of his coach; he prevented my going out; I got out at last; they said I broke his whip in getting out; I don't know whether I did or not. When I came to the coach, I could not see the number, it was so dark, and I bled so. I went from the coach, he halloo'd after me, and said I was a thief, that I was robbing his coach. I went from the coach as fast as I could; I thought I was among strange people, and had no friend with me; therefore I thought I was in danger of being ten times more beaten, so I ran away from the coach, about the distance of fifteen or twenty yards; the girls left me, the deceased came up to me, and I was afraid of him; he gave me a blow upon my breast and broke my rib, any body may feel now that my rib is broke; he broke my rib with his right hand, and he struck me at the same time on my eye with his left hand. I told him he should not use me ill; that I would stand upon my defence. After I had received that unmerciful blow upon my rib - I don't know how it happened; it was dark, and my eyes were blinded up. I had the knife, and I don't know how it happened; after that, he caught me and brought me into the public house, and there he took from me ha I had, except the bit of beef; he threw that, as if for the dog, upon the table; then they carried me to the watch-house, and locked me up. I was used in a barbarous manner. Here is a person come here by accident, and he saw how I looked. My head was beat about just like a sheep's head that comes out of a butcher's shop.</p>

            . I am an organ-builder, and live in Compton-street, Soho; I saw the prisoner the Sunday after the affair happened; his eyes appeared very black; I tried with my hand, and felt one of his ribs deeper than the rest; I did not see his body, I only felt. I have known him eleven or twelve years, I never heard of any complaint in his ribs before this. He has the character of a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. If your Lordship pleases Mr. Jessamin shall examine the prisoner's ribs. (Mr. Jessamin examines the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Jessamin. There is an inequality that there should not be.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his rib broke?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. Probably it may have been; it is almost impossible to say that: I believe it has.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how recently it may have been broke?</p>
               <p>Jessamin. When once the ribs are united it is impossible to say that; it is impossible to say whether it has been broke a month or a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that if it had been broke by a blow at that time, it might have been in the state it now is?</p>
               <p>Jessamins. It might.</p>

I rode about five or six hundred yards after he had passed me; as I was riding down a hill I drew up my horse, then the prisoner rid across me, caught hold of the horse's bridle, presented a large pistol to me, and demanded my money; I said he should have what I had; he said be quick; I gave him nine shilling and four-pennyworth of half-pence; he said I had got more, I said I had not: during this conversation I had an opportunity of observing the prisoner's countenance. I observed he had a little cast in one of his eyes; he said I had more money; I told him I had no arms about me, and he might search me if he chose it. I asked him for some money to pay the turnpike, he refused to give me any. He rode off towards Barnet, and I came forward for London.

            , or order, one pound seventeen shillings for value received, the 16th of June 1770." The date is not to it now, it was by accident burnt off; that note was left on the table, and my own pocket book; so finding I could neither get the money nor the hanger, I took up my pocket book, and put it into my pocket; they wanted me to take a note for three days; I would not, I threw it at them and run away home. I would have took them up if I had had a constable. I went again on Monday; I saw two women there, they said they knew not the persons. About a month or six weeks after I found the prisoner at a horse ride, in Moor lane, Fore street; there I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the name burnt off this note, which the prisoner left you, at the time he left the hanger?</p>
               <p>Bryant. It happened by accident, since the time I lost the hanger, it fell into the ashes. I found this note and the note which Harris pretended to give me, by way of security, for the debt, which I totally refused; I don't know how I came by it, unless they thrust it into my pocket book while on the table; it was burnt by falling in the ashes; I never received it as a security; nor did I know what the prisoner wrote on the paper. I would not give any credit to him, not knowing him; I only gave him credit because of the hanger, which was worth the money. The prisoner agreed, when he left the hanger, if he did not come in two or three days, I might sell it. I refused to take Harris's note, to deliver up the hanger, on receiving Harris's security; I did not agree to it. The day I took the prisoner, I met him first at the end of Silver street, near my house, between three and four o'clock. I said, sir, I think you did not use me well, taking my hanger and not giving me my money, the prisoner said did not that man pay you, and seemed surprized; I said no; I went to the house, two women said they neither knew you nor Harris. I asked him where he lived, and how to come by my property; he took out his pocket book and offered me another note of ten pound, drawn on one Wilson; he said if I would change that he would pay me; I knew Wilson not to be a very good man, and refused it; he said if I would come to the coffee house, opposite the Mews gate and bring change for the note, he would be glad to meet me, and would settle the business, being then busy in getting change for a customer. I left him and went home; then I got the beadle; we found him in Moor-lane, at a ride, where I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he was a going to that livery stable?</p>
               <p>Bryant. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for a warrant?</p>
               <p>Bryant. No; I had a right to take him without a warrant; I saw the man that came the prisoner's servant, a few days after the hanger was left at the house; I said nothing to him nor he to me; that person was with the prisoner when I saw him in Silver street, the day I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer to compromise the matter?</p>
               <p>Bryant. Mr. Richardson and Lester's clerk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230032"/> came to me and had some conversation with me on this; I might say to Mr. Richardson and Lester's clerk, who came to make matters up, I desired justice might take place, but if I could have my money and a release I might let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say that you had been encouraged by my enemies to prosecute me?</p>
               <p>Bryant. I once told them that the people at the Dog and Duck had offered to employ council for me, and they encouraged me to go on with the prosecution, because they said he was a bad man and should be brought to justice; but I have not employed council.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. You never did say that Harris had undertook to pay the money, and because he did not pay it you had taken me up?</p>
               <p>Bryant. I never paid the least attention to it; when I went there, it was to take them up, not to get money for the note.</p>
               <p>- Ellis. I am the prosecutor's servant; I measured the prisoner for the clothes. I was there when the prisoner first called to his servant to produce the hanger, and saw him pledge it for a guinea, and a pair of breeches that came to sixteen shillings. My master asked me what I thought of it; I told him I was not a judge, so he went out to enquire the value of it. The prisoner talked of being a good customer if he was used well. My master came back and said he would take the hanger for the guinea and sixteen shillings; the prisoner offered him a note, which he refused to take: he left the note on the table; my master called after him to take back the note again, for he would not account it as a security.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. What kind of a hanger was it?</p>
               <p>Bryant. It had a fox's head, green ivory in the gripe, circled round with silver, and the sheath was silvered.</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, in his defence, said the prosecutor agreed to take Harris's note for the money, and voluntarily gave up the hanger."</p>

            . I know the prisoner. On the latter end of June, or the beginning of July, I was at my brother's house, in the Printing House yard, Black Fryars; while my brother and Mr. Hoare went to get their hair dress, the prosecutor came in and asked for Mr. Hoare, he waited for him; Mr. Hoare came in about a quarter of an hour after; I told Mr. Hoare he had brought his hanger; I delivered it to Mr. Hoare and he put the hanger on. The prosecutor said he had brought his hanger, and he gave him a bill or note. Mr. Hoare applied to the gentleman with him for some money; but on the gentleman's telling him it was his sabbath, that he was very sorry to disappoint him, but could not give him any money till Monday, Mr. Hoare said to the prosecutor he had no more money about him then than would defray his expences; being a going out of town, but would leave orders for the money to be paid him on Monday. The prosecutor said he did not choose to go away without his money; but on my brother's telling him he lived in the house, and would give him a bill for the money, he was satisfied. My brother wrote something on th e back of his bill, or note, and the prosecutor went away satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. He pulled out the bill in expectation of money?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he object to Mr. Harris's security?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; not in the least, upon his telling him he kept a house: my sister told me he came the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Court. What business is your brother?</p>
               <p>Harris. In the mercantile way.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a large expression: In what branch?</p>
               <p>Harris. He deals in every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. That is larger still; does he deal much in these sort of notes?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. He deals in every thing?</p>
               <p>Harris. He buys every thing and sells it again.</p>
               <p>Q. No particular branch that he chooses to call himself by?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he have lived in Black Friars before this happened?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as recollect yourself.</p>
               <p>Harris. It might be six months.</p>
               <p>Q. More or less?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230033"/>Q. Are you sure he had lived there four months, on your oath?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more than four?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot say particularly, I believe about four or six months; I cannot be particular just to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. He had kept a house for that time?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you live in this house?</p>
               <p>Harris, No; in Rosemary lane. I am a salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the occasion of your being there that day?</p>
               <p>Harris. I went to dine with my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long this man and your brother have been acquainted?</p>
               <p>Harris. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your brother continue to live there after that time?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect.</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. A week, month, or year.</p>
               <p>Harris. Six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear to his continuing six weeks at the same house, after the prosecutor was there?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where may your brother be now?</p>
               <p>Harris. In Norfolk.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived with your brother in this house?</p>
               <p>Harris. Nobody but him and my sister, in his part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. All the time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no endeavour, by the prosecutor, to take the hanger from Mr. Hoare, the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harris. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Hoare did not draw the hanger on the prosecutor, and say, now if you have a mind to have it take it?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; nothing of that sort past.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room at the time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My lord, he was not in the room at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room at that time?</p>
               <p>Harris. My brother, Mr. Lazarus, my sister, the prosecutor, and Mr. Hoare.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were six of you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room all the time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you did not know the prosecutor; how do you know the prosecutor is the person?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot swear to the prosecutor if I see him; I remember he was a little man, drest in brown or black.</p>
               <p>Q. You should not know him now perhaps?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door open, or did he knock at the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot say, I was sitting in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all there?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes; to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke first? I think you said Mr. Hoare told him he was very sorry.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Bryant did not seem satisfied, but on your husbands signing the note delivered up the hanger?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the hanger in his hand, or did he wear it by his side?</p>
               <p>Harris. In his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept it fast then till your husband signed the note?</p>
               <p>Harris. I believe he had given it into Mr. Hoare's hand first.</p>
               <p>Q. What, as soon as he came in?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot say as soon as he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but before Hoare told him he was disappointed and could not pay him, did the other desire to have his hanger again?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes; Mr. Hoare said he should be much obliged to him to call on Monday, being disappointed that day.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not give him the hanger?</p>
               <p>Harris. He gave him the hanger, or he took it out of his hands, I cannot say which, and without words.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not offer to give him the hanger again?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did he offer to take the hanger again?</p>
               <p>Harris. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. No struggle between them about it?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No struggle, nor no blows?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hanger drawn by any body?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is your husband?</p>
               <p>Harris. He is in the law.</p>
               <p>Q. What branch of the law may he follow?</p>
               <p>Harris. He is an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the world is he in at present?</p>
               <p>Harris. The other end of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he not to be here to-day?</p>
               <p>Harris. We live at the other end of the town, I mean to say. He is out of town at present.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Harris. He went to Oxford; where he is now I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been out of town?</p>
               <p>Harris. He has been out of town better than a fortnight I think.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last hear from him?</p>
               <p>Harris. About nine days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he date his letter from?</p>
               <p>Harris. He was then at Oxford; he was going away next morning, he did not say where to.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not heard from him since?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quarter of the country he is in?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. An attorney is he?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only sort of business he has ever been engaged in?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, ever since I have been married to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that?</p>
               <p>Harris. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Never in any other business?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Not concerned in buying and selling any thing?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not that I know, except among his acquaintance or so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived at this house at Black-friars, when the prosecutor came there?</p>
               <p>Harris. About a month or six weeks; we lived there three months in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have staid in the house a month or six weeks after this man had been there, and then removed?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you at Mr. Harris's in June last?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I believe the last of June or the beginning of July, I saw Mr. Hoare there; I was in the parlour when Mr. Bryant came in; I was there before any one was at home; in about a quarter of an hour a little man in brown or black came in with a hanger, and asked if Mr. Hoare was within; he was told, no; but was coming immediately: in about a quarter of an hour Mr. Hoare came into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there beside you?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I believe one

             came in; the man said, Mr. Hoare, I have brought your hanger; Mr. Hoare said very well; how is it; he shewed him a little bit of a note, and said it is one pound seventeen shillings; Mr. Hoare asked me if I had any money to lend him to pay the man, it was between one and two, or there about; I told him if it was not our sabbath I would lend him some money; the man said he was a stranger to him and could not leave it without the money; Mr. Hoare said would he take my word for it: he said I was a stranger to him as well as Mr. Hoare, he would not take my word nor Mr. Hoare's; he said if Mr. Harris, that is the house-keeper, would give him an undertaking for the money he would take it; so Mr. Harris gave him an undertaking on a bit of paper, I believe of some note for to be paid on Monday; that is all I know, and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the hanger?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. Mr. Hoare took it and put it to his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave it him?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. The man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no quarrel or struggle?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. No; not a bit.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing taken from the man?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave him the hanger voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the hanger was not drawn?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came in you say, you think, Harris came in with him.</p>
               <p>Lazarus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. Nobody else, that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were present when this transaction, about the hanger, passed?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. To the best of my knowledge, four; there were me, the prisoner, and the two brother Harris's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there must be five of you?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. With the prosecutor there was five.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Harris at home?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I cannot recollect myself whether she was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was not in the room?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I do not recollect myself, I did not see her, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man enquire for Harris or Hoare, when he first came?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. for Mr. Hoare.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what might be your business there that day?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. Mr. Hoare told me I should come for some particular business, to discount a bill; he did not know it was our sabbath, when he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. So you came, though it was your sabbath?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I told him I would do it on Monday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230036"/> but that I could not do it on my sabbath.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he send to you to come?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I believe that sabbath morning, about ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appoint what hour you was to come?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. No; not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came to the house was he not at home?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he lodge there?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to appoint you to meet at Mr. Harris's?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I do not know; he does business with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What business may he be?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. He is a merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. In what sort of way?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I do not know; I do not do any business with him.</p>
               <p>Q. His wife has told us that he is an attorney at law.</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I cannot tell what he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell this strange man that he would come in presently?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. He was told as I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. The maid, or man, I cannot say which.</p>

             the hanger, and then said now do you want your hanger.</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I never did such a thing in my life; no sword was drawn; I saw no quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no sword was drawn; was the hanger drawn, for I know you are a correct people?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. No.</p>

            , till I saw him in his brother's house in Printing-house Yard, a very short time. Prior to this transaction of the sword, I have heard that he was a salesman in Rosemary Lane; but I had heard he had quitted that, and was going into some other business. With respect to the brothers, I believe they are people that can prove he was bred a merchant, and he served his time to an eminent merchant in the city. My acquaintance arose with him by an attorney, who transacted business for me, and he was going to be articled with him as his clerk; and I don't know now whether he is not now articled as his clerk; whether he has quitted the name of merchant; I cannot tell the fact relative to myself, or why I came to Mr. Harris's house; I had been getting some business done at Mr. Harris's; I was to dine at his house, and in consequence of that, sent to Mr. Lazarus, whom I have bought many different trinkets of in his way, and always had discount for bills, paying so much for the articles I bought. The reason why Mr. Harris's wife has shewn a diffidence about her husband is, his brother is mistaken for the identical Mr. Harris. I have a great number of evidences; it would distress me in keeping away my witnesses; and I believe there is a man in court to take this Mr. Harris for the identical Harris himself: it is a hard case. I never saw Mr. Harris, his wife, nor Lazarus, till since I have been in confinement; but Mr. Lester who is agent in this cause for me, applied to Mr. Lazarus to come to declare the truth; I asked no compliment but the absolute truth: it is very plain Mrs. Harris has given this account, because she is apprehensive of the consequences for her husband; the tipstaff has told me he would try the event whether this Harris is not that man. I believe there is a person who has known Mr. Harris, and has done the business that Lazarus has done before in point of giving cash; I saw him there a while ago, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230037"/> can declare upon oath, if called for, what I have stated of Mr. Harris's being articled to Mr. Herne of Lyon's Inn; whether or not he was a merchant, and how long he lived in this house; I believe if he is asked he can tell he had no subpoenea from me. If your lordship will give me leave to call in a witness.</p>
               <p>Court. No; you are too late for any more witnesses, your council told me you had finished your evidence, and I indulged you with the liberty to make any observations upon what evidence you have offered, there it was closed; one thing I have to say to you, your council has not called any body to give any account of your way of life or character; if you will give any account of your character you may?</p>

            . When I went into the house I saw Humphreys and another man sitting by the fire drunk, after a while the prisoner said, he was very hungry, and wanted something to eat; Humphreys gave him six pence, he went out and got a tongue; and brought a woman in, the tongue came to four-pence more than he had given him; after this we went into another room to drink. I was invited in to eat part of it, and sat down with them; there was beer and brandy called for; after a while the prosecutor laid himself down on the table, and lean'd his head on it; while he was thus leaning down on the table the prisoner was fumbling about his breeches; he made an attempt to take out his watch, but did not succeed, that made Humphreys get up; I dropped a halfpenny, stooping under the table to pick it up, I saw Humphreys get up on this attempt to take his watch, and then laid himself down again; the prisoner's hand was again about his breeches; I knew that, because I heard the chain rattle.</p>

This was in the public room; then the prisoner went out and bought a tongue; they went into the parlour all together: brandy was called for by the prisoner; and he obliged Humphreys to drink half a glass; the prosecutor was lying on the table; the prisoner was feeling about his breeches, and at last the prisoner asked what it was o'clock; Humphreys took out his watch; it was then ten minutes after seven; presently after this the prisoner called for the reckoning, and said he must go out and make water; soon after he was gone, Humphreys got up and said he had lost his watch, and the prisoner had got it; we went out a second time, and brought him in.</p>

               <p>Humphreys was fuddled, and treated me with a tongue: we had brandy, and other liquors; I would have paid part of the reckoning; Mr. Humphreys would not let me. I know nothing of the watch. When I was gone away they came and laid hold of me, charging me with this watch.</p>

I never heard of the robbery till the next morning, and then I went and acquainted the family of it, and described the man, that evening he was taken up, at Valentine Townshends.

               <p>- Speckman I have known the prisoner some years, he lodged with me about a fortnight before he went to Mr. Coulson's. On the 30th of September search was made at my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230040"/> house for some goods the prisoner had left there; he was at my house, on Saturday in the forenoon, and left a box, before he went to live with Mr. Coulson, and desired me to take care of it; on Saturday the 28th he came about ten or eleven o'clock, and brought a small bundle in his hand, it was big enough to contain all the plate; I did not see what was in the bundle. I gave him the key of the room; he went up and stayed a little, and then came down; he had no bundle when he came down. I was present when the box was opened, and the things that have been produced were all found in the prisoner's box.</p>

               <p>I found the things in the field, near the garden, about six o'clock; I thought they were the gardeners, because he was going away; he had desired me to enquire after a place for him; accordingly I removed them from there in order to have a little fun with the gardener; I put them into the field over the gate; when he came he said nothing to me about them, and I said nothing to him, but I told him I had heard of a place, and he appointed to meet me at St. James's in the afternoon, and the gardener not coming I took them to my lodgings; I have no witnesses; I never sent to any body.</p>

I came down stairs into the place where the bureau was broke open, about a quarter of an hour after him: I saw the windows open in the back parlour, the window shutters were both open, and the sash of the biggest was up; the shutters of the little window were cut with something, and the bureau was broke open; the prisoner said there had been a man in the garret, with a pistol, where he lay, and told him if he did not lie still he would blow his brains out, and then all the family came down; this was towards six o'clock; the prisoner then took us into the garden to see if he could any way trace the thieves; he said, before he went into the garden, he believed the rogues came in at the little window; we went into the garden directly; we went down first to the alcove in the garden, and looked over, and one of the maids saw the silver spoon, just over the ditch, in the field, opposite the alcove; the prisoner went first; when we saw the spoon he was a going to jump over to get it, but he went round into the field, and we went into the middle of the field; the prisoner said we will go quite cross the field; to see if we can find any more; the cook found another in the middle of the field; we went across the field and found a pair of old black buckles, them he picked up; then we came into the garden and found the china snuff box. The prisoner said he believed a little boy got in at the little window; the glass of the window was broke; it did not appear as if any body had got in; a man could not get in, it must be a small boy to get in; the windows were both towards the garden.</p>

I went from my house, on the 26th of September, to go into Essex, and returned on Saturday the 28th; the first person I saw on my return was the prisoner; he informed me a man had broke in at the little window, and went out again at the large one; and that the thief stood by his bed-side near an hour before he went to the maid's room for a candle, and he said he was dressed in a light blue coat.

            , I found the sash glass broke, but it was broke on the inside, because the glass was on the outside. On examining the window shutter there appeared three small cuts, as if it had been done by a case-knife; the cuts were not opposite the hole in the glass; they were below; and there was a screw, a turn buckle, and an iron bar that were not brok e at all; so that it seemed impossible for any body to come in at that window; the hole in the shutter was not large enough for a child to get his finger through, and the vine that grew on the outside of this window, was not damaged; it could not be opened on the outside. I looked further, and found my bureau was broke open; I lost a large pair of silver shoe buckles, and a silver stock buckle; I could not tell particulary what I had lost. I am not sure the silver shoe buckles were taken out of the bureau; the stock buckle was, the table spoons were on the side board; there were four of them in the same parlour; I left them in the house when I went, and I missed them when I came back; I lost a china snuff box; I can say, for certainty, that the silver stock buckle and the china snuff box were in the bureau. The prisoner was taken up the day the robbery was commited. Before I came home Mrs. Redman suspected him; at first she went to a friend, and he advised her to take him up; he was taken before justice Sherwood, and committed on Monday. On the Friday after, Mr. Sackler, a publican, in the neighbourhood, came to my house, just as I returned from the justices, and told me where the prisoner said the things were buried, and that the magistrate had consented he should come into the field, in custody, and if I would go the things should be delivered to me; so I went into the field; there was the prisoner, in custody, with

These are my buckles that I advertised, and this is my stock buckle, and these stone sleeve buttons are mine; the prisoner was present when these things were delivered to me; the officers said they found them in my fields, near the pales, the snuff box was given to me the day I returned home, by the servants; it was found in the garden.</p>

            . I live at the Red Cow, at Mile-end. I know the prisoner; the day the things were lost I saw him, and asked him it was; then he said a man had broke open the house, and came up to his bed. I enquired after the man, particularly, because I had been robbed myself; On Friday I went to the justice, and I went to a publick house where the prisoner was, and two men had him in custody, we went into a private room, and taxed him with knowing of this robbery: we said to him, you must know of this robbery; he said he knew nothing at all of it; we all stuck up to in that the must know, and he had better confess; then he confessed that they were hid in the field, but he could not tell where, without going. I acquainted the justice with it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230044"/> and I and the two men, Wright and Farrel, went to this field, by Mr. Redman's; when we came to the field, we went round to let the squire know of it, and left the prisoner with Wright and Farrel; I was not present when the things were found.</p>

I persuaded him at the sixth bowl to have no more; he was exceeding drunk; at last he fell a sleep; he had been so two or three times; I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230045"/> notice that the prisoner was more busy about him than the rest; the company dropt away one after another from the sailor into other boxes, but the prisoner kept in the same box, on the right hand side; and he persuaded him to go to the White-horse cellar, and said he would show him the way: he wanted to persuade him to stay all night, but he would not do that. He staid some time; another half-crown bowl was called for afterwards, and he gave me half a guinea to change, and said he had took a place in the coach for Bristol; after that he fell asleep again, having eight shillings left; the prisoner and Drew desired me to keep it till next day: then the prisoner proposed that they should say there were only three shilings. I refused, and waked the man and gave him the change; he had a shilling in his hand, which made 9 shillings: presently after, he had only seven shillings and six pence left in his hand. After that the prisoner set himself on his right hand, the prosecutor being asleep; I saw the prisoner's left hand in his right hand breeches pocket; upon which I said to Hooper in the bar, that the prisoner had been robbing the sailor, upon which they advised me to secure him and to search him; we seized the prisoner immediately, and charged him with robbing this man; he denied it; I said are not you a villain for saying so, I saw your hand in his pocket. Upon this the prisoner put his right hand into his breeches pocket, and took it out again, as if he was putting something into the fore flap of his breeches; I said I suppose you have not got it in your pocket now; you put it into your breeches: then Mackoy said he has eighteen pence in his left hand waistcoat pocket; I saw him take it out and put it there; the prisoner denied that he had any money at all; Mackoy said don't think I have it; I will be searched, turned out his pockets, pulled down his breeches to shew he had nothing, and said to the prisoner if you have not got it, why will you not let yourself be searched? The prisoner swore before, no one should search him; Mackoy put his hand in his left hand pocket to show us a shilling and six pence; the prisoner swore again no one should search him; and that the eighteen pence was his own; I assisted Hooper to take him into the back room, many people insisted that it should be cleared up; he said he would not be searched, Hooper then took hold of him, and said he would search him; upon which the prisoner submitted, and began to undo his garters. Hooper said to the company mind what you are about, watch him close; as he was unbuttoning the last button, Hooper said he has put something in his shoe, then they searched his right shoe there they found a guinea, I said are not you a villain to rob the man when he has treated you? Then the prisoner said I have that but I have no more: upon this, I insisted he should be further searched. Another guinea was missing; he refused to be searched further unless we had a constable; then a constable was sent for. He denied that he had any more money; we searched him by force, for one took him by one arm, another by the other: we pulled off his right leg stocking and there came out the other guinea; then he said the sailor gave them to him.</p>

I saw Coates sitting in the tap-room, and the prisoner sitting by him they were drinking together; Crouch and the other grenadiers were with them; Crouch would not let them have any more liquor. Then all except the prisoner and Coates drew out of that box into other boxes; the sailor laid his head down on the table; Crouch said I am afraid the prisoner will pick his pocket, and desired me to take notice. A quarter of an hour after that, Crouch being in the box, said his hand is in the sailor's pocket, then Horbond was desired to go round and examine the man; he shook the sailor, and asked him if he had lost any thing, and desired him to take out what money he had; he said he had five guineas: there were eighteen-pence wanting of the change of the last reckoning; and they searched, and there were two guineas missing, Mackoy desired they would search the prisoner's left hand waist-coat pocket, either Crouch or Mackoy did, and took out eighteen-pence: before this, the prisoner said he had no money about him, and no one should search him; the prisoner took the opportunity and run out of the door I took him coming round the house. We said he should go before the company, that they might be better satisfied about the two guineas; with assistance I took him back into a large room behind the bar, the company desired an account about the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230046"/> guineas; at last he began unbuttoning his right leg garter, and we found the money as mentioned by the last witness. I asked how he came to be so wicked to take it; after a little pause he said he took no more than that guinea, and had no more; and then in a few minutes afterwards he said that the sailor gave it him, but that he had no more: the sailor was then a little come to himself and desired the constable to take change of him; he still denied the other guinea, and refused to be searched; we compelled him to it, pulling of his right leg stocking, the prisoner said the money not in it; and pulling it off, we shook cut another guinea from his stocking, then he said the sailor gave it him. The prisoner dared any man to search him; the serjeant wanted that evening to have the prisoner delivered to him; the sailor said he should be delivered to the constable.</p>

He said he had five guineas when he came into the house, and he produced what was left; he said twenty-four shillings had been spent; upon counting all the money, a guinea was wanting. Upon that Jones said another guinea is wanting, we must search you; he said they should not: he said the sailor had given him the first guinea; he refused to have his pockets searched. Then Hooper said search his shoes and stockings; he said they should not till they had took him to some person; upon which Hooper and Draper forced him into a chair, and then he pulled off his left shoe first of all, then pulled off his right stocking, turned it down half way, then shook it, and the guinea fell out. The prisoner had said he would find an other guinea; and when pulling the stocking, he said, you will find money enough there; they asked him how he came by this guinea, he said the sailor gave him the guineas.</p>

            . I was in the same box, at these two Brewers, on the Friday night. I, the the prisoner, and the sailor were drinking together; three or four other soldiers were with him, they were all disguised with liquor. I drank with them; one of the company asked him if he would drink till tomorrow morning, for he had pretty nigh half a guinea good. Crouch said he saw the prisoner's hand in the sailor's pocket; the prisoner, on being charged, said some silver dropt, and he took it up to put it in the prosecutor's pocket. Then the prisoner went out and was brought back by Hooper, who took him into a room. I heard, but did not see it, that they found the two guineas about him; I heard the prisoner ask the sailor if he had robbed him of that money; the sailor said, no, I believe you did not.

            . I am the Prisoner's serjeant; I was told that the prisoner was confined for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230047"/> taking money from the sailor. I went to the Two Brewers; then Hooper said the prisoner robbed the sailor of two guineas; I said I should be glad to see the sailor; Hooper said he was in a private lodging, down the court; we went together there, and another soldier. Soon after the soldier came out, I asked if he had been robbed; he said, they tell me so; I do not know that I have; upon which I told him to take care had he very punctual; I asked the witness to go into Crouch's, which he did, and Hooper said it was a pitty they could not make the affair easy, as it was a drunken frolick, and let the sailor have his money again; I said it was a pity it should not be so; the sailor called for some liquor; then Horband came in and said; what was I going to compound a felony? I said, no; upon which Horband said he should suffer the law; I said, I had no objection to it; Horband said again, he should suffer the law, unless your officer will take him, and Lord Ancram gives his honour that he shall be severely punished; we went to Lord Ancram, who ordered the man to be dismissed; we went at ten or eleven o'clock to justice Fielding; the sailor said they told him he was robbed; but he believed he gave the prisoner some money to pay the reckoning; the justice said he could not commit a man upon that charge, and Hooper and others, said the man was drunk, that he had been drinking in the morning, and had been tampered with, and did not know what he said; then the justice sent him to sleep, and said he should be brought again at five; that he should go to Crouch's, and they promised no one should come nigh him, to tamper with him, or give him any thing to drink; an hour or two after, I went there, I missed Hooper; suspecting something, I paid my reckoning and went away; and in half an hour came back again; I asked Crouch if the sailor was asleep, he said, yes; I asked if he was sure; he said yes; then I said I was informed that somebody was up stairs with him; Crouch denied it, I was told Hooper was upstairs, with the sailor, upon which I charged Crouch with knowing it; then he said that Hooper was up stairs, and so should be, and no one else should: I was present about seven o'clock, before the justice, then the sailor said the soldier had taken the money out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mary Carleys. I went to see the prisoner in Newgate this day; Hooper, Crouch, and Jones, came in when I was there, and asked the, prisoner what he thought of the affair, he said he did not know, he was innocent of it, and asked what they intended; Crouch said, they came on purpose to make it up with him, and said it had cost them eighteen-shillings the day before, and nine that day; and that it was a great expence and fatigue to them to attend; and the prosecutor would not be there, and if the prisoner would make it up with them, it should not come to tryal; the prisoner said he was innocent; then they said they would put it off till next sessions, if they could do no worse.</p>
               <p>Crouch Young. Mr. Fielding, in the morning, said it was plain these fellows, meaning the soldiers, had been tampering with the sailor, and ordered Crouch to let none of them come near him, and he ordered Hooper in particular, to keep them from him.</p>
               <p>Hooper. Justice Fielding ordered me to let none of the grenadiers come near him, till between four and five, to get him ready to go before the justice; the only thing I said to him. was to desire he would recollect himself as well as he could, in the morning, before the justice; the sailor said he had lost his money but did not know how, being so much in liquor; between six and seven in the evening he swore he was robbed of two guineas, and repeated it several times.</p>
               <p>- Jones. I am the constable; from what passed in the hackney coach I thought proper to keep the soldiers away; there were five in the coach; myself, the prisoner, the prisoner's serjeant Walley, and one Skelly; the prisoner said to the sailor, don't you know you gave me two guineas last night; the sailor said no, and took his head several times; at this time he was in liquor; the prisoner said did you not give it me; the sailor said no, why should I give you my money, if you would have drank gold. all in my pocket should have been at your service, but to take my money I do not like it; the prisoner said what you want to hang me; he said no, I do not want to hang or hurt you; but the prisoner said, you will hang me if you do not say you gave me the money; why then says the sailor, I will say so.</p>
               <p>Q. To Crouch. What do you say to that?</p>
               <p>Crouch. It is totally misrepresented; we did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230048"/> go, and the prisoner said, Mr. Crouch, you do not mean to hurt me; upon which I said, I can do neither one way nor the other; upon which the prisoner said, I must take my trial when the sessions come on, but you cannot find a bill; upon that I said you may make yourself easy, the bill is found; then he said he must take his trial and submit to his fate.</p>
               <p>"Hooper and Jones said the same; and also that there was not a syllable said about making it up; that they only went to give the prisoner something to drink; that there was a woman with him, which they believed to be Careless.</p>

I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment, except the ring, on the 6th of December, out of a bureau in the bed chamber; the diamond ring I lost on the 21st of July: in fact, I did not miss them till the 17th of this month, only I heard the prisoner acknowledge the time she took them. The bureau was sometimes lock'd, and sometimes left open; I had no servant but the prisoner, and she did not quit my service till last Saturday se'nnight; she had been with us three years and two months in the whole. On Saturday the 17th of this month my wife missed all the things, except the ring, out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230050"/> bureau; the next day I desired her to see whether the ring was safe; on searching we found that was gone. My wife charged the prisoner with taking them about one o'clock on Thursday; she would not see her but locked herself up in the kitchen all right: about eight o'clock I charged her with this ring; I said, What have you stole the diamond ring too; on which she put her hand in her pocket, and took out a pawnbroker's ticket, of the name of Jasson, who lives in Brown street, and delivered this ticket to Mrs. Teed. On Saturday morning, me, my wife, the prisoner and the constable went to this pawnbroker's. Jasson acted in a very scandalous manner, for he refused to shew the ring; but the constable's taking him into custody, he did go before the justice, and there shewed the ring. Mrs. Wright, the other pawnbroker, not being in town, appointed us to come on Monday twelve o'clock, and to appoint the other pawnbroker. In the mean time my wife was detained by illness till after eleven o'clock, then this Jasson was gone. The prisoner is about eighteen years old, her parents live at Putney; they are honest, poor people, for what I know. The prisoner did not own the things when first charged, but desired her mistress to look about, and see if she could not find the things. She did not go to bed that Thursday night nor Friday; the kitchen was not the room where she usually lay. I was not afraid of her running away on Friday; it was then day light; I should have been able to have recovered her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you carry her before the justice on Friday?</p>
               <p>Teede. My wife wanted to consult her friends what course to take.</p>

            . I kept the things in my bureau in my bedchamber; it was sometimes lock'd, and sometimes not. I had no suspicion of the prisoner; she had been so long in the family. On the 17th of October, between one and two o'clock. I missed all the things except the ring. I asked the prisoner where they were; the prisoner said she knew nothing of them, made various protestations of her innocence, and desired me to look and search after them. I did all day and next morning, and to no purpose; the prisoner was locked up in the kitchen. I did not see her to speak to her till Saturday; I said nothing to her about confessing, nor did I hear my husband say any thing. My reason for putting her there was that as she had done this fact, as I suspected it on Thursday, and knew it on Friday. I was afraid to have her lie so near me. On Friday evening my husband asked me if I had got all my rings; I searched my bureau, and presently missed my diamond ring, which I told my husband of. The prisoner, my husband, myself and the constable went on Saturday to Jasson's; Jasson said he had the ring, but I should not have it without paying for it. At last, however, he went with us to Justice Wright's, and produced the ring. I saw it in his hand; the prisoner being present there, he would not give it out of his hand, he only let me look upon it. I told the justice I was sure it was my ring; being ill I did not come next time to justice Wright's till half past twelve, then the prisoner was gone. Mr. Jasson afterwards came to my house at night, along with another person, they frightned me very much by their behaviour; he threw the ring down, and said, he had rid his hand of it, and I must take care of it.</p>

I said, madam, you need not be afraid to open the door, at last she opened it; I told her it was impossible for me to know the person of the prisoner: she said she would not take charge of the ring; when I offered it to her, my only motive for that was, because I would not sware to the prisoner.</p>

I took him into custody, and brought him down into a lobby, I searched him, and found this watch in his fob.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the same watch?</p>
               <p>Rogers. Yes; it has always been in my possession. I took him before a justice, and he was committed; I went to the maker, and he recollected who the watch belonged to?</p>
               <p>Q. What is the maker's name?</p>
               <p>Rogers. Wagstaff.</p>

               <p>Q. You never had it in your own hand?</p>
               <p>Tollington. No; not till after it came out of the cellar: I did not see him put it down.</p>
               <p>Hewetson (again).

I said it was a good deal of money for such a watch, I would give him 40 s. for it; he would not let me have it; I then rose to 45 s. I bought it at last for 50 s. I gave him three guineas; he asked if I had a 6 d. I had, and gave it to him, and he gave me a 13 s. 6 d. I found the money by Covent Garden; I have one witness to prove I found the money that saw me pick it up; and another to prove I bought the watch, it was just as it is, with the lockets to it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>This gown Mr. Hore gave to me out of the box, on Tuesday night; he had no money, so he gave it me to be concerned with me; he went out into St. James's park, and under the fourth tree, by the gravel, he brought the gown there under his coat and gave it me; there was nobody there but ourselves. He spoke to me several times; I told him he had a wife; he came home drunk on Sunday night, and played his fun with me before his wife, and he put his thigh over mine. I am twenty one years old.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hore. Whether on Sunday, you played your fun with her, by putting your knee on hers; did you make any of these overtures to her?</p>
               <p>Hore. No; I never did in the world; I was quite the reverse of that; she would not take with me; it is very false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the gown out of the box?</p>
               <p>Hore. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the gown was out of the box before your wife told you?</p>
               <p>Hore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet this woman in the park.</p>
               <p>Hore. No, I never did, nor any where else in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring the gown under your coat?</p>
               <p>Hore. No; I never did.</p>

            ; I keep a chandler's shop. The prisoner lodged with her father and mother at our house about eight weeks ago. The things mentioned in the indictment were stolen out of a sore kitchen; they were in bags, they were just come into the house, and had not been there four hours. The kitchen door was locked; it had been locked all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had nothing to do in this kitchen?</p>
               <p>Wright. No; I missed a great quantity of silk, seven Holland shirts, a gown, twenty yards of thread-lace, and eight or ten yards of linen cloth. The things were taken out of the bags, and the bags left behind: I found the kitchen door locked as I left it on Friday morning. My husband went to the justice, and he granted him a warrant: we searched her room, we found some cloth, some pieces of silk, and part of the thread-lace, about eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that is your's?</p>
               <p>Wright. I have some at home to match it; I am very sure it is mine; the cloth was cut into shift-sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the silk?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; I have a gown at home of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when you found these things?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; she confessed she brought them out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I saw them in the fore kitchen, and took them into my room; they were put out of the way till somebody should own them.</p>
               <p>"She called a witness to her character, who deposed, that she takes in gentlemen's linen to wash. She said the prisoner had ironed for her; that she entrusted her with a great many things, and always found her very honest.</p>

On the nineteenth of October my daughter told me she had taken some things out of the house. I asked if she knew what silver spoons were in use; she said, No. I went and looked among the spoons, and missed a silver one marked M N. I then desired my daughter to look over the house, and see whether she missed any thing else: accordingly she did, and on Monday following that silver spoon was brought in, and put into a cupboard, and another was carried out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was brought in?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Because I found it; I missed another that was marked I S C; then I desired my daughter to look further, if she found any thing missing. I did not know that any thing else was missing. On the Tuesday following the prisoner ran away; I got a warrant of justice Sherwood, and she was taken up on Wednesday, I think it was the twenty-third. She was carried before justice Sherwood; the goods mentioned in the indictment were all produced at his house, they are here now in court. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

Mrs. Hyde is here, and Hyde owned she pawned them for her; she owned they were my property, and she took them for necessity.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner on board the ship?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes; he was <rs id="t17711023-86-deflabel420" type="occupation">chief mate</rs>

               <p>Q. Who superintended the delivery?</p>
               <p>Hill. The chief mate; the cargo is delivered by lumpers, who are hired by the chief mate, and under his direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit the ship while the cargo was delivering?</p>

               <p>Hill. Yes; a few days before we arrived the prisoner and I were talking about the cargo; he said, captain, you have got nine pieces of mahogany on board, which is not good.</p>
               <p>Council. Describe the pieces of mahogany that the cargo consisted of?</p>
               <p>Hill. Pieces of logs and planks; we call them all logs that are fourteen feet long; they are sawn off trees, one tree perhaps is sawn into three pieces, ends, planks, and spurs. A spur is a piece out of the root of a tree: it is like a table. They are from fourteen feet down to two, and from two or three inches thick to 25 inches. He said you have nine pieces of mahogany not good, if you please I will chop off or change the marks, and give you nine pieces of the best in the ship, which makes little or no difference in the cargo. I answered, No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any mahogany on board on your account?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes; the nine logs, it was all shipped as cargo; I bought it after it was shipped, I said no, I never chused to put myself in the hand of any man; as my logs were received, so they should be landed; we had no more on that subject.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mark on your logs?</p>

            , M, were taken out of the one hundred and ninety-five; then we came up and reported the goods at the Custom house. We generally in wood report less than there are in case of a mistake; I entered them something under the number, then the mate had an order from the Custom house to discharge the ship; he continued discharging till the ship was out. Mr. Bowler, the measurer, came to me, and said, Sir, I believe some of your cargo is landed at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf in Surry. My cargo was to be landed at the Jamaica wharf, near Black friars bridge, in Surry, agreeable to the owner's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is Sir Peter Thompson's wharf?</p>
               <p>Hill. Below bridge, at Dock head. I told Mr. Bowler, I had an opinion of my mate that he would not do such an action as smuggle wood contrary to my orders; I begg'd him to make enquiry, and I would speak to my mate about it. I went on board, and asked the prisoner if he had been guilty of landing wood out of my ship, for I had been informed that he had landed wood out of the ship at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf. He declared that he had not landed any wood out of the ship, nor had he any there but two small pieces which I had knowledge of: I told him if he had done so to confess it, and I would use my interest with Capt. Massom, before it went too far; he utterly denied it, and said he hoped I had a better opinion of him; this was about the end of June, or in July. Nothing passed for about six weeks, when Mr. Bowler spoke to me about it again, and brought in an account of his measurement; I had so good an opinion of the prisoner, that I never went to Sir Peter Thompson's wharf to enquire about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowler's account of the measurement differed vastly from mine, he is a sworn measurer and broker; he differed twelve or thirteen thousand feet from the measurement I took in the country; some I measured myself; neither he nor I could account for it, unless they were my goods that were landed at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf. This passed on about ten days; he gave me some slight hint that he thought it was my wood; Mr. Massom came to me in September, and said the clerk of the wharf, where our wood had been landed, had told him that he believed the wood that was sold at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf was his; I was so persuaded of the prisoner's honesty, that I could not believe him guilty: the wood was advertized as the property of a gentleman from Honduras. I saw some of this wood afterwards, in Mr. Slater's yard, in the beginning of Sept. that is at Rotherhithe; there were two pieces there; I only challenged one to be mine; I measured four hundred and twenty nine for sale; I saw my mark, G. M. on it: it was in some measure bruised out, but yet visible; the number is visible 164, it is not quite plain, the 4 is not touched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the particular dimensions of every piece?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the dimensions of your piece, 164.</p>
               <p>Hill. I made a mistake, it is 264; it is thirteen feet long, and twenty-three inches both ways, square; the piece at Slater's wharf agreed with the invoice exactly: my measurement in the country was 573 feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say 429 feet.</p>
               <p>Hill. That is for sale; there is a difference between that and for sale; the exact measurement of the outside is five hundred and seventy three feet: when they measure for sale, they make a difference of any that is not square;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230059"/> when I measured it at Slater's wharf, it was five hundred and seventy three feet, according to my measurement; the length of the piece was thirteen feet in the country, it was twenty three inches square. I found another piece at Mr. Hodder's, in Tooley street, the same day; the mark is visible, It is L. C. G. I could not see the number; I did not take the dimensions of it; I believe it is about nineteen inches, it was sawed in four logs; I put them together and it made the measurement.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be one of the pieces shipped at the Musketo shore?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes, I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these four pieces were originally all one?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes; by having them laid on one another, and they fitted exactly. I have brought that piece here with the mark. (the piece produced) I found this piece in Hodder's yard in September; I found the other piece in Maiden lane, in the hands of one Ash, the day after; I believe the mark of that is hackled out; there is no describing it; there is a mark No. 201 on it, visible enough to see it had been so marked; I found another piece at Mr. Clifford's in Queen-street, Holborn; the marks of that are chopped out; I found one piece he had sold privately-in Ratcliff highway, to one Mr. Burkit, the marks of that are chopped out.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cargo was landed, I believe it answered in point of number of pieces of wood; how happened that?</p>
               <p>Hill. Pieces that had been shaken and tossed about in the ship, some were split in two, there were two pieces of cedar, there were seven hundred pieces on board; the cargo delivered had more pieces; some whole pieces were split in two, and other pieces were shook by the carriage, on the sea; and there were some pieces which the measurers call white wood, that are not in the invoice: they were delivered with my mark and numbers upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you cut any of the pieces in two?</p>
               <p>Hill. To make stowage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to cut your pieces of mahogany in two; for to make stowage?</p>
               <p>Hill. No: but we gave leave for six or seven to be cut, to stow in the hatchway. I don't know how many were cut; these were cut at the Musquetto shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible to cut these on board the ship?</p>
               <p>Hill. They could not cut them till the port was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How must that be cut?</p>
               <p>Hill. With a cross cut saw, two people must do it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave orders you say in the country for six or seven pieces to be cut?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in fact how many pieces were cut?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when you came home, you entered them under the mark?</p>
               <p>Hill. That is customary; we are allowed what is called in the Custom-house, a post. entry; we are permitted to make a second entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this ship lie in the river?</p>
               <p>Hill. Close by Shadwell dock.</p>

               <p>Q. These were marked by the dealer you bought them of I suppose.</p>
               <p>Hill. I did not buy any wood, my wood was all shipped on freight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of all these different marks?</p>
               <p>Hill. That is best known to the gentlemen of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were marked by the planter of the country?</p>
               <p>Hill. They were squared and marked before my eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230060"/>Q. Did you see all these letters put on?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who directed that?</p>
               <p>Hill. Mr. Gorden, one of the merchants of the country; he marked most of them himself; they had their negroes there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cargo put on board?</p>
               <p>Hill. I saw every piece measured and marked, the log-book will account for the cargo took on board.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this Mr. Richmond had a private trade of his own.</p>
               <p>Hill. No, I agreed that no wood should be on board that ship but the merchants; I bought none of my own, but after it was freighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man any wood of his own?</p>
               <p>Hill. When I first agreed with this gentleman, I admitted no wood to go on board the ship but for the gentlemen. My mate smuggled a piece of wood, and I discovered it; I wrote him a letter, he begg'd my pardon, and said he would do so no more. After that he asked me to give him leave to put a small piece on board a man gave him, which I did; they were not small logs, they were pieces ten or twelve feet long, and ten or twelve inches square; about two or three hundred feet together I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. How much wages did you give?</p>
               <p>Hill. Three pound per month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any dispute about his having three pound or three pound ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never mentioned to him, that if he drove any private trade you must not know of it?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his papers?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The cabin was broke open, I believe.</p>
               <p>Hill. I do not know.</p>

            . I marked the greatest part of the logs, there was hardly one but what I marked.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at that piece, and see if you can tell what marks are there?</p>
               <p>Gordon. This to the best of my knowledge, is what I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively?</p>
               <p>Gordon. I think I could, I am almost positive.</p>
               <p>Court. What mark is it?</p>
               <p>Gordon. G, M.</p>
               <p>Q. What else?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Here is something like a figure of 6; here is something like the top of a figure of 25 it is like a 264.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it; you are sure there is a figure of 4?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive the other figure was a 6; I suppose the marks are not now so fresh as when you first made them?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They cannot be seen so well after they have stood together?</p>
               <p>Gordon. That would not deface them in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you suppose that was done?</p>
               <p>Gordon. It appears knocked out with a tool.</p>
               <p>Q. Some part of the marks remain?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these marks that now remain, appear to you to be the marks that you put on?</p>
               <p>Gordon. They look to me to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that they are the marks.</p>
               <p>Gordon. I dare not say either the one or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other pieces that you can swear to the marks of?</p>
               <p>Gordon. There are some; I can swear more to the pieces than by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was such wood as this generally brought from there?</p>

            . I was the owner of the ship,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230063"/> the cargo is consigned to me; the prisoner was chief mate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with him in consequence of any suspicion of him?</p>
               <p>Massom. I was informed that he had landed wood contrary to my, and I believe contrary to the Captain's orders; I called him down into the cabbin, and asked him about it; that was in June I believe; he told me then that he had none, and had landed none, but two little bits. I was informed of it by Mr. Fossack, and Mr. Bowler; Mr. Fossack is the wharfinger, at the Jamaica-wharf. Mr. Bowler measured the whole cargo: I only allowed the Captain a tun; and I gave the prisoner no authority to land any.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, though you gave him no authority to land wood, yet it is pretty well known that the officers have sometimes private property contrary to the will of the owner?</p>
               <p>Massom. We don't let any person interfere with our trade.</p>
               <p>Council. You don't allow it, but yet it will often happen?</p>
               <p>Massom. But it is not right that an officer should take any thing without the consent of of the Captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you break open the prisoner's cabbin?</p>
               <p>Massom. I went on board for the books, the boy said he could take the Smith's, the butcher's books, and another penny book out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the books? (shewing the witnesses some memoramdum books.)</p>
               <p>Massom. Yes, these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are what you took out, books that relate to the ships account, or did you take out any book of any private dealings of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Massom. No; besides these, I only saw a single piece of paper, which the boy handed me, mentioning something about a book that had been sent on shore by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the mate is not concerned in making the entry?</p>
               <p>Massom. No; it is made by the Captain, and I generally go along with the Captain to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. So the mate could not tell what entry was made; I believe you went to Sir Peter Thompson's wharf.</p>
               <p>Massom. Not for some time; I had such great faith in that lad that I could trust the whole property with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner entered the wood at Sir

               <p>Massam. Yes; he knew there was a warrant out.</p>

            . I am a broker and measurer. I was employed to measure the cargo of mahogany that came home in the Chance; I measured some part at the Jamaica wharf, the other part at Hitchcock and Millan's wharf, a little higher up; there were 805 logs, ends and pieces. I began to measure the cargo on the 29th of May; I continued on it, I believe, near five weeks before I had done. The difference in the measurement between Mr. Hill's account and mine was 12000 feet; I don't look upon him to be a measurer: I made it 212,000 feet, Mr. Hill made it 200,000.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find some wood among the cargo that was not mahogany, that was of a peculiar quality?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes; I called them white wood.</p>
               <p>Q. There were marks and numbers on those pieces I believe?</p>
               <p>Bowler. I have not been very accurate about these marks; one of them is G. M.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of that white wood?</p>
               <p>Bowler. We never had any of it; I don't look upon it to be worth even the freight.</p>
               <p>Q. So there is 12000 feet difference between Mr. Hill's measurement and yours?</p>
               <p>Bowler. There is 12,300 feet difference between his manner of measuring for freight and my measuring in the port of London; I measure for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how many superficial feet freight measure there were?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Two hundred and seven thousand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230064"/> and forty feet, eight inches, superficial freight measure.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did you measure all the pieces as you found them, and make no allowance for freight?</p>
               <p>Bowler. By no means for freight. As I was passing by Sir Peter Thompson's wharf, about the 11th or 12th of June, I saw ten, twelve, or fourteen pieces of mahogany; I thought they were very much like the cargo that was going through my hands at that time; I examined them, but I could not discover any marks or numbers upon them. When they came to a public sale, I went down to the wharf, and the measurement was offered to me; they were sold by auction about ten or a dozen days after I saw them. When I saw Mr. Hill some time after, I asked him if he knew of any wood coming from that shore besides his cargo; he said, no. I told him they were advertised as Honduras logs.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Captain Hill is not a very accurate measurer?</p>
               <p>Bowler. I don't apprehend that he is; it is not his profession.</p>
               <p>Q. But supposing you had measured all the wood that came out of the ship, there might have been a great difference in Captain Hill's measurement and yours?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Probably if any other measurer had done it, there might be.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there might be, you say, a great difference between Captain Hill's measurement and yours?</p>
               <p>Bowler. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And between measurement for freight, unless he knew how, there might be a large difference?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might there be this 12000 feet difference in that quantity, if there had been no embezzlement at all?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes, very probably.</p>
               <p>Q. I find these logs were publickly exposed for ten or twelve days.</p>
               <p>Bowler. They laid on the public wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. You measured the timber on the wharf without knowing whether it was the whole cargo or not?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a barge being sunk?</p>
               <p>Bowler. A boat was sunk at Sir

            . I was in the ship at the Musqueto shore; the prisoner cut three pieces of white wood on the shore; it was put on board the ship on his account; I believe without the captain's knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner desire you to keep it secret?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it against orders to put these on board?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. Captain Hill knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked at this white wood?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it part of the wood cut at the Musqueto shore?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell Captain Hill of this?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. It was nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cut in the day time or the night?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. I was not with them; I believe it was cut in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it of the same sort?</p>

            . I am a waterman; I was employed by Capt. Massom in landing wood from his ship; I put out several pieces for the prisoner, several times; he ordered me to put some into the water, and some into the ferry.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Coates. Five or six pieces, and I did so, he said it was his.</p>

               <p>Coates. No; I had a piece and was going to put it into the water, by his order; but the Captain was coming on shore, and then he bid me put it into the barge; he called for the cook's axe to chop it into the boat; I did not see what he did; I was in the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mark on that piece?</p>
               <p>Coates. I cannot say, Captain Hill was on board, and was gone down into the cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the pieces might there be in the barge where he chopt?</p>
               <p>Coates. There might be thirty or forty pieces, we put some out afterwards, some into the water, and other vessels for the mate.</p>

I am a waterman; the prisoner was mate of the ship Chance; I was employed by him to receive some wood for him; he bid me call when I passed that way, and if any of his wood was at hand, I should take it up to the wharf; I called sundry times; I went away with a piece, and sometimes without a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet the Captain there?</p>

               <p>Carr. He told me so; I never saw the prisoner before in my life; he said he had a parcel of mahogany, and asked if I would buy it; he said, there was about two thousand foot. I told him I would rather chuse the selling, of it, than the buying of it, if he would give me a commission; he said he had spoke to Mr. Heard, and he would know his mind before he would give me a commission; he came again and said, he was not at home, and he would not stay any longer, because he wanted money; he said it was at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf; I went; there were about ten pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew them to you?</p>

I bought some timber on board the ship Chance, of Mr. Richmond, it was mahogany; I bought some short heads; some nine inches, some a foot, some twenty inches; this piece I bought singly by itself a fortnight afterwards; that is a log; there was nothing in the ship but itself; I bought it of Mr. Richmond.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the ends you bought?</p>
               <p>Tate. Three pounds three; there was nothing in the ship but them, when I was there; there was nothing of the cargo on board at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these marks enough to make you know what letters?</p>
               <p>Gorden. No; it is just the same wood that is shipped; and this piece, there is not such another piece on the shore; this is what they call a crutch; and nobody gets them but myself; I know it must be mine by the shape of the log; nobody in the country cuts such but me.</p>
               <p>Clifford. He has swore as positive to my piece, which appears not to be his mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you refuse to have it brought to court?</p>
               <p>Clifford. Because it would damage the piece; it has lain up six days for any body to look at.</p>
               <p>Gorden. I have seen the wood at Hodders; there is an L on it; but I swore more from the nature of the wood than the mark; I bought it of the people in the country; I consign'd it to Mr. Massom; my people sell'd it; nobody in the country has got negroes to cut wood but me.</p>

            . I was a foremast man on board this ship. When I was on shore I observed a piece of mahogany buried in the sand; I was at the taking of it up, the prisoner took it; it is a frequent thing to find mahogany buried in the sand. I was at the cutting it; and this particular piece that has been produced here as one of the pieces belonging to the cargo is part of the piece that I found buried in the sand. I know the prisoner had four or five more pieces on board; there was among the cargo shipped on board this ship a piece of carbuncle wood, that is a piece of mahogany, which I suppose had been cast away in some ship that had been there before; it had shell fish sticking about it, and was worm-eaten. This I reckon to be the white wood they talk of, that was hoisted into the ship as part of the cargo for the benefit of the owners. It is a frequent thing on board these ships, when pieces don't go in cleverly, so as to stow well, they hawl them out again, and chip off part of them; and if an officer does not stand by, the sailors are as apt to cut where the marks are as any where else. They screw the logs in; and if a mark should happen to be put upon a place where it is splintered, they may by thrusting them in, break off the marks.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bonnet. When the people were brought into the room, I fixed upon Gumpay Humphreys, without any token given whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Bond pointing to Gumpay Humphreys, before you fixed on him?</p>
               <p>Bonnet. There was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember before that, Bureau saying that is Mr. Humphreys?</p>
               <p>Bonnet. No, he said, after I had fixed on him, that is Mr. Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you did not know the man, it being six months ago, that perhaps he might alter?</p>
               <p>Bonnet. No, I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Did not Mr. Bond stand next to me?</p>
               <p>Q. I took no notice of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gines. I was present at the examination of Gumpay Humphreys; about fifteen or twenty persons were called in, out of another room, and Humphreys was set about the middle of the semicircle without any particular mark, or any thing whereby he could be known or distinguished. A profound silence was observed, and Mr. Bonnet stept forward, and with great caution and deliberation he passed from man to man, without receiving any hint or direction<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230071"/> whatever; he went up to Gumpay Humphreys and said that is the man: as to what Bureau said, that was not till afterwards, nor did Mr. Bond at all point with his pen to Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is what the prisoner said, that Mr. Bonnet did not fix upon Humphreys till Bond pointed at him with his pen, and Bureau said that is the man, false or true?</p>
               <p>Gines. It is false, every syllable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bonnet say that he did not know the man; that it was six or eight months ago, and a man might alter?</p>
               <p>Gines. No; so far from it, that he plainly shewed he did not know the man.</p>

            . I was present at the examination of Gumpay Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bonnet say he did not know Gumpay Humphreys, for it was six or eight months ago, and a man might alter.</p>
               <p>Sibby. I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Bonnet do when he came into the room?</p>
               <p>Sibby. He was ordered to fix upon the man; he went cautiously from man to man, and he fixed upon Gumpay Humphreys, and said that is the man: some little time after I saw that he was the man; I perfectly knew him, he having been three different times at my master's house: Bond did not point to Humphreys, and Bureau did not say that was the man till after my master had fixed upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner to Mr. Bonnet. Did not you look hard at me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bonnet. I did, and there is something of a likeness between ye.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you point with a pen to Humphreys?</p>
               <p>Bond. Upon the solemn oath that I have taken, I did not, and I don't know that I had a pen in my hand at that time : the prisoner was brought into the room, Mr. Bonnet and Mr. Gines were in the other room; we ordered every person in the outward office to come in and the prisoner to be mixed with them: when they were all come in I believe Humphreys stood about the middle, Bureau stood at the right hand of the room, I was to the left of Humphreys; I was two or three from him, they were all still and quiet; Mr. Bonnet was desired to go round the room, to see if he could pitch upon the man, and he pitched upon Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say, before he fixed upon him, that he did not know him?</p>
               <p>Bond. No.</p>
