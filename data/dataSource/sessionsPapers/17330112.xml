On (the 28th of last October) the Day before my Lord Mayor's-Day, I agreed to go out a Fishing with the Prisoner, and I was to have a Groat in the Shilling of what we made of the large Fish, and half the small Fish, as is usual. We went from Hammersmith to Fulham, and there he left me 3 Days, while he went to his Wife to get some Money of her, and then he came to me, and we went to Sheerness ; but getting no Fish there, we went to Feversham, and from thence to Woolstaple-Bay, where having caught some Fish, we return'd to Feversham to sell them. We set the Boy on Shore with the Fish, and then put off again; but the Shore being very slippery the Boy let the Fish fall, upon which the Prisoner desir'd me to put too again; he went to the Boy, and beat him with a Rope, and return'd to the Boat, when presently the Boy fell down again; the Prisoner again went a-shore and beat him, and so return'd a second time-to the Boat; the Boy happen'd to fall a third time, upon which the Prisoner went a-shore once more, and he and the Boy went away together. The Boy came on Board again at Night, but the Prisoner did not come till next Morning, and threaten'd to beat the Boy for asking some Body at Feversham for a bit of Bread. Says the Boy, I hope there was no harm in asking for a little Bread when I was very hungry ? Well, says the Prisoner, I won't beat you now, but I'll give it you by and by when we come into Queenborough-Grounds. So we row'd through Queenborough-Grounds by Milton-Creek's Mouth towards Sheerness ; then the Prisoner took a 2 Inch Rope, and splitting it into 7 Strands, he ty'd 3 Knees in each Strand, and stripping the Boy stark naked (except only his Shoes and Stockings) he whipt him with this Cat of nine Tails, for I believe, full three Quarters of an Hour by the Clock, and then 2 Fishermen came up, and said, Why don't you kill the Boy out-right? You had better hurl him over-board at once, and put him out of his Misery. Upon that the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120003"/> left off beating the Boy, and made him put his Cloaths on again.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe any Marks on the Boy's Back?</p>
               <p>Sugg. Yes, it was all black and blue, and wheal'd, and his Eye was cut some how in whipping; and when the Prisoner saw that, he threw the Cat-o'-nine-Tails over-board, and said, I am sorry I have beat you so much, but I'll never beat you any more. Then we went to Sheerness, where we staid 2 Days. The Prisoner and I drank together, and he and the Boy were good Friends. But going out to work next Morning he beat the Boy again, because the Boy had eat more Victuals than he intended to let him. Sirrah! says he, if you offer to eat a bit of Bread without asking my leave, I'll strip your Skin over your Shoulders. Two Days after this, when we were at work, he beat the Boy with a Helm-stick (the Titler, that we steer the Boat with) because he had eat some Victuals without asking leave. And when he had done beating him, he stript him to see if he was black and blue, and I saw the Blood was ready to start out of his Skin. Then we return'd to Sheerness, and were all good Friends again; but after this he beat the Boy again, because he was lousy, and he took some of the Lice, and thrust them into the Boy's Mouth, and swore, damn his Soul he'd make him eat them. The Boy told me, that he could not keep himself clean, for he had been 3 Months with his Master, and had had but 1 Shirt to his Back in all that time. After this the Prisoner and I quarrel'd and fought together.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you quarrel about?</p>
               <p>Sugg. I told him I would not work any more with him if he abused the Boy so.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you no other Motive?</p>
               <p>Sugg. Yes; he did not do by me as he should do about the Fish, for he went to Billingsgate and sold seven hundred, which I was to have had my share of, but he spent all the Money except Six-pence, and so we parted. But before this parting, I had taken up a Fisherman's Lave-Net, and put it into the Prisoner's Boat; and three Days after parting I met the owner of the Lave-Net, and told him of it, so we went together on board the Prisoner's Boat to fetch it; we asked the Boy where it was, and he said he knew nothing of it (for the Prisoner being there, I suppose the Boy was afraid to say it was there, without leave ) but the prisoner bid him see for it, and then he went and fetch'd it. I believe his Master had just been beating him afresh, for he was in a sad condition; his right Eye was cut down half an inch (it was his left Eye that was cut before) and his Cheek was cut a matter of two Inches down; the Blood was running fresh from those Wounds, and it run from his Head like a Spout.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Sugg. I forget the Day of the Month, but it was on a Tuesday, about six Weeks or two Months ago. And four-Days after this, the Prisoner brought the News to Billingsgate, that his Boy was dead. He said that he fell from the Mast-Head, and killed himself; but that was impossible, for his Mast is so low, that a Man may stand upon his Boat's Head and reach the top of it.</p>
               <p>Will. Finch. I saw the Prisoner beat the Boy barbarously with a Tiller, at Sheerness Dock;

             (the last Witness) was then in the same Boat; I ridicu'd the Prisoner for so doing; You Villain! You Rascal you! says I, your Master never served you so! About a Week or a Fortnight after (I am not certain to the time, but it was upon a Friday-night) the Prisoner brought the Boy dead in his Boat to Hammersmith, and there he run her a-ground, and left the Boy in her all Night.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see that?</p>
               <p>Finch. No; but the Boat was found there next Morning, and the Prisoner was gone to Billingsgate.</p>
               <p>Court. But how do you know that the Prisoner brought the Boat in over Night?</p>
               <p>Finch. Next Morning his Father came to my House crying; I asked him what was the Matter? He said Matter enough, his Son had brought his Boy home dead. I said it was no more than I expected.</p>
               <p>Court. What his Father told you is no Evidence.</p>
               <p>Finch. But I met the Prisoner himself not long after, and he said, What Cheer Finch? Pretty Cheer indeed, says I, you have made a fine piece of Work of it! your Boy is dead it seems, but it's what I expected. Why, says he, I own I have beat the Boy, but that was not the Cause of his Death.</p>

            . About two Weeks before the Boy's Death, I was at Sheerness, and having some Fish to sell, I borrowed a Basket of the Boy (in the Prisoner's Absence) and in about half an Hour the Boy came to me crying, and said, Give me the Basket, my Master is going away. I asked him why he cry'd? He said his Master had knocked him down backwards two or three times with his Fist for lending me the Basket. I saw the Boy when the Coroner sat, his Body was blackish, and had several Wounds.</p>

            . I am a Waterman at Hammersmith. On the 2d of December between One and Two in the Morning, the Prisoner's Father called and said, he had got a job for me that Tide; so I went down to the Water-side, and there I found the Prisoner putting the Fish out of his Boat into mine. He said he wanted me to carry that Fish to Billingsgate. Says I, How came you to bring this Fish by Billingsgate last Night, and now want me to carry it back thither? Why, says he, something has happened. So he laid down in the Boat sleep, and ordered me to land him at Card Alley (by the Old Swan.) When we came there, he fetch'd a Basket and sorted the Fish, and bade me go to Billingsgate and sell them. I asked who was his Market-Man, and he said, Blackbourn. The Prisoner went Home to Hammersmith that Night on foot, and I believe got there before me.</p>

            . The Prisoner's Wife and Sister came to me, and said, Can you make a Coffin? Yes, says I, have you brought the Measure? No, says his Sister, but if it is as high as my Shoulder it will do; and it must be done by six at Night. Before I had carried the Coffin Home, the Prisoner came and desired me to lend him a Hand to bring the Body from the Boat. I asked him if he had a Justice's Warrant for moving the Body; and he said, Yes. So he took a Lanthorn (for it was between 8 and 9 at Night) and I and another went with him to the Blue Anchor at the Water-side; when we came we found the Boat lay off from the Shore; so we took another Boat, and

So I put my Hand under the Head of the Boat, and felt the naked Body; it was crouded up so close there, that I thought it impossible to thrust a dead Body into so little room; and therefore it was my Opinion, that the Boy had crept in there for fear of being beat, and so had died in the Place. I was above an Hour in getting the Body out; but at last, I got it thro' a Hole 14 Inches square; it had no Clothes on, only it was wrapp'd up in a Red-rug. So says I to the Prisoner, Where's the Boy's Clothes? Why, says he, the Clothes are all bloody, for he fell from the Mast and kill'd himself. Then we went a-shore, and I put the Body a-thurt [athwart] the young Man's Shoulders, the Prisoner went before with the Lanthorn, I staid a little to launch the Boat off, and then follow'd. When the Prisoner came to the Lane's end, he was taken from us by the Constable. I help'd the young Man to carry the Body to the Prisoner's house, and there I laid it a-thurt a Bed, and then the Prisoner's Wife desir'd me to fetch the Coffin. I went, and when I return'd, the Body was made clean, and lay on a Table with the Back upwards.</p>

            . On Thursday (the Day before the Boy died) I went unto Sheerness, and there I saw the Prisoner and his Boy; it was then a very hard Frost. The Boy had nothing on but a Serge Waistcoat and Breeches, and he said he had been at Work all Night and all Day in the Cold, and had had no Victuals. He was wet to the Skin, and I seeing a dry Jacket in the Boat, said to him, Sirrah, why don't you put on that Jacket? I did put it on, says the Boy; but my Master made me pull it off again, and beat me, and broke my Head here about my Temples. Says I to the Prisoner, How can you use the poor Boy so, he is ready to perish with Wet and Cold, he'll never live to see London again? Then the Prisoner went a shore for a Pint of Gin (whether he intended any of it for the Boy or not I cannot tell) but when he was gone the Boy shew'd me his Head. There was a Wound in the Temples, and the Flesh was bruised and black all about it; and I afterwards understood that the Boy did not live above 5 Hours after.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think those Wounds were the Cause of his Death?</p>
               <p>Dafforn. I believe those Wounds and want of looking after, and Hunger and Cold together, were the Cause of his Death, and especially Hunger and Cold; for we must all dye if we have nothing to eat or keep us warm.</p>

I examined the Body of the deceased, I found nothing in the Thorax or Abdomen that could occasion his Death; I observed a Contusion in his Arm, upon which I raised the Skin, and found the Muscles discoloured, but nothing that could cause his Death, he had no other Wound but that in his Head.</p>

I sat down there, and pulled out my Watch, to see what o'Clock it was, and when I had staid some time I went away; I had not been gone above three Minutes before I mist my Watch, upon which I went back to the Shop, but she was gone. I asked the Man of the House if he knew her, he said yes; I bid him look for her, and if he could get my Watch again I would give him a Guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the Linkmen came into Mr. Puddington's Brandy Shop and attacked you, did not you take out your Watch, and did not I bid you take Care of it, and did not you then put it into my Hand?</p>
               <p>Gouge. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did, as God is my Judge; but you was so drunk that you was hardly sensible, you called for 6 half Pints of Gin, and paid Puddington 2 s. for it.</p>

               <p>Court. It may be necessary to ask you to what Degree, are you sure you was so far sensible as to be now capable of giving an Account of what you did then?</p>
               <p>Gouge. I remember my sitting by Paddington, and giving him Liquor, and that when I went out I consider'd what Company I had been in, and thereupon felt for my Watch, and mist it.</p>

            , Headborough of St. Giles's. I went to the Round-house between 3 and 4 o' Sunday Morning, the 24th of December. The Prisoner was there, and I heard she had been stripp'd naked, to search for a Gold-Watch that had been stolen from a Gentleman; but to no Purpose. Puddington being there too, he said he had some Reason to suspect she had put it in a private Place, and upon hearing that, she presently shew'd me the Place he spoke of, and bid us search and welcome. He and I refused, but

The Prosecutor and Prisoner came into my Shop between 2 and 3 in the Morning, they staid there about 2 hours, and then he went out and she after him; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120007"/> returned in 4 or 5 Minutes, and asked for her. I told him she was gone, but I knew where she liv'd, and would endeavour to find her out ; I found her in her Room up two pair of Stairs, and had her before Justice Mercer; she deny'd that she had any Watch. The Justice sent for the Governor of the Round-House, whose Son came, and we conducted her to the Round-House, where she stripp'd herself to be search'd, but we found nothing upon her, and so she put on her Clothes again. I went out, but before I had gone far, I recollected that as we went along with her from the Justice's to the Round-House, I had seen her stooping forward, and poking with her Right-hand in her Pocket thus - and with her Left-hand a good deal lower thus - so I went back, and said, Bab, you have certainly got this Watch about you. Where have I got it? Says she. I told her in what Place. Why then, says she, as you are a married Man, you may search; and with that as she sat in the Chair, she parted her Feet, and remov'd the Covering, I refus'd to search, and so did Mr. Cross; but we told the Governor it was his Business, and at last he agreed to do it. When she found we were come to a Resolution, she made some Resistance; but I and Mr. Cross kept her Feet in a proper Situation, while the Governor examin'd the Premises; after some search he call'd out, and told us, that he had got hold of the Chain at last; but says he, I had much ado to reach it, and with that he drew the Watch out, and in a sad Condition it was; we cleansed it, and carried it to the Gentleman, who own'd it to be his; and then it was carry'd before the Justice, by whom it was seal'd up, and now we have it here.</p>

About 9 I was told that my House was broke, I went home and found both my back Door and fore Door open, and that I had been robb'd. I was a new Comer, my House was not quite fitted up, nor made so secure as it might be; my back Door was fastened with a wooden Pin that went into a Hole in the Wainscot; my fore Door had a Lock, but between the Lock and the Staple there was a hollow place through which the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120009"/> Lock might be push'd back. Behind my House was a Yard, with a dead Wall 8 Foot high. The hole in the Wainscot where the Pin of the back Door went in was burst, so that I suppose the Entry was made that way.</p>

He had tied a piece of a white Shoes about him like an Apron, and put a Woman's Apron over his Shoulders; he slopt his Hat over his Nose, and over that he wrapt another piece of Linnen, one end of which he brought down to his Mouth. I could not guess the meaning of all this, but he told me he was in great Poverty, and afraid of being arrested, and that he wanted me to go and carry a Gown to his Daughter, that she might come out to speak with him, for she had never a Gown to put on. He took me thro' Rag-Fair, where he bought an old pair of Shoes, and coming into Penitent-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120010"/> he pointed to a Door, and said, There my Daughter lives, carry this Gown and these Shoes, and bid her put them on, and come to me at the Corner of the Street, where I will wait for her. It was then about 10 at Night. I deliver'd my Message to her, and while she was striking a Light, he follow'd; Father! says she, my Mother's gone to Newgate! for God's sake make your Escape! get away Backwards, for the House is beset by Kemp and several more. Upon hearing that he ran down Stairs, and got away; but Mr. Kemp coming in seiz'd me with the Gown and Shoes, and carried me to the Justice's House; but the Justice not being at home, his Clerk order'd me to be confin'd. I begg'd it might be in my own Room then, because as I got my living by charing in several creditable Families, if it should be known that I was committed to Prison on any such Account, it would be the Ruin of me. Mr. Kemp consented, and went and set with me himself, in my own Room. About 12 that Night, some Body knock'd at my Door, Who's there? says I. A Man answer'd

            . Now, says I, to Mr. Kemp, you may go down and take him; so I went down to Banks, and he ask'd me, if I had deliver'd the Goods as he order'd me? I told him, Yes; for being a naked Woman, I was afraid of some Mischief if I said otherwise, while he and I were alone in the Street. So then we went into a Brandy-Shop that was just by, and presently Mr. Kemp came in, and the Prisoner was taken.</p>

He struck her no more after the Light came, but turned her Face up and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120012"/> stamp'd about, and fell on his Knees, and said, my dear Betty, I fear I have killed you, but if I have I will never leave you, but will freely be hanged for you.

I view'd her afterwards, her Head and Body were full of Contusions all over; I never saw any one in the like Condition. There was a large Cut in her Head, and her Head was 'swell'd in Comparison as big as a Peck. I opened the Muscles that cover the Skull, and found a large Quantity of extravasated Blood lying on the Sutors, which were in a manner separated. I believe there might be a Pint, or a Pint and a half of Blood, for I took out several Handfuls. This extravasated Blood must have been caus'd by external Blows, and having such an Effect upon the Sutors must have been the Cause of her Death, and therefore I had no Occasion to open the Skull, or examine any farther.</p>

Nine Guineas, 11 Shillings, and 12 penny worth of Halfpence; a Silver Punch-Ladle, 2 Silver Spoons, 3 Gold Rings, 2 Pair of Silver Buckles, a Pair of Shoes, 4 Pair of Gloves, a Silk Hood, 3 Knives, one of them was a Pen-knife, and several other Things that I can't remember.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you leave the Box when you went up?</p>
               <p>M. H. It stood on a Trunk in my Bed-room, on the same Floor with the Publick Room in the Cellar. The Door of my Room was left open, but the Box was lock'd.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find your Goods again?</p>
               <p>M. H. I found the Box, and some of my Goods, at the Bull-Head in Wells's Yard in Tottenham-Court Road, where he had taken a Lodging; but all my Money, 2 of the Gold Rings, and other Things, were quite lost. This honest Man here apprehended him, and he was admitted to Newgate ; and as he was going thither, he sent a Messenger to the other Prisoner Gore, to desire Gore to bring him all the Money he could raise. The Messenger shewed me the Directions, and we got a Warrant and search'd Gore's Room, where we found a Pair of Gloves, and two Knives, that I had lost. Gore was frighted, and said if we would not hurt him he would tell us where the Box was. We promis'd to be favourable if he would confess all he knew; and so he directed us to Emerton's Lodgings. Upon that we discharg'd Gore, only the Justice bound him over to be an Evidence against Emerton. But after this Gore sent my Punch-Ladle to pawn (which he told us before that he knew nothing of) and so he was taken up again. I and my Husband are poer old Folks, we had taken a great deal of Pains to scrape a little Money together; and that Rogue Emerton ( tho' I had given him a good Dinner that Day) robb'd us of all, and left us but 3 pence ha'peny in the World.</p>

            , of whom I had some Knowledge, the Handle was broke off; says I, you have made strange work with this Ladle? Ay, says he, a sad Accident happened when this was done, for a China Punch bowl was broke at the same time. So I jump'd over the Counter, and seiz'd him, What do you mean 'Saule me? No, says I, but I'll pepper you, if you don't tell me how you came by that. He told me, he had it from Gore, who was at an Alehouse (the Sign of the Theatre) in Drury-Lane ; I went thither, and found Gore a playing at Cards; but he play'd the wrong Card then. Says Tool, that's the Man I had the Ladle from, and Gore after some Shuffling, and pretending that his Wife save it to Tool, at last confess'd that he himself delivered it to Tool.</p>

            , Headborough. Gore let us search his Room readily, and told us where the Box was, at Emerton's Lodging in Wells-Court by St. Giles's Pound; there was a Shirt hanging in Gore's Room, and says he, When Emerton sent you to me for Money, I suppose he meant I should pawn this Shirt.</p>
               <p>Gore. They took away a pair of my Shoes, I hope I may have them again?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Holder. Yes, there was a pair of Shoes that are none of mine, and they are in the Box there.</p>
               <p>Court. Then as they are not yours, and he claims them, let him have them: Officer, give those Shoes to the Prisoner, and if there's any thing else that belongs to him, let him have it.</p>
               <p>Gore. I thank your Lordship, I claim nothing else.</p>

I had used Mrs. Holder's Cellar 3 Weeks Night and Day, and I happening<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120016"/> to meet with a young Man of my Acquaintance, John, says he, I can't come out for fear of being arrested; but there's a Box of mine in Mrs. Holder's Room, which I want very much, and if you will be so kind as to bring it to me, I shall be much obliged to you. You may take it away without any more to do, for no Body will ask you any Questions about it. So I took the Box and carried it up. The Girls called after me, and I told 'em I was coming again presently.</p>
               <p>Court. And why did you not return according to your Promise, or at least acquaint the Prosecutor with it?</p>
               <p>Emerton. My Friend kept me to drink with him longer than I expected, and besides I ow'd her a little Money, about 3 s. which I could not pay her till I had Remittances out of the Country, which I afterwards received indeed; but my Friend hearing of it, he desired me to lend him 15 s. upon the Ladle and the Rings, which I did, and then he told me he had some other odd Trifles in the Box, which I might make Use of if I had occasion, and so I took the Box to my Room; but he not returning me the 15s. at the time he promised, and I wanting Money, I gave the things to Gore's Wife to pawn, and she brought me 6 s.</p>

Ackers afterwards took the Knife from Goodman, and threw it over a House; then we all went through St. Martin's Court, where we bought 8 pennyworth of Meat at a Cook's Shop, and so to an Alehouse in Drury-lane. I don't know the Sign, but it is the corner of a Court that goes to Blackmore-street, and is next door to a Tin Shop. There we eat the Meat and spent 17 Pence half penny in Beer and Bread.</p>
               <p>Court. What Meat was it, and how was it drest?</p>
               <p>Mascall. It was ready drest, but cold, I believe it was roasted; it was a sort of a Breast of Mutton, there was 2 pieces, and one had a Marrow-bone to it.</p>
               <p>Booth. Does a Marrow-bone belong to a Breast of Mutton?</p>
               <p>Mascall. I don't say that both pieces were the Breast. From thence we went to a Pawnbroker's in Bowl-yard, where Welton had pawn'd his Goat for 4 s. and we redeemed it. Then we went to a House we constantly use, the King's-Arms, the Corner of Lawrence-Lane in St. Giles's. 'Tis a grand bandy House, where they harbour Thieves and Whores, and let 'em in at all Hours in the Night. There we had some Beer, and I being about to go home, asked them to let me have a Shilling; they denied me at first, but afterwards Ackers and Booth came out and gave it me, and I went away and bought some Victuals with it for my Family, but the Prisoners lay there together.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know?</p>
               <p>Mascall. They commonly lie there, and I found 'em there at 9 o' Clock the next Morning; then they gave me one Shilling more for my Share, so that I got but 2 s. in all.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to differ?</p>
               <p>Mascall. I heard that Goodman was going to make himself an Evidence, and so I got the Start of him, and went voluntairly before Justice Hilder and made my Information. Goodman was taken with the rest, but he was afterwards admitted an Evidence too. The Robbery was on the 12th of December, and I made my Information on the 18th of December.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you meet before you went out upon this Robbery?</p>
               <p>Mascall. We met that Morning as usual about nine o' Clock, at the King's-Arms, and there we staid till between 6 and 7 at Night, and that's the Time we commonly go out to pick Pockets, and what Handkerchiefs we meet with we bring to the Woman at the King's Arms; then we get our Suppers, and afterwards turn out upon Street-Robberies. That Night we went round all the Streets till we came to Albemarle Street, and there we stood by the Garden to look-out, till we met with the Prosecutor. We had three Pistols among, us, Ackers, Booth, and Goodman had each of 'em one, but I had none that Night. I had been out with them but three Weeks; the first Time was the 11th of November, when I committed that Robbery with Booth. I was a Carter before, and a Master, but I met with Losses.</p>
               <p>Booth. Kirk the Thief-catcher lent him those Pistols to produce here in Court.</p>

He took Viner White, (when I and Sutton were Evidences* ) and he had 9 l. odd for his part of the Reward. I set down a Candle by him at the King's-Arms, and it happened to burn his Wig, upon which he swore that Jobb should fetch him 140 l.

We bought some cold Mutton at a Cook's Shop (I don't know the Name of the Place) it cost about 8 d. there were two or three odd Pieces of it ready dress'd; I believe it was roasted; one was a Marrow-bone Piece.</p>
               <p>Court. And what was the other?</p>
               <p>G. They were both Marrow-bone Pieces. Then we went to an Alehouse in Drury-Lane (I don't know the House) and there we had 3 or 4 Pots of Ale, and broil'd the Mutton and eat it. We spent about 18 d. we did not stay a great while there, but went to the King's-Arms the Corner of Lawrence-Lane, where we always used to lie, and there we all went to Bed.</p>

               <p>G. Yes, I think so; except Mascall; I believe he went away, for he did not use to lie there because he has a Wife; but Ackers, Welton and Booth lay together, I saw them a-bed. We were all together next day at the same House.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mascall there?</p>
               <p>G. I can't say, but he used to come every Morning. We divided the Money over Night; I and Mascall had 2 s. a-piece, and there was 4 s. paid to fetch Welton's Coat out of pawn.</p>

            , a Watchman, found the Prisoner that Night, and brought him to my House. He had my Boy's Hat upon his Head, and his Wig in his Pocket; he fell on his Knees, and begg'd me to be favourable; my Wife was under some Concern about him as he was a Neighbour's Child, and desired me not to prosecute, and being but a trifling Master I let him go to Bed; but three Hours afterwards, Allen came again, and says he, If you won't prosecute him, I will prosecute you, and so I was obliged to send him hither, which otherwise I should not have done; for I never knew that he followed such Courses, and his Father who is a Pipe-maker and lives in the Neighbourhood bears a very honest Character.</p>

            , Watchman. Between 10 and 11 at Night, Mrs Chapman told me that her Child was robb'd of his Hat and Wig, and that her Husband was gone to look for 'em. A Girl came up and said she had heard that Mr. Fretwell's, Son had got the Hat and Wig, and that some were gone after him to Charing-Cross; then says Mrs. Chapman, I'll see that he shan't go without being prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mrs. Chapman say so?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Her Husband swears she desired him not to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Allen. You shall hear how that was. I goes away, and meeting with my Brother Watchman,

            , I told him there was a Street Robbery committed by Mr. Fretwell's Son.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you heard of a Reward for taking Street-Robbers?</p>
               <p>Allen. I had to, but what I did, was not for the Sake of the Reward I'll assure you; so Bird found the Prisoner and brought him to me, and I carried him to Mr. Chapman; then Mrs. Chapman being frighted, desired her Husband to excuse him: Upon which Mr. Cross, (who lodges in Mr. Chapman's House) says to me, since Mrs. Chapman is frighted and is not willing the Lad should be sent to Newgate, if you will let him go, I will give you a Bond of Honour to secure you.</p>
               <p>Court. A Bond of Honour?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes, I am sure he said a Bond of Honour: Then says I, you ought to secure the Prosecutor too. Well, Allen says he, let us keep it as quiet as we can and there will be no Danger. The Prisoner shall go to the Place where the Child was robb'd, and deliver the Hat and Wig to him; so we went, and after the Child had got his Hat and Wig again, I up with my Staff and gave the Prisoner a Knock on the Breast, and said, was not you a Villian to wrong such an innocent Child?</p>
               <p>Court. What Right had you to assault him after he had been discharged by the Prosecutor, and while he behaved himself peaceably?</p>
               <p>Allen. I did nothing in Derision of Justice, but only in Resentment.</p>
               <p>Court. If the Jury should discharge him, he may perhaps make you pay for your Resentment. Why did you afterwards threaten to prosecute Mr. Chapman if he would not prosecute the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120021"/>A. You shall hear. After I came back I met the Prisoner about one a Clock, standing full in my Walk. Go about your Business, says I, why do you stand brazening here in the Face of Justice? You know this Thing has blacken'd you, and therefore you ought to keep use of Sight for a quarter of a Year, and then if you mind your Work, and behave your self as you should do, perhaps there may be no more Notice taken of it. Lord, says he, I am very told! Well, says I, there's a Half-penny to buy you a Dram, and let me see you no more in my Walks. So I went my Rounds, and coming to my Brother Watchman's Stand, there I saw the Prisoner again. Now, are not you a graceless Villian, says I, to stand so outdaciously here to affront Justice, when I gave you a Charge to the contrary? and with that I gave him another Knock with my Staff.</p>
               <p>Court. And for what Reason, because he stood in your Way? Was it an Insult upon Justice to appear in your Presence without Leave?</p>
               <p>Allen. Why, suppose any of my Inhabitants had been robb'd, or any of the King's Subjects had been murdered, as I am his Majesty's Officer, the Blame would have been laid upon me, for not making Use of my Authority, in taking Care to prevent such Mischief: And therefore I took the Prisoner, and carried him again to Mr. Chapman ; and Sir, says I, This Villain has not stood in Defiance of your good Nature only, but in Defiance of Justice and Authority, and therefore if you don't prosecute him, I'll proceed against you in a Process of Justice.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that it was a windy Night, and that he found the Hat and Wig. The Jury <rs id="t17330112-39-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

I took him in, and he lodged there till October following. He pretended to belong to the India House, and that he had great Effects and Interest there, and could help me to a Place of 12 s. a Week: At last he said he had done my Business, for he had secured the Place, and if I would go with him I might have it directly. So we went to the Ship-Tavern against the India-House; he went over to the India House, and coming back again told me it was all done, and only wanted signing. My Watch and Cane lay upon the Table; he took them, and said he'd take those with him because he should make the better Appearance, and so he went out again, but never returned. The Night before this I lost a silver Cup, and I have Witness to prove that he took it.</p>

He said he was Boatswain of the Grantham which was cast away, and that he should stay at the Prosecutor's House till she was sitted up, that he had 30 s. a Week, and was to receive 50 l. at Woolwich. He ordered me to make him as many Cloaths as came to 20 l. I was drinking with him over Night at the Prosecutor's, when he took up a silver Cup and looked on it. I did not see him, lay it down again. The Cup was mist, the Landlady enquired for it; says I to him, What can become of this Cup that you was looking on, don't let us have it missing when here's none but ourselves in the Room? Damn the Bitch, said he, I have the Cup, I only took it to frighten her, I'll give it her again, but I'll get a Pint of Brandy out of her first. So he called for a hot Pot, and then went to Bed. In the Morning I asked the Landlady if she had found the Cup, she said. No. I went up to the Prisoner (who was a-bed) and asked him why he kept the Cup so long ? Damn the Bitch, says he, I'll give it her as soon as I get up. He had given me 9 s. 9 d. in Earnest for the Cloaths he bespoke, and which I made for him; but being a little dubious of him, I would not deliver the Cloaths without my Money, nor return the Earnest, because I was likely to have the Cloaths left upon my Hands. When he found that, Damn the Fellow, says he, I'll have a Warrant for him to make him either deliver the Cloaths, or return the Earnest.</p>
