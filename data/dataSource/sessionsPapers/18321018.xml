I bowed to him, and he accosted me and asked where I was going; I said to Austin-friars, and from there to Broad-street - I had a letter in my hand which I was going to take there; we went on together, and just as we got through Austin-friars and into London-wall he asked me if I would take a drop of porter; I said I had no objection, but he said he had no money - I said I did not mind, and we went into the public-house at the corner, and had a pint of porter; I paid for it - we stood and drank it - we came out of there with my letter in my hand which I was going to deliver, and he said he was very much in distress, and asked me if I knew four or five gentlemen whom he named, who belonged to the India-house - I told him I certainly did, and he then said would I give him a shilling or two, as he was very much in distress; I told him I had no money in my pocket, but if he would call on me any day at the India-house, I certainly would give him a shilling or two: we still continued going on to Crown-court, Broad-street, where my letter was going; I gave in the letter to the person, and left the prisoner at the door - it was raining very fast; when I gave in the letter to the person, he asked if I would take a glass of something to drink - I said No, I could not, as I had a person waiting for me, and he asked the prisoner to go in, which he did, and we all had a glass together; when we got out the prisoner said he was in a great hurry, and he was going to Stepney - I said Broad-street was his nearest way, but he said he would go a little way with me, as I was going to another place; we went by the chapel in Moorfields, and then on to the square - I pointed up Sun-street, and said that was his way; I was going up Chiswell-street - he still kept with me, and said he must have a shilling or two, as he was very much in distress - I said, as I had before, that I had none, but if he would call at the India-house I would give it him - he said it was all d-d nonsense, he must have it now; he went on with me till we came to the brewhouse in Chiswell-street; he then called out Hey! and a tall man crossed over towards us - the prisoner said to him, "What do you think? this old b - r has brought me all the way from Cornhill, and took me to a house (meaning the house where I had left my letter,) and wanted to take liberties with me;" the other man said directly "You had better give him 5s., for if he calls at the India-house, and exposes you, it will be such a disgraceful thing;" I told him he could not do that, for my character was so well known there, I could defy him or any one else to hurt me; they still followed me up to St. Luke's church, using bitter oaths - I went to where I had to go, and they followed me back, the prisoner still saying, "If you don't give me the money. I will give you in charge of a Policeman," and every pawnbroker's we came to, he said I had got a watch, which I could pawn - I objected to pawn my watch; he then said,"Give me one of your seals - that will fetch 5s.;" I said I should do no such thing, for I never was in a pawnbroker's in my life, but if he would call at the India-house, I would give him a shilling or two: in going along London-wall, they still followed me with violent threats, the prisoner kept saying if I did not give the 5s. he would charge me with the offence, and the other kept persuading me to give the 5s., and said it would expose me, for him to call on me - when we got to London-wall I called at a friend's house and said, "Mr. Jones, can you lend me 5s." - I was so alarmed I went to borrow the money to get rid of the parties; Mr. Jones gave me half a crown, two shillings, and one sixpence; I came out, and gave it to the prisoner - the other man then said, "Now I must have 5s. - you can't expect me to walk all this way for nothing;" I told him I had not any money, that I did not ask him to walk, and should not give him any thing - the prisoner then said,"I will give you half a crown of this - I know where to find him;" I said to him, "Do, and call, and I will give you the half-crown;" I then went home, and gave information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180004"/>to two or three officers about our place, and told them I expected a young man to call; he did not call till the Monday following, when he called and said, "How do you do, Mr. Pearsall? you promised you would show me the sale-room;" I said, "I can't now, for the sale is going on;" he then said, "Give me the half-crown" - I said, "I have no money now, but I am going out to my dinner;" he went down the steps with me, and two officers took him - I gave him the 5s., because I was so alarmed and afraid of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you in the same dress as you are now? A. Yes, I am always in the same dress - I asked you to have some porter at the house we went into: I did not follow you into Mr. Jackson's, at the corner of Finch-lane; we did not go that way - I had never spoken to you before; I had seen you pass, and bowed to you.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Why did you promise him the shilling or two? A. Because he mentioned the names of two or three gentlemen whom I knew, and I thought he was in distress - if I had had a shilling or two I should have given it to him, and I thought the gentlemen would have refunded it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you not ask me to stand in the passage while you went into the house, and did you not offer me a part of your umbrella. Witness. I really do not know whether I had an umbrella, but I do not think I had.</p>

             (City Police-officer No. 67.) I took the prisoner in charge, and found two handkerchiefs and a case on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day stated I had been to boy a pair of iron rings, and was going to Aldersgate-street; I stood in the street, reading a picture about black jokes; the prosecutor brushed by me two or three times, and then he asked me which way I was going, and if I would take part of his umbrella - I thanked him, and went with him to the house with the letter; he went in with it, came out, and said, "It is all right;" I asked what he meant, and he took me in, and he got some liquor - Mr. Russell sat a chair for me by the bed, which was turned up; they then shut the door, and began to act in a very unmanly way to one another, and to me; I was alarmed, and said if they did not let me out I would alarm the place - they did, and we went out; as we were going along a tall man came up to Pearsall; they went to two public-houses, and then he went to Jones, and borrowed some money - when he came out I bade him good day, and asked when I should call for the ticket for the Diorams, which he had promised me; he said, "In a day or two;" I called on the Monday at the India-house, and asked one of the porters to call him; they did, and he was all in a tremble - I asked him if he would give me the ticket, and show me the India-house - he put down his head, and went away; he came back again in the course of a few minutes, and had some papers in his hand; he then said he was going to his dinner - I went out with him, and an officer came and took me; I asked what for, and the prosecutor said I had wanted half a crown of him - I then stated about a young man coming up to him, and he said that he was my friend, and that I had called him with a whistle or a Hey! I had lived with Mr. Dawson in Great St. Helens, for four years.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEARSALL re-examined. Q. Is there any truth in the statement of your acting as he states? A. Not the least, and the other young man I never saw till he called him over with a Hay! I had the pint of porter and the glass of spirits.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you meet any officer after they spoke to you? A. Yes, several, but I was in such a fright I could not tell what to do.</p>
               <p>DAVID JAMES RUSSELL re-examined. Q. How long were these persons at your house? A. I suppose five or six minutes, not longer - I was there all the time, and never rose from my chair; I had a boot in my lap; they were in my presence all the time - there was not the least liberty taken all the time, and the prisoner never came further than the mat.</p>

On Monday, the 17th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving the house fast; I shout the door as usual, and locked it; I have a back door, but there is no ground belonging to me behind the house - the back door was bolted inside; all the windows were shut down; the front window shutters were shut - it has been a shop - the up stair back window was nailed down; half of the sash of the ground floor back window is without glass - I had fixed some wood against it; part of the wood was nailed, and part laid against it - nobody could get in without pushing it aside by violence; the house was being repaired, and I nailed a lime sieve against the window, and the wood against it was two new door frames, without the pannels: the upper half of the sash was glazed all but one pane, which was broken, and the lower sash had no glass - any person could put a hand through to unfasten it, with a deal of trouble - the sieve was nailed inside against the window frames; when I went out in the afternoon I looked in at the prisoner's door - she asked how I did; I said I was very ill, that I was going out, and should return about nine o'clock- she said I should have a light when I returned, as usual, and if she was out I should have it from her children; I returned about nine, and her eldest daughter gave me a light - I unlocked my door without any difficulty; I went into the prisoner's house, and saw her - she told me she had found my door open about eight o'clock; that she walked into the house, and called me at the foot of the stairs, but no answer was made, and she went out, and shut the door - I said, "Why did you call me? you knew I was out;" I do not recollect her answer; I went into my house, and shut the door; it has a spring lock - I did not miss any thing just then; but I undressed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went to bed - I had left my bonnet on the back of a chair, which I do not usually do; I got out of bed, to put my bonnet on a petticoat; I missed the petticoat - I had left it there when I went out - I missed a black silk dress, which was inside the petticoat, and it also contained a parasol - there was a clasp fixed to the waist of the dress, and a shawl was folded with the dress; the shawl and dress were folded up, and placed within the petticoat - I searched over the house, and found they were gone; I dressed myself, and went to Mrs. Hall's window; I tapped at her window repeatedly, and then she answered me - I told her to dress, and come in, as I wished to speak to her particularly - she came in, and I told her of my loss, took her up stairs, and showed her where the things were taken from, and when I came down with her, I said, "Look at that window, they have forced away the wood;" one of the door frames was drawn on one side, the sieve taken away, and thrown to the left of the window - she said, they had better take my life at once than murder me by inches - I asked her to go with me to the station-house; she said it was very late - I said I was determined the Police should have information of it; she went with me -I told my story there, and returned with her - I did not suspect her - I went to bed, and next morning asked her if any of the Police had left a message for me at her house - she said they had left none; I said I would not be put upon, I had been robbed before, and was determined to persevere, and recover these articles, and if she could find them by questioning any of the children in the neighbourhood if they had seen any body open the door, I should be obliged to her; on the Sunday morning after the robbery (the 23rd) about ten o'clock, she brought me the petticoat, containing the parasol and shawl - she said some boys had brought them to her, and that the black silk dress would be returned on the Monday morning - I understood her to say the boy said so - she said she had given the boy 1s. 1d. for what he had brought; I have the shawl, parasol, and petticoat here - I am sure they are mine; I have seen the clusp in possesion of a witness, and the dress in possession of a pawnbroker - they are worth 20s.</p>

I had not told her on whose charge I took her - I never knew the prosecutrix by the name of Neal; I did not know the prosecutrix: I told her she was in bed, and she must accompany me to the station-house; and as we went along I thought I heard a piece of paper being crumpled up in her hand; this was about thirty yards from the station-house, and when we got there I asked if she had any thing in her hand; she said she had not - I told her she had thrown some paper away then on the road; she denied it - she had a white handkerchief in her hand, and had let it fall, all but one corner, as she went along; I took a lamp, went to the spot where I thought I heard the paper crumple, and there found two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180006"/>pieces of a duplicate, which I produce - they were at the corner of two streets; this was about three o'clock in the morning - I saw, in the possession of Soper, the serjeant, two other pieces of a duplicate, corresponding with what I found - I searched the prisoner's room about half-past four o'clock that morning, and found in a small box a clasp, wrapped in paper: the box was under a show-board, under the window, inside the house; there was an unfinished house near the corner of the street where I found the pieces of the duplicate.</p>

I said to my friend" I don't know;" she said her door was wide open; I said, "What a shame - they are always playing her some tricks;" I directly went into the passage, and called Mrs. Cunningham! no answer was made; I shut the door, and came home - when she came home I asked if she had shut her door; she said Yes - I said I had found it open; she asked why I did not make a report of it, but I had not the presence of mind to do so - she knocked at my window at twelve o'clock; I went with her to the station, and next day she said she would reward any body to find it out for her - I asked if she liked to put a bill in the window; she said No, but if I made inquiry, and told the party she would not bring them to trial, she might recover the property, and said, "If you can find it out, recompense them; I don't care what you give;" a boy came one morning, and asked if there was not something lost and a reward offered; I said "Stop a bit" - he said he could not stop, that somebody wanted to speak to me at the corner of Catherine-street; I went there, and a young lad said, "Have not you lost something?" I said No, but I knew who had; he asked what were the articles - I told him, and said, "If you can tell where they are, let me know;" he asked if there was not 5s. reward - I said I did not know what it was; I gave the little boy a penny to go with me - the boy said he would send the things to me, which was done, and I gave the boy 1s.; I took them to Mrs. Cunningham, and said the boy would bring the other articles on Monday - I did not know what the articles were till the parcel was opened; the gown was not brought on Monday, and in the evening Mrs. Cunningham came and asked me to go and make inquiry for it - I went out, and saw the little boy who first came, and asked him about them in Bell-street - I was going to spend the evening with my landlord, and did not come home till late; I took the duplicate, and kept it till I came home, but was not so late as the Policeman says - he said there was a charge of felony against me; I asked what for - he said Mrs. Neal's: I said,"Where is she? can I see her?" he said No, I could not; I found my eldest girl at the station-house, and having the ticket in my hand, my fright was so great I did not know what to do, and tore the ticket; I did every thing to serve Mrs. Neal.</p>

I went to bed on the evening of the 28th of September, about nine o'clock, as I came home very tired- I looked round the house before I went up stairs, and it was all fast; the kitchen was fasted by a long bar across the shutter, which is inside the casement, so that I could not see whether that was fastened - it is an old fashioned casement; there is a French window to the drawing-room, and to the hall - the door was barred and locked, and had a bell on it; about two o'clock Mrs. Choppin awoke me, and said something; I listened, and heard something drop in my dressing-room, which is next to the bed-room; I burn a rush-light in my room - I got out of bed, lighted a candle, and Mrs. Choppin lighted another; while I was lighting the candle Mrs. Choppin said she dare say it was the servant getting up to make the butter - I immediately opened my bed-room door, and called Mary! some person immediately said "Hush!" softly - I looked forward, and two men rushed down stairs; they came out of the left-hand room, which is my boy's room, and went before me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180007"/>as I stood at my bed-room door I could see them as plain as possible, by the light behind me, which was on my bedroom drawers, opposite the door; I turned round to Mrs. Choppin - she put up the window, and called for help; a carter got over the yard gate and came in; I went down stairs directly, and found the glass door or window leading from the hall into the garden open; that was fastened the night before with a bar, and had a bell to it - my wife and servant had followed me down stairs, and when I got down I looked round, and saw lots of things in the hall; there were cruet-stands, clothes, brandy, and wine - two cellar or cupboard doors, in the hall were broken open, where I keep wine and other articles - the locks were broken right off; I then went to the drawing-room - the door was open- the drawer of the table had been taken out, and the plated snuffers, with silver edges, taken out, and put on the table; I then went into the kitchen, and found the door open, which had been shut at night; it had no lock, only a catch - I found the window shutters wide open; they had been opened by a piece six or eight inches square being cut out by a centre-bit - it was large enough to put through a hand and remove the bar, which was moved; a pane of glass was taken out of the leaden frame, which enabled them to open the casement, and bore the shutter: they had entered there, I have no doubt, and retreated through the hall door, as the bar and bell laid against the garden wall outside; I went from there to the parlour sideboard, and found all the silver tops off the pepper, mustard, and sugar-stands; the sideboard drawer was broken open - my writing-desk was broken open, and a very handsome silver pencil-case and a gold seal taken away; my wife's writing-desk was broken open, but nothing missed from it, and the bookcase was broken open, but nothing missed - the cupboard door was broken open, a tea caddy opened, and a silver spoon taken out; two salt-spoons and silver sugar-tongs were left on the table - some brandy and gin had been drank, which had been taken out of the cupboard; I told the carter to go on the road and give and alarm at Stamford-hill - we have no guard nearer then there; just as I was going to let the carter out, a man stood there, who I spoke to - we looked round the house, and went to bed; this was between two and three o'clock: I got up about seven - my brother-in-law came in, and Pye, the constable; we examined the windows, and found some chips and oil, which the tools had been greased with, and there was one piece of tobaccopipe, three or four inches long, with the bowl to it, and another piece; two little round phosphorus-matches, both of which had been lighted, and there were three or four more little bits of pipe - Pye took possesion of them, and one bit of pipe was left on the ground; that was a bit of pipe without the bowl; I rode up the London road, and at the turnpike I got information, and in the evening the carter came back, and about five o'clock a Policeman came down - I went over the premises with him, and when we got to the kitchen window I saw him pick up a bit of a tobacco-pipe, which I had thrown down in the morning - he put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your maidservant here? A. No; she remained below about two minutes after I went to bed, to bring up some hot water, which she brought into my room; I wished her good night, and she then went into her room - I heard her go into her room, and shut her door; she might have gone down stairs after I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you made some exclamation to the maid when you was alarmed, as to whether she had admitted any body into her room? A. As the man said Hush! I turned round to Mrs. Choppin, and said, "Why it ayn't right;" I said nothing to the maid about a sweetheart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it in the kitchen you threw down the tobacco-pipe? A. Outside, in the garden; I could see where it fell - it was in one piece, about an inch long, broken off the bowl; it was part of the pipe, which the bowl belonged to; Pye had taken away the bowl with the tobacco in it; there were about three inches of pipe to the bowl which he took away; I found one bit with the bowl, and one broken bit - Pye took away one piece, and the other dropped down again, and the officer afterwards took it away with him.</p>
               <p>Martin. Q. How did the carter get an entrance into your house? A. He got over the yard gate, not the garden gate; the garden gate was never unlocked - I let him out at the yard gate: they are both front gates - there were footmarks at the garden gate; I examined your shoes at the station-house on Sunday, to see if there were nails in them; there were no nails in the footmarks - the robbery was on Friday morning; I believe there had been rain between those times - the garden had been dug up the day before the robbery, and there were no footmarks before; it was the marks of two or three shoes - I cannot swear how long they were; I said one was long: Pye measured one with a rule, in my presence, and said it was about eleven inches long, and the other was a very short foot - he did not measure the short one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the footmarks on the gravel or on the bed? A. One the bed, by the side of the footpath; the footpath is gravel and drift - it was hard, and would not take an impression well.</p>

            . I am a Police-inspector. On Friday morning, about six o'clock, I was on duty at the Kingsland station, and observed the three prisoners coming along the road, in company together, towards town, in a direction from Eufield; I had heard of a robbery at the time, and told some of the men in the station to apprehend them, which was done - I asked where they had been; Smithers said they had been to Hertford; that was in a direction from Hertford; I detained them; and next day,(Saturday) at the Police-office, I searched Smithers, and in his coat pocket found this bit of a tobacco-pipe - I have had it ever since - I compared it with some other pipe before the Magistrate, in their presence; I compared it with a piece Williams produced, and it corresponds with it; the two ends fit as broken - it is not broken straight off, but dove-tailed; I afterwards went to the prosecutor's house, and observed they had removed a small pane of glass from the back kitchen window, and opened the shutter by a center-bit - some chips laid about under the window; I observed three or four footmarks in the garden - they were quite distinct; there was not more than two impressions which could be measured fairly - I did not remark whether they were large or small feet; I afterwards received the shoes of all the prisoners, and delivered them to Mellish.</p>
               <p>Martin. Q. How long after the robbery did you go to Choppin's house? A. The next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I went in at the front gate, but not where you got over; I saw no footmarks at the gate I went in at- they were close to the gate leading to the front of the house, not where the servants go in - I found no footmarks any where else.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received three pairs of shoes from the inspector, and took them to Mr. Choppin's on Sunday, the 30th; I went into the garden, and saw two footmarks against the front gate of the garden - they were near the gate, in the garden; I tried the shoes to the impressions, which were quite fresh - I found one shoe, belonging to Martin, correspond with one of the footmarks near the gate - it was in the mould, which was soft; the impression was distinct, except a small piece on the heel - a small part of the heel had caught against the box border; it seemed as if the impression had been made tip-toe; the toe was deeper - it was close against the fence, and appeared to be done by a person jumping down - I have no doubt whatever but the impression was made by that shoe; there were only two footmarks which I could compare - the other was so slight, I could not compare any of the shoes with it; in another part of the garden, near the hall window, I found another footmark, and tried Smithers shoes to it, and found one of his shoes corresponded exactly with the mark; it was a shoe without nails- there was nothing particular in the impression; it was a small shoe of the left foot - there was only the impresssion of one foot; a person stepping off the gravel path on to the border where the mark was, would reach the window with one foot, and the footmark pointed as if going to the hall window.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance from the fence was the mark which Martin's shoe matched? A. About a foot; I have no doubt whatever that the impressions were made by Martin's and Smithers' shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. On what day had the house been broken open? A. On the Friday; I have not heard Mr. Choppin examined - I believe there had been rain between the Friday and Sunday, but the rain did not at all interfere with the footmark, as it was shaded by a laurel tree; there had been very little rain at Enfield, I believe, though there had been a great deal in London - I only know that by inquiries I had made.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the mark of Martin's shoes towards the house or from it? A. The side of the footmark was towards the house.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOPPIN. I do not recollect that there was much rain between the Friday and Sunday; I think not - the impressions were not altered in the least; the garden had been raked over the day before the robbery - the descriptien given of the footmarks is very correct; one of the men I saw had gilt buttons as he went down stairs, and the other had dark clothes, and at the office Jones had gilt buttons; he has a mark on his face.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. On the Thursday previous to the robbery I started to look for work - my father gave me two sovereigns, and a letter of recommendation to go to Cambridge; I proceeded as far as Hertford, and finding I had lost the letter, I thought it useless to proceed - I returned, and by the station-house was taken into custody; had I been guilty I might have escaped several times - I was not handcuffed.</p>
               <p>Smithers' Defence. I was out of work, and went into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180009"/>the country - I found I could get none, and thought I would return to town; I came as far as Kingsland, went into the Brill, and was there about an hour, and had some beer and a pipe, and that is the pipe I gave the Policeman; when I came out of the public-house, which is about one hundred yards from the station-house; I was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Martin's Defence. I beg to call your attention to a few remarks; I have no friends to speak for me - at the first examination the prosecutor said he called in a carter, who jumped over the fence - now he must have made footmarks; the Policeman measured the footmarks, which were eleven inches, and my shoe measures longer; the Policeman did not fit them till three days after the robbery - I call your serious attention to this part of my case.</p>

            . I am a milkman On the 29th of July I lived at No. 1, Market-street, Edgware-road, about three minutes' walk from Clarke's - I was passing by his house on Sunday, the 29th of July, as near as I can judge, about a quarter after twelve o'clock in the day; I know the passage near Clarke's house leading to the public-house - I saw some men in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the persons you saw there? A. I certainly did swear to Wood, but I was persuaded at the time at the station-house, when I was brought tlex, by one or two men - that was some time after the Sunday; I was persuaded to swear to Wood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did it from persuasion, and not from your own conviction? A. No, not from my own conviction - I saw three persons in the passage near to Clarke's house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Turn round, and tell us if you see any person who you saw on that occasion? A. I cannot exactly swear I saw that man (Jepson) because their heads were turned towards the gate; I was examined at Bow-street - I believe Jepson was one of the men, and I believe the other man is innocent; I believe he was not there at the time - I was examined at Bow-street three or four times; I should not know the third man, because he was kneeling down - I just saw the glimpse of the other two faces; I was standing there two or three minutes - they were six or eight yards from Clarke's premises, and I was ten or twelve yards from them - I saw a bundle by the side of the one who was kneeling down, and I really think it was a silk handkerchief - it was yellow; I went away, and returned to the same place half an hour or three-quarters of an hour afterwards, and saw two men there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they two of the three you had seen half an hour before? A. I think they were - I cannot say; one was, and that was the one I had seen kneeling down, but the other I do not think I had seen before; that man was neither of the prisoners - I only just passed by at that time; they were in the passage, in the same place as the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180010"/>three were - I passed again about a quarter after four o'clock, when I was going round with my milk, and saw Jepson, the tall prisoner, walking by; he was within three yards of Clarke's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had you seen him before that day? A. None: he was doing nothing but walking about - he had nothing; I did not speak to him, nor he to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was you examined at the station-house, and persuaded to swear to Wood? A. I suppose about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell the Magistrate you had been persuaded to swear to him, but not from your own conviction? A. I might not think any thing about it; I swore postively to Wood at Bow-street: I did not know him before - I have not seen any of his friends since, nor his attorney, nor been examined by him.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, why not, when on your oath before the Magistrate, state that you had been persuaded to swear to him? A. Because I was not asked - I swore to him positively before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How dare you, before the Magistrate, swear Wood was the man, when now you swear he was not? A. I never thought of it, hardly; I was examined at Bow-street about five weeks after the robbery, as near as I can guess; I swore to Wood when I was persuaded to do it - I cannot tell on what day I was examined.</p>

            . I married the prosecutor's brother, and we live opposite his house. On Sunday, the 29th of July, between three and four o'clock, I was at my window, and while there the prisoner Jepson spoke to me - he was alone; he asked me if Mr. and Mrs. Clarke were gone to Harrow - I said I did not know where they were gone, but they had gone out for a ride, but I said he might speak to my husband; he said, "Oh, no, I will call to-morrow" - he did not say what he wanted; he did not call next day, to my knowledge; about half an hour afterwards I saw two men walking past, one in the road, and one under my window - they had a handkerchief, with something long rolled up in it: I believe Wood was one of the men, but cannot swear to him - Jepson was not one of those two; there are three or four houses in the passage leading to the public-house; the public-house goes into the Harrow-road, but there are no houses on the passage to the public-house - it joins a great shed; my husband's house is at the bottom of the passage, and the prosecutor's house joins the passage - when the passage is stopped, you cannot get to any house but ours and Clarke's; there is a gate at the end of the passage; my husband had the key of the prosecutor's outside shed door - it was in his possession; a person having that key could get into the premises, but nobody had it but him - it was the key of the shed alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Point out Wood? A. That is him; I did not tell the Magistrate I never saw Wood till I saw him there (at the office) I said I saw him pass my window, but could not swear to person - I do not remember swearing that I never saw him till he was at the office; I swear I did not say so- Jepson was alone under the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. It was between three and four o'clock that Jepson asked if the prosecutor was gone to Harrow? A. Yes; he might be wo minutes speaking to me - he went away when he got his answer; I saw nothing more of him that day - I never saw him before, and did not see him again till he was in Newgate; I went down to Newgate, and picked him out in the yard among all the prisoners, before I swore to him.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I first heard of this robbery on Thursday, the 13th of September - on that day I had some business to do with Jepson: I had apprehended him on the 5th of September, for something else, in Scotland-yard, and took him to Gardener's-lane station, and told him I must search him - he immediately put his right hand into his trousers pocket, and pulled out a wire purse, and took something from it - he said, "I must look what property I have got before you search me;" he took something out of the purse, and crumpled it up in his hand - I then seized hold of his hand, and got possession of what he crumpled up; it was a 50l. Bank of England note; I took from him a 20l. Bank note, and two fives - I was compelled to give them up last Session, to Mr. Wood, the under Sheriff; I took the numbers of them - the two fives were Nos. 23,560 and 23,563, both dated the 9th of June, 1832; Jepson was committed on the charge I apprehended him on, and was tried here; the Session commenced on the 5th of September, and on the Thursday, the 13th, while Jepson was waiting for his trial, I saw the prisoner Wood at the New inn, Old Bailey, and apprehended him there, in the passage of the New Inn - I took him into the coffee-room, down to a small box, to search him; he pulled out his watch, and I was in the act of taking his watch-guard off his neck, when Mr. Wooler, who I believe is the solicitor's clerk, came across to the table, put his left hand out, pushed me on one side, and seized the watch and guard with his right hand, took possession of it, and desired the prisoner not to give any part of his property up to me, but to give it to him; Mr. Wooler was then standing on the other side of the table, near the end, opposite the prisoner; he came round the end of the table, got between the prisoner and me, and took possession of the whole of his property; he took from him a purse - I asked Mr. Wooler what it contained, and told him he was acting very improperly in interfering with me in my duty; he said, "It is no matter, I shall be answerable for all this property - don't give it up to that fellow, it won't be safe in his hands," and that it was a pity the public paid for such men as me, and it would he safe with him - I requested him to give me the numbers of the notes, which he did; there were two 5l. notes in the purse, with three sovereigns and a half in gold - I got a scrap of paper and pencil, and put the numbers down; he gave them to me: they were 23,561 and 23,564, both dated the 9th of June, 1832; while I was taking the numbers of the notes, the prisoner pulled off his hat, took out a yellow silk handkerchief, and threw it towards Mr. Wooler; Mrs. Wood (as I believe her to be,) who was in the room, picked it up - I said to Mr. Wooler, "Did you see that?" he said, "Oh, I will be answerable for all this property<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180011"/>being produced when it is wanted;" there was nothing in the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the property produced at any of the examinations? A. I saw the watch and two 5l. notes at Bow-street, and they are in my possession now; the handkerchief was never produced, nor yet the purse or sovereigns - I went to Wood's house, No. 12, Lambeth-walk, Vauxhall-road, on the following day; I knew it to be his house from information I received - I was at Bow-street when Wood told the clerk he resided there, and in consequence of that I went there next morning; I saw the woman there who had taken the handkerchief - I searched the house, and found three phosphorus-boxes with matches in a drawer in the back kitchen, and this chisel in the same drawer; I have since been to the prosecutor's house, and find this chisel very accurately fits a great many places which were broken open, drawers and bureau drawers; I saw Wood in this Court on Jepson's trial - he was examined in Jepson's behalf, to prove an alibi - he said he knew him, and had been out with him pleasuring at Windsor and Hampton; that he had recently been at his house, and spent his evening with him- I have the 5l. notes and the watch; Mr. Wooler produced them at Bow-street, and Mr. Minshull ordered him to give them to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you took Wood into custody, I believe you knew Jepson was about to be tried? A. I did; I was a witness - he was on the list for trial that day: Mr. Wooler never told me Wood was a witness for Jepson till I got to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not request of you to send him in custody before the Court, to be examined, when you were at the Compter, before you took him before a Justice? A. No, he did not - I recollect when we got to the Compter Mr. Wooler stated to the person who took the charge, that he was a very material witness to prove an alibi for Jepson; I do not recollect his requiring that he should be brought in custody before the Court; the person sitting there refused to take the charge, in consequence of what Wooler said, but I stopped him, and took hold of his arm in the street, and he requested me not to take him further: he did not at any time request me to send him to the Court to be examined for Jepson - I desired to examine the Bank notes at the Compter, to see if Mr. Wooler had told a falsehood, and I saw them; Mr. Wooler produced the same notes before the Justice - I have been told the purse lost was a clasp one; the one found on Wood was a long one with a slide; I remember when Mack was first examined before the Justice - it was on the 13th, and on the 27th, when you came, the depositions were taken a fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did Mack attempt to swear to Wood before the Justice till you had rode home in a coach with him, after the 27th? A. I never rode home in a coach with him at all - I put Wood into a cab, and sent him off to the station-house, and when I got to Bow-street the prisoner was brought in - Mack was brought in, and identified him that evening - that I swear; the Magistrate's clerk was there, and is here now - it was on Thursday, the 13th: I was not at the station-house at all with the prisoner, nor with Mack, and do not know what took place there; I appeared at the next examination, on the 20th, and then Mack swore to him - I was there on the 27th; I never saw Mack at the station-house at any time - I heard Mack examined on the 27th- what was said was taken down in writing; I was asked before the Justice if I could not have taken the yellow handkerchief from Wood's wife if I pleased; I said I could, but the prisoner might have escaped while I was doing it: there was nobody with me - there were many persons there; Morgan came up when I first apprehended Wood - there might very possibly be an officer in the room when she received the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was there not, and have you not sworn it? A. I have sworn I went to Forester, a City officer, and asked him to take him into custody, it being in the City; I was not accompained by a brother officer, and had not one in the room at the time I took him; I never swore so- when I went to the house next day I applied for the handkerchief, and searched the woman to find it; I did not take her into custody - Mr. Wooler told me the numbers of the notes, and promised to produce them before the Magistrate, but he did not till he was compelled; he did not bring them the first time: I have not been offered any reward in this case - nobody has ever said any thing to me about it; I never asked Mr. Clarke for any thing, nor had any conversation with him about it - I have been at a very great expence in it - I think I have spent nearly 2l.; I was obliged to come from Croydon at my own expence, and never had a farthing, nor asked for any thing; Gosling, the publican, is here - Mr. Wooler had the watch in his hand, and held it by the chain; Clarke was behind me, and I said, "Is that your watch?" he said, "No, mine was silver - that appears to be a gold one;" I know nothing about a ride in a coach from Bow-street to the station-house - I call the instrument produced a turn-screw; I have not inquired whether there is a more common instrument in London.</p>

            . I am a tailor and cap maker, and live at No. 34, King-street, Borough, and am a house-keeper. I know Wood; he came to my house on the 29th of July, about three o'clock, as near as possible, to ask me to go to Gravesend on the following day - I know it was the 29th, because I had an order to get in on the 30th, and told him I could not go on that account; he remained at my house till half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long has he been acquainted with you? A. Fifteen or sixteen years - he lived in Vauxhall-walk, Lambeth; he was brought up a tallow-chandler, and sells candles by commission; he did not dine with me; I am sure it was as late as three that he came, because I was just going to church - nobody has applied to me about this; I did not attend at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tellany body what you could prove? A. About a fortnight ago - I believe I told my wife; she had seen him there - I mentioned it to the prisoner's mother; I did not tell Mr. Wooler of it - I never mentioned it to any body till a fortnight ago: I then heard he was in trouble, and in reading the newspaper I saw it was on the 29th of July; my wife was at home on the 29th, and another young woman; the young woman is now in Court: my wife was there first, and saw him come in - he drank tea and supped with us - I did not go to church, as he came in: I did not go to Gravesend with him; I was not here last Session, when Wood was examined - I did not go with him or Jepson to Hampton or Windsor; I never saw Jepson before - I have not been to Woods' house more than once for the last six months; he never sent for me to come forward.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did a female call on you to know what you could say in Woods' behalf? A. Yes, his mother called about a fortnight ago - I told her what I could recollect about the 29th of July.</p>

On Monday morning, the 10th of September, I came down to my breakfast a little after eight; Ewer was up before me - when I got down into the tap-room; the prisoner was there, among others - I got some bread and cheese for my breakfast from a cupboard in the little back parlour; I got the cheese on a piece of bread, and was toasting it at the fire; I had got a knife and fork; when I had half done it, the prisoner came to light his pipe at the fire, and hit me on the head gently; I took no notice of that, but continued to toast my cheese - shortly after that he turned back, hit me rather harder than before, and threw the cheese under the grate; I do not remember his saying any thing - I threw the knife and fork down, and ran and hit him with my fist; he then pushed me, and we both got up in a corner, and were scuffling and hitting one another; a man in the room parted us, and I sat down - a young man came in afterwards; I continued in the room till dinner time - the prisoner was there an hour or so; a man named Oxford gave me half a pint of beer; after we were parted, somebody proposed that I should fight the prisoner on Saturday night - I did not agree about that; when the beer was given to me I just sipped it, and the prisoner asked if I had any beer to give him - I gave him the remainder; after that he had a pot of beer, and asked me to drink, and we were on good terms again - I believe he left the house soon after that; we had the beer together directly after the scuffle - it was after nine o'clock; he left the house about half an hour after I drank with him; he did not lodge in the house at that time - I saw him bring a can and put on the table, about eleven o'clock or half-past; I was in the house, and had not been out -Symmonds and another man were there; we all three had a pot of beer - the prisoner asked whose beer it was; I said I did not know - he said, "Well, I don't care whose it is, I shall drink," and drank; he then went out - there was no quarrelling about his drinking, only somebody hallooed out "Come, any't you going to be a pot?" the prisoner left, and said no more to me - I went out with Symmonds about half an hour after the prisoner, and as we were walking I saw the prisoner leaning over a gate, where he used to lodge: I said nothing to him, nor he to me - I returned to the public-house to dinner after one o'clock; I dined in the tap-room, and about two I was looking out of the tap-room window, and saw the prisoner; he came into the tap-room by the back door; he said nothing to me-I said, "What, have you been for a walk, Bob?" he said, "Ask my a-s, you bl-y fool," and I said,"D-n your a-s, and you too;" I was just turning from the window, to sit down, when this passed - when I sat down the prisoner drew towards the mantel-piece, and I saw him take a knife off the mantel-piece; he pushed towards me, and just touched me with it about my trousers; I felt the touch - I did not see whether my trousers were cut at that time; I could not see the knife in his hand at the time, but I had seen him take it off the mantel-piece, and when I felt the touch about my trousers I supposed he had it, and tried to take it away from him, but could not - he pushed towards me, and run it into my bowels; I felt the stab, and hallooed out - he directly threw the knife down under the grate and went out; he did not speak a word - Symmonds came down stairs to me; I showed him what had happened to me - Saunders afterwards came in; I was put to bed, and Mr. Hilder, the surgeon, sent for - I had only one wound, and cannot say how long I was confined to my bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What occupation do you follow? A. I do any little jobs I can get, errands and that; I was not in the employ of any one master - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180013"/>was bred to no business; I had lodged at the Crispin above twelve months - I am not very often in the taproom; I first went there about eight o'clock - I am sure I was not there at six; I had no employment that day but was going to do something the next day - I have known the prisoner for years - he used to bring our milk when he lived with a milkman; I had three pints of beer myself, besides what people gave me - one and another asked me to drink; I had nothing but beer, no spirits - I had to pay for three pints of beer, but did not drink them to myself; I dare say I took three pints, and a great deal more - I was not drunk, but a little funny between ten and eleven o'clock - I was stabbed between one and two; I was drinking till Symmonds went, and then we came back and ordered another pint a piece, and Mrs. Cooper, the landlady, said we should have no more till four o'clock - I drank a little after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you challenge this man to fight you? A. He challenged me first; I do not recollect saying, "D-n you Ned, come out and fight like a man, if you are one;" I might say so - I did not go into the road and strip; I went as far as the door with my jacket off - I had taken it off in the tap-room, because we were going to fight; I believe Mrs. Cooper was having her breakfast at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say to you, "Be kind to the young man, and don't treat him in the way you are?" A. I do not recollect it - I did not strike him after the skirmish in the morning at breakfast; I did not knock him down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who struck the first blow? A. He came to the fire to light his pipe, and touched me on the head, and the next time he hit me hard, and knocked my cheese down under the grate, and then I hit him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was not the first striking as if it was in fun, putting his hand on your head? A. Yes; I did not take any notice of the first striking - the second was done in the same way, only harder; he did not bruise me, he only jolted the cheese - I felt it, but it did not hurt me; I struck him by the side of his head, and knocked his pipe out - somebody had used the knife, and left it accidentally on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you received the wound in the stomach were you not advancing towards him with your hand raised? A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were standing at the window, he came up and touched you, but not to hurt you, and seeing him with the knife, you went to take it from him, and then he struck you? A. Yes; he then threw the knife down and went out - I had had no quarrel with him at all about a young woman.</p>

            . I live close to the Crispin, and was there to breakfast on the morning of the 10th of September - I had taken a knife there in my hand, and after eating my breakfast I laid it on the mantel-shelf, in the tap-room; it was a case knife, not a clasp one - there were several persons in the room; the prisoner was one; the prosecutor came down to breakfast shortly after I placed it there - I saw him toasting his cheese; the prisoner and him were afterwards going to fight - I separated them - Neibour pulled his coat off in the tap-room, and went out into the road to fight; Mace said he would not fight him then, he would fight him on Saturday night- Mace had said he had got his Sunday clothes on then, and should not like to make them dirty; they had some beer together; after that I went away, leaving the prisoner and Neibour drinking beer, and apparently friendly - I returned to the Crispin about half-past one o'clock; I did not see the prisoner when I came in - Neibour was eating his dinner at the tap-room table, and after that I went out, leaving Mace standing at the window - I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not there at the time of the occurrence? A. No; I left about two o'clock, and went to my work - the prosecutor was not at all violent in his conduct, nor making a noise while I was there- I suppose I was there two or three hours; it was after the prisoner gave him a bonneler that he went out to fight; I did not hear him use any oaths - I only had half a pint of beer of my own, and drank once out of a pot.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he offer to do any thing, or say any thing, till Mace gave him the bonneter, as you call it, on the head? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he receive a second blow before he offered to fight? A. It was the second blow on the head - it was a slight blow; he dropped the cheese, and went to hit Mace; this is the knife I had to eat my bread and cheese (looking at it.)</p>

            . I lodged at the Crispin, and was present when Neibour was toasting his cheese - his statement about that is true; the prisoner hit him twice over the head - Neibour did not strike him till after he was hit twice; I went away between ten and eleven o'clock, and returned a little before one; I went into the tap-room, and remained there till about two - I saw Neibour come in, and have his dinner; I did not see the prisoner return to the house - I went up stairs a little after two, and while there I heard a sad screaming down stairs; I went down into the tap-room, and found Neibour there, alone - he said he had been stabbed, and I saw that he had; I saw part of his bowels out - I assisted him up to bed, and went for the doctor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he had a hat on his head at the time he was struck? A. He had a cap - the striking knocked it over his eyes; that is sometimes done in fun.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in the neighbourhood of Uxbridge-moor. On the 10th of September, between two and three o'clock, I was returning from my round, and when within a few yards of this house a person told me somebody was at the Crispin who had been stabbed; I went and saw the prosecutor on the bed - I took up his shirt, perceived a wound in his belly, and the howels protruding - the bowels had been perforated in two places; that might be done by one stab; it was an extremely serious wound - persons after such an injury generally get into a great state of depression; but I should say he was not drunk, but if he had drank a considerable quantity that morning, he would have presented the same appearance; he was in a state of colapse and depression; I have attended him ever since - he is not quite recovered yet - in my judgment, it was a very dangerous would; it was by bleeding him down to death's door that he was saved - the bowel has been restored to its place, and things are going on properly; I think the bowel is healed, but the external wound is not quite healed yet.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister, and live with my father, in the same street. On Saturday morning, the 18th of August, about seven o'clock, I went to my brother's place to take his breakfast; it might be later than seven - I had the key, which he had left with my mother; as I was opening his door, somebody inside pushed up against the door - I found the prisoner inside my brother's room, where the trunk was; I was trying to push the door open, but could not; I pushed it a little way open, and saw his white trousers - I went round, and opened the window shutter, which was a little open, and then he came out at the door which I had opened; I had seen him before, and knew him by sight, but I was a little girl when I saw him before - I am sure he is the person; as he went down the street he shook his head at me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far did you open the door to enable you to see my trousers? A. Very little - I saw you come out, and you shook your head at me; I did not halloo out - when I went inside I found the back window broken open; the box was open, and a poker laid by the side of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You speak of Sutton and Lawson, were the other two men present at the time you received the blows on the head? A. I cannot say; there were several persons present - the woman and Sutton I am positive were there; I have some faint recollection of my foot being jammed with the door, but I was stunned and stupified with the blows - I cannot say whether I fell when the blows were struck, for I was nearly stunned; the next thing I recollect of myself is, that I found myself standing near the door, and my head bleeding - I then saw Sutton come out of the door; I jumped upon him, for the purpose of securing him - he then commenced beating me again on the head with the iron bar; I then found myself become so weak I could not strike him on the head with my truncheon, and brought him to the ground on the top of me - I was down in a stooping position, keeping my head close to him to save it, and I being undermost, he fell on the top of me; after we had fallen, I heard the iron he had been beating me with ring against the stones at some distance from me, as if thrown away -I got up again, and finding myself so weak from the blows I had received, I held him with both hands, and left off beating him; during that time I was repeatedly struck by him and others - I cannot tell who they were; we again fell down, and on getting up I found myself alone with the prisoner Sutton, the rest were gone, and after a little struggle, Brooks, my brother officer, came to my assistance, with Green; Sutton was then secured - I was taken from there to the station-house by two officers; Sutton was afterwards brought there - I was taken from there to Mr. Mears', a surgeon, in Brick-lane, and am still under his care; I was taken home and went to bed - I was not exactly confined to my bed; I got up next morning; I saw no more of the other two prisoners than I have stated.</p>
               <p>Sutton. He says he was not able to spring his rattle, and yet able to hold me - I wish to ask if he did not swear at Worship-street that he never saw me. Witness. I said I could not swear to you at the beginning of the transaction - that I believed you to be the man who struck me in the street, when I was first attacked, but I could not swear it.</p>

            . I deal in haberdashery and rags, and live at No. 15, York-street, Mile-end. On the 23rd of September, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was coming home, and heard a rattle spring very low; I made a stop, and it sprang again slow - I ran down Wentworth-street - there is a street called George-street, which turns off to the right; I then saw Davis, the Policeman, having hold of Lawson; they had hold of one another, and a mob was there - I saw Davis dragged in doors by Lawson; she caught hold of his arm - I went and called for assistance, calling out Police! I was some time before I could find a man- I left the house for that purpose; I was full ten minutes absent - I ran a good distance before the Police<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180016"/>man, and found Davis holding down his head, having hold of Sutton by his legs; the three male prisoners were beating Davis with their fists - I caught hold of Jones, and hallooed out, "This is one;" I have not a doubt of his being the man I caught hold of - he had no coat on, but was in his shirt sleeves; he hallooed out, and said, "It was not me;" one of the Policemen I had fetched caught hold of me by mistake - I said, "It was not me," and they let me go; Jones went off at that time - I then saw Sutton: I am sure he was one of the men, and assisted in taking him to the watch-house; when I got hold of him he said, "You have no business with me at all;" he gave me several blows, and I expected to go to the ground - my face was cut- it was swollen for several days, and my cheek has the mark of it now - there was a gas-lamp over the way, which enabled me to see; I am sure of all the three men - I took Sutton to the station-house: the other two were present also - I saw Davis holding his head down, which was bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the woman dragging Davis into the house - was she alone, or were others dragging him in? A. Yes, she and other were dragging him in; I cannot swear that either of the male prisoners were among them - I saw blood on the hands of Kemp and Sutton, and pointed it out to the superintendent, Pearce.</p>
               <p>Sutton. Q. Where was you when the rattle began to spring? A. In Wentworth-street; I turned into George-street in consequence of hearing the rattle - I was coming from Long-alley, Moorfields; Brick-lane was my nearest way home - I was in Brick-lane when I first heard the rattle; I then went into Wentworth-street and George-street - I was rather further from the spot when I first heard the rattle than I am from here to Newgate, but not so far as I am from Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Kemp. Q. When you came up the second time, and brought the officers, did you hear the Policeman say any thing? A. I do not remember hearing him say any thing - Brooks is the officer I fetched.</p>

            , and live at No. 52, Wentworth-street. I was up on the morning in question, and heard a woman scream out in the street, between twelve and one o'clock, or near one - I sent a girl out to see who it was, and as she did not return, I went myself, and saw Kemp, Jones, and Sutton ill-using the Policeman, beating and striking him; he was standing in the street then - they all fell together: they were beating him with their fists at that time, and trying to rescue the woman - the Policeman said, as he had been ill-treated so much, he would take her to the station-house; they then went along the street, fighting one among the other, till they got to the house where the female prisoner and Sutton lived; when they got near that house, Sutton went in doors, and the Policeman having fast hold of the woman - Sutton and the woman pulled him in sideways, till his feet and his arm got in; he then cried out "Oh! Bolton, Bolton - I am a dead man!" Jones and Kemp then ran home; they live within two doors of me - they live in different rooms in the same house; I ran home, and called my husband to come out with the rattle and spring it - we have a rattle of our own; I went back again - Kemp and Jones left their coats at their own lodging, and as I went back they ran past me, and Kemp said, "Before the Policeman shall take him, I will kill the b-gg-r;" when I got back the Policeman was against the window of the house where Sutton lived - he was leaning against the window ledge; Sutton came out with a piece of iron in his hand, about ten inches long, about as thick as my thumb, and turned up at one end; I saw him beat it about the Policeman's head - the other two men were not there at first: they came up while he was beating him with the iron, and the girl held him by the throat; they all beat him severely for some time - he could not for some time get his staff out of his pocket, but when he got it out he beat Sutton over the legs with it as hard as he could; the other two men held his hands together - two Policemen came up, and I saw Sutton throw the iron down among the crowd; there were a good many people there at that time - it fell on the stones, and made a noise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it after Jones and Kemp came back that you saw Sutton strike him with the iron? A. Yes, during the time they were there, he struck I think eight or nine blows with the iron; and they held him the while, till he got his stick; Davis tried to spring his rattle, but he could make very little noise indeed - they still continued to ill-use him till the Policemen came; I saw him beat Sutton with his truncheon very severely about the legs, when he could raise his arm; I have known Jones and Kemp these twelve months, and have not a doubt of them; they have no business that I know of; I do not know whether they appeared in liquor - I picked up the iron, and upon that a boy, who used to be with them, came and said, "Mrs. Sheen, let me look at that iron?" I said, "You shan't have it out of my hand," but he got it from me, and ran away with it; I have seen that boy with Kemp and Jones - he is in Clerkenwell prison now.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next? A. Sutton was in custody; Jones and Kemp ran away - I have known Lawson more than twelve months, and am sure she is the woman; I saw Davis' head - it was in a shocking state; the blood was running down his face and head - I was at the Police-office on the Monday afternoon, and saw the three male prisoners in custody, and when I was outside the office Lawson came up to me, and said, "You don't know any thing bad about me nor my young man, and I hope you will say as little as you can help.</p>
               <p>Sutton. Q. What business had you up at that time of night? A. To look after such thieves as you; when we see such company as them in the street, we are bound to be up to take care of our property; I was not sitting up for my son; when the Policeman's arm was in the door, I saw you going up towards the stairs in the passage - I stood opposite the door; it was about five minutes from the time I left till I came back - the first thing I then observed was Sutton coming out of his door, with the iron in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180017"/>Kemp. Q. Did you see Sutton strike the Policeman with the iron before he came out? A. No; when I was in the road Kemp and Jones ran by me, and I think they got to the house first - I left the first time before you did, and got back before you did - I did not see you run away at last, for I was looking for the iron.</p>

            . I live with my mother in Bennet's-court, George-street. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of Septemner, I was up early, going to gather blackberries; I was going along, and heard a great noise in George-street, near Wentworth-street - I ran down to see what was the matter, and saw Davis, the Policeman, persuading a young woman to go home; I cannot say who the woman was - there were a great many more people there; there was more than one man- I saw Sutton there; I am sure of him - I did not know him before: Davis was persuading the young woman to go home very quietly - she was obstinate, and would not, and he attempted to take her to the station-house; Sutton caught hold of him by the collar, and got him down in the gutter, and then kicked him several times in the face; then Sutton ran away - Davis got up, and ran after him - he hallooed out "Bolton, Bolton," to come to his assistance; Sutton turned back, and struck Davis with his fist, and ran off again: a young woman directly ran and clung round Davis' neck, and used a bad word to him - I cannot say whether it was Lawson or not; I do not think it was her, but it was dark - Sutton made his escape into a house, while the woman held Davis; Davis then got the young woman from the ground, and was going to take her to the station, but several others dragged him and the woman into the house; he got his foot and knee tight in the doorway, and hallooed out, "Oh, my knee!" they had pinched it in the door - I did not go into the house; Davis afterwards came out of the house, and fell against the window stone - I was close to him; his head was bleeding in a dreadful state - Sutton came out of the house with a long piece of iron in his hand; Davis laid hold of him, and said,"You are the man I want," and he took and cut Davis ever so many times on the head with the iron; he struck him eight or ten times with it, as near as I can say; I saw some Policeman come up afterwards, and lay hold of him; Davis had hit Sutton on the legs with his staff; nobody else struck him - I saw no woman there; I saw nobody there but Sutton and the Policeman at any time after they came out of the house; I staid till the iron was thrown away - he got from the Policeman after he was on the ground, and ran away; a rattle was sprung, and he turned back again and fell, and the iron fell from him - I saw it on the ground, and left it there; I do not know what became of it - I went to the station with the Policeman, who was bleeding, and then assisted him home.</p>

On the 23rd of September, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was called up to attend Davis; he was very much injured - he had received several wounds along the side of the head and the scalp; they were confused wounds; there was, I should think, six wounds; but they communicated one with the other, so that I could not exactly tell how many there were - from the nature of the wounds. I considered dangerous consequences might ensue; they had broken the skin, and penetrated to the cranium - I thought him in danger; he is not out of my care yet; I do not think he will be fit for duty for a month yet, or perhaps more.</p>
               <p>Sutton's Defence. I had been out all the evening, and was rather tipsy, and coming home, I heard the squalling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180018"/>of a woman; when I got there, I saw the Policeman beating a female, and called him a rascal for doing so - he struck me over my left shoulder, and immediately struck me twice again, and would have struck me over my head, but I caught the blow on my arm; he tore my coat right up my back, and I struck him, knocked him down, and was going away - he got bp to me again; I told him to leave me alone - he would not; I turned at him again, and pitched him, I believe, on his head twice - he kept hold of me till I was taken into custody; I lost my hat in the scuffle; somebody came behind me, put the Policeman's hat on my head, and said, "Now we will have him;" he was behind me - Green took me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIS. I had not said a word to him, nor struck him, till I was attacked; I was not ill - using any woman - I did tear his coat; I did not put my hat on his head.</p>

               <p>Kemp's Defence (written). On Saturday, the 22nd of September, I arrived at home, at my lodgings, No. 46, Wentworth-street, Spitalfields, between the hours of twelve and one o'clock, and, after talking with my landlord for a short time, I then went into my own room, in company with my wife - the room which I occupy is one adjoining my landlord's shop; I asked my landlord if I should fasten the street door - he replied Yes, and I accordingly did so; I then sat down with my wife, and had some beef steaks for our supper, which I cooked myself - while at supper, a knocking came to the street door, about half-past one or two o'clock; I got up and answered the door, which I opened, and three or four Policemen came in - I then asked them what they then were going away from my room, when one of them turned back, and asked me if my name was not Henry Kemp - I said it was; they told me I must come with them - I asked them what for; they said, "You will see when you come to the station-house;" they then took me to Spitalfields station-house - I again inquired on what charge I was a prisoner; the inspector said for beating one of their men - I inquired when it happened; he said a quarter of an hour before - I said I could prove my innocence; my landlord came to the station-house, but they would not hear what he had to say - I asked them if bail would be accepted; the inspector said he did not know whether the man was out of danger or not, therefore he would not take bail - I was then locked up till Sunday night, when the Policeman Davis, and some more, called me out, and after Davis had looked at me some time, he said to me, "Put your coat on;" I asked him if he knew the colour of it - he said No; I then put on my coat, and after looking at me some time, he said softly to one of the others,"He is not one;" I was then again locked up till Monday morning, when I was taken to Worship-street office, and remanded till Tuesday morning, when I was fully committed for trial - I had not seen the prisoner James Sutton since the day before I was first taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I came in about ten o'clock, and went up stairs to bed about eleven; I heard nothing more till Sunday night, when I came home about ten, and in about a quarter of an hour two Policemen came, and said they wanted me for a row, and if I came to the station I should hear all about it; they then said it was for ill-using the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Lawson's Defence. I was not there at the time, and know nothing about it; I was in bed and asleep by ten o'clock.</p>

            . I am married, and live with my husband, at No. 49, Wentworth-street. Kemp and Jones live at our house; I cannot say whether Kemp is married; a young woman lives with him - they have lived in my house eight or nine months. On the 22nd of September he came home about twelve o'clock, on Saturday night, as near as I can guess - it was while I was shutting up; I keep a chandler's-shop; he occupies the back room adjoining my shop; when he came home he was quarrelling with his young woman for not having his supper ready, and while they were quarrelling I went to bed - I sleep in the next room, on the ground floor - there is a parlour, his room, and a little shop; my husband was in bed before me about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear next? A. When the young woman went to get the supper ready she had not got the frying-pan, and then they got to blows; I got out of bed, and told them to be quiet; my mother-in-law, who sleeps on the first floor, got out of bed, opened the door, and told Kemp to open the door, and go over to Mrs. Wass' for the frying-pan - I heard them sit down to supper; I then heard no more till my husband got out of bed, to go into the yard, and while he was there Bolton, the officer, came - I did not see him; I got out of bed because I heard Bolton say he wanted to get into Kemp's room; my husband, as he was coming from the yard, opened the street door to Bolton, and showed him the prisoner's room; Bolton went in, and said, "Is your name Kemp?" the prisoner said Yes, and he took him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your husband? A. He is forced to be at work; he has some things to finish which are to go on board ship; my mother-in-law is at home -I do not know where the woman who lived with the prisoner is; she does not live at the house now - I have been in Court during the examination.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What ages are your children? A. Ten, eight, five, and two years and a half; my husband had been doing no work for a few days before - he was out of work, but had been making a table or two to sell; he often said he wanted money to go on with.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stopped out all the night before? A. No; I had not been out all night for the last month or two.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pacing up and down the room, you was using violent language to him and he to you? A. I cannot say that I was; I am sure I did not call him ill names.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the razor in his hand, did you hear him observe that he could not use it for shaving, that it required sharpening, and he was going to take it to be done? A. Not any thing about it; I did not see him take it up - it was before I observed the razor that he wished the privilege of a husband; I did not try to catch hold of it - I went to try if I could feel it, and he brought it forward himself; I did not catch hold of his arm nor of the razor - I was going to do it, but he brought his hand forward; I am certain the razor was not in my hand at any time - I did not attempt to take it from his hand; he did not throw me on the bed, as if insisting on what he had asked for; it was all done instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his hand up rather when he threw you on the bed, and you tried to catch the razor from his hand on the bed? A. No, I did not; I tried to keep his arms from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your impression is that he did not throw you on the bed to have connexion with you? A. No - he was over me before I was cut, and I was struggling to keep his arms from me, to prevent his injuring me; I called Murder! when I first saw the razor in his hand, before he touched me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your hands were not at all cut? A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you go out to upholstery work, or what? A. Any thing I can get; I never did upholstery - I have made children's clothes and shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his cutting you in the throat appear the effect of accident? A. I cannot say.</p>

I live in the back room up stairs - I went to her room; the door was not locked - I went in and saw her laying on the bed, on her back, and the prisoner laying on the top of her; her petticoats were not thrown up at all - I did not notice his breeches: she was bleeding at the neck a good deal - I screamed out for my mother to come down stairs; the prisoner continued to lay on her till my mother came - she caught hold of him by the collar, and pulled him away from her; I did not see any thing in his hand - I saw the razor next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he must have been some time on her? A. Yes; I ran down when I heard the cry; he continued on her till my mother came - he was some minutes on her; I went down directly she screamed out -I went with her to the surgeon, and after her wound was dressed walked home with her; she was not taken to the hospital.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Clarendon-square, Somer's-town. The prosecutrix was taken to Mr. Robinson's shop - he was not at home, and I was called into the shop; I found the prosecutrix sitting on a chair in the surgery, very pale, with a handkerchief up to her throat - it was bleeding but very trifling; there was one wound on the left side of the chin; and one on the right side of her throat; the one on the chin was immediately below the chin bone, about an inch and a quarter long; it was a semi-circular sort of wound; it could not be deep; it went nearly to the bone - the other was a very trifling wound, about an inch and a half long, towards the lower part of the neck; it merely divided the skin on the right side of the windpipe, close by the side of it; it is impossible to say whether they were done intentionally, or by accident - it might be done by falling on a sharp instrument; it is quite impossible that it could be done by accident.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The second wound was very slight? A. Very, but in a much more dangerous part, for it was immediately over the principal blood-vessels of the neck - I observed next day a third wound; it was very slight, more like a scratch from a cat.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the second wound might have been done if the razor had been dropped on the part? A. Yes, but the same drawing of the sharp instrument might have done both.</p>
               <p>Q. The wound being semi-circular was the length you name, but not that size? A. No; she walked home from the shop: there was not much loss of blood; the injury did not appear to be inflicted with a heavy hand at all - I cannot say respecting the first wound, as it was so near the bone.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Seymour-street about half-past one o'clock; seeing a mob collected, I went and found the prosecutrix in a doctor's shop - I went to her house, knocked at the door, and was told to walk in; I found two or three persons in the room, with the prisoner, and took him - I asked for the instrument he had cut his wife with; he said, "You may find it if you can;" I called at his house next morning, to make further search, and the wife gave it to me - when I told the prisoner he must go with me to the station, he said,"Very well, I am ready to go with you any where;" as we went along to High-street, Marylebone, I asked him what made him use an instrument like that to his wife - (I had not then found it, and did not hold out threat or promise to him) - I said it would have been better to have used his fist; he said she was in the habit of going to houses which he had an objection to to work - I said"What houses?" he said, "Houses where girls live, and more than that, I pulled her out of a bawdy-house at Temple-bar;" I said, "A bawdy-house! perhaps she might go there to work;" he said, "No, she went there along with a gentleman, and I was determined to be revenged on her."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you and he alone at this conversation? A. Yes; we walked on first.</p>
               <p>MRS. GRAY. I gave the razor to the officer; I cannot say it is the one I saw in his hand; I pulled it out of the fire next morning; the handle was burnt off - I could find no other in the room.</p>

On Wednesday, the 3rd of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I went into the Castle, public-house, and had half a pint of beer at the counter - it is near Sharpe's-alley, but I do not know the name of the street; I had a sovereign, 18s., and some halfpence in my pocket; I looked at my money when I paid for the half-pint of beer; I had five half crowns, five shillings, one sixpence, a sovereign, and a few halfpence; I had been drinking before that, and was not quite sober, but could recollect what happened; when I came out of the house, I had the sovereign in my mouth; I had taken it from the silver, being afraid I should give it for a shilling if I went to another public-house; the silver was in my waistcoat pocket, in a black purse; I do not know that either of the prisoners were at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you were out of the public-house did you see any body? A. About five minutes; the prisoner John Whittey and a woman came up to me - he took hold of me by the arm, and told me that was the right way to get to my lodging - he took me down Sharpe's-alley; when I was in <placeName id="t18321018-11-crimeloc73">Sharpe's-alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. How soon did you come to your senses? A. I recollect nothing more till next day, when I found myself in the workhouse, under Mr. Palmer's care; I am still in the workhouse; I was a good deal hurt on my shoulder and back; I was ill for a week or eight days - I saw no man but Whittey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do I understand that you had your recollection so about you as to know perfectly well what you was about? A. I was not so far gone but I knew the party who struck me and knocked me down - I saw no third person; I was sober enough to see if there were three, but never took notice.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Had you got any employ in town? A. No; I had 7s. or 8s. or 10s. when I left home at Sheffield, but I earned some on my road here; I had about 2l. 7s. when I came to town - I worked for it on the road, at slating and plastering; I earned a sovereign in Lymington, and about the same in Warwickshire, and I earned 7s. or 8s. more; I have not earned any in town; I have been looking for a brother whom I have not seen for eight years; I spent all my money but 1l. 18s. and some halfpence; I believe what I paid at the Castle for my beer was 1d., for it was common beer; I never said I changed a sovereign there; I did not offer the landlord a sovereign for a shilling - I gave a sixpence; I did not offer the landlord a shilling; I am quite sure the male prisoner was by at the time the female was standing over my head.</p>

            . I am a private watchman of St. Sepulchre's. On the 3rd of October I was in the neighbourhood of Cow-cross, about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner Bullimore drag the prosecutor out of the Castle public-house, Cow-cross, which is nearly facing Sharpe's-alley, and knock him down; the prosecutor was in liquor - after knocking him down, he wanted to take him up a dark passage, called Faulkener's-alley, which joins the public-house; when he knocked him down, he called out, "Come on, Jack, he is down as dead as a herring;" a black man(the witness Springet) came out of the public-house, and helped to pick him up; he laid hold of one arm, and Bullimore the other - Bullimore endeavoured to drag him up the alley, but Springet said he had better let him be on the step, and he would recover himself; they had not been there above two or three minutes before Bullimore said,"I know where the man lives, he lives on Saffron-hill" - somebody said Yes, but I cannot exactly say who it was; Springet and Bullimore took him over towards Sharpe's-alley, and I did not see any more of him then; but about ten minutes after Springet came up to me, and a Policeman, and told me there was a drunken man being robbed and murdered; I and the Policeman turned to go down Sharpe's-alley, where Springet said the man was, and met Palmer, the master of the workhouse, coming up with a Policeman - they asked if I had seen any body go by, if I had seen Whittey go by; I said I had seen Whittey and a woman go by, and thought they would find them at the Bull's Head; I went there with them, and found Whittey and the female prisoner - they had got a measure of gin; Whittey was outside, and the woman in; they told them they wanted them to go down to Sharpe's-alley to see a man that was laying there - they took them down there, and when they got down there they were told they had knocked the man down there; Whittey and the woman said they were passing by at the time, and had assisted the man up; the woman made use of very bad language, and said she was coming by, and saw the man laying there, but they did not knock him down at all; the master of the workhouse gave charge of them - I saw Crowson, a bricklayer, standing at the corner of Sharpe's-alley, when they were in custody; Whittey told Crowson he had been at Croydon fair, and had got some money belonging to his(Whittey's) brother; he said he had got 1l., and gave Crowson 18s. out of it to give to his brother - I saw the money; there were four or five half-crowns, but I cannot exactly say what, as it was in the dark - Crowson went up to the station-house, and delivered it to the inspector; I saw nothing of Bullimore after he led him into Sharpe's-alley': I went away from there up to Cow-cross, and Springet fetched me; I did not interfere when Bullimore knocked him down, as they talked about being his friends, and seeing him home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you thought they were friends? A. Yes - I saw him knock him down; I cannot say whether the prosecutor was too drunk to help himself - Bullimore hit him in the breast with his fist; he caught hold of his collar, and dragged him out of the house - they were all in the public-house together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you thought this was done in friendship? A. I do not know about friendship - I have been a watchman nearly two years; he was knocked down right facing the public-house door; I did not interfere, because there are such desperate characters there - it is not safe to go without assistance; if there had been a robbery I should have gone over - I did not see the landlord; his name is Knight: Bullimore was inside the public-house when he knocked him down - I did not see him till the man laid on the ground; I did not hear the landlord say any thing to Bullimore - I did not hear him call out "Joe, help the man up - don't let him lay there;" nothing of the kind was said; I stood on the other side of the street - it is about twenty yards wide; there are Policemen about - I had a rattle, but I had no business to interfere unless I see a robbery; I went over about the time they were picking him up, and saw them put him on a step; I did not go up till after Whittey and his wife came up - Bullimore hit him hard enough to knock him down; I did not speak to the prosecutor at all - he was not sensible to be spoken to, he was so much hurt; I afterwards carried him up, and helped to put him to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. You say you saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180022"/>them all coming out of the public-house - who do you mean? A. I said they were all in the public-house - Springet, Bullimore, and the prosecutor were all together; I did not see either of the other prisoners there - I did not see the prosecutor till he was knocked down; I did not see him in the public-house, and have never said so; I did not see him till he was dragged out of the public-house and knocked down.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. On Wednesday night, the 3rd of October, about fifteen or twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, I saw the prosecutor four doors from the Castle, in Cow-cross-street, standing with his back against a shop shutters, passing money from one hand to the other, apparently looking for something among the silver - I suppose he had about 1l. worth of silver; I did not see whether he had any purse - he was in a dark part of the street; I could discern nothing in his hand but silver - he appeared to be rather in liquor, and was talking to himself; he left there, and went into the Castle public-house - he appeared to keep the money still in his hand; I did not see him again till after I had apprehended the female prisoner, which was about half an hour after - I then found him laying with his arms extended opposite the poor-house in Sharpe's-alley - about a quarter of an hour after I had seen him go into the Castle, Whittey and his woman passed me near Red Lion-alley, Cow-cross-street, going towards the City, in a direction from the Castle to the Bull's Head, where I apprehended the female prisoner.</p>

On the night of the 3rd of October I went to the Castle, Cow-cross-street, about eight o'clock, and saw Joyce, the prosecutor, there when I went in; he was drinking there when I went in; I judge it to be about eight - he was very much in liquor; I saw him flashing a sovereign and some half-crowns about in his hand - the landlord told him to put them into his pocket, and advised him to go home - he went out at the door, made a stagger and fell - the landlord desired somebody to pick him up; this was outside the door - the landlord asked me to see him home to his lodgings; I was going to conduct him to Saffron-hill -I took him down Sharpe's-alley, just close to the work-house, and then the prisoner Bullimore came up, and hit me a blow on the head with the but end of a whip, and asked me to fight; I did not say a word to him -I picked up my hat, which was knocked off, and made my escape; he called me a black b-gg-r, and I ran away - as I ran away I saw the Policeman, and told him they were robbing the poor man.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did you see Whittey or the woman? A. They followed me down the alley when I went to see the man home: they were all three together - after attacking me they got round Joyce, but what money they took from him I cannot say; I did not see Joyce knocked down - I was glad to make my escape, as they asked me to fight; I thought my life was in danger; I saw the female prisoner looking on while the other two were round Joyce, and in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180023"/>few minutes I saw the Policeman, and told him they were robbing the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Bullimore till you got to Sharpe's-alley? A. Never, till I got into Sharpe's-alley - Joyce went out of the Castle; I did not see him knocked down by any body at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it take you to go from the Castle to Sharpe's-alley? A. I dare say it took about half an hour; when Joyce fell down at the door, the landlord said, "Joe, help him up, it don't do for the man to lay there;" my name is Samuel - I did not see Bullimore till he came and knocked me down, and my life was in danger; the landlord asked me to see Joyce home - Bullimore came and helped him up with one arm at the door of the Castle, but he left him; I did not see him in the public-house - he was outside the door in the street; the landlord was inside, just at the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you say you never saw Bullimore till you saw him in Sharpe's-alley? A. I say I never saw him in the public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Bullimore help him up outside the door of the public-house, and give him all the assistance he could? A. He assisted him up, then left him to me till he came up in Sharpe's-alley and hit me; I did not notice a private watchman outside - I did not see Bullimore knock Joyce down at the door; he staggered, and the landlord said, "Pick him up;" I did not see Bullimore in the public-house, nor see him come out of it - I dare say he was in the street; he hit me on the head in Sharpe's-alley, when Whittey and the woman were about Joyce, and he asked if I would fight - my life was in danger.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were there at eight o'clock - did you sit drinking there all the evening? A. I staid there till the house was being shut up - I was very sober; I only had half a pint of beer - I was about half an hour taking him to Sharpe's-alley; I have got a bad leg, and do not walk fast.</p>

I apprehended Bullimore on the 4th of October, at a quarter to six o'clock, at his master's yard, Mr. White, a horse-slaughterer, in Sharpe's-alley; when I entered the yard he was standing in the middle of the yard - he turned and came towards me, and before I could speak to him, he said, "What is the row that happened last night?" I told him he was wanted at the station, that Whittey and the female prisoner were there - when we got to the station, Draper recognized him as having knocked the prosecutor down; he said, "What do you say, that I robbed him?" I said, "Hold your tongue - he does not charge you with robbing the man."</p>

            . I am landlord of the Castle, Cowcross-street. On the night this took place, Joyce came into my house, about eleven o'clock; he had not been there before - I never saw him before in my life: I am sure he was not there at eight; he appeared intoxicated when he came in - he went out when I told him it was time to close the house; Springet was there - Bullimore was there that night: when Joyce went out at my door, he fell down outside; no one touched him - Springet was close to the door; I called out to Bullimore, "Joe, help him up - it won't do for the man to lay there;" he did so, and Springet took hold of one arm - Springet and Bullimore were both at my bar together; he could not avoid seeing him there - my house is about fifty yards from Sharpe's-alley; I did not observe that Springet was lame, nor any thing to make him half an hour going to Sharpe's-alley.</p>
               <p>MR. DONNE. Q. Were either of the Whittey's in your house? A. No; the prosecutor laid out 1s. 1d. at my house - he tendered me a shilling for half a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him throwing his money about? A. I saw him with a sovereign and 12s. or 14s.; I could not tell rightly how much he had - I shut up at half-past eleven o'clock, and was closing my doors when I saw Joyce fall; Bullimore was close to him - Springet was outside also; I was inside, but just within my door, shutting it - I have known Bullimore about twelve months.</p>

             (Police-constable C 30). On Friday, the 28th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, in consequence of information from a lad, I went towards the shop of Mr. Allnutt, in <placeName id="t18321018-13-crimeloc84">Piccadilly</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The only opportunity you had of observing them was when they crossed over? A. Yes; they came very close to me - it was not a very dark night, but it was dark about the shop - he crossed right opposite a large doctor's shop, which has a gas-light; I had my Police dress on - I stood by Lord Wellington's wall: I immediately went to see if the window was cut, in consequence of the information I received from the boy, but could see nothing the matter with it - I returned in about five minutes, but had not taken so much notice the first time; I had run as far as George-court, which took me about five minutes - after examining the window the first time, I went into the shop, and saw Mr. Allnutt, Jun.; it is a large double fronted shop - I do not know whether any body else was in the shop - I called Mr. Allnutt's attention to the window, and ran off directly, without waiting to see him examine it - I did not examine so minutely, being in a hurry to cross after the prisoner; I think I should know the one who crossed with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. On the 28th of September, about half-past ten o'clock at night. I saw the prisoner and another man in company with two females, in Whitcomb-street, St. James' - they were standing under a gas-lamp, all looking at a pair of ivory boot-hooks; when they saw me they all walked away together - I followed them to the bottom of Whitcomb-street; the prisoner and one of the females crossed towards Charing-cross; I lost sight of the others; I met Stone, a Policeman, and we followed them into Parliament-street, there stopped the prisoner, and asked if he had any boot-hooks - he said Yes; he pulled a pair out of his coat pocket - it was not the pair I had seen in his hand; I told Stone to search him - he found two more pair in his coat pocket; I asked how he came by them - he said he was the manufacturer of them; and afterwards said he was a dealer in the article, and afterwards, that he was an ivory-turner; we took him to Gardener's-lane station, and searched, but found nothing more on him: we then took him to the station in Vine-street, and in the morning, found Mr. Allnutt's window had been cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have told us all that passed? A. Yes; Stone was present - he said at last, when I got him to the station, that he bought them at the Black Horse public-house, of a person who was a manufacturer and dealer - I do not recollect his desiring me at first to take him to the Black Horse to find the man - I will not swear he did not; we passed the Black Horse with him; I walked a dozen yards behind with the female; I did not refuse to let him go in - I took him to the nearest station - the inspector did not refuse to take the charge, but as Stone said a window was cut in Piccadilly, he said he thought we had better take him to a nearer station.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not produce all the boot-hooks to you? A. I cannot say, for Stone searched him; he produced one pair, which I saw - I turned aside to the female while Stone was searching; he did not produce the whole pair at once - it was a black pair.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About a quarter to eleven o'clock on this night I was in Parliament-street, and saw the prisoner; the serjeant had given me information - I asked the prisoner if he had any boot-hooks about him; he said he had - I asked him to let me look at them; he pulled one pair out of his coat pocket; I then felt his pockets, and said, "Have not you got some more here?" he said Yes, I have, and pulled out another pair, with a white handle - I asked if he had any more; he made no answer; I felt his coat pocket again, and another pair rattled - I said, "Let me look at all you have about you, for I shall be sure to find them," and then he pulled out another pair - I asked where he got them; he said he was the manufacturer, and hawked them round at different places; then he said he was an ivory-turner, and made them himself; we took him to the station, in Gardener's-lane, and afterwards to Vine-street - when he got there he said he had bought them of a man at the Black Horse, in the Haymarket; I asked if he should know the man if he saw him again; he said No, he should not, he was an entire stranger to him, and he never saw him before in his life; I asked if he bought them in the tap-room or the bar; he said No, just outside the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard Harris examined? A. Yes; he is not my serjeant - I stated this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180025"/>conversation before the Magistrate; I am sure it was at the station that he said he bought them at the Black Horse - he never asked to go to the Black Horse; I told him to come with me, and point out the man; I offered to go with him - he said he did not know the man, he was a perfect stranger; I will not be certain whether I told the Magistrate this: the boot-hooks were all in one pocket - when I asked if he had such things, he produced them: I took them from his hand; I walked to the station with him - there was nobody else with us; he never said he could point out the person at the Black Horse.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Allnutt, of Piccadilly. On the night in question I left the shop at seven o'clock; all the windows were safe then, and none broken - when I came to the shop at eight in the morning I found a corner pane of glass broken, and these three pairs of boothooks, which had hung in a corner close to the square when I left, were gone - those produced are the same; I know them all by a private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Before you missed them had you been told they were lost? A. No; I had hung them there myself; the glass was broken right across the centre, and a hole made sufficient to put a hand in, and get them - we have a lamp in the shop, near the window, every night; the hole could easily be seen outside - it depends on how a person looks; the dwelling-house is Mr. Allnutt's; the property belongs to

             is the only name I know him by; it became due on the 23rd of August - I saw my horse and chaise on the 14th or 15th of August, when I went to Kennington to look for it; I went to the Horns, where he said he had put it up - I got no account of it there; I inquired at several places, and at last saw it standing at a public-house door in Kennington - there was nobody with it, so I got into it, and took the reins; a lad came out, and said it was his father's - I went with him to his father. Thomas Evans, in Belvidere-place, Southwark, then took it home, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. He had hired a horse and gig before? A. Yes, three times - the firs was on the 21st of June; he kept it longer than he had hired it for each time - he hired it first for two days and kept it six; then for four or five days and kept it sixteen: the third was for one day, and he only had it one day - on the 18th of July he hired it for a friend for six days, and he was to pay me; I did not know his friend - I had 7l. 15s. from the prisoner previous to the last hiring, and on the 18th of July he gave me 4l. more; that was after he had hired it the last time - it was towards his former account; I did not complain of his keeping it so long, as I expected to be paid for the hire - the bill of exchange was not paid to me at my own request; I refused to take it several times; I said I had a bill to take up, but my object was to get money from him - I got the bill discounted; on the 31st of July, when I received the bill, he told me his friend was down at Coventry on business, and I need not be uneasy, as it was perfectly safe - I saw him twice after that, as he used to call on a neighbour of mine on business - he did not call on me within ten days of my finding the gig; I called several times at his house, but could not find him - I cannot say when I last saw him I had known him about six weeks before this; I was often in the neighbourhood, and we smoked on pipes at the same tavern; Evans told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180026"/>bought the horse and gig, and showed me a receipt, but did not say the prisoner had bought it of me; I took a warrant out against the prisoner the day after I found it, or the second day; I saw Evans, but had no conversation with him about letting it stand over - Evans said, "Let it rest a day or so," but I was advised to the contrary - I said I would sooner have my money than prosecute; the warrant was delivered to the officer immediately - I told him it was useless to go over the water unless I went with him; I was busy for a day or two, and could not go, but I told him to call in Shouldham-street, where the prisoner lived; he was taken on another charge - I called at his house once or twice, but the young man said he was out of town; there was a person with Evans, who he called Solomons -I have not kept him out of the way.</p>

            . I live at No. 38, Belvidere-place, Southwark, and am a furniture-dealer. On the 18th of July, about two or three o'clock, the prisoner came, and said he had bought a horse he thought would suit me, being about to go a journey; I thought it would suit me - he said he could recommend it as a good working horse, which would suit me for general purposes, and I should have the horse, chaise, and harness for 35l.,; I said I thought that was not out of the way, and we retired to the Duke of York public-house, with Mr. Solomons and Miller; Solomons is a friend of mine, and Miller was at my house; I said, "Will you go and have a glass of ale?" we all four went, and there completed the bargain - I paid him 35l., and took a receipt, which is here; it is signed "

            " - I have known him five or six years by that name; he said the horse and chaise were his own; I sent my son out with them on the 15th of August - he came back with the prosecutor and another person; I live at least three miles from Harley-mews.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been intimate with him? A. I knew him as a tradesman, but have not seen him latterly - I saw him the day before I bought the horse and gig, and said I was going into the country; he knew I had been in want of a horse for some time, that would do various works - I did not particularly want it for that journey; I had a horse and gig from him once before, but not more - I think it was the 6th or 7th of July; I kept it nine or ten days - I did not buy it: he offered that one for sale, and recommended it as strongly as this; I had it on trial, and not approving of it, returned it - I lent him 20l. on it, and took his receipt, which he has destroyed; it was not for 35l., but I took very little notice of it, as the bargain was not concluded - the money was returned to me, and the keep of the horse paid; he promised me two tons of coals for the interest; he was then selling them at 25s. a ton- Solomons' son introduced me to him about the first horse and gig, but he knew me well; Solomons wrote the receipts on both occasions, and some trifling money passed between them, which I understood was commission for some coals - I gave the money to the prisoner on both occasions; I paid him 35l. for the horse and gig - it was no loan; he paid me about 1l. 15s. for the keep of the first horse, but not as interest - Bannister came to my house soon after he got his horse and chaise, to know what was to be done, and we went to the Duke of York; Miller came in; I said to Bannister, "I don't rightly understand this business, it seems strange the man should sell a horse and gig which don't belong to him - have you ever received any money of him?" he said Yes, and I think said between 11l. and 12l., in cash, and a bill for 24l.; I said,"Well then, he has bought the horse and gig of you" - he said, "Oh, no, I don't know about that - the bill is not paid;" I am quite sure he said that - I did not tell Mr. Richards that all I wanted was 27l. 10s., nor that it was all that was due to me; I did not mention any sum - I said, "Where is Golding? had he not better come forward and arrange about the horse and chaise? Bannister don't want to injure him, nor do I;" I did not say I had not bought it, nor any thing which he could infer that from.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it the same gig that you had both times? A. Yes - I objected to the first horse, and afterwards the same gig was brought with a different horse; he came to me about eleven o'clock in the morning on the 18th of July, and said he thought he had a horse that would suit me, and brought it between two and three; I went into the country on the 22nd or 23rd of July.</p>

            . I was present at this transaction; they went to the Duke of York - I saw Evans put some notes on the table to the prisoner, who handed him a receipt for 35l.; I had previously seen the first horse which Evans had - the prisoner said this would do much better, that he had bought it, and paid for it, part with a bill and part with cash.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went to the public-house? A. Solomons, Evans, the prisoner, and I - I only knew Evans in the way of business; I am an appraiser, and do business with brokers - he frequently buys at my saleroom; I only know Solomons by sight - I have heard he is a lawyer - he is a respectable man: Solomons asked the prisoner for 10s. commission on some coals; the prisoner gave him a 10l. note, and Solomons went to the bar for change, which he could not get - he then went out, and brought in 9l. 10s.; I live in Johnson-court, Blackfriars-road.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 26th of September I took the prisoner on another charge, at his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to say Evans had the horse and chaise three times, though he swears he never had it, but twice - Solomons, who managed the whole transaction and wrote the receipts, would be able to contradict every word Evans has stated, as to the sale and money, as Evans on one occasion received 7l. interest; Bannister told me he was so pushed for money, he had a bill to pay, and if I would let him have it, I might keep the horse and chaise, or if I returned them I should have the bill back again, or the money; I have lent him money on one or two occasions to take up bills; we had a running account between us, being out together smoking our pipes; Evans first let me have 20l., for which I gave him 2l. 10s. interest and paid for the keep of the horse; the next time I had 20l., and gave him 22l. 10s., and 3l. or 4l. for keep, and on the third transaction he gave me 20l., which Solomons could prove.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 20th of September, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a silver milkpot; he asked the price, and weight, which I told him - he took it up, and went out of the shop with it - I followed him to the door, and missed him - not knowing which way he was gone, I could not follow him; he was apprehended on the 22nd of September, on a similar charge - he took it quite openly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run, or walk away? A, He was a very short distance from the door - he went out quick - I cannot say he ran; I had some distance to get round, the flap of the counter being down; I saw him again at Bow-street on the 26th or 27th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me run, or walk out of the shop? A. The distance was so short, you could hardly make a run of it; you were hardly three steps from the door - you went out quicker than you came in.</p>

             (Police-constable F 76.) On the 27th of September the prisoner was given into my custody, on another charge, on which he has been acquitted to-day, in the other Court - he said what he had to state should be before the Magistrate; I found this silver milk-pot on his person. (See page 927.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you look after me, or did I give myself into your custody? A. Neither; you were given to me by Mr. Mott's foreman, who had you by the collar; we took you into a shop, while he told me the nature of the charge; I took you into another of Mr. Mott's shops; he has two - Mott's man had you by the collar, and you had the milk-pot in your hand - it was from what you said that I found Mr. Brook's out; I do not consider that you gave yourself into my custody.</p>

            . This is Mr. Brook's milk-pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is it in the same state as when you gave it to me? A. Yes; I see no alteration - here is our private mark on it now; nothing has been done to disguise it - the officer brought it to our shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I most respectfully inform the Court I am not in a situation to proceed further in this trial: the officers of justice, by whom I have been confined, have pursued a course which renders it impossible for me to defend myself, and I am solely, from the course pursued by the said officers, completely and entirely at the mercy, and in the power of the prosecutor, who is comparatively a rich man, and his witness, the Policeman, who is entitled to receive more wages than his pay for my conviction; I am thus left at the mercy of persons interested in finding me guilty; under these circumstances, I claim the interposition and authority of the Court to afford me a just and reasonable opportunity of defending myself from the charge: the Policeman, as soon as I gave myself into his custody, (with an intention of going before the Magistrate to explain that I was possessed of the milk-pot, and another which I took from Mott's, and for stealing which I have been acquitted, I intended to explain my conduct there; but) instead of taking me to the Magistrate, he took me to the station, where every article was taken from me, among which were the very proofs and facts I had prepared to defend myself against the charge.</p>

            . Mr. Minshull ordered me to bring to him what I took from the prisoner, and I believe they are in his hands now; it was pamphlets relating to the criminal law, with some papers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were several manuscripts and receipts, and various articles of which I have no account; he took even the key of my trunk; and it is the practice of Policemen to go to prisoners' dwellings, and take what they think may convict them; I do not know the injury I may sustain from this man, who I gave myself into the hands of; the fact is, he has committed a robbery instead of me, for he took my property; I have been locked up a month, in consequence of which the newspapers are exposing me all through the world; I am a teacher by profession; I am known in Scotland and all parts; the papers have exposed me as having done an act - whereas my sole reason was to expose the cause of crime, with an intention of bringing the matter directly before this Court, and through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180030"/>them before the Government, in order that crimes so heinous may be stopped. I wish to inform the Court I am clear myself of any intention of taking the cup with any other view than to expose a publication which I have brought out for the benefit of society; I went to Mr. Brooks', thinking the man would follow me into the street, and take me into custody, and I said I should explain to the Lord Mayor why I did it; I can bring evidence before the Court, if means are afforded me to subpoena my witnesses, that I used every other means in my power to bring the work before the public, but not having the means of publication, I took these means. I was aware I was breaking the law, but I had rather suffer punishment myself to benefit society.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and live in High Holborn. I believe the prisoner to be a worthy good man - he was a schoolmaster, but has been unsuccessful -I firmly believe the situation he has placed himself in was merely for the sake of experiment, he is so excited with regard to the laws - on the subject of any thing connected with our laws and politics he is exceedingly warm; and considers that his publication will produce general good; a more honourable man I believe does not exist.</p>
               <p>- FEDDON. I am a schoolmaster, and live in Stanhope-street. I have had the pleasure of the prisoner's acquaintance for twenty years; he would scorn the idea of a mean action - he got his living respectably as a teacher; I do not know whether he had a place on the day in question; he had a home - I do not believe him to be in want.</p>

            . I live in Colebrook-street, and have known the prisoner three years; he was enthusiastic on the question of public good, more especially on criminal law; I have read his pamphlet - a more honourable man I do not know; his pamplets were for sale, and for public circulation.</p>
               <p>After the Learned Common Sergeant had recapitulated the evidence to the Jury, the prisoner added:</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ought to have said I held the property from Thursday evening to Saturday, waiting to see if it was advertised; when I walked out of the shop, I stood at a distance to see if the man would follow me, but nobody did, and I was so astonished I thought it was really a dream; I went home, and looked at the paper two days, but it was not advertised - I said, "I will take this with me, and go and commit another act to-day, at twelve o'clock at noon - it is impossible that they will take me into custody, and by this means the man I have taken this from will have his property;" if it had been advertised, I would have gone before the Lord Mayor, and acknowledged myself the man who took it; I have ruined my character, no doubt, by the act, but it is plain I did not intend to deprive him of his property, as I did not dispose of it - I explained this to the Magistrate, and he was perfectly satisfied I did not intend to steal it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Had you known any thing of her before? A. No; we had not a character with her; she said she was in distress, and we took her out of charity - she said that afternoon that she should not stay.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON (Police-constable H 87). On the night of the 13th of September I was on duty in Wentworth-street, about eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner, who had a plaid clock on, speaking to another person; I went up to her, and asked what she had - she said I was very curious, she had got her own property; she then said she had got a pair of trousers, if I must know, which she had taken out of pawn, and she was going to send them to a young man in Yorkshire - I found these overalls on her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I came to town in September, on a Sunday night, by the steam-packet; and on the next Thursday I wanted to go to St. George's in the East, but being a stranger, I did not know the way - I met with the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was looking in at a window; she came, and asked me to give her a glass of porter; I said I would, on condition of her showing me the way to St. George's in the East - she said she was going that way, and we walked on for two or three hundred yards; she then said, "Stop, I have to call in here;" she went to a house, and told me to come in; I went in, and then she asked me for her glass of porter; I gave her some - when we had drank it, there was a knocking at the door; the prisoner got up, and said, "For shame of yourself," and she went out of the door - I went to go out, but I found I was fastened in the house; I pulled the door, and with difficulty I got out, but the prisoner was gone; there were two women standing in the yard; they asked what I wanted - I said I came with a lady, who was going to show me the way; one of them said, "I think she has fleeced you;" I felt for my pocket-book, which had 1100l. in it; that was safe; but I missed thirty sovereigns out of my pocket, all but one half-sovereign - I gave information, and she was taken the following morning; I had taken out all my money to give her sixpence to get the beer - I had only one sixpence; the rest was sovereigns and half-sovereigns - she saw what I had; there was a bed in the room, and we sat upon it - I was there probably a quarter of an hour; I had been anxious to go, and she was anxious to keep me; I did not perceive her hand in my pocket; I had been tipsy in the course of the day, but I was a great deal better then - I am quite sure my gold was safe when I took out the money, and gave her the sixpence.</p>

               <p>HARRIET DREW. On the 24th of September I had been to Bethnal-green, and was coming home in the evening, about ten minutes or a quarter past seven o'clock, with my mother, my aunt, and a friend of hers -I had a bundle in my hand; I do not know what it contained: a man, who I did not see, snatched it from me, and ran away - my father's name is William; it was my mother's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of a night was it? A. It was dark - I had a friend with me; my mother and aunt were three or four yards before us: it was so dark, we could not well distinguish them - my bundle was snatched on a sudden, and the person was gone in an instant; there was no opportunity for any one to see him scarcely - my friend was in conversation with me; I believe she saw three men as we passed, but not at the time the bundle was snatched - they had not offended us; there was no reason to notice them particularly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not a dark night? A. It was about a quarter-past seven o'clock, but the gas-light shone full in his face; Mrs. Drew and her sister were three or four yards before us - I could discern them distinctly; it was quite light enough to see what they were doing - there was another man taken up in the field; I saw Scott again, about a quarter before ten o'clock the same night, and I identified him - none of the Policemen desired me to look at his nose, or at any part of his face; he had his hat on when he took the bundle, but I could see his face - he had a coat on with bright buttons; I cannot tell what cravat he had - I had seen him when I passed the end of the street, and then I turned round to look at him - I did not describe the prisoner's face to the Policeman; I said he was a tall man and fair - I did not notice the other men; they were standing more in the dark.</p>

             (Police-constable S 1.) On Sunday morning, the 23rd of September, I was on duty at Highgate-hill; the prisoner came up, and spoke to me - as he was going along towards Highgate we got in front of a public-house; he went and laid down his head on the trough, and his hat fell into it - I took it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180039"/>found in it a new handkerchief, an old one, a cap, and seven pairs of gloves; I said, "Have you lost any thing?" he said, "Yes, my hat" - I asked if he had lost any thing else; he said Yes, a new cotton handkerchief, a nightcap, and an old handkerchief; I then produced the gloves, and asked if he knew any thing about them - he said No; he claimed the hat - I took him to the station.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was the hat? A. In the trough; there was no water in it; he was not asleep - he was a little in liquor; he did not appear to have been fighting - I meet him every morning when he goes out to work; it was about half-past two o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

On the 22nd of September I saw the prisoner in my shop, in company with two other persons - one of them bought a half-handkerchief; while I was serving them I was called to serve a man at the door; on returning, I saw the prisoner putting a parcel into his pocket, but not suspecting it was any thing of mine, I took no notice of it - he went out before the other men, and said he wanted to go and get some tobacco; I have no doubt of these being my gloves; they have my wife's writing on the paper - I did not miss them till they were brought on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock; I could not miss them from my stock; but when they were brought, I missed some similar to them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many pairs of gloves ought you to have had in your stock? A. That is impossible for me to tell - I missed such as these; I have no mark on them; I cannot say the prisoner was sober, but he was not drunk - he was sober; it was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were your gloves wrapped up in a paper of this description? A. Yes; I had but one paper of gloves of this description.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop with my mates; I believe they bought a shirt and a handkerchief - we came out together; I saw no gloves - I then went on to Camden-town; I offended one of them, and we quarrelled and fought - the Policeman came, and told me to go home about my business; I then went on to the trough; this Policeman came, took my hat, and took it behind the Flask - when I awoke up I saw two lights, and two Policemen came, and asked if I had lost any thing - they brought these gloves forward, but they were not in my hat at all.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Was there another Policeman with you? A.

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, on the 7th of September, I went to look for the prisoners, and took them together in Drury-lane - I asked how they came by the plate; they both said they found it in an uninhabited house in the New-road.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Chandler's Defence. I left Chelsea, went to Smithfield, and met Chilston between eleven and twelve o'clock- he said he had picked the property up, and asked if I knew where to sell it; I said No - he asked me to go into the shop, and ask if they bought such things; I went, and said it belonged to a young man outside - I came out, and sent Chilston in.</p>
               <p>Chilson's Defence. About ten o'clock I left this lad, and by some ruins I was taken ill; I went into a vault, and in one corner saw this parcel, wrapped in paper - I came out, and saw this lad coming; he asked what I had got; I told him, and asked where I could sell it - as we went up Long-acre he saw written up, "The best price given for old gold and silver;" he went in, came out, and said they would buy it; I went in with it, and it was stopped - I understand the sweeps had been at the prosecutor's that morning, and most likely they stole it.</p>

            . I am waiter at a tavern in Swithin's-lane, which this alley comes into. I was standing at master's door, which is by the side of the alley, and saw the prisoner standing before Warner; what he took from him I cannot tell, but I saw him run away, and Warner hallooed out Stop thief! he turned down George-street, which is opposite - a watchman there made him turn back; I caught him in my hands, and while I held him I saw him throw the watch down - we had a scuffle; I fell, and he got away - I took the watch up, and the watchman, who was about one hundred yards off, secured him; I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a dark night? A. Yes, but there was a gas-lamp right opposite where it was done- I did not lose sight of him at all till he was re-taken, except for a moment while I was down; the prosecutor's face and the prisoner's back were towards me at the time of the robbery; I was near a light when I fell - we scuffled for four or five minutes, but the watchman is a very old man, and could hardly walk; the prisoner saw him, and then turned back - it was not him who took him; he was about thirty yards from the end of the court at the time; the prisoner had a green sparrow-tailed coat, which was buttoned; I could see the colour of his coat when I was in front of him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in Oxfordcourt, leading to Cannon-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, and saw the prisoner run by, and several pursuing him, calling Stop thief!

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were other persons running? A. Three or four - it was a dark night; he was ahead of all the rest that I could see - he might be following some body, but it is not very likely.</p>

I had a wardrobe of old clothes to sell, and on the 18th of September I directed my servant to apply to some one to buy! them - the prisoner was brought in for that purpose; I showed him the clothes; I think I asked 8l. for them; and, after a great deal of bantering, he agreed to give 5l. for them - he wished to divide them into lots, but I would not allow it, as I wished to sell them altogether; he offered me a 10l. note, but I suspected it was not a good one, from a man of his appearance; I refused it, and said I would have five sovereigns; he said he would go to the public-house, and get change - he gave me five halfcrowns to bind the bargain; I then went into my dressing-room, and, on hearing a bustle, I looked out of the window, and saw him running, but I was in deep negligee, and could not follow him - I dressed as fast as I could, and found that the greater part of the cloth clothes were missing - I had seen him carrying a bundle as he passed the window - I gave information at the Policestation, and went with the officer to Cutler-street, where I saw the prisoner exhibiting the clothes for sale; we took them and him to the Magistrate; he was remanded; and when I entered the office a man put a 5l. note into my hand, and I promised I would do what I could, as it was not my wish to prosecute - I told the Magistrate I had received the 5l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then you had the clothes and money too? A. I had part of them, but not the part which the prisoner took away; I have been acting as a mercantile agent for several houses on the continent - I told the Magistrate I had received the 5l. note, and he desired me to keep it - I did not see the prisoner's 10l. note, I only chose to have five sovereigns - I do not remember whether I told the Magistrate that I saw the prisoner running away.</p>

             (City Police Constable, No. 36). I live in Little Britain. I went with the prosecutor to Cutler-street, and, after looking about for some time, we found the prisoner in a gateway, spreading out these clothes, in the presence of two or three other persons - I took the property stated, which I here produce; the prosecutor taxed him with taking them; he said "Well, I intend to pay the gentleman for them."</p>
               <p>MR. COX. These are my property, and are a part of what I showed him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who proposed leaving the five half-crowns? A. The prisoner did; he said he would change the 10l. note at the public-house, and bring the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to the house, and he agreed to let me have the lot for 5l. - I selected the best of them, and offered 4l. 10s. for them; he said I had better buy the old ones, and I agreed to have the rest for 10s.; I then gave him 12s. 6d., and took some of the things, but no part of what I had agreed to give the 4l. 10s. for - these things are not worth the money I left.</p>
               <p>MR. COX. He did separate some things, and made me an offer, which I would not listen to; he took the best of the things away.</p>

            . I remember the time when Cousins found the potatoes and fowls in my brother's possession; I had been with him to London that morning, as far as Shoreditch church - I did not go to the market with him- I saw him buy these fowls of a higgler, in Shoreditch, at 1s. a piece; the man said he was going to Leadenhall-market - he bought the potatoes for 18d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far does your brother live from Mr. Talbot's? A. About half a mile; you go across two fields from his house to Mr. Talbot's - the place where I received the fowls was the nearest place to turn off to go to my brother's; the higgler was a dark man, and he had a cart - he bought the potatoes of another man.</p>

               <p>MR. DONNE. Q. Where did he buy the potatoes? A. Just by Shoreditch church; I did not notice that man - I have always given the same account of the transaction; I swear I never said that they were bought at the corner of White Lion-street - I was not at the prosecutor's that morning; I only shut the gate, but I was not in the yard - I was waiting for my brother.</p>

On the afternoon of the 16th of September I stopped the prisoner in Tyndal-place, with a fowl in his apron, which he said he had brought from the Commercial-road, to sell to a man at a public-house, but he did not know the sign - as I was taking him to the station, he put his hand into his coat pocket, and raised it so as to spill a quantity of barley; the prosecutor was allowed the care of the fowl, and it has been stolen again.</p>

             (Police-constable E 157.) I took Miller at the prosecutrix's; she was searched by a woman- there was one duplicate found on her, but it did not apply to any of these things; she said there, and afterwards, at the station, that she would pawn every thing she had in the world to get the things again, but she did not specify any thing in particular.</p>

               <p>Miller.

On the 22nd of September my attention was called to Dyer's-buildings; I saw the prisoners coming down the buildings; Stepto was carrying this copper, and a chain; Davis was carrying a basket of carpenter's tools; I asked where they were going to take the copper; they both said to Ludgate-hill - I said that could not be, as it was not their property; they said if I had any doubt they would go back to the person who gave it them - Stepto put the copper down, and was going away, but I told him to take it back to where he brought it from; he took it to No. 5, Dyer's-buildings, and put it down in the parlour; Davis went in with him -I sent my brother for an officer; he could not find one - I went for an officer, and got one; we then went to the house, and tried to get in with a key, but we found the door was bolted, or locked, inside; we went to No. 6, and tried to unlock that, but it was fastened inside; the officer then tried to get in with a crow-bar, but could not -I then got through No. 4, over the roof, to No. 5 - I went down there, and let the officers in; they searched that house, but found no one - we then went to No. 6, and on going down stairs we found a white apron; we went into one of the yards, and found a basket of tools, which I believe is what Davis had in his hand - an officer then went on the top of the houses, and found Stepto between two walls; he was got out, and the officer took him; in the mean time a servant came, and gave us some information - we went to a house in Castle-street, which is at the back of the houses, in Dyer's-buildings; we could not find Davis, but he was afterwards taken.</p>

I saw Davis at the Compter the next morning; I asked him if the basket of tools belonged to him - he said they did; I said,"Stepto means to throw it all on your shoulders, for he says you hired him to carry the things" - he said, "That is false, for we both agreed upon the robbery," and asked me what story I would advise him to make.</p>

On the 27th of September, I saw him in St. James's-place, and said "Bill! Mr. Hinton wishes to see you;" he said "Mr. Hinton wishes to see me;" I said "Yes, he does particularly;" he said he could not go then, if I would go to Hinton and tell him he would be there at two o'clock; I said Hinton had desired me to take him if I saw him, and if he did not go with me, I would take steps to make him; he said it was impossible, for he had to see Lord Palmerston, and Lady Brougham, and could not disappoint them; I said, I dare say Hinton would satisfy him for his loss of time; I took hold of his arm, and said, if he did not I would give him into custody - he then went with me to Hinton.</p>

I am entirely innocent; he knew perfectly well when I left Lord Brougham's, where I was going - he invited me to dinner before I left town - I said I did not think I could come; I called on the Saturday, told him where I was going, and he forced me to stop and dine with him - I produced the miniature; he went to the door, which was only a few yards, and I was not out of his sight; he came back - I met him, and said "Well, Hinton, I have stopped so long, I must go;" he said "Very well, call again if you can before you leave town;" he knew what coaches went to where I was going; I did not go to Grantham till Wednesday; I booked my place on Tuesday, and there was plenty of time for him to inquire at the coach-office; I returned to town, as the lady kept her old servant; I was going to be introduced to Lord Brougham at twelve o'clock for a situation, when the servant out of place came up shabbily dressed, and gathered a mob round me - he said he did not know what Hinton wanted; I said I would be there at two o'clock, but he made me go; I begged him to tell me what Hinton wanted, and in Regent-street, he said he suspected me of taking something from his house - I would not have gone with him if guilty; when I got there, Hinton insulted me - I felt hurt; he said he would fight me, for he could not bring me to justice - I said "You wrong me, take me before a justice," and finding I would not fight, he called in a Policeman; the Magistrate offered to take one person's bail, but having no friend I could not get bail.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go with him to the station? A. I believe I did; I did not hear him say any thing - he might have asked the Policeman to go with him to the house he received the note at, without my hearing it - his tendering the second note was voluntary, but I had said I would send for an officer before he took me into the room; I could have searched his pocket-book if I had chosen - I live about half a mile from Wych-street.</p>
               <p>MR. FOLLET. Q. Before he produced the pocketbook, you had asked how many notes he had? A. Yes; I sent my lad for an officer, in his hearing, before he asked to go into the back-room; the lad brought Reynolds, and I left the prisoner in the room with him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 1st of October Mr. Simpson's boy fetched me - I found the prisoner in the back parlour, and found on him 6s., and some halfpence, and a pocket-book -Mr. Simpson gave me these two forged notes - I marked them, and kept them till the next day, then gave them to the Bank-inspector, Mr. Freeman -Mr. Simpson marked one note in his shop; I did not see the inspector give him the notes at Bow-street; I took the prisoner to the station; we had no conversation before- as I was taking him from the station to Bow-street that night, he told me if I would let him walk a little before me, he might show me the house where the party was who gave him the note - I asked him to tell me the sign; he said he could not tell, but he would point it out- I would not let him walk before me, thinking he meant to run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you the house was in Maiden-lane; A. No; I did not ask him where it was; he said there where two young men in the house, and that was all he stated - I could have got assistance to go with him to point the house out if I had chosen.</p>
               <p>MR. SIMPSON. The note No. 2347 is the one he offered in payment of the 6s.; I wrote the address he gave me on it in the shop - Reynolds was at the office once more than me, for the purpose of giving the notes to the inspector, but I marked the other note at Bow-street, within a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I live in Grenada-terrace, Commercial-road, and am a watchmaker and goldsmith. To the best of my belief the prisoner is the man who came on Monday, the 27th of August, to my shop; he asked to look at a gold-chain, which I showed him, and asked four guineas for; he said it was rather too much, and asked to look at some seals, and he selected one, for which I asked him 35s.; there was another man with him- they talked it over among themselves; I am quite sure the prisoner is not the other man - he was much stouter; he said he would give me a guinea and a half, which I agreed to take, and he tendered me a 5l. note, as I thought it to be - the prisoner I believe to be the person who tendered it; to the best of my recollection he took it out of his waistcoat-pocket - I took it, and asked his name and address, which he gave; I wrote it on the back of the note, this is it (looking at it); he gave me "Mr. Evans, No. 1, Curser-street" - I asked him where Curser-street was; he said just at the top of the road - I was then satisfied, and took the note, and gave him the seal, with three sovereigns and 8s. 6d. from my pocket - I wrote the address on the note, in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at Bow-street? A. Yes, last Monday week; I was not sworn - I refused to swear to the prisoner, but at the same time expressed my confidence that he was the man; but when he tendered me the note he had very bushy whiskers, and he was then without whiskers, which made a very great alteration; that was my only reason for refusing to swear to him - I do not swear to him now; he has no whiskers now, but there is still the same countenance - I discovered the note to be forged about five weeks after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How is it you mention the 27th of August so exactly? A. I put it down on a piece of paper, when I was copying some poetry that day, after he left - I wrote the date down carelessly as I was writing; I burnt it among other papers a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you afterwards hear the note was forged? A. Yes, and my master sent me to look for Curser-street, but I could find no such street.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean, that going to look for the street, and hearing the note was forged, impresses the 27th of August on your mind? A. I heard my master say it was the 27th, and I am positive that was the date - I kept it in my mind.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes. These three notes are forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signatures - they are both from the same plate, and the signatures appear to be the same hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Possessed of a small independence, and having much leisure time upon my hands, I have been in the habit of frequenting many places of public resort, at one of which, about two months previous to this unfortunate transaction, it was my misfortune to meet with a young man named Lane - from his gentlemanly and prepossessing manner, I felt disposed to encourage the intimacy; indeed, so great was my confidence in him, that but a short time after the commencement of our acquaintance, I, without the least hesitation, acceeded to his request for the loan of 10s., and would willingly have lent him a larger sum. On the morning of the day in question, I met Lane, and accepted his invitation to pass the evening with him - according to my appointment I met Lane, and with him proceeded to a coffee-house in Catherine-street, Strand, where we met two other persons, with whom Lane was acquainted, and of whom I had some slight knowledge; we afterwards went to a tavern in Maiden-lane, when, after some preliminary conversation, Lane alluded to the 10s. owing to me by him; and, jestingly alluding to my taste in articles of dress, he asked me if I would have any objection to execute a little commission for him of that nature; he mentioned a particular description of silk handkerchief of the same pattern as one which I myself had mentioned as possessing, and a similar one he was desirous of having; he, therefore, asked me if I would oblige him by purchasing a handkerchief of the same pattern, and at the same time two black silk handkerchiefs - he took a 5l. note from his pocket, and gave it to me, for the purpose of making the purchase, observing that I could repay myself the 10s. he had borrowed of me. As I was about leaving the room, one of the persons we had met with at the coffee-house, asked me if I would be kind enough to execute a similar commission for him; I answered Yes, willingly, and he took a note-case from his pocket, in which there was a 5l. note, which he gave to me with the case; I then went to Mr. Simpson's shop, in New-street, Covent-garden, and asked for the articles for Lane first, for which I tendered his note, wishing to keep each commission separate - Mr. Simpsons declared the note to be a forgery, and asked whether I had any more in my possession; I instantly produced the other note, and told him where the parties for whom I was acting could instantly be found; he, however, gave me in custody to a Policeman, to whom I repeated where the parties were to be found, and requested him to accompany me to the house where they were, but this he refused to do.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Saunders. I remember the prisoner coming and tendering the 5l. note, which master desired me to take to Mr. Stanford, a neighbour, to ask his opinion whether it was good - I took it, leaving the prisoner in the shop; I brought the same note back, put it into master's hands, and told him Mr. Stauford's opinion - after that he said, in the prisoner's hearing, that he would go to a neighbour himself with it; she made no reply; after he was gone some time, she asked where he was gone; I said, "To a neighbour;" she said it would injure her very much, and she should be very late home; that her husband was not aware she was going to purchase a shawl, and it might cause some disagreeableness - she asked how long he might be; I said I could not tell, he was only gone a few doors off; in the mean time he came in, told her it was a bad note, and he must keep it - he wanted to walk home with her to her husband; she declined, saying it would make it very disagreeable, and she would leave all the silver she had, which was half a crown, which she laid on the counter; Mr. Saunders would not take it - she wished to have the note back; he said he could not return it; she told me she had seen some very pretty shawls in our window, which took her fancy, and induced her to come in; she declined allowing Mr. Saunders to walk with her, but said she would return with her husband in a quarter of an hour; she left the shop, and master followed her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the note sent into Mr. Stanford's back parlour to be looked at? A. No; it was never out of my sight - I was gone not above five or ten minutes, and found her waiting there when I returned; I am sure she said the half-crown was all she had - I had left the shop by the private door, to watch her - I followed master and the officer.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 1st of October I met Mr. Saunders in Oxford-street, accompanied him down Regent-street, and went up to the prisoner - when we got to the end of the Quadrant, she turned round, and said, "Now, Sir, I will tell you the whole truth;" Mr. Saunders' account of what she said is correct - I had been with him for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and had not heard him say a word to induce her to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search her? A. Yes, and found 12s. on her, in silver - she was about twelve yards before us, till we stopped her; she turned down a court; I followed her, and she was tying her shoe or stocking, or pretending to do so; she then crossed to the other side, still going towards the Quadrant; Saunders first went up to her fifty or eighty yards from the Quadrant; some conversation might have taken place between her and Saunders before I went up - she might have thrown any thing away in the court, as it was dark, but I did not search to see if she had, which I should have done if I had suspected it.</p>

               <p>MR. FOLLET. Q. When was she searched, when she got to the station? A. Not for an hour; I searched her pockets, and merely felt her breast.</p>

            . I know the prisoner, and believe she is an unfortunate woman. On the 1st of October, I met her between six and seven o'clock, in the Haymarket - we walked together, and about eight o'clock she met an old gentleman, and went away with him.</p>
               <p>MR. FOLLET. Q. Where was this? A. In Regent-street; it was on a Monday - we had walked from between six and seven o'clock - I was looking about for new patterns for my business, in different shop windows; I am a trimming manufacturer, and live in Old Montague-street, Brick-lane, Whitechapel - we met the gentleman in Regent-street; I left them down a turning close by Oxford-street; I do not know the name of the street - I walked with them for about half an hour, to various places; they were looking at different shop windows, up Regent-street, till they came to Oxford-street - the gentleman said in Regent-street; that he would make her a present of a shawl, and asked her to have something to drink - I saw him take out his purse, and heard him say he had nothing but a 5l. note, except a little silver - I saw him give her a bit of paper from his purse; it appeared like a note - by the prosecutor's shop she said "That is a shawl which, if I was going to purchase, I should like;" I wished them good night, and left them together, going towards the prosecutor's shop again; she took his arm, and walked towards the prosecutor's shop - I did not hear him tell her to meet him under the Quadrant or at a public-house; I heard him say"Mind and return the change, and not give more than 1l. or 25s., if you do, I shall be angry;" I at first thought that he was joking, but when he gave her the note I found he was in earnest; he said when he met her "Have you not a better shawl?" she said not - he said "I will give you one if you will go with me" - I heard she was in custody on the Wednesday following; I have known her four years, but do not know where she lived - I had not seen her for seven or eight months; I believe she is married.</p>

Bank note, as it appeared to be; I asked her name and address - she said, "Jackson, No. 22, Lucas-street, Commercial-road;" I wrote on the note, in her presence, "Miss Jackson," but did not put the address - she saw me write it; this is the note - it has my own name under the name; I fetched the change down stairs, locked the note in my own chest, and brought down 3l. 18s., which I gave her with the heads; I paid the note to the receiver-general - it was returned to me on the Tuesday following, stamped "Forged."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain the prisoner gave you the note? A. Quite; I pointed her out at Newgate this day week, from a number of females, who were all in a row; I knew her directly I looked at her, and so did my young man - I never said I could not swear to her - she was nearly a quarter of an hour in my shop.</p>

            . I am a woman of the town. On the night of the 27th of September, I was in New-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180060"/>Covent-garden; I saw Williams and Lawrence about halfpast eleven o'clock, I asked them to treat me, and they took me to a wine-vaults - I walked with them through the Piazza's, and left them at the corner of Elton-street; Williams said he would sleep with me, and perhaps he would see me again in half an hour, but no place was appointed - it was then about half-past twelve o'clock; I afterwards saw Williams at the corner of Plumtree-street, St. Giles', about a quarter-past one - I known the stationhouse, one part of it is in George-street, which is the next street to Plumtree-street; Williams then asked me, if I would call a cab - I went to a stand, but there was no one on the stand; I returned in two or three minutes to Williams and then Lawrence had come to him, but I had not seen him come - they had got a cab, and were in it; I asked them to give me a ride - the cab-man refused, and said it was too much for the horse, but they said, "O let her get in," and I did; we drove to Eagle-street - Lawrence there got out of the cab, and took a bundle out with him; I still sat in the cab: Lawrence returned, and brought his bundle back to the cab, and said, "My brother is gone to bed" - he got into the cab, and they then told the man to drive to Little Saffron hill; he drove there - I do not know the number of the house they stopped at; they got out, and took with them the bundle and a basket - I sat in the cab for full ten minutes after they had got out, and taken the bundle and basket; I do not rightly know what time it was, but it was more then half-past one o'clock - Williams then came out, and asked if I would come in and sit by the fire; Isaac Cohen then came out of the house, and I went in doors - I did not see Cohen do any thing with the cabman; I did not see what the bundle and basket contained: I did not see them opened at Cohen's, nor did I see any things on the floor - I was sitting by the fire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see either the basket or the bundle on the floor? A. I saw them on the floor, but I did not see them opened - I had had something to drink, and there was a table before me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see them on the floor? A. Yes; they had been removed before the Policemen came, but I did not see them - both the Cohen's were in the room; I cannot tell how long I had been in the room before the three officers came, but I think above an hour; I had had some tea - I heard

             speak to one of the officers, but I cannot tell what he said; all the prisoners were in the room when the officers came; I saw the Policeman take the basket from under a bed, or a sofa, and I saw them take the clothes out on their arms, but I cannot say where they took them from; they seemed to be men's clothes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see, at any time, the things taken out of the bundle and basket? A. No; the clothes were taken from the same place as the basket was, but the things were put away before I got into the room; I think the basket was empty when it was drawn from under the bed- there were two beds in the room; I did not see whether there were articles taken from both the beds - I did not hear what passed between the officer and Isaac Cohen as they went out at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you known Williams before? A. No; we went to a wine-vualts, and I think they had been drinking before; I think we had two or three glasses of gin at the wine-vaults - Williams certainly was tipsy; I do not know who put the things into the cab - I did not see them put in; I did not see any thing with either of them; I heard that a number of things were laying about the street - Williams was all the way through very desirous that I should accompany him, and when there was an objection made about my getting into the cab, I think it was him that said, "Oh, let her come;" it was Lawrence who got out at Eagle-street, but Williams remained in the cab; and when Lawrence got in again, Williams desired the man to go to Saffron-hill, and said he was going to take me to his lodging.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. Q. Did you not put a blue handkerchief into my hat, which you said you picked up at the bottom of the cab? A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon after you arrived at Saffron-hill did you go into the room? A. I think in about ten minutes - I cannot say who removed the things into the room; I dare say I was an hour in the room - the things were not removed in that time - Abraham Cohen went out to get something to drink, leaving the others in the room - I saw and heard what they did; when the Policemen came in, Isaac Cohen said, "What is the matter?" or something of that kind, and he went outside the door - they came into the room again, and I believe the things were pointed out by Cohen, but I did not see it, as I was very much frightened - I was sitting by the fire; it was a good sized room; I had not seen or heard any bargaining about the things.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went into the room, were the bundle and basket in sight? A. No, they were not - there was no appearance of business in the place; it was merely a common room.</p>

            . I am driver of the cab No. 3. On the night of the 27th of September I was called off the rank, at Broad-street, St. Giles', by Lawrence, who took me to the corner of Charlotte-street, against the chapel - I went up Plumtree-street, and there Williams met me, he put a bundle into the cab, and Lawrence fetched a basket, and put in; they both got into the cab, and Wilkins came running up to bid them good bye; but as we were going off, she said, "Bill, give us a ride," and Williams said,"Get in;" I said it was too much for the horse, I could not take three; but if I did, I hoped they would pay me for it; Williams said, "It is all right, we will pay you;" I drove to a street, which I think is called Turk-street, Bloomsbury - Lawrence there got out, and took the bundle and basket; he returned in about a quarter of an hour, brought them back, and said to Williams, "I can't get in there;" Williams said, "I know of a place on Saffron-hill" - I then drove them to Little Saffron-hill, and put them down; I do not know at what house; Williams and Lawrence got out, and took the things, but the girl remained with me in the cab for about a quarter of an hour - Williams then came out of the house, and told her to go in, and make herself comfortable by the fire; she got out of the cab, and went in - Williams then asked what my fare was; I said 3s., and I hoped they would give me something more; he said Oh yes, he would, and give me something to drink, but he must call his friend out to get some money; Isaac Cohen came out just as the girl was going in at the door; Williams told him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180061"/>give me 3s. 6d.; I waited some time, and then Cohen said I could not have any thing to drink, and they gave me another shilling.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you undertake to say that both the bundle and basket were not put in by Lawrence? A. Yes; they both brought some -Williams said he knew of a place on Saffron-hill; I did not hear him say it was a place to sleep at with the girl, for I was rattling over the stones - I believe they were tipsy.</p>
               <p> - WILLIAMS. I was assistant to the waterman at Broad-street rank that night; I saw the cab hired, but I cannot say by whom - I saw a bundle put into the cab -I saw a lady and gentleman come along Charlotte-street; the gentleman said, "Halloo, what is this?" I looked, and saw a number of things on the steps and on the pavement; this was in the same street, and nearly opposite where the things were put into the cab - I took up some of the things, and gave information; the gentleman and lady took up some of them; I saw the cab come back between two and three o'clock, and I gave information of it.</p>

In consequence of information on the morning of the 28th of of September, I went with two other officers to No. 11, Little Saffron-hill - it was then between two and three o'clock - the door was on the latch - we opened it, and went in - the four prisoners were in the room; Isaac Cohen said to me "Well, Isaac, what, is it about these things?" or about the things, and at the same time, he put his hand against me to wish me to go into the passage - he did not push me; I had known him for some years - I believe he is in the clothes line; when we got into the passage, he said, "What about these things," I said, "What things?" he said, "Those things here;" I said, "If the things are here, show them to me;" he went into the room, and pointed to a bed - I stooped down, and pulled out a great coat and a Police-coat, and my brother officer found some more things out; I then said "Are there any more?" he said"No, I have told you all;" I said, "I am certain there are more things, for we have missed more;"

            . Q. You saw these things all safe? A. Yes - I did not notice them particularly, but they were safe; I did not notice the time particularly - they were laying about the shelves in the kitchen; there was a great deal of property there; I went down to stair the fire about one o'clock; I went down again in about half an hour, and the shelves were stripped.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. I was walking up Catherine-street, and met Lawrence, whom I had known four or five years - I asked him to have something to drink, and we went and had some; we afterwards met Wilkins, who asked me to treat her, which we did; we then went on to Middle-row, and then parted - we then went to St. Giles's to try to get something more to drink, but could not find a house open; we were then coming down a short street, leading from George-street to Charlotte-street, and I stumbled over something - I took it up, and it was this basket; we then went on, turned the corner, and Lawrence found the bundle tied round with a piece of list; he said "What had we better do?" I said "Keep them till morning, and see if there will be a reward offered," and we agreed to take a cab, and go to Eagle-street, where he had a brother, but he was out, and he could not get in (when we got into the cab, Wilkins had come to us, and asked us to give her a ride); I was then going to sleep at Co hen's, which they had allowed me to do, as I have known them for four or five years, and they have lent me a little money to purchase small things; when we got to the house, I put the bundle down, and kicked it under the bed, and the basket was put down at the foot of the other bed - I did not know what they contained; I did wrong in taking them away when I found them; it was stated at Hatton-garden, that there are still some things missing, and it was as likely for us to find these things as for other persons to find them.</p>
               <p>Lawrence's Defence (written). On the night of the robbery I met Williams in Catherine-street, Strand; he asked me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180062"/>have something to drink - we went into a public-house; Williams paid for some rum, and afterwards for a pot of ale - we left the public-house about half-past ten o'clock, and proceeded on towards Covent-garden market, where we met the girl Wilkins; she asked us to give her some gin - we treated her to some gin; we then walked down New-street, and went into a wine-vaults, and we had some more to drink; the girl was with us - we then went away, determined to go home, being intoxicated; we all three walked together towards St. Giles' church, where we parted with the girl Wilkins; I did not hear Williams say that he would meet her again that night - this was about a quarter to one o'clock; I wanted to part with Williams, but he said, "You shall not go until we have a parting glass;" we went up Plumtree-street, thinking to find a public-house open in St. Giles' - when we got there they were closed; Williams then said he knew of a watering-house, at the corner of Red Lion-street, which was open all night - we went up Phoenix-street, and turned into Charlotte-street; Williams fell over something, and, getting up, picked up a basket - a little further on I saw a dark bundle lay, which I picked up; Williams put the basket on his arm, and said we had better call a cab to take them somewhere until the morning, and see if there would be a reward offered; we had not opened the bundles, and did not know what they contained - we went to the top of Plumtree-street; Williams then said, "Give me the bundle, and go and call a cab;" when I got into Broad-street I saw a cab on the stand, and called him off - I got into the cab; Williams put the bundle and basket in - he then got into the cab himself, when the girl Wilkins came up at the time, and asked Williams to give her a ride - he asked me whether I knew of a place to leave them until the morning, to see whether they were advertised; I told the cab man to drive to Eagle-street, to an acquaintance of mine, but I found they had left - Williams said, "Never mind," and told me to get in, as he knew of a friend of his, where in a day or two he was going to lodge; he told the cab man to drive to Little Saffron-hill - I told him I should not get in, as there was not room for three; I walked by the side of the cab all the way - Williams got out, and knocked at the door, which one of the Cohens opened; Williams asked me to bring the things out of the cab - Cohens invited the girl to come in; I asked Wilkins if every thing was out of the cab; she said Yes all but a blue handkerchief which she found at the bottom of the cab, which she put into my hat -Williams then asked me how much money I had got; I told him about 7d. - he then said, "We have not got enough to pay the cab;" Cohen said, "Never mind, I can pay, then you can pay me to-morrow," as they had known Williams for five years; it was the first time that I had ever been in Cohen's house - after the cab man was paid and went, Williams told me the things were all safe at Cohens'; it was past two o'clock - the elder Cohen said, "Perhaps your friends would take a cup of tea, as you have been drinking;" we all sat down and had some breakfast; I then remarked to Cohen it was getting late, and that I gave up all hopes of getting into my lodging - Cohens then said,"Never mind, as you are friends of Williams, you are welcome to stop here until the morning;" while we were having some tea, some person opened the door, and knocked at the parlour door, which Cohen opened, and in came several Policemen, and asked for some things that had been stolen from a station-house- it struck us, for the first time, what the basket and bundle contained; the elder Cohen said, "It must he the bundle or basket that you have found;" the Policemen then said, "These are the things that we have lost;" they then took us all prisoners.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, and live in Phoenix-alley. On the 7th of September I saw the prisoner - I had known him before; he came about four o'clock in the day, and was in livery - he staid about an hour; he gave me a note to get changed, which he said he had received of his master for wages - he did not say what the amount of it was; he only asked me to get change - I did not know what note it was; it might have been a 5l. note for what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your mark to this paper? A. No, Sir, not that I know of; I put a mark to a paper - I cannot read nor write; my examination was read over to me, and what was read was correct - I gave the note to my sister Elizabeth, who lodges with me; I pay the landlady for my lodging, but I do not know her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, take care - did the prisoner tell you, when he said he had got the note from his master for wages, how many pounds he received for his wages, and how much for his clothes? A. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been in custody ever since you were take up? A. Yes; I was searched - I was examined by the Justice - my sister was present when the prisoner gave the note to me, and she heard what passed; my deposition was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. If that contains any statement about 50l., or any sum which the prisoner told you he had from his master for wages, is it correct? A. I do not know; he did not say any sum for wages.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say (whether true or not) before the Magistrate, "When the prisoner gave me the note, he said, in answer to my question, how he got it, that his master gave it to him; 20l. for wages, and 30l. for clothes?" A. He told me his master gave it him for wages.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Nightingale tavern, Lisson-grove. I was there in the beginning of February, 1830 - I had known the prisoner a long time, and knew Moffat; I recollect the prisoner coming two days successively, to look at some horses which Moffat brought there; I cannot say what day it was, but I know they had been two days before the prisoner saw them - one of them had a mark on one quarter, and a bad hough; I saw Moffat lead them out, and show them to the prisoner - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180065"/>see any money paid, but Moffat fetched them from the stable, and I never saw them again.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were they horses or mares? A. I cannot exactly say - I think Moffat used to come about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day; it was in 1830 - it might be in January; it was not so late as March - the horses were there about four days; they came on a Wednesday, and the prisoner came to see them on the Friday; Moffat had been there a great many times with horses - I had known him nine or ten months; I had never seen the prisoner before nor since; Moffat had a cart, with the name of Thomas Moffat, Reading, Berks, on it - he said he had been into the country for a fortnight before this, to fetch horses; I told the Magistrate I did not know the colour of this horse, but when I came to see her, I knew her by the marks.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long ago was this? A. I should think very near three years - it is between two and three years; it was the latter end of January or beginning of February - I had known the prisoner by seeing him at repositories and other places; there were several persons in the parlour when the money was paid - persons who buy horses at fairs do not take receipts for them.</p>

               <p>MRS. CLOVER. I never lent her the shawl, and did not know she had it, or the sheet; she was not well - she was with me twelve months - I believe she was 6s. 6d. in my debt; she went away pennyless, I believe.</p>

On the 10th of September, he saw me put 27s. in a purse, and 2s., and some halfpence in a basin, into a large sailor's chest in my bed-room, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he was to have slept at home that night as usual, but he went away, and did not come home - I then looked at the chest; it was still locked as I had left it, but the money was gone: there was no other person in the house.</p>

On the 4th of October I received information, and on Friday evening, about eight o'clock, I was standing at Kingsland turnpike gate, and the prisoners passed me - I followed them, and asked Wilgoss his name, and if he did not lodge with Mrs. Scott; he said No - I took him to the station, then went for Woodley, and took him: he said he had lived with Mrs. Scott, and left her because she was making a bother about the key; he dropped a box, and I took it up- it contaained eight duplicates, and one was for this blanket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

Barclay's, where I found that 20l. in country notes had been changed for a 10l. note, a 5l. note, and five sovereigns - the numbers correspond with these notes.</p>

In June last the prisoner was living at Enfield - he was possessed of a horse in that month, and from information which I received, I watched him and his premises; I received information that the prosecutor had lost a horse, and took various steps to find an owner for this horse; and afterwards in consequence of information, went to the prisoner's promises, and took it out of the field; some time before that, I had seen an advertisement, in consequence of which, I spoke to the prisoner, and said "You have a valuable horse here, did you buy him?" he said "I bought him of a man at Paddington;" I said "I suppose you know the man;" he said "No - I don't;" I said "I should be very sorry to buy a horse of a man I did not know;" he was afterwards in custody on another charge, and I took the horse out of his field; Bloy indentified it, and he called it by its name, and the horse knew him - I knew it to be Bloy's by the advertisement.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the prisoner prevented the other man from taking your life? A. Yes, he laid hold of him, and shook his head at him when he made a blow at me - he held him and prevented his striking me any more; I cannot say whether the prisoner gave me any blows - when they came in the other man was in such a rage he called me an Irish b-gg-r, and said he would serve me out - that he had been served out by some Irishmen, some time before, and he would serve me out; that was after I was knocked down - they had called us Irish b-gg-rs before they entered - I was stunned so that I could not exactly tell who struck me; they left the room, and the first I noticed in the room was a Policeman; I was confined to my bed eight or nine days, from the blows - the Policeman lifted me off the floor and put me on a seat; he went out - he afterwards took me into the court, and I saw the prisoner in Head's custody; I was taken to a surgeon, who dressed my head, and afterwards to St. Bartholomew's hospital - I was there eight or nine days; I had never given them the least provocation - I think I had said, "I defy you to come in;" I had had some beer that night, but knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. The prisoner collared the man, and prevented his beating you further? A. Yes; he laid hold of him by the collar when I was on the floor, and I received no blows after, that I know of, if I had I think I should have known it - I had stood against the street door, as well as I could, to prevent their coming in; I then left the passage and came into the parlour, as they pushed the street door in once or twice - I then attempted to keep them out of the parlour, and two men rushed in; I put up my hands to defend myslef - I will not swear I did not lay hold of them; I did not that I know of - I might have been struck either with the poker or shovel; a heavy first might injure me as much. but I really believe it was not done with a first; it was light part of the time, and then the light disappeared.</p>

On the 22nd of September, about three o'clock in the morning, I was called from Whitecross-street into Davis'-court - I found the prosecutor alone in the room, bleeding from the head, laying on his back on the floor - I put him in a sitting posture, then went out, and was directed to the opposite house, where I took the prisoner in the first floor room - he was in company with three girls; he said he had not been out of the room for two hours - he was standing up, and I think had been drinking; I went and took the prosecutor to the station, and then to a surgeon - he appeared to have been beat about the head a good deal, and bleeding; I did not see a poker or any weapon about - I believe I had not told the prisoner what I took him for, when he said he had been in the room two hours; I believe he was under the influence of liquor, but did not appear drunk.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard the cries of Murder! and saw St. Ledger - he took me to the house; when we got to the door, the prisoner and another were coming out at the front door - he had the handle of a fire-shovel, and a quart pot, as it appeared to me; St. Ledger said, "Those are the two murderers, and I give charge of them;" the prisoner said, "If you say another word, I will split your bl-y scull, or crack it;" I looked into the room, saw May laying there bleeding, and during that time, they popped into the opposite house - further assistance came in a few minutes, and I and other officers went up; we found the door fast - pushed it open, and saw the prisoner in the room with three or four common prostitutes - there was no light in the room; Head turned his light on - I told the prisoner he was one of the party, and must go with us - his hands and jacket were bloody - the other was not there; I afterwards saw the prosecutor - he was bloody all over the head and face, and seemed in a very weak state - the prisoner said he was not the one who had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he was not one, or not the one? A. He said he was not one of the party who had been there; I am sure he is the man who told St. Ledger, if he said another word, he would break his neck, for I knew him by sight well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you notice the prosecutor's wounds? A. We both went to the doctor's, and saw them dressed; there were six cuts in his head, both in the front and back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, and am totally innocent.</p>

Jones, Lloyed, and Co., drawn by himself; I said I could not give him the difference; he said it was quite immaterial, if I would give him a slip of paper, he would give me a cheque for the amount; he wrote this cheque for 4l. 14s. on my counter - I have had it ever since; I presented it next morning to Jones, Lloyd, and Co., but payment was refused; he gave me his address Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are Yorkchambers an extensive range of buildings? A. I did not go into them, but rang the porter's bell - I had known the prisoner about seven years ago; he then bought a few articles, which he paid for; he called about fourteen months ago, and asked me to trust him for some tackle; I said we did not give credit - I did not recollect him till he made himself known to me; he said he had been abroad, and in Ireland part of the time; he was in a counting-house in Finsbury-square, I believe, when I dealt with him; he took these goods with him.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Jones, Lloyd, and Co. I know the prisoner - he had no account with us on the 31st of August; he had an account once, but drew his balance out on the 19th of March, 1831; the draft in question was presented to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Since 1827; he had a large account at our house; his returns might be 20,000l. in 1827, and in 1828, 40,000l.; that was not a balance; I did not know his father - this is his pass book (looking at it) - it goes from 1827 till the 19th of March, 1831 - his balance on the 25th of December, 1827, was 1095l., and on the 16th of May, 1828, 90l.; he drew that out by two drafts; he drew nothing in 1827 and 1830; the balance in 1829 was 4l. 10s. 3d., and he had the same balance at Christmas 1830 and 1831- the last transaction was on the 11th of June, 1828; the balance was against him then; he had overdrawn 35l. 8s. - he paid in something after that.</p>

About a week previous to the 9th of August, the prisoner came to the shop - he said his name was Landmann, and he had come respecting a debt that was in our books, in 1827 - I did not know him in 1827; he said, if I turned to the books, I should find it so - I did so, and gave him a memorandum of a book, which came to 1l. 8s. - he said, "That is right, I shall want more books, I will call in a week, and pay for them - you had better give me a catalogue;" he came on the 9th of August, selected books, which came to 2l. 5s., and after farther conversation respecting business, he said "Well,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180073"/>I will be content with these at present; can you change me a ten?" of course, I thought he meant a 10l. note, but he handed me a 10l. cheque; I said I could not change it, but on looking into the till, and being led away by his address, I said I could advance him 3l. on it, if that would do; he said well he would take that, I gave him the 3l.; he left the cheque, and said he would call next morning for the balance - he did not call; I offered to send the books home for him; he said there was not the least occasion for that, as he was only at Searle's coffee-house, in Carey-street - he took them with him; I never saw him again till the 13th of October, when I met him on Ludgate-hill; immediately he saw me he ran away - I pursued; he looked round, and in his hurry, ran into the road, and slipped down - I secured him; the cheque was never paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you enough money to change the 10l.? A. Yes; if it had been a Bank note I should have given it all; I had strong suspicions; as I had no adviser in the business, I did not like to give the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you gave the 3l. rather from his genteel manner than from the cheque? A. No; I thought I should take more on myself than I ought if I gave the whole, as it was not a Bank note, and thought if it was not good, I should be no greater loser - I have not got the books back.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 14th of September, I went to bed at six o'clock precisely - my door was fastened with a spring-lock, but it has no bolts; I examined it with a candle before I went to bed - I have known the prisoner many years; he was in the habit of coming to my house till within a few months; about ten o'clock I awoke, and discovered him holding his hand over my head - I sleep in a press bedstead: my watch lays on the bedstead; he had a candle in his hand - I knew him perfectly well: his hand was reaching over to the top of the bedstead, where the watch was, with my snuff-box and brooch; I said,"You thundering villian, is it you? is it possible, Dick?" and he went out with the rapidity of a shot, down stairs; I found my watch was gone, and when I got down stairs the sideboard drawer was half open; I missed a shirt from it - I have not found any of the property: I went with the Policeman about one o'clock on the Tuesday, and took him at his lodging in a little court in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you any relation to the prisoner? A. He is the son of a half sister of mine; I often go to bed early - I had dined at a friend's, and left there at a quarter-past two o'clock; I drank once out of a pot of beer, but had no spirits - I then went home and read; I had dined in Fashion-street - I drank nothing at home but tea; the prisoner has seen my watch on the bed when he has called - I did not exactly know where he lived; I knew the neighbourhood: I inquired at the different pawnbrokers for my property on the Monday - I told his father of it on Monday morning - he did not live with his father.</p>

Yes, it is about five minutes' walk from our house; I saw the prisoner come in - I looked at my clock, and it wanted five minutes to ten o'clock; I had to get up early to go to work, and gave the watchman 1d. to call me, and when he called ten, the prisoner and his wife were in bed.</p>

On the 18th of August I was at the door - the prisoner came, and made herself known to me; I had not seen her for some years - she said she had been about the neighbourhood, and was faint and hungry, and had no bonnet or shawl on: she wished me to let her come up stairs and sit down - she stopped to dinner and tea; we had the saltcellar at dinner - she stopped till after dark; I missed the carpet and salt-cellar the next morning - I met her two or three weeks afterwards, and had her taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you in the habit of drinking gin together? A. We drank some that day - we had only one quartern; it was an old glass salt-cellar, but one I did not wish to lose - I am quite sure it was not pawned to get the gin; she left my apartment about eight o'clock in the evening - my husband was not at home; I swear she did not dine with me the day afterwards - she called, but I did not see her.</p>

             (Police-constable S 97). On Friday, the 28th of September, I was standing by Euston-place, and received information, which led me to examine a vault in Gordon-street; it was one of a range of vaults, not covered with houses - I found the prisoner and another in the vault; the other ran away - the prisoner had this roll of silk in his hand; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it belonged to the young man who ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the person who informed you here? A. I do not see him - he gave his name as Harman; I took the prisoner with this silk in his possession, the other man had not hold of it at all.</p>

In the afternoon of the 28th of September I saw the prisoner in the shop; he asked for some silk patterns - the apprentice cut him some; he returned in ten minutes, and said he wanted enough for a full dress for Mrs. Millington, of Bond-street: he said he had lived there two days - I gave him this piece; he went out - the clerk told me to watch; I went, and saw him go over - he rang the bell, and went in - the clerk was not satisfied, and he went to Mrs. Millington's; there were not less than thirty-five yards on the roll - I gave it to him, supposing him to be servant to Mrs. Millington; I gave him no credit - I intended Mrs. Millington to take the quantity she wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the quantity for a full sized dress? A. From twelve to fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him go in at Mrs. Millington's door? A. Yes, and then I thought it was all right, but I had my suspicion at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not have given it him at all, if he had not used Mrs. Millington's name? A. No, she is a customer almost every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do I understand you that if he had not entered Millington's house, you would have seized the property? A. Yes, certainly; I did not mean absolutely to part with it to Mrs. Millington, unless I had met with something farther to induce me to believe he came from her; but when I saw him go in there, my suspicion was at an end.</p>

               <p>Q. But did not the prisoner tell you where they were to be found? A. No; I made inquiries about the first pair, and at the office he said he pawned one pair at Mr. Bailey's, and one in Camden-town.</p>

No, I did not, nor did I send such a message by Southerden - I had some conversation with him, but did not send any message to the prisoner; I had no quarrel with him.</p>

I was at the top of White Lion-street - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor on the opposite side of the way, in Norton-falgate; I saw the prisoner leave him; I had suspicion. and asked if he had lost any thing; we took the prisoner near Spitalfields-market; I told her I wanted her for robbing a person in Norton-falgate - she denied it, but I saw her hand was closed - I seized it, and took out of it 4s. and come halfpence; she said, "Give me 2s., and I will throw it away, and that will puzzle him;" I said I would not - she then said, "Throw it all away, or give it to me, and I will;" I said I would not; she said "Then it will lag me."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was counting some money when he came up; the prosecutor said he had lost 5s. or 6s.; I had 41/2d. in my hand, and three half-crowns - I had changed a 5s. piece. Witness. She said so at the office, but not before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said I was not the girl, and then he said I was; I told him to go to Mr. Fulcher's, and inquire if a girl had not changed a crown piece.</p>

On Saturday week my servant was at my door; the prisoner spoke to her, and walked into my lodging - he walked into the parlour, and while he was there I was called into the passage by the servant; the prisoner and I then went up stairs; while we were there my comb fell out of my hair, and the prisoner was moving it with his foot, to push it under the bed-curtain; I then recognized him as being a person who had robbed me once before; I got up, opened the door, and found a paper which had been in my purse - I went down stairs; the prisoner followed me; I begged him to give me my purse -I told him there was no money in it, only bills - he then went into the parlour, and threw it on the table - I thought he had something else, and I went out into the street after him to try to get an officer; a gentleman detained him while I got an officer, who took my thimble from the prisoner - it had been on the parlour mantel-piece, and my purse had been on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had you had no dispute with him? A. No; we had made no agreement - he had not given me any thing; we were not up stairs more than five minutes; I was sitting by the side of the bed when the comb fell out of my hair - he did not pull any of his clothes off - my servant was in the kitchen when the prisoner went out - he opened the door himself.</p>

On the 13th of October, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked if Mr. Crawley was at home; I said he was not - she said she was sorry, as she wanted some net; she had made shirts for us for nine months; she sat down in the shop - I was looking out of window, and as I turned my head I saw her draw an umbrella off the counter; I went up stairs to my fellow shopman, and told him - he came down, and told the prisoner she had taken an umbrella off the counter; she immediately said, "Do let me go," and dropped the umbrella by the side of the counter - we said No, and my fellow shopman had her taken up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before had you seen them? A. Not for some months - the shutters were shut- I only went up there once a day; whether they had been unfixed before I cannot tell - it was not a very dark night - there was a light in the back parlour; I saw Smith go into the passage - I saw his back and his side face; he run out - we pursued about sixty yards and took him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.)

In consequence of information I went in search of the money, to Tothill-street, and found nine sovereigns and three half-sovereigns - I lived in the prisoner's house, on the first floor; I put the money into my pocketbook on the 21st of September, and on the 3rd of October I missed the pocket-book and money; they directly took me before a Magistrate, on suspicion of making away with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lodged there? A. About two months; I went just before the robbery -I placed the pocket-book under my mattress - there are several lodgers in the house; I was a Policeman, but have been discharged for being tipsy, as they said, but I was not so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was your room secured? A. There was a lock to the door, but I seldom locked it, as a person lived with me, and we had only one key - it was a woman lived with me; there was only one bed; I am married, but she was not my wife - I do not know that I ever told the prosecutor that she was; she passed as my wife.</p>

I stopped the prisoner between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, rolling this cask along, and asked where he was going with it- he said he was taking it to Bethnal-green-road; I secured him, and went to the prosecutor, suspecting it had come from there; he said he was employed by a person named Adams to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, who said his name was Adams, who told me if I rolled the cask to No. 84, Bethnal-green-road, I should see a broker's shop, and he would give me 1s. 6d. - he showed me which cask it was; I rolled it about two hundred yards and was stopped.</p>

             (Police-constable G 175). I was sent for to Mr. Hawkins' warehouse, on Monday, the 20th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening -I found the prisoner in the counting-house; I took him to Bunhill-row station - he gave his address No. 21, Britannia-street, City-road; I then took him from Robert-street watchhouse, and told him I intended to search his premises, and asked what part of the house he occupied; he said a room on the first floor, and a kitchen on the ground floor - I went and searched his rooms between ten and eleven o'clock; I found three brass locks in the front room, a door plate, a dog collar, four metal spoons, four metal tea-spoons, two blind movements, some wire and brass, and counters, a punch, stamps, and a brass bag lock in the upper room; and a coffee-mill and two table-spoons in the kitchen; when I told him I was going to search his house, he asked if he could be allowed to go with me - I told him no; on going to the station he asked what I had found - I said various ironmongery goods, and among the rest a door plate; he asked me again - I told him a patent coffee-mill; he said, "That is not Mr. Hawkins', nor never was - I had it before I came into his employ;" he asked if I took any thing else- I told him some ivory Pope Joan counters; he said,"I dare say Mrs. Hawkins can swear to them, for I did take them - I found them laying about, and thought them of no value."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found his address correct? A. Yes; I had followed him home the Thursday previous - I could not have known the rooms he occupied if he had not told me; I did not let him know that I followed him home.</p>

            . I was in the service of the prosecutor in August. I know this dozen of locks to be his property; there is something peculiar about the make of the lock, but more about the make of the key; the bit of it is short, and it is not glazed as they generally are - they are common locks, but of a different description to the generality of them; they came to my master's on the 9th of August, from Mr. Wright, of Wolverhampton; the basket was unpacked on the 10th of August, which was Friday, and on the Tuesday following I looked on the shelf on which I had placed the parcels, and missed some of them, but did not notice how many; nineteen dozen came, and I believe one dozen was missing - I had not sold any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you unpack them? A. Yes, and marked them all; they came in four and six dozen papers - the papers have been taken off these - they are worth 3s. a dozen.</p>

            . I am a wholesale ironmonger, and live at Wolverhampton. On the 9th of August I sent some parcels of locks to Mr. Hawkins, these are a part of the nineteen dozen I sent him; they are made to a particular pattern - there is something peculiar about the bolt and the key; we never had more than the nineteen dozen which we sent to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they ordered from this particular pattern? A. No, but from my representation; another manufacturer might have such, but I should think it very unlikely; I saw them packed, and these are the locks.</p>

On the 20th of August I was sent for by Mr. Hawkins, and took the prisoner in his counting-house; Mr. Hawkins said, "William, I have every reason to suppose you have been robbing me;" he said, "I have not indeed, master;" Mr. Hawkins said, "If you have not been robbing me, you know I have been robbed; and perhaps you know who has been robbing me;" he said,"That's another thing;" I then took the prisoner into custody; I went with the serjeant to No. 58, Lower Whitecross-street - I did not find any thing then, but I saw the serjeant take from a box some duplicates in a paper; I afterwards searched the room again, and found this spike-borer, three sacks, a spade, and these two spoons - they were in the front room two pair.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep books? A. No; we buy and sell for ready money, and I sold them to the prisoner on a Sunday; on the Saturday following<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180091"/>he came and bought another pair, and said these were too small for him, and he had pawned them for 8s.; he came backwards and forwards once or twice; I did not know his name - his wife came to me several times about a fortnight before the last Session; I attend without any interest; I wanted to identify the trousers at the office, but the attorney would not let me - he said he should want me in another place; these could not be made for the prosecutor - they are not large enough for him, he could not get them on; I cannot undertake to say that these stains of blood were on them, but they have my initials, which I put on them when I gave them out to the translator.</p>
               <p>MR. HAWKINS. I cut my finger about five months ago, and at that time I had these trousers on; I went to get my watch out and blooded my fob - this is the mark of it; I missed these trousers about the 11th of May - the prisoner was then in my service.</p>

            , JUN. I was in my father's employ, and served in his shop - I became acquainted with the prisoner - I first saw herwalking in Oxford-street - I accosted her one evening, and after that I saw her many times - that was in August - after I had been acquainted with her a fortnight or three weeks, I went to her lodgings - I had seen her almost every evening in the street, and told her where I lived - I made her a present of a ring the first night I spoke to her; and the next night I made her a present of a ring and a coral necklace - I made her presents at our following meetings; Amelia Saunders was mostly with her - I went to her lodgings in Hertford-street, Fitzroy-square - I saw her, Phillips, and Saunders there -I visited her there two or three times a week; she removed from there to Pettit's-court - I visited her there two or three times a week, and carried presents - I have seen Phillips and Saunders there: Phillips once asked me, in her hearing, there, why I did not rob my father of 100l., or as much as I could get - and the prisoner made answer, what would be the use of 100l., my father kept a good deal of cash in his possession - when I took things to the prisoner's lodgings, from time to time, Phillips used to take them out and pawn them - I generally stopped there till she came back - she produced the duplicates and the money, and the prisoner mostly received it-I had shown the articles, in the prisoner's presence, before they were taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first accosted her? A. Yes; I had my father's property in my pocket at the time, but I did not mean it for any one - I meant it for her - I had seen her before, but not spoken to her - I asked her if she would have the ring - she took it, and I walked away; I met her again the next evening; and I asked her if the ring fitted her, and gave her the coral necklace and ring, which I had in my pocket, and which I had stolen; Saunders was with her, and she asked me to bring her something - that was all that passed the second time; but I made an appointment to meet the prisoner on the Sunday following, at the corner of John-street; I met her there, and took something with me for her - I believe it was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180092"/>buckle; she had not asked me for any thing at that time; she only said, "Thank you," when I gave her the things; she never asked me where I got the things; I told her that I had lent a young man 10l., and I was obliged to take these things for it; that was when she said she should like a silk dress - and I asked her, if I brought these things, if she would pawn them to get it; I told her the young man had paid me in jewellery, which was a falsity; I told her so because she should not think I had taken them from my father; my object all along was to conceal from her that they were stolen; she asked me my age, and I told her I was going on for eighteen, but I was not fifteen then; I said I wished I was of age that I might come to some property; I said I should like to marry her - I showed her two 5l. notes of my father's at one time; I told her I had been to the banker for my father - I have told her that my father did not allow me money, but I did not say I had rich friends, who gave me 10l. at a time - I remember her being ill; I was a constant attendant at her bedside; I remember taking her a pair of ear-rings; I told her I gave 2l. for them in the City; I told her I liked them better those she had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do we understand that she never asked you to bring her any thing, but accepted what you took her? A. She once asked me to bring her a weddingring, to persuade her landlady that she was married; I asked for her in the name of Mrs. May - I never gave her any name of my own.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you not told the landlady that you were married? A. No, Sir; I never spoke to her only to ask if Mrs. May was at home - I had robbed my father before I saw the prisoner; I called at her house one day, when she was not at home - I sent her one letter, but no more; I had given my father's property to a woman of the town, named Lee, before I knew the prisoner - I had visited Lee; I had been in the habit of robbing my father for five months - I was sometimes without any thing in my pocket to give to women; I remember telling the prisoner, shortly before our acquaintance terminated, that I had overheard my father, and mother talking about sending me to sea - I told her that I had got away my boxes, and I said perhaps I might get a situation; I have been to bed with May and with Lee - what I gave them was the price of their prostitution; I used at that time to wear a frock-coat - I told May that I was going on for eighteen years of age, on purpose to deceive her; she wore some of the ornaments I gave her about the street - I remember taking her to the theatre one night; and when we came away I told her she had better not go home, as I thought it not unlikely my father might come - I have taken tea at her house, but I never dined or supped there; I have drank there, we have sent for brandy, and it has been paid for out of the money the things fetched - I had been in custody on a charge of robbing my father before I mentioned this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she have the silk dress? A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been in custody before you told this? A. Three or four days; I had been in the New prison, Clerkenwell - I came from there this morning; May had seen me in my father's shop, after I gave her some things - Phillips once said,"I wonder your father does not find it out - if he does I shall get the worst of it;" I thought May looked into my father's shop rather hard the second night I - spoke to her, and I told her not to look in so hard, as I lived there, and she said she would not - Saunders was with her that night; I never told her that my father kept the shop, but his name was over the door; I told the prisoner my name after the Sunday I speak of - she was to pawn the goods I took her, to buy a silk dress; the goods pawned might come to more than 10l. - I took her two pairs of candlesticks.</p>

             (Police-constable E 86). I took the prisoner on the 31st of August, in High Holborn; I had been to her lodging, in Pettit's-court, Hanway-street - I knew her before, and saw her remove her goods there; I found on her a pair of bracelets, a pair of pearl earrings, a wedding-ring, two caddy-ladles, a buckle, a coral necklace, a coral negligee, and a duplicate for a pair of gold ear-rings; I told her I took her on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery at Mr. Steele's - she said they were the things that young Steele had given her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any one with her? A. Yes, Phillips.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating, that the prosecutor's son had been in the habit of visiting her - that he represented himself as nineteen years of age - and that he had the property from a young man who owed him 10l.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D 6). I saw the prisoners pass the shop twice - they then went and looked into the window; Worley unhung the soap, and gave it to Austin - they run different ways; I pursued Austin up William-street - when I got near him he threw down the soap; I took him turning into George-street -I said, "I want you for taking the soap;" he said,"I did not take it;" I said, "No, but Worley gave it to you;" I went, and took Worley in bed the next morning; I said, "You know what I want you for;" he said, "No, I do not;" I said, "For taking the soap;" he said he took none - I said, "When you were in company with Austin;" he said, "I was not with him."</p>
               <p>Worley's Defence. I awoke about half-past nine o'clock, and Austin went to get something for supper - I went out, but could not find him; I then went home to bed, and about two o'clock in the morning the officer came and took me; I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Austin's Defence. I was going up the street - a man stopped me, and the officer came and took me; he said,"I want you, for having this soap;" I said, "I did not take it, I never saw it."</p>

            . On the 16th of October I received information of this - I went and took Turner at his father's house; and Cox at Holloway, the next morning; Turner said he was very sorry, but he did not kill the ducks-Cox said poverty drove him to it, and he had only had one penny roll for two days, which I believe to be true; he has a wife and two children, and has been hard working and industrious.</p>

               <p>Harris. Q. Did you see me with Chapman after I came out? A. Chapman stopped and spoke to two others at the corner, and Harris went by, and did not speak to him; but they were in company together when we took them.</p>

I received information, and went to Lisson-grove, about a mile from the house, and saw the prisoners going along; Cochran pointed them out - I ran; Harris turned round, saw me, and stopped as if for a necessary purpose; I told Cochran to take him; I followed, and took Chapman - I saw the watch-key in his mouth, and caught hold of it - we struggled; I forced his mouth open, and believe he must have swallowed it; I saw another watch-key hanging from his pocket - I caught hold of it; he said, "It is mine, what do you want with it?" I found the watch in that pocket, and in Harris's pocket I found a skeleton and a latch-key; Harris said, "I know nothing of it, I have not been with him."(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

The prisoner occasionally worked for me; I lent Bradick a rest, which I never could get back, and this is it - it has been in my uncle's possession fifty years; and, to tell you the truth, all these tools are mine, for I gave Bradick the money to pay for them - I only claim the rest- I consider he will take a false oath.</p>

            . I am a porter. I have been in Bradick's employ nine months; he authorized the prisoner to pawn the tools on account of the non-payment of his money, and he owes me money for labour - I have heard him tell the prisoner to pledge his tools, and offer him money afterwards to redeem them; he was taken to the Marshalsea-prison, and owes me 12s.; he sent the prisoner to pawn a top and box-rests, and things- I never heard him authorize the prisoner to pledge, but he knew it was done, and gave him money to redeem them.</p>
               <p> - FORD. I am a bedstead-maker. The prosecutor called at my shop between nine and ten months ago, and asked if I had seen Leary, as he had pawned some of his tools, and he wanted him to get them out again.</p>
               <p>JOHN HILL re-examined. I know the prosecutor has authorized the prisoner to pawn his own apparel, but I cannot speak about these articles - when he could not get his pay he has made a piece of work, and the prosecutor has offered him his apparel to pledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there another Policeman with you? A. Yes; but he went away, because the prosecutor would not substantiate the charge - he gave the woman in charge; but I took them both, for he said the man was there, and he had thrown him out of the room - he said two men had taken him into the room; he seemed in a very queer way; I do not know whether he was drunk, or any thing had been given to him - he was very drowsy.</p>

             (Police-constable K 63). I heard the prosecutor call Police! I went down; Watson was gone: I knew where she lived - I went and found her at her own house; I accused her of robbing the man- she said she had not taken any thing from him, and all the money she had in the world was one halfpenny - I asked her where her old man was, meaning Parkinson; I looked out of the window, and saw him outside - I got him in, searched, and found on him this little hammer, a crown-piece, and a half-crown: while I was doing that Watson ran off - I pursued and took her, and while I did that the serjeant searched Parkinson further, and found on him this purse and this pouch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What colour were the stockings? A. Black, and so was the ribbon; there were a good many other ribbons in the drawer, but no other of this width; I put the ribbon back into the drawer - I threw it in - my brother got the constable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the ribbons and stockings stand so near to one another, that she could take one with the other? A. No; the stockings were in paper, and the ribbon in a drawer; there was no other piece of ribbon in the drawer that I could mistake for this; there is about sixteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sell her the stockings? A. Yes, and she had them in herlap when she came back.</p>

I was in the prosecutor's employ, and was in his shop; the prisoner was at the counter- the stockings were at the end of the counter, in paper, and the ribbons were in a drawer a very little distance from the stockings - I saw the prisoner put her hand into the drawer, take something out, and put it into her lap; I not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were the ribbons and stockings? A. A very little distance off - I knew where she lived; there was nothing to prevent her going straight home, but she went a contrary way, and passed our shop again.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any thing that mixed the stockings with the ribbons, so that one could be taken with the other? A. No; the stockings were on her lefthand side, and the ribbons on the right.</p>
