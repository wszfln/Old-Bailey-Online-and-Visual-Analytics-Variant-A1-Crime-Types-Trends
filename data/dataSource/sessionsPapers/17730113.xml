While the highwayman was engaged with Mr. Bell, I endeavoured to conceal my watch, which he saw; he turned short round upon me, snatched the chain, and took my watch; then he turned round to Mr. Bell and finished his robbery; what he took from him I cannot say; he was near five minutes about it, and he thrust half his body into the coach. When he had done with Mr. Bell, he turned round to me, and said,</p>

            . I was in the Hampstead stage on the 7th of January, in the evening, a little before six o'clock; there was in the same coach Mr. Mackey, Mr. Park, Mr. Curtis, and I think in all six persons, besides a child; we were robbed by three persons in company together; the coach stopt, and one of the men opened the door, with a large pistol in his hand. (A pistol shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>Grignion. It was such a pistol as that, but it was brighter at the time, and he said, Your money!</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was frightened at that?</p>
               <p>Grignion. No, I had been robbed so often lately that I was not frightened at the time. I flung my money into his hat; I cannot tell how much; there was another man just at the side of the person, that put a pistol into the coach; I said take your pistol away and I will give you my money. As far as I could discern his countenance at night, I believe

            . Last Thursday se'ennight, at half past five, I saw the prisoner and Humphreys at the Castle in Kentish town, in a box; about five in the evening; I suspected them then; I went there with Joyce, a farrier; we got into the box and began talking of a robbery committed the night before; upon which the three people quitted the box immediately; the two prisoners and Humphreys. I suspected them to be dishonest persons upon seeing them start up on this conversation with respect to the robbery; I looked into the mug out of which they were drinking and found a good deal of liquor left; that confirmed my suspicion that they were in a hurry to get away or they would not have left part of their liquor. In about twenty minutes after they went out of the house I heard of this robbery.</p>

I heard of this robbery in about twenty minutes after; I am sure Male is one of those persons, because I observed a hole in his cheek.</p>

We went down Kentish town, where we robbed a coach. I had at the Castle this cutlass; May had this pistol; Wilson had a hanger; (produced in court) I had it under my coat, putting the point into my pocket; I cannot tell how they concealed the pistol and hanger; Male presented the pistol and stopped the horses; Male opened the coach door; I was on the other side; he took something on the other side of the coach; I heard them desire them to put the pistol away and they would give them the money; we were all concerned in the robbery. After I got over the gate I threw away the cutlass, but Male did not know that I threw it away, nor I did not know that he had thrown the pistol away; but the pistol and cutlass now produced, were the pistol and cutlass we had at that time. The reason why we run away upon Sir John's coach stopping, was, because we knew it very well by the pace: a common stage goes much faster.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 7th of December, about 11 in the morning, the prisoner offered me this silver watch (producing it;) it has been in my custody ever since: it is a very remarkable one; there is a painting in the dial plate; the account the prisoner gave of it was, that he had bought it of his master; the master was sent to; he said he sold him a watch, but it was not such a watch as this; it was without a chain when it was offered to pawn.</p>
               <p>He called some witnesses, and his master among the rest, who said this was not the watch.</p>

I had 42 l. there in money; there was as much taken out as amounts to 20 guineas; the bank notes were of the value two of 15 l. each, and another of 10 l.</p>

Mrs. Brown informed me she had found something in her box, and brought down the playing cards: she was desired to go up and replace them in her box. I went up and searched her box then, and found two packs of playing cards and the napkin and stockings; (the napkin and stockings produced and deposed to.) She said, on the playing cards being produced, that as young man who lives at a stationer's, the corner of Camomile-street, gave them to her. I charged her with taking them; then she said a gipsey woman came to the family, and that she gave her some cards to tell her fortune. Mr. Sturgion said, your master's mark is upon them, and that will not be believed, then she said she had taken them, and hoped I would be merciful; I said that depended upon her conduct. She went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130020"/> home to her mother's, and I paid her her wages. After that my wife missed a pair of stays: then Mr. Sturgeon and I went to her mother's, and charged her with having the stays; at first she denied it, and made many protellations; after some time she confessed she had them, and said she would send them back. I asked her how she came to do it; she replied she believed the devil was got in her. The stays were sent back by somebody that day.</p>

At first I would not shew it her; in about two or three minutes after, on her asking to see the watch again, I shewed it her; she snatched it out of my hand and put it into her bosom, and told me I should have it again; on demanding it, at last, she said she had it not, but another young woman had got it. When I first saw her (not at the time we went into the house) I asked her where she was going; she said to the one Tun; upon which I told her I would follow her there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have it?</p>
               <p>Harris. The owner broke it; I was to put a chain to it and to get it monded.</p>

            . I am the keeper of the Bengal warehouse at the East India House.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of this warehouse?</p>
               <p>Corbet. It is solely appropriated for the reception of prohibited goods, because the crown does not suffer any other goods to be mixed with them. By prohibited goods are understood all goods that are painted or stained, and wrought silks; they are received into the warehouse, are shewn there to any buyers, and when sold are delivered to the buyers; from thence they are sold by auction, which all the companies goods are, which by act of parliament are sold at the East India House, by inch of candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the kind of warehouse that all buyers have access to at proper hours?</p>
               <p>Corbet. Yes; from eight in the morning till two at noon; buyers or not buyers have access there; it is a common public show; samples are shewn of some goods; indeed all these particular goods are shewn open in chests; but these that were stole never had been shewn. The warehouses are open during the times of sale, which are in March and September, but are constantly open for reception from the ships and delivery to the buyers. I was informed on the 29th of December, that this warehouse had been broke open; upon examination I found that in the chest of bandannos, which are spotted handkerchiefs; under the No. 19 was invoiced 200; they were all gone. In No. 6, the same kind of goods, invoiced 138 pieces, 46 lost; of silk lungee romalls, which are a check handkerchief, No. 8, invoiced 200 pieces, lost 198; new o malls, they are a check handkerchief, a new fabrick, No. 17, invoiced 200, lost 184; in the whole 628 pieces lost; there were invoiced upon the whole 738; there are 110 remaining, that brings the loss to make up the full account of the invoice.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the pieces?</p>
               <p>Corbet. 246 pieces of bandanno which run about 1700 yards, the value of them at 20 s. a piece (they sold at the company's sales from 20 s. to 28 s.); the romalls I value at 30 s. they sold at the company's sale at 34 s. 6 d. the value in the whole is about 800 l. The company's resident at Bengal puts a ticket into the chest, of the contents of the chest; these two tickets (producing them) were found in the warehouse; they exactly correspond with the invoice of those chests.</p>

            . I am a king's officer, and attend at the warehouse in the India-house; the warehouse goes all round the leather market at Leadenhall. I left the warehouse on the 24th of December, about a quarter after two o'clock; we never attend in an afternoon: there is a stair case goes up into the warehouse from Leadenhall-street; there is a lock of the company's at the bottom of the stairs; there is a door on the middle of the stairs, of which the Company has a lock and the king a lock; there is a door at the top of the stairs, which has the company's lock, and there are two locks more before you can come to where the goods were taken from; I saw the outside locks fastened; the folding doors on the outside had not been unlocked some time; they are only open to receive goods from shipping; the buyers go up stairs at another door; there are two other doors besides; we generally look at them before we leave the warehouse; on the 24th I locked the doors, and tried them and found them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the warehouse again?</p>
               <p>Mason. On the 29th at eight o'clock as usual. I saw the gunnies of these chests cut, and the boards wrenched off; gunnies are a coarse cloth put over the chest; I put my hand into one chest, and there were but two lungee romalls remaining; I saw the ticket that is put into the chest at India; the next chest had nothing in it; the next had I think about twelve or thirteen pieces of new romalls; the fourth was a chest of bandannoes; there seemed to be a good many out of it, I cannot justly tell how much might be taken out of it. I found one ticket in one of the chests and I left it there. All the goods in this warehouse are exported by certificate, and one of us is obliged to go down to the waterside with them.</p>

            . I am one of the king's lockers. We leave this warehouse generally at two o'clock; I had been to the keys on the 24th of December; I returned before two; I fastened the outer door which comes down to Leadenhall-street, the door we go in at, that goes to the staircase; I went round the warehouse and looked at every one of the doors; the king's locks and the company's locks were on; the goods were all very safe then. On the 29th an alarm was given, while I was there, that the warehouse had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130024"/> been robbed; I went down and saw the padlock was broke off the door, and the other lock wrenched; I found one chest open; a little further I saw another chest with the gunnies cut, and the boards were broke off; most of the contents of that chest were gone; I cannot be particular how many pieces were remaining; I found, a ticket a little further on the ground which agreed with the marks on the gunney; a little further I saw the third chest which was broke open, and most of the contents were gone; and upon the left hand coming back there was another chest broke open, about one half of the contents of which were gone. I found the king's lock on the outside the warehouse safe, except these folding doors to the inner market; the company's and king's locks were both on; I went round and put the king's key to them and the lock was safe, but the inside fastenings of these two doors, two bolts, were broke off; the padlock was broke off, and the other lock strained and bent. There was a piece, I think it was of bandanno, upon the ground; I believe also there was a piece of bandanno between the door and this chest.</p>

They described the house where the others were, in King Edward-street, not far from Armstrong's; there was a padlock on the door; I drawed the staple, went up stairs, and there I found 385 pieces, which I delivered to Mr. Corbet; Shurbut producing 94 in the whole, 15 and 79.

Burrell used my shop to buy little matters; he confessed before the Justice that he was the only person concerned in breaking my shop; he had at first said that Ferry was concerned with him; he said now that he only charged Ferry out of spite; he said he broke in between one and two in the morning; I observed the marks of feet upon the table seemed to be all of one size. Burrel told the Justice he had thrown my till in a field; it was found according to his directions. (The till produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

            . I am brother to the prosecutrix; I keep a public house opposite the Ferry came to me last Monday se'ennight, and said he knew the person that had robbed my sister; that it was Burrell. I went to Mr. Gray's, a weaver, who is Burrell's master; Burrell hearing me come up stairs, attempted to get out at the window; I laid hold of the slap of his coat and pulled him in again; he said I am guilty; I asked him of what; he said of robbing Mrs. Croker; he said he got into the house between one and two o'clock, and described the manner in which he did it.</p>

            . I attend at Justice Wilmot's; I found four plates, a table cloth, four bottles of rum, a dark lanthorn, a chissel and a cutlass, last night was a week at Richardson's. (The plates produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Three of them have my marks, some of them I had not marked.</p>
               <p>Flanagan. Richardson and this other man had two rooms; they are both upon one floor; Richardson, and Meakham, and Meakham's wife were all together there. Richardson begged very hard to be taken before the Justice to be admitted an evidence; we took him to Mr. Wilmot's, and there he spoke freely about robbing Mr. Summers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no promise of pardon?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no expectation at that time that he should be admitted a witness?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No; Mr. Wilmot told him he should not; he said these plates belonged to Mr. Summers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say that?</p>

               <p>Flanagan. The night he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he robbed him?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. He said that he and one

             broke the house open, and that this was the chissel they did it with (producing a large chissel.)</p>
               <p>Q. And there was no treaty at that time about making him a witness?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No; when we took him in bed he begged to be taken to the Justice to be admitted an evidence; we told him he should be taken before the Justice and hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise made him?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No; I was present all the time: Meakham and his wife both said this was their tablecloth when we found it.</p>
               <p>Richardson. They made me drunk; all the way they said I should be an evidence if I would bring any body into the scrape.</p>
               <p>Flanagan. We did not.</p>
               <p>Richardson. In what room did I lie?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. In the further room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the things?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. In the hithermost room, and there was a bowl with four or five shillings worth of halfpence; he came into the room and took them out and said they were his.</p>

               <p>Wilson. Between four and five; I was awake when they were getting the goods out; I heard the copper pots, that disturbed me; I got out of bed and went down a little after five; then I saw the house was broke open; the sash was up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130030"/> but the window shutters were put close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part appear to be broke?</p>


               <p>Wilson. The shutters which were new were forced open, the main part of the bolt was bent double almost; I thought they were in the house; the watchman called me at five as he commonly does; I searched the house and missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). All but the tea chest was in a little room called the kitchen; the tea chest was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your things again?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I gave information at Justice Wilmot's of the robbery and of the men I suspected. I was sent for when they were taken; I heard them acknowledge they had robbed the house; I heard Mr. Wilmot ask them whether the rum belonged to me or the man at the Cock; they said they believed some of both; they said very little before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said that?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Richardson; the other said nothing. Richardson and another man were drinking at my house almost all the evening, till I went to bed; I cannot swear whether that man was Meakham; it was a man taller than himself. I found my house dog dead at the door.</p>

            . I am a ticket porter: I ply at the corner of Castle-alley by the Exchange. On the latter end of last November, about the 27th, about three in the afternoon, a person came to me, and asked me if I was a ticket porter; he handled my ticket, and said, can you read? I said, yes; he asked me whether I knew Mr. Child's shop; he then put a 40 l. note into my hand, and bid me go and get the money for it and bring it back and leave it at Hazard's lottery office; I was told by a friend, I was not safe in leaving it there; the person that directed me to leave it there, not being there to receive it, but it was better for me to go and fetch it back; I went in an hour and a half after, and fetched it back: as I saw nothing of the person that gave me the note; I kept it at the stand till eight o'clock that night, and then took it home with me; the next morning, at a quarter or half after nine, I was crossing the way, and the person was enquiring for me; he spoke to one Farmer; he had forgot my name, and asked for Parker instead of Palmer; at last seeing me, he asked me if I had carried a draft for him, I said, yes, and left the money at Hazard's office expecting him there, but not finding him, I had kept the money for him, and I would go to the office and pay the money to him; I went to the office, and there gave it to him; he asked me what would satis'y me for taking the note; he said I had had more trouble than usual, and asked me if 5 s. would satisfy me; I said 5 s. would; (The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130031"/> note shown him) I know that to be the note by a blot on the four, and I made a remark on the name

               <p>Palmer. I have not; I am poor sighted; I saw the person four times, but having lost one eye, and having very bad sight, I could not make such observation upon the person, at the time I saw him, as would give me such idea of his person as would enable me on recollection to swear he is the man; I am rather inclined to believe him to be the man: the appearance of the prisoner corresponds with the appearance of the man: I cannot with safety swear he is the person.</p>

               <p>Jekyll.

               <p>Davis. A very sober honest good man?</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Jekyll. I have known the prisoner from an infant; he is a very modest ingenious young man; he always behaved exceeding well; he lived at home; he has lived the life of a recluse till within these last few months, and great pains has been taken with his education, and he has made a good use of it till this affair; I believe he is a very good scholar.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. There is some alteration; he had his hair powdered and was paler than he is now; he is altered in his hair, his colour, and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always declare that? I am as tender as any body on cases of this sort: did not you swear positively to the knowledge of this young man?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I did believe him to be the person at Sir John's, but his colour, hair and cloaths are altered that I cannot swear to him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130032"/>Q. Did you believe the person at Sir John's to be the person you saw before?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I did believe it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be so now?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I cannot in my conscience be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion there?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. It was my opinion then that he was the person, his cloaths, and his hair, was different, and powdered then, which makes a great alteration.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a doubt?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told them I believed him to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express any doubt at Mr. Child's shop?</p>

               <p>Tracelove. I do not know he was any more than I heard say so.</p>

               <p>Tracelove. I believed him then to be the person but cannot positively say he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him the day after he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Yes, the self-same day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told them I believed him to be the person that gave me the draught.</p>

               <p>Tracelove. With regard to his appearance now.</p>
               <p>Q. You porter for any body with regard to carrying draughts?</p>

            's, and then they let me go with a bag of halfpence to Anderton's coffee-house; after they had detained me for some time, the master of the Coffee-house said he knew me to be an honest man; then they thought it proper for me to go to Tobit's Dog again, in case I should be sent for by the person that gave me the draught, and desired me not to go out of the way all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go that day?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I did a job for Mr. Johnson, a bookseller; I staid in the way all the afternoon as they desired me; one of Justice Fielding's people came to me, and asked me several questions, and I thought it most prudent to go to the Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the magistrate?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I went with Sir John's man to the Crown, Mr. Montague's, a public house in an alley in Ludgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present there?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Only Justice Fielding's clerk and I; I cannot tell his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Shall you know him again when you see him?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you declare to that man?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I told him as near as I could the description of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Strictly speaking the conversation is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Very true; what pased next?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I went to the Tobit's Dog, and from thence home. I went on a little job; when I returned, they told me at the Tobit's Dog that the man was taken: I went to Sir John's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there?</p>

               <p>Tracelove. I told him I believed him to be the person at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you know the person that gave you the draught at the coffee-house?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Not in my conscience and heart: I would not say it for all the world.</p>

               <p>Tracelove. Between twelve and one on the 30th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it the name was wrote on the draught in order that you might know it again?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. Yes.</p>

I left two of Sir John's people there, and charged them not to leave the house while it was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure that the order was brought you by Tracelove the porter.</p>
               <p>Edgar. I am certain of it, because here is the mark upon the back of it, that I am sure of it by; it was not made by me.</p>

               <p>Court. I cannot admit that evidence, it contradicts your own witness.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown to Mr. Wormhall. Are you sure that is the draught presented by Tracelove independent of the mark.</p>
               <p>Wormhall. I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Edgar. The other side of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible for you at that time to see the draught?</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the draught?</p>
               <p>Edgar. It was given to Mr. Keysal another of the clerks.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not the custody of it?</p>
               <p>Edgar. It was in a drawer where every body in the house had access to it.</p>
               <p>Q. At your house you have a great number of clerks, pray who produced it before Sir John?</p>
               <p>Edgar. I did.</p>

               <p>Wormhall. My reason was from the name

               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe he is the person that came to the coffee-house on the 31st of December in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he apply himself to?</p>
               <p>Price. He applied to the bar; Mrs. Price was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said?</p>
               <p>Price. No; the waiter called me; when I came down, the words to the best of my recollection were, pray sir, is there any money left here for me?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>Price. To the best of my judgment I believe it is the same person, but I will not take upon me positively to swear he is, one may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that person apprehended at your house?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man that took him into custody?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes; when I see him; the man took hold of him, and said you are my prisoner, sir; the note is a forged note. The man searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he?</p>
               <p>Price. The man attempted to put his hands across him; he said he need not be rude with him, he would go with him. I heard him ask him to send for Mr. Nedham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to the charge?</p>
               <p>Price. I do not recollect that he said any thing more; they sent for a coach and the man and he went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired him to send for Mr. Nedham?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes; the person said it was improper to send for him there, he might send for him at Sir John's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the name Nedham been mentioned before that?</p>
               <p>Price. Not that I heard of.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the prisoner himself proposed to send for Mr. Nedham?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Do you know what he said to him upon which he desired Mr. Nedham might be sent for; what expressions were made use of just before?</p>
               <p>Price. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the discourse between at the time the prisoner desired Mr. Nedham might be sent for?</p>
               <p>Price. He said that to the man who took him?</p>
               <p>Q. What that discourse was you cannot tell?</p>

            's clerk, in the evening between eight and nine o'clock; I believe on the 30th of December, to Anderton's coffee-house; I waited till past twelve at night; nobody came that I saw to apply for any thing; I went back in the morning, betwen nine and ten, the prisoner came and said something to the waiter; Mr. Price was sent for; he came down stairs in some few minutes; when he came down I went up pretty close to them to hear what passed between them; I heard them say something about money; I said young man you are my prisoner; that note is a forged note; I was going to tie his hands; he said behave civil I will go with you; I sent the porter for a coach; he wanted to send for Mr. Nedham; who Mr. Nedham was I did not know; I did not know it was forged in Mr. Nedham's name: the coach came; I took him into custody, and took him up to Sir John's; I called at Mr. Child's shop to tell them I had him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it you took to Sir John's?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find about him?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. Only a pocket book (producing it) an ass skin book in it; there was a little bit of writing, I believe of no consequence; there is nothing in the pocket book that relates to this.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tracelove. Look at that pocket book?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. The person that gave me the draught gave it me out of such a pocket book as this.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. This is a common almanack case; I suppose you have seen a 100 of them in a stationer's shop?</p>
               <p>Tracelove. I do not believe that to be the same pocket book; I said so before the Justice, because I saw an ivory leaf in that, which is not in this.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. It is not very usual for a person that forged a draught to send for the person in whose name it was forged.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. There is nothing meant in this prosecution but public justice; if you force me to it, I can give a very sufficient answer to that.</p>

               <p>Burt. The s is turned different from what Mr. Nedham does in joining the N; this is turned round to the right, Mr. Nedham turns it over and joins it to the end.</p>

               <p>Q. You are no way acquainted with Mr. Nedham's hand writing but from a knowledge of his signing briefs and pleadings: don't you know most gentlemen sign briefs and pleadings in a different manner from what they do in common writing when they sign securities; I know I do; it is the only way of security, when a gentleman writes his name so many hundred times; I believe people are not pretty accurate when they write their names on pleadings.</p>

               <p>Q. What judgment do you form of that as to its being Mr. Nedham's hand or no?</p>
               <p>Strong. The letters seem to be cut different, particularly the N, and I think there is a variance as to the T.</p>

            , Esq;</p>
               <p>Q. You I believe are captain of a man of war?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are brother I believe to this young man's father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the peace you have been pretty much at home?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes, since the year 1763.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the young man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. About eighteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have been at that time about eight or nine?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time to the present what has been his general character?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. His general character has been irreproachable; he is a very sober, virtuous young man, never out of the house: I was amazed to hear this of him at Portsmouth, where I have a ship, upon which I came up to town</p>

               <p>Q. He has been well educated?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was pretty much at home with his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Always at home; I never knew him go out without leave; he was never absent above two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. He always acted dutifully to his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And has had a good education?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. His father has the misfortune to be blind, and this young man has always been his amanuensis, read and writ to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was much at home?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Always at home.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a clergyman?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Jekyll?</p>
               <p>Davis. About five or six years in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his general character?</p>
               <p>Davis. A very honest-sober good sort of a lad as can be: I have known his father twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to be pretty much at home?</p>
               <p>Davis. Always at home with his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a dutiful young man?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes, and very diligent and sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any complaint or crime or misbehaviour?</p>
               <p>Davis. Never in the least.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Jekyll. I have known him from his infancy.</p>
               <p>Q. You are related to his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Always a very decent dutiful boy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been from school?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. I do not recollect; he has been very diligent and dutiful, very attentive to his books, and I have seen a great many of his own observations in manuscript.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep at home and close with his father?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. He always kept with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear till the present charge the least imputation in the world upon this young man's character?</p>
               <p>Jekyll. Not in the least.</p>

               <p>Capt. Roach. On Monday night last, at half after eleven, going to my house at Chelsea, I met two men; the prisoner and the other that was just now at the bar; the prisoner pushed me violently into the gutter; I did not fall by it; I clapped my hand to my sword and asked them what they meant by that: upon which the prisoner immediately fired at me; the ball grazed my head and the paper fell upon my shoulder; I pursued him but heran too fast; I seized the other with one hand, and held my sword to his breast with the other hand. On taking him before the guard he was searched; there was a loaded pistol found in his pocket; he gave me information where to find this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive to this man that he is the person?</p>
               <p>Roach. I am quite so; I am very unhappy that I should be so certain.</p>

This small pistol (producing it) is the fellow to that found upon Godlington; I found it in a hole in the chimney as far as I could reach up, I could not find any thing round the room; he denied there was any thing in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pistol loaded?</p>
               <p>Bond. No, it was not; I found six bullets which are here, and two pistol flints all together in this hole; when I pulled the pistol out the the others fell down and a bullet mould.</p>

Roach, not with any design to molest him; he clapped his hand to his sword, and said, d - n you, you scoundrel, what do you mean by that; I said, what you assault me, if you me an to molest me take that, and fired at him; the captain pursued us; we had no weapons to make our defence with; Godlington had another pistol loaded with powder, without ball; I ran away as fast as I could.

               <p>Roach. The paper fell upon my shoulder; I should be very sorry to declare further; I am to all human probability certain in my own mind the bullet whistled by my head. I should much rather wish he might be transported.</p>

            . I am a constable: I was on duty at the Old Bailey session; a person came to me from the Baptist's-head, and desired me to take charge of a person that had robbed a man of his money; I found the prisoner Glynn, and charged her with it; she denied it, but acknowledged she was in the company of the prosecutor, and drank part of a pint of purl and a quartern of gin at the Baptist's-head; we went into Fleet-lane, and the prosecutor pointed to a house and said this is the house I was robbed in; the people at the next house said they were gone away, that there was a disturbance in the night by a man calling out watch! in consequene of this I took her before a magistrate, and she was committed to Wood-street Compter, the other prisoner the prosecutor himself took in the Old Bailey.</p>

               <p>It is as false as God is true; it is because this woman would not lie with him; he gave me two-pence halfpenny for a quartern of gin; I said the best was threepence: she said she would not go to bed without some supper, and he gave me seven-pence to get some; when I came back they were disputing: I asked what was the matter; she said he wanted to go to bed all night and trust to his honour till morning, and he would pawn his watch to satisfy her, and if she would not he said he would call the watch.</p>

I suspected Low, my servant, an errand boy, about eighteen years old, of having stole them; my reason for supposing it was, because nobody had access there but he and me; I looked in a box of which nobody had the key but this boy to fetch things as might be wanted; I had no other servant but a servant girl; I never employed her to go into this warehouse.

            . I am a watchman. On the 18th of December at five in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a sack upon his shoulder; he was about 200 yards from Mr. Fonsica's; he said he was employed to carry it over night, and not having done it he chose to carry it at that time, and said he was going into the Borough; I suspected him, took him up, and carried him to the watch-house; there I examined the bag; it contained a considerable quantity of tobacco (The bag produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bag is mine, and the tobacco is mine; I know it by its having been wetted and put into the kiln to dry, that gave it a peculiar smell.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Letton: I went with my master and his lady and set them down at the play; I came home about half after six; I locked up the box coat in the stable; I put the key in at a little hole in at the side of the window in the stable; I went there again about two hours after, in order to fetch my master; then I missed the coat: the key had dropped down from the place where I put it. I suspected the prisoner, as he had been about there; I had employed him to assist me as he was out of place; I did not tell my master of it that night; I told him the next morning of it. I went down to Westminster to look for the prisoner, I left word there that I wanted him; a soldier brought him to me at five o'clock on Tuesday night; the coat was stole on the Monday night; he acknowledged he took the coat, and said he would shew me where it was; he went with me to Plaid the pawnbroker's, where the coat was found pawned by

About five in the morning the waiter, with whom I lay, waked me in order to get at the pot; I found that my breeches then were drawn from under, and lay at the top of my pillow beside my head; I said who has been medling with my breeches? the waiter said he knew nothing of the matter, he was just awake; I searched, and the two guineas were gone. On an information received, I went and found the prisoner at the King's-head in St. James's-street; there I charged him with taking my money; at first he denied it, then I told him if he would confess, I would not prosecute him, but he still denied it; at last I searched him, and found concealed in the inside of his breeches a guinea, and 9 s. the prisoner then confessed he had taken it, and had sent half a guinea of the money by a chairman to get changed, who was not yet returned; that he had spent 18 d.

               <p>Q. Why did you go to Wood-street Compter?</p>
               <p>Walker. Because he said he belonged to Wood-street Compter; the officer next day fetched the prisoner from over the water, and I had him secured; the other never knew my house nor my person; he must be brought there by the prisoner.</p>
