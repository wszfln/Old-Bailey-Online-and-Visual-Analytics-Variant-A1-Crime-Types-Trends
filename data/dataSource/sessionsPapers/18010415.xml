(The muslins were deposed to by Mrs. Gander.)</p>
               <p>Murphy's defence. I bought the muslin and paid for it; there is no particular mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What distance is this place from your house? - A. I should suppose, pretty near a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>Verney's defence. Marsh came and asked me to lend him a truss of hay for a day or two; I let him have the truss; I saw the gates open, I thought the man was gone to the Bull-and-mouth to know what horses were coming there, and I laid down in the straw till he came back.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he only pretended to unlock the other? - A. Because I had been the night before to examine, and found it unlocked; as soon as he had opened the shop, and his back turned, I looked in the till, and missed one shilling and sixpence; I went to the officer about ten o'clock, and he found one shilling and sixpence of money that I had marked, upon him; he had other silver about him, and twenty penny worth of copper.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a mark was this? - A. More like a V than any thing else; but it was not intended to represent any particular letter.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you never saw a letter upon a shilling, or a sixpence, in your life? - A. Yes, I have, certainly.</p>

             sworn. - I am a beadle,(produces the one shilling and sixpence;) I received it from the prisoner, with some other silver, and about twenty penny worth of halfpence; I asked him for his master's property; he said, he had got none; I told him I must see it; and then he pulled out one shilling and sixpence, of which Mr. Hoare had described the mark.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same, but the mark is not very easy discerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There are several marks about it? - A. I don't wish to know any other marks than my own.</p>
               <p>Q. And that scratch is the only mark by which you are able to swear to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any money due to this man for wages? - A. There is nothing due, I have paid it to his mother since.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If you will examine it again, you will observe there are several smaller marks upon that money? - A. It is a mark that you cannot discern but by the shade of the light.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is that conspicuous cross the mark you mean to swear to? - A. No, that is a mark put upon it by the officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Will you venture to swear these marks were not upon it when you put it into the till? - A. I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Shepherd. I put a cross upon the opposite side to the prosecutor's mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You put that mark upon it to know it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have known it again without that mark? - A. Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty.</p>
               <p>Barr. This is the same money; I have another of the marked shillings in my pocket. (It is banded to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you intend that the mark upon this should be like the mark upon the other shilling and sixpence? - A. Nearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. This appears to be like a W.? - A. That may have happened from my marking one stroke down and not seeing it; I may have made another.</p>

             sworn. - I am a brushmaker, opposite Mrs. Heywood's: On Tuesday morning, the 17th of March, I saw the prisoner, Mary Selby, go into Mrs. Haywood's passage, and then one of the lodgers in the house came out, and the prisoner ran out into the court; she came up again, and went into the passage, and her husband followed her in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was her husband? - A. He said so at Bow-street; then she came and watched at the door; her husband came out, and put his hand to his waistcoat pocket; he stood looking two yards within the door, but did not proceed into the shop; I then saw the woman come out with the scale-beam under her apron; the man came out at the same time behind her; upon which I ran to her and laid hold of her, and said, that won't do, you shan't have it; I held her fast, and called out for assistance, but could get none; I then took her back into Mrs. Haywood's passage, with the beam; when I laid hold of her, the man ran away; there was but one man that I could see in the street to get any assistance, and he would not, by that means the man got off; and the next morning, as I was going to work, I met the man in the next passage; I told him I knew him, that I saw him in a place he should not have been in, and then he set off and run; I went to get some of my shopmates to assist me, and a man immediately came to tell me he was taken; I am sure he is the same man. (Produces the scale-beam).</p>
               <p>Mrs. Haywood. It was hung upon a hook in the passage, with a wire round it, to prevent its being taken away.</p>
               <p>Wells. There is a small bit of wire round it, which appears to have been broke.(Alice wills confirmed the evidence of her husband).</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure of that? - A. I am; upon that I turned my horse about to take off the party to go home; upon that the prisoner called out to make fast the gates; I knew his voice; he said, lock the gate, and was answered by a voice, unknown to me, that all was fast already; the prisoner then said, the d-d b-rs of light horsemen are here again, shoot them, shoot them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Are you sure that was the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150011"/>soner's voice? - A. Yes; there was a large company of people assembled upon a rising hill, in a bit of ground adjoining his house; there might be twenty, more or less; they were about sixty or seventy yards from where the prisoner was; upon that the company began to give huzza, huzza, and as I was passing on, I saw

             and Edward Martin, jun. who lived in the house, I believe; my lads, says I, you had better behave, as there is some person here now that knoweth you; Hodges said to Martin, I believe that is Arnold, is not that Arnold's voice; upon that I passed by them in a direction to come away off in a little gentle trot, and as we had got to the summit of the hill, just as we had to pass over a rivulet of water, I heard a voice say, fire; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner's voice or not, and immediately a gun was discharged; we went on to the gate, and they continued firing upon us, I should suppose there were twenty guns discharged, more or less; when we came to the gate, we found it chained and padlocked; we got off our horses and broke the gate open as soon as we could; I never knew that gate locked in my life before; it is a road leading to the sea-side, and also to the farm-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether those guns were loaded or not? - A. Yes; I heard several balls; there was one just at the gate, which I thought would have gone through one of the horses, but it did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You don't know who discharged any of the guns? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. I now ask you, upon your solemn oath, if you have any doubt as to the voice, or as to the person of the prisoner? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You are speaking of the 6th of September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it when you first came upon the premises of the prisoner? - A. About six o'clock; we were there six or seven hours.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taking in his wheat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there assisting him in getting in his harvest? - A. Ten or a dozen persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner that morning? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You searched his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the search of his house did any body accompany you besides Twentyman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you molested by the prisoner? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you rudely addressed by him? - A. Twentyman and he had some words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he obstruct you in your search? - A. He treated me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you something to drink, I believe? - A. I drank a glass of brandy with him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was getting in his harvest - you having actually searched his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found nothing? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that you searched every where that your duty suggested? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you all went away from his premises? - A. Twentyman and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. To a cove by the sea side, which is a place, I understand, very open to smuggling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had entirely finished your search at Bawden's premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your design, or did you communicate your design to Bawden, or any of his servants, or any body you knew connected with him, that you intendeded to search over again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the words b-rs of dragroons, shoot them, had you not passed his house? - A. We had passed under his house towards the sea-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - A. To the beach, to look for smuggled goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going when you saw the prisoner, and heard his voice? - A. I was going up where the soldiers gave me directions, that he was seventy yards from his house.</p>
               <p>Q. If the dragoon had not told you there were people behind the hedge, you and all your party would have gone home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the dragoon had not led you back to the house of Bawden, you would have gone homeward, having examined his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When I am defending a man, who is trying for his life, I do not mean to impute to you an intention to swear that which is not true, but we are all liable to be mistaken; in the first place, you have stated the distance to be about twenty yards; what time of night was it? - A. Eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The sixth of September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not as light as day? - A. No, it was a fine moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. By moonlight, at the distance of twenty yards, and a hedge between you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you swear that you saw the prisoner by moonlight, at the distance of twenty yards, and a hedge intervening, I take it you mean to say that you believe you saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it has happened to you, as it has happened to all of us in our turns, not wickedly, to take a false oath against a man; but I believe it has happened to you, that you have mistakes one man for another - Are you as sure of that as you are that you saw the prisoner? - A. I am sure I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it never happened to you to make a mistake of one person for another, to make a charge upon one man, and afterwards find out that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150012"/>were mistaken? - A. I once called a man forward for a hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. It so happens, I see, that the Nobleman is here who was the Magistrate upon that occasion; did you not swear to one man and afterwards find it was another? - A. I said I would not swear to May, but to Crease.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you believed May to be the other man? - A. No; I said I could not swear to him; the Collector says the information, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not think it was May? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not send for a man of the name of Orgill, and then see your mistake? - A. No; I told my Lord, before-hand, that I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard at this time the words, the d-d b-is of light horsemen are here again; had they been with you in the morning? - A. No; only Twentyman and me together.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you heard the words, shoot them, shoot them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time there was no firing in consequence of those words? - A. Not directly.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two persons there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard these expressions, where did you go? - A. We took our route to go right away home.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this gate had not had a chain and padlock upon it, would you not have passed it without taking any notice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nto a chain and padlock that you had over seen upon the gate before? - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you broke them, and went through? - A. We unhung the gate behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the place where you saw the man behind the hedge, from the gate? - A. I should suppose it must be three hundred yards or more, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the gate when the firing took place, or had you passed through? - A. No; we were two hundred yards from the gate, I should suppose, when the first firing was.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that from the house of the prisoner - a quarter of a mile? - A. No, one hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the gate to the prisoner's house? - A. Two or three hundred yards; I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot take upon you to say what became of those two men after you saw them, and after you heard the words, shoot, shoot? - A. No, I cannot tell what became of then after that, it is impossible, I was going from them.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was there between your hearing those words, and your coming to the rivulet where you was fired at? - A. Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might that be - you was riding; - A. We walked our houses, I walked my horse, and the dragoons met, it might be four or five hundred yards, I apprehend; I am speaking as near as I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were several shots, by some wicked persons, fired at you? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body say, fire, fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that it was the prisoner's voice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody unknown, said, fire, fire; and then the guns were fired? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no mischief happened - I do not mean that that circumstance lessens the wickedness of the persons? - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. When the information was taken before a noble Lord, against May and another, are you conscious of having charged any man, and I did not swear to him, I only called him forward, and told my Lord, I could not swear to him, and he was discharged, and the other was fined two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the house only that you were to search for smuggled goods? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the fields? - A. By the sea-side; we thought they might have been moving the goods in the night.</p>
               <p>Mr. E<note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>skine. Q. My Learned Friend Must have misunderstand what you said to me, and what I said to you - you said, but for the dragoons you should have gone home? - A. Yes, I should have went home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far was this large company upon the rising ground from the hedge where you saw the prisoner? - A. About sixty or seventy yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these two persons with the twenty persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. How loud were the words spoken by the prisoner? - A. Pretty well as loud as he could speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they spoken loud enough to be heard by the people upon the hill? - A. It was loud enough to be heard a mile and more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance from which the answer proceeded? - A. Three or four hundred yards; I cannot say for certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it your intention to search about for smuggled goods? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from his house? - A. About one hundred and fifty yards; when we went to make a search, we passed about sixty yards from Bawden's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or a dark night? - A. It was a little moonlight, I have seen it lighter.</p>

            's house; Bawden sent some men who were on the premises to go down and lock the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of voice was that said in, low, or loud? - A. Rather loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any answer made? - A. There might be one, but I did not hear any; I apprehended some violence was going to ensue, I did not pay any great attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a public highway that the gate crossed? - A. It was the common road from Withiam.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way to the cliff? - A. No, it is a gate that leads from the high-road to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a gate which people commonly use as well the prisoner's servants, as the public at large? - A. Yes, it is quite a common gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find that gate locked before that night? - A. No, I never saw it locked before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it at this time that made you apprehend danger? - A. It struck me, that that was the case; there were a number of men there, holloaing, and making a violent noise, huzzaing; there were a great number of them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear or observe any thing that increased your fear? - A. I heard a noise, to the best of my recollection, cry, shoot the b-rs; there were several, I believe, said that; I then retreated towards the gate that I came in at, and found it locked; I was going to tell the party we could not get through that way, and I heard a bullet pass between me and our party; then we went towards the gate, a number of guns were find till we had got the gate open.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guns were fired? - A. I did not pay much attention.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you guess? - A. I can't say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there half a dozen? - A. I think there were that or more.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence were those guns fired? - A. From some persons ftanding pretty near Bawden's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do you think from Bawden's house these people were placed? - A. I suppose the gate is three hundred yards from the house; it is impossible for me to say whether they fired from the house or where.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far, according to the best of your judgment, were the peaople who fired from the house? - A Fifteen yards perhaps, or so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. You cannot understand the question, I think? - A. I don't pretend to speak positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To the best of your recollection, how far were there people from the house? - A. It might be perhaps about ten yards, or a trifle more; I might be three hundred yards from the place where the guns were fired, and the gate was further.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think they might continue firing? - A. Some few minutes perhaps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp - Q. I understood you to say, it was not so light a night as you had observed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Several witnesses make use of the word shoot; did not you say so? - A. I said I thought there were.</p>
               <p>Q. You were about three hundred yards distant from where the persons fired? - A. I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Q. It was near that? - A. I suppose it was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am serjeant in the 2d regiment of the Queen's dragoons; I was with Arnold and Pettitt on the 6th of September last, at Goodriddy; about ten o'clock in the evening Arnold and I went down to the cliff, and ordered Pettitt and the other four dragoons to stay in the field to see that nobody fired upon us, or threw any stones; and as we were coming home some person cried out, lock the gate; Mr. Arnold, Mr. Pettit, and four dragoons were with me at that time; then we came on very gently, and coming under the hill, near Bawden's house, I saw a numbher of men upon that hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that hill from the house? - A. About seventy yards; and coming a little further, there was a dog set upon us; Arnold said, is there no one that can shoot the dog? upon which I drew my pistol, and fired at the dog, but missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the dog, had you heard them make use of any particular language - bad they called out? - A. To lock the gate, and I heard somebody cry, the gate was already locked; when I fired and missed the dog, they fired upon us from the top of the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there upon the hill do you suppose? - A. I suppose a dozen or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shots were fired? - A. Two or three, before we got to the gate; when we got to the gate, we found it fastened; I ordered a dragoon to dismount and unhang the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shots? - A. I suppose there might be twenty; I did not hear more 
than three myself.</p>




               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Had this gate not been shut, you were in your way home? - A. Yes, we were going home then.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150014"/>Q. Had not the gate been locked, you would have passed through it? - A. Yes, we should have gone home quietly.</p>


               <p>Q. It was immediately upon your firing off this pistol at the dog, that the firing took place? - A. Yes, from the hill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Q. Do you happen to know how far a musket will carry a ball? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which, after being revised by his Counsel, was read as follows:"I leave my case to my Counsel; I cannot impute to Mr. Arnold, or to the witnesses who have given evidence against me, the wicked design of falsely swearing away my life; I have no doubt they were fired at in the manner they have sworn, and are only mistaken in imputing it to me; the situation of the farm I occupy under Lord De Dunstanville, is upon a very exposed and remote part of the sea coast of Cornwall, where there is a great deal of smuggling; my house had been searched in the morning: no violence or resistance, or any such disposition, has been imputed to me; on the contrary, I behaved with civility to Arnold, and there was no temptation which could lead to the commission of such desperate wickedness; I had no malice to Arnold, or to the persons with him, I was a stranger; they had made no seizure, nor had I any to apprehend; they had searched peaceably, and having found nothing, were retiring to a distance from the village; they had done me no violence, they had offered me no provocation to the wicked attack made upon them; I declare most solemnly, in the presence of God, I was, and am yet a stranger; at the time it was made, I was with the persons who had assisted me through the day in bringing in my corn; the report of the firing was heard by all of us at a considerable distance, and I intreat the Court to hear their evidence in support of my innocence; the distance of the place where I live, makes it impossible for me to be at the expence of bringing up my neighbours and acquaintance to speak what they know of my disposition; but I have a certificate from most respectable persons, if the Court can receive it: Lord De Dunstanville, my landlord, will, I am persuaded, bear witness that he believes me incapable of the wickedness imputed to me. Gentlemen of the Jury, I commit my life with confidence to your humane and impartial judgment.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Lord DE DUNSTANVILLE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Your Lordship has a considerable estate in this neighbourhood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner is a tenant of your's? - A. Yes; I have known him personally these two years, by reputation four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be a man capable of the desperate wickedness imputed to him in this indictment? - A. By what I know of him, I should certainly think not; I never heard any thing against the man, except that he certainly has been suspected of smuggling; I know nothing against him; I always understood him to be a very quiet, sober man.</p>
               <p>Q. And your Lordship does not think him capable of the desperate wickedness of shooting at another? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Lordship recollect the circumstance of Arnold bringing May and Crease before you; I have a saint recollection of it, and I think it was as you have stated it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been out of your company during that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are upon your oath, do you mean to swear positively that he never was out of your company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney-General. Q. Do I understand you, that all the persons who had been assisting you were in the house with Bawden, from eight till one, without going out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what were you doing all that time? - A. We got supper; Mr. Bawden made some liquor for us, and we were drinking till eleven; then a woman came, and said, there were horses come upon the cliff; Mr. Bawden got up, put his back against the door, and insisted that every man should go to his seat; we heard the firing of the guns.</p>

               <p>Q. How many were there of you? - A. Eleven.</p>

               <p>Mr. Moore. I had not slept in the house since before Christmas; Martin takes care of the house; I had been about three days before, and seen all these things; the pistols are worth a guinea and a half; the gun I would not take four or five guineas for; if it was offered me; I went down afterwards, and found the tea-chest, out of which this tea ladle was taken, broke to pieces; I know all these things to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I put it to you as a man of candour; do you think it possible that such a boy as that could make use of force sufficient to break this door open? - A. I will tell you why; if it had been a short instrument, he could not have done it for want of purchase, but there was a garden-spade near the door, and it having a long handle, would give a purchase sufficient for such a boy to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think it might have been done by such a boy as that? - A. I am sorry to say I have no doubt about it.</p>

No; it was voluntary; she said she was sorry for the other woman, for she was not with her when she pledged them; she said the she had pledged five skins at Mr. Mathews's and the other four she had pledged at Mr. Davidson's, in the Borough, in the name of Darby, but that Darby was not with her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street-office, I was with Griffiths: I took Mr. Matthews to see the prisoner in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150021"/>the lock-up-room, and she said to Mr. Matthews, it was me that pawned them; the other pawnbroker could not swear to the woman, and the Magistrate ordered him to deliver up the skins. (The five skins were identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Goulding. The other four I had returned to me, and I have sold them.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. The prisoner acknowledged that she had pledged these skins at Mr. Davidson's.</p>
               <p>Goulding. I knew the other four to be mine by the marks, and the quality; by the quality, I mean that these were skins that I bought in a rough state, and before, what we call grounding them, I washed them over with a liquor which contracts them, alters the texture of them, makes them finer, and not so spungy; it is a practice that is exploded in the trade; I do not know any man in the trade that uses it besides myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My husband is a leather breeches-maker, and he makes up his leather, and sells at Rag-fair; my husband bought some skins of a Jew, he had not money enough to pay for them, and he sent me with five skins to pledge; the skins that were pledged in the Borough I never saw; I am innocent of it.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Goulding.) Was it light when you went out? - A. No, it was not. <rs id="t18010415-30-verdict159" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No; he got it from me and run away, I ran after him and cried stop thief; there were some people belonging to the Mews heard the alarm and they ran with me; he chucked down the bundle, and then one Starkey, who lives in Wells's-mews, heard the alarm, and seized him.</p>

               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes; he never went out of my sight; when he threw down the bundle it came open, and I picked it up; when the man was taken, I took the bundle and left it at the washerwoman's; the prisoner was brought up facing the washerwoman's door, and then the two witnesses charged the watch with him; after I had got to the watch-house, they sent a man with me to the washerwoman's to get the bundle, and I went and serched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bundle in the same state in which you had left it? - A. No; when I left it, it was open, and the washerwoman had counted the things, for the bill was in it, and she had tied them up again; the prisoner was in the watch-house that night, and the next morning I saw him again.</p>

             sworn. - I am a journeyman carpenter, I work with Mr. Nash, of Wapping-wall: On Saturday night, the 28th of March, about ten minutes past nine o'clock, I went up New Gravel-lane, and saw the prisoner driving two pigs; I had some suspicion of him; I asked him where he was going with these pigs, at that time of night; he said, he was going home with them; I asked him where he bought them, he said, he had bought them on board-a-ship, he seemed very much fluttered; I said, my friend, they are not your property, you have stolen these pigs; says he, then you had better stop me; I said, I have a great mind to stop you; I followed him, driving the pigs up Ratcliff-highway; I took a great deal of notice of him, and the pigs too, it was a moonlight night; he then drove them up King David's-lane, Mile-end; I stopped there, and pursued him no farther; I was in company with him about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Under all these circumstances, have you any doubt that the prisoner is the man? - A. None; I remarked one pig in particular, that was the barrow-pig, it was swelled under the belly; I saw that one of the tails was cut short, I did not observe the other tail; the next morning, I was at the barber's shop, and heard that Mr. Blackling had lost the pigs; I went with him to Special's, where I saw the same two pigs; I am sure they were the same.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming home on the Saturday night, I saw these pigs in the street, and I was going to drive them to the Green-yard, but it being rather late, I asked Mr. Special to let me leave them there till the next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. That was the first seizure; be so good as come to the second? - A. Before we got to Lord Rous's Park the prisoner passed us in a cart; I am sure of his person, I knew him very well; he had been sent back with one of the carts, and when I saw him he had got the cutter's men in the cart; he called us b-rs; we went up to Lord Rous's Lodge, and let them pass us, they were huzzaing; we went on, and in Lord Rous's Park we found to the number of sixty or seventy half ankers, I counted thirty in one lot; Mr. Gooch immediately went off for a waggon to convey them away, and while he was gone, I saw the smuggling carts coming from the White-hart, at Blithborough; I ordered one of the waggons that we had hired, to bring the half ankers out of the wood; we slaved a half anker, we knocked the head in, on purpose to taste it, it was foreign geneva; I told him I should seize that tub, and the rest of the tubs that were in the wood; I ordered my men to load the waggon, and when we had got about twenty half ankers in the waggon, the smugglers appeared upon the hill, in five carts they were about two hundred yards from us when I first saw them; when they saw us they huzzaed, d-d their eyes, and said they were glad to see us; I asked them what they wanted; the prisoner replied that he wanted to go past, he said the King's highway was as free for them as for us; he then said, d-n your eyes we want the tubs, and the tubs we will have; they immediately surrounded us, and blocked us in between the waggon and the pales, and their carts; Dick then jumped down off the cart, and said, d-n their eyes they are fixed; we charged them with our swords, and then we forced out between the carts, and we left the tubs behind; I told them they had got the tubs, but if they offered to move them I would fire at them; one of the sailors, with a straw hat on, came immediately up to me, and said, d-n your eyes shoot; he unbuttoned to his shirt, and said, here is a breast to shoot at; we then fired at them several times, and they retreated; they then charged us with pitchforks, and bludgeons, up the hill, and stoned us till we got loaded again, and then we drove them back again, and so we kept on for nearly half an hour; then they holloaed out that we should have twenty tubs; I then consulted Mr. Gooch, and we found we had only one cartridge a-piece left; then we said we would accept of twenty tubs; Little Dick's reply was, d-n your eyes we will not give you twenty; we then fired at them again, and then they agreed to give us twenty, and we carried them off; when we parted, he said to Mr. Gooch, d-n your eyes I will mark you; upon which I told him he would have to answer for the whole, for I knew him very well; I had seen him several times at Bawdsey, in Suffolk, he used to be along with a man that went by the name of Frenchman, I am sure that is the man; there were two foreigners in the party that could not speak a word of English, they assisted in picking up stones for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you always been as certain as you are to day? - A. I am certain to the man now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as certain? - A. I have been mistaken in a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150026"/>Q. Have you not mistaken another man for him, as much unlike him as any man in Court? - A. I was once at his house, and they wanted to counterfeit Dick, and persuade me that another man was him.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you about any thing that passed at his house. - Did you never, at any other place, charge any other man with being the man that you now charge the prisoner to be? - A. When we were going to serve the summons, we overtook a Mr. Woolner, we understood that Dick went out of Saxmundham before us upon a black horse, this was a man upon a black horse; and Mr. Woods; who was with me, said, don't look at him, and I will serve him; I passed him, and Mr. Woods spoke to him; I then turned round, and immediately said it is not Dick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go with Woolner to a public-house, and keep him till the landlord told you who he was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house of Mrs. Buck, at Ash? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not there mistake another man for Dick? - A. No; that was the time when they were counterfeiting another man for Dick.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in the same room with him and did not know him? - A. Never, to the best of my knowledge; if he was he was in disguise.</p>
               <p>Q. But if he had been in the same room with you, undisguised, you must have known him? - A. I suppose I must.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you ever see this man, and were you about to take him? - A. Yes; I met him last November, and he presented a serew barrelled pistol at me.</p>

I was with the last witness at Blithborough; I know the prisoner at the bar very well; I have known him ever since the year 1797; he came up in a cart, and there were a number of men in another cart; some had the appearance of landsmen, and some sailors; we had found the goods before they came up; we made a regular seizure of them; I am sure the prisoner was one of the men; he had a slop on; we had a scuffle for half an hour, and they rescued the goods from us; the prisoner was in one of the first carts that came up; three other carts came up upon us, and fixed us against the railing of Lord Rous's park, and he said, with an oath, "We have fixed you;" we drew our sabres, and forced our way out; I have not the least doubt that he is the man; I met him once since, going from Snape to Yoxford; but I had not the writ with me, and therefore I had no business with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Having no doubt of him, you never can have been in his company without recognizing him? - A. I never was, except at Bow-street, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen him in a party of fourteen or fifteen people, and sat down and drank with him you must have known him again as you knew him so perfectly? - A. I don't know, they wear so many different dresses.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he was not disguised, could you have been in his company for two hours together, and not have known him? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge any other person with being the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stop some other person on the road and charge him with being the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not with Burdett when he charged Woolner with being the man? - A. No; I came up after him, and heard him say, I beg your pardon, Sir; but what had passed before I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take Woolner to a public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. MAYOW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. You see the prisoner now, was he dressed in the same smart way when he was apprehended? - A. When I saw him at Bow-street, he was in a very dirty sailor's dress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you know how long he had been in custody? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was an officer of Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Gooch? - A. Yes; he is an officer of the Customs, and Mr. Burdett is an officer of the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they knew him or not? - A. I know they have not known him; one night Gooch and Burden called me up at my house, near Orford, in the county of Suffolk; I dressed myself, and came down; they asked me if I knew a man of the name of Little Dick; I told them, yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mean the prisoner? - A. Yes, that identical man; they said they wanted to take a man of the name of Little Dick, but they did not know him; I asked what they wanted, and they said there was a reward of fifty pounds from the Revenue to take him, because he was supposed to be of a party that rescued some goods; I told them I would assist in taking him, but they said positively they did not know him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney-General. Q. For what fraud upon the Revenue were you dismissed from the office of Excise? - A. The Revenue were not defranded by me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what was the gross fraud for which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150027"/>you were dismissed their service? - A. I received a fine of the Revenue, and did not return it in due time, but the Revenue had their part, and I lost mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you received twenty-five pounds, as a fine, which you ought to have accounted for, and which you did not account for? - A. They had their due.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Burdett.) Q. Did you tell Thompson you did not know the person of Little Dick? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Gooch. What he has said is perfectly false.(A hand-bill, offering a reward of fifty pounds, read.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a farmer at Sternfield, in Suffolk, near Saxmundham.</p>
               <p>Q. At the close of 1797, do you remember seeing Burdett and Gooch? - A. Yes, by Little Glenham; there was one man on horseback, and two in a cart; Burdett I think accosted me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him? - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure, or do you speak doubtfully? - A. This is the man, certainly; he jumped out of his cart, and seized the reins of my horse; he said, d-n you, I have taken you now; I said, I see you have, but I don't know what authority you can have for doing it; he said, yes, he had; he then said, I think your name is Harnell; I told him I could not think what he meant by stopping me; he said, I think your name is Little Dick; upon which I said, you are near enough; they looked at each other, and hesitated some time, and then said, I believe we are mistaken; they stopped me, I suppose, about five minutes; Gooch was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they let you go as soon as they found their mistake? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. How soon afterwards did you see Little Dick? - A. I never spoke to him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that you saw him afterwards? - A. I dare say it was half a year before I saw him, to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the third man, who was on horseback before those who were in the cart, say something to you, or do something? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a third person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. The 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Burdett. It was Bird that got out of the cart, as Gooch can certify, I did not get out of the cart at all; Gooch was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Gooch. Burdett never got out of the cart at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep the Halberd public-house, at Ipswich: On the 20th of September, 1799, Harnell came to my house, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and stopped the whole day; and between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, Burdett and Gooch came in; Harnell was dressed in a coat very much like the one that he has on now, he was not at all disguised; I was smoaking my pipe with Harnell, when Burdett and Gooch came in; they sat within three or four feet of him, right opposite to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Must they have seen him; therefore? - A. They must have seen him; they did not change any discourse with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say directly, you are Little Dick; you were guilty of obstruction us, or any thing of that sort? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. And you verily believe they did not know him? - A. They did not appear to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your company? - A. An hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney-General. (To Burdett.) Q. Were you at the house of that man on the 20th of September, 1799? - A. I was taking a man to jail, and I went to this man's house; I had a writ against a man that used his house, of the name of Edwards; I went in with Mr. Norman; I was not there five minutes; we had but one pint of beer, and we left some of that; Mr. Gooch was not with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person there in the dress of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did not observe any such person; I afterwards did arrest Edwards at his house.</p>


               <p>Q. Was Gooch ever with you at his house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You went there to look for somebody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you looked at the faces of every body in the room? - A. Yes; I looked into all the rooms.</p>
               <p>Gooch. I was there once about five minutes with Mr. Burdett, but that was in July; this house is notorious for the resort of smugglers; this gentleman is called the Telegraph. <rs id="t18010415-39-verdict207" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that no other persons have not the same sort of wool? - A. It is what we call prime wool, from different sorts of sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. South Down? - A. None South Downs; that makes me so perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this wool drest, or undress? - A. Drest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the same man who drest that wool, had not drest wool for other persons? - A. Yes, I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person? - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner is the only person in the world who has the skill to dress wool in that way? - A. No; there are many men, I dare say, that dress wool in that way; this was a sort that no sorters ever send out in that way; it was all the best of the choice lot that goes into the Prime, that makes me so positive.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that he never dressed any wool for himself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know? - A. I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you access to other woolstaplers? - A. Yes, a great many; and we can hardly find any sorts that are just like ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body with whom he worked before would dress like him? - A. Very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear that on that day there was any deficiency? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>- DAVIES sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the wool); I took it from the breeches of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swaine. This is the sort of wool that I lost.</p>

On the 16th of August, I received it from the Cashier's office; I then traced the note; I observed the prisoner's name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that to be the note which was upon your counter? - A. Yes, I did; there was my own hand-writing upon it; I have had the note ever since; I got it from the Bank. (Produces it.)</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. North, Hoare, Nanson, and Simpson, grocers in Fleet-street; in the month of August last, Mr. Wood came to our house to enquire of whom we had taken a ten-pound note, which he then produced; the note was examined, and it appeared that I had taken it of the prisoner at the bar, on the 29th of April last; I particularly remembered, and do now remember, the prisoner coming to our house; I knew him personally, but did not recollect his name; he came in the forenoon; I asked him his name, and where of, meaning of what place; he told me his name, which I wrote upon it - Mr. Brough, of the Leverian Museum, Blackfriars-bridge; after he was gone, I recollect writing the word "over," over Blackfriars-bridge; I think he said, near Blackfriars-bridge; this is the same note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You conceived him to be a respectable person, and therefore you readily took it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe you have not put the day that you received it, upon the note? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not see it? - A. Yes, there is 29. 4, which signifies the 29th of the 4th month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Wood). Q. What time in the day did you lose your note? - A. About nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I searched the prisoner's house in Union-street, close to the prosecutor's; I found a box and an adze, marked with nearly the same colour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Berger.) Q. Don't you know that another man of your's lived in the same house? - A. The prisoner said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a man of the name of John that worked for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not lodge in the same house? - A. I don't think he lodged there when Watkins did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not gone out of the way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been into the jail to see the prisoner? - A. Yes; he sent for me to open his heart, and when I got there he had nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him you could not swear to the colours? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man of the name of John, who worked for Mr. Berger, lived in the house, and I found them there; Mr. Berger came into the jail, and said, before one of the turnkeys, that he could not swear to the colours.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 31st of March, did you take any particular notice whether the evening before the windows were broke? - A. I believe all was safe, but I cannot speak positively; about three o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by three or four watchmen ringing the bell; I got up and went into the gallery, and missed the dial; I then went into the meeting, and missed a woolen cloth, and several books.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am servant to Mr. Bingess, a cowkeeper, at Stepney, about a furlong from the meeting; I heard a noise, I looked out at the window, and saw three men come with parcels upon their backs, and deposit them in a little shed upon my master's premises; they came the back way from the meeting-house; as soon as they were gone, I went out, and found books wrapped up in a woolen cloth, and a parcel tied up in a handkerchief; I then alarmed the watchman, and came again to the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation of their persons? - A. Yes; I knew the prisoner perfectly well, it was a moonlight night; when I came back to the spot, I observed the things still there; I then went for some more watchmen, and when I came back, I found the prisoner in custody, I am certain he is the man; he was dressed in soldier's clothes, and had a light-coloured coat over his regimentals; I assisted in taking him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Ellwood.) Q. Did you observe how they got in? - A. They got in at the casementwindow of the meeting-house, by breaking it off.</p>

Yes; the back of it comes into Gray's-inn-lane; he had a bag upon his shoulder; I stopped him and found it was lead; it had the appearance of being fresh cut; he said he had found it in the ruins in Gray's-inn-lane; I then took him into custody.</p>

             sworn. I came up and saw the bag lying at the prisoner's feet; it contained lead which appeared to have been fresh cut; Smith had hold of him; I went the next day to the pavilion with a plumber's man, and it fitted the place exactly, and the nail holes matched.</p>
               <p>- MORRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a gardener belonging to the Society of Gray's-inn; I missed the lead from the pavilion; I saw it compared, and in some places it fitted exactly, in other parts the wood work was rotten, and the nails broke, and it would not sit there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Gray's-inn-lane; I wanted to do a job for myself, and I turned in by the ruins, where I saw this bag lying in a corner.</p>
               <p>Morris. When I locked up the gate the evening before it was all safe, and when I opened the gate on Saturday morning, it was all stripped off.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know there is a reward of 40l. for each of these persons, if they are convicted? - A. I have heard as much, but I don't know it.</p>

             sworn. - On the 9th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, as I was returning out of the City, I met the two prisoners in the same street that the Royal Exchange is in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean Cornhill? - A. Yes; knowing Griffiths before, he shook hands with me; I told him he had met me at a wrong time, as I had no money in my pocket to ask him to drink, as I would wish; we went into a public-house and had a pot of beer, and a paper of tobacco; we stopped there two hours, and then Griffiths told me of one Gearing, and he went out to fetch him; I asked Hopkins if he was a <rs id="t18010415-64-deflabel362" type="occupation">lighterman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you partake of the gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was a little in liquor; we all four of us went out of the house together, I paid what little money, I had as part of the reckoning; when we got out, one of them, I cannot say which, called a coach, and we all got in, but where the coachman was ordered to drive to I don't know;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150042"/>Griffiths sat opposite me on the starboard side of the coach; the coach stopped, and they had half a pint of gin more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you partake of that too? - A. I cannot recollect; the coach went on, and in Holborn Griffiths seized upon me all at once, and got hold of the chain of my watch; I called to the coachman to stop two or three times, and then he caught hold of me by the throat, and held me there while Hopkins and Gearing took my property; they took a silver watch, a silver chain, a gold and a silver ring, a silver key and seal, a pair of silver buckles, one of my shoes, and my hat; Hopkins and Gearing jumped out of the coach, and the coachman detected Griffiths before he could get away; they cut away the waistband of my trowsers with a knife, but I cannot tell who it was that cut them; an officer belonging to Whitechapel came by at the same time, and made him get into the coach again, and then we went to Hatton-garden office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were not very drunk when you came out of the public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Only half and half? - A. No, I was not half and half.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no money? - A. I had little or no money when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. As we are upon the subject of money, did you ever hear of a forty pounds reward? - A. Yes; but I don't look upon that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very drunk at last, after drinking the gin? - A. No; I was not so drunk but I knew what I was doing; I went the next evening, and found out the house again, to look for Gearing, and there we heard of him; he was taken up the same night, and admitted an evidence.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coachman: I was called off the rank in Gracechurch-street, about half past seven o'clock in the evening; Griffiths asked me what they should give me to drive them to Wells-street, Oxford-road; I told them three shillings; then they told me to drive them an eighteen-penny fare towards there; going through Lombard-street, they ordered me to stop at the first public-house, and call for a pint of gin; I stopped at the Queen's-arms, in Cheapside; then I kept on, and when they got the other side of <placeName id="t18010415-64-crimeloc363">Grays-Inn-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. How came you to stop the third man? - A. Jumping out in that way, I thought they were going to leave a drunken man in the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. They were all very drunk, were they not? - A. I don't know; the waterman let them into the coach, I did not see any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sampson drunk? - A. I cannot say; after I had stopped Griffiths, I found Sampson almost throttled in the coach.</p>

             sworn. - On the 9th of March, in the evening, I was coming down Holborn, the coachman had the prisoner Griffiths in custody; I enquired what was the matter; I told them I was an officer, and I took charge of him; I put him into the coach, and took him to Hatton Garden office; going along, he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and put his hand underneath him as he sat in the coach; I immediately caught him by the hand; when I got to Hatton-Garden, I got a light, and searched under where he had sat; I found this piece cut out of the waistband of the sailor's trowsers, and a seal, he said he had lost a seal with a Fox upon it, which this has; I searched the prisoner, but found nothing more upon him; I matched this piece with the trowsers, and it exactly fitted, it appears to have been cut with a knife, or some sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you apprehend the other prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor appear drunk or sober? - A. When I first spoke to him; I thought he was very much flurried, and when I got to Hatton-Garden, he appeared quite sensible.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Recollect, if you say a syllable that is false, you forfeit all pretensions to that mercy that you have received? - A. I will take care to speak the truth; I am a carpenter and box-maker, I work in Finch-lane; I was going to carry a box home, and in Cornhill I met Griffiths; he asked me if I could tell him of a job, I told him, I had a brother better acquainted with the business, and I would ask him when he left work; I went with him to a public-house in Bell-yard, or Bell-court, Gracechurch-street, we had a pot of beer and some bread and cheese; I agreed to meet him there again when I had done work, and about a quarter past six he came to the shop where I work, he told me Sampson was at the public-house just by, and would he glad to see me; I knew Sampson before; I went with him to the public-house, and there was Sampson and Hopkins; I had never seen Hopkins before to the best of my knowledge; we had some gin, I cannot say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150043"/>how much, I paid for one half-pint, I think there were three or four half-pints of gin, and some beer, but I don't know how much; while we were there, I asked Griffiths if he meant to go over to my brother's, to enquire for work, he said he did not mean to go that night, he had borrowed some money of his friend, that was Hopkins; he said, Sampson talked of going home, and he had borrowed money for a coach; I don't know who proposed having a coach; I told him I had a relation at the other end of the town, and I would accompany Sampson to Soho-square; they seemed to be all very agreeable to go together, and Griffiths ordered a coach; Sampson, Hopkins, and I, got into the coach, and Griffiths settled with the man where to drive us to; we went down Lombard-street, and after we had gone some distance we stopped and had some gin; we went on again, and I observed Griffiths and Hopkins whispering together; Griffiths then struck Sampson, and the other seized him; I cannot tell what they did, for the blinds were up; I asked what was the matter; one of them said, you shall soon know what is the matter, or we shall soon know what is the matter, I don't know which, and immediately the door was opened, and I was pushed out; I ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your running? - A. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nothing that was done to Sampson? - A. No; they were both upon the top of him, or nearly upon the top of him; I could not see what they did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You paid for one half pint of gin yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did each of you drink his half pint? - A. We all drank round regularly, as far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the coach when you got out? - A. I believe somewhere about Middle-row.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make use of any expressions when you got out of the coach? - A. I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say come along you b-rs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not use the word brush? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took to your heels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had done nothing, what did you run for? - A. I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that by giving your evidence today you would save yourself from being tried? - A. The gentlemen told me so.</p>

               <p>Q. At this time a great part of the audience had come away? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- STONE sworn. - I am constable of the parish of West Drayton; On the 13th of March William Batt appled to me; the prisoner was cutting chaff in my barn, near the cart; I searched my own barn, while he was gone to get some beer, and found two bushels and a half of oats in a sack; I immediately went to Batt, to let him know I had found them; after Grover had locked the barn up, and left work, between seven and eight o'clock, Mr. Batt came to examine the oats, and see if they were the same; he said, they were his oats, and likewise the sack; about ten o'clock at night, Batt's brother locked me and his brother into the barn, and went away; while we were locked in the barn, about a quarter before twelve, Grover, the prisoner, came, and tried with a key; after that he hit eight or ten very had knocks against the door, and it opened; he then came into the barn, took the oats upon his back, and just as he had got into the road, I got over the barn lift after him, and immediately collared him; he then threw the oats down, and immediately resigned himself up to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You know nothing of their being taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who the person was that took the oats, you cannot pretend to say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He might be only the receiver, for any thing you know? - A. I told him, if he would tell me if any body had played the rogue with the oats, I would give him five pounds.(The sack was identified by the prosecutor).</p>

(Produces the handkerchiefs).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Might you not have lost your handkerchiefs before you had got through Temple-bar? - A. It is scarcely possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say he had picked them up in the street? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character. <rs id="t18010415-71-verdict404" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I was employed as a watchman by night, and a labourer by day, at Barr's wharf; it is called Simmons's wharf; Gehan worked with me; we were employed in changing sugar out of cases into puncheons.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were doing that were there any other vessels prepared by Perry? - A. Yes; four puncheons, one tierce, one barrel, and one hogshead; Perry was the foreman of the wharf; I got orders and the worst was put into the puncheons for the merchants, and the best for themselves; they were neither scrapings nor sweepings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what words was that order given? - A. To fill those casks with the best when a good case came; it was put into place by itself in the fallow warehouse, and instead of putting that into the hogsheads for the merchants, it was put into the puncheons; they would sometimes throw the merchant in an odd shovel full of the best, and take the rest themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. In this way how much was carried away? - A. Four puncheons, one tierce, one barrel, and one hogshead; I helped to roll them down through the master's yard, through the private yard of Mr. Barr's house; it was eight days before we had completed it; I had nothing besides my wages, which was eighteen-pence a day, except I used to get an odd drink of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. In the conveyance of the sugar you are now speaking of, did it run at all? - A.

               <p>Q. Perry has been convicted, and Haynes has fled? - A. Yes; I went to Mr. Wackerbarth's, he was not at home; I spoke to the clerk first, and then Mr. Wackerbarth came in; I told him I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150049"/>come from Barr's wharf for the payment of two puncheons of sugar; Mr. Wackerbarth applied to his clerk to know what quantity, and what sum; the clerk told him, and then he wrote a check.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. That is the same check.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you make out your bill of parcels? - A. Messrs. G. Wackerbarth and Co. to the clerks of Simmons's wharf, two puncheons of sugar; I do not recollect the exact weight, but to the best of my recollection, it was 18 cwt. at 38s. amounting to 34l. 6s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the cash upon that check? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your share of the plunder? - A. Fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive from the other house? - A. Haynes received 60l. it was divided between the clerks of Barr's wharf, Haynes, the King's locker, and the coopers.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of Havannah sugar in the month of July? - A. Havannah sugar in the month of July was worth from 70 to 86s. per cwt. without the duty; I believe the duty is 37s. or therabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Havannah sugar is a particular kind of sugar? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Havannah sugar, after it has been damaged by sea-water, distinguishable from sugar of our own colonial produce? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose that which went to Mr. Wackerbarth's to be the best and brightest, what was it worth? - A. The best of it, in the month of July, was worth 86s.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you know, by having sold some? -Yes.</p>
               <p>You sold the damaged sugar which was sent to the merchants? - A. Yes; and that brought from 74 to 88s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Including the duty? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, - I leave my case to my Cousel, and all mintue observations upon the Crown's evidence, as well as that which I shall offer in my defence to your Londship's humane consideration, in stating it ot the Jury hereafter; I have only a few observations to make upon that part of the proof that applies to me, for as to all that part of it which establishes the guilt of the seller, I am not interested in resisting it, and feel as much regret and indignation upon the subject, as can possibly be felt by the Court. The case, as far as I am affected by the evidence, is shortly this: The clerks at the wharfs have been accustomed to receive, as a perquisite, the drainings and sweepings of the sugar, and there is no evidence whatever of any previous knowledge on my part, or of any of my servants, of the condition of this cargo of sugar, or of the frauds practised upon the wharf, regarding it; I was wholly ignorant, until Hort, the witness, came for the money in payment for it; I referred therefore to Mr. Beaumont for the quality and amount of the sugar, which I had neither seen nor contracted for; the bill of parcels was "to the clerks of Simmons; wharf;" and having nothing to conceal, or any management to practice, instead of paying in money which common sense would have dictated, it I had considered the transaction as dishonest, or irregular, I made it payable by a draft upon my banker; and so wholly unconscious was I of guilt or dishonour, that even when the fraud of the seller was detected, and I was before the Magistrates, I spontaneously produced the check, and delivered it into their possession. This is the whole of the transaction which could have been proved by Beaumont, who is since dead; I regret that Divine Providence had deprived me of testimony so important, but I declare most solemnly, in the presence of God, that I had given him no instructions, directly or indirectly, respecting this sugar; that I had no concern in the contract till Hort applied for the money, and no knowledge of any such sugar till I paid for it, when I referred to Beaumont for the price and quantity, and drew the check. This transaction took place in the middle of July, and the sugar, which I never saw, was taken to the scum-house, and worked up in the ordinary course of business; it was not till two months afterwards that the frauds were detected, and it was then im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150050"/>possible to appeal to the quality. I am not, however, without the means of repelling the evidence of Gehan and Murphy; their account of the sugar is inconsistent with the account given by the carman who carried it, as to the quality and value; and it will appear, by the evidence of several intelligent witnesses who were employed in working it, to be a mixture of sugar, water, and flush, and smelling strongly of far; that it was not worth more than the money given for it; that it failed even in the process of converting it into bastard-sugar, and was only sit to be made into treacle in the scum house; surely this ought to outweigh the evidence of two men who are accomplices in the original guilt. This is all which it is necessary for me to state, to lead your attention to the evidence, as I am affected by it, and I ask no more. I take as strong an interest as any man can do, in the protection of the trade of this great City, from the innumerable frauds it is subject to; and strongly, as I contend my innocence, and feel the humiliation of so public an appearance at this bar, I bear it with chearfulness, when I recollect the advantage that will be derived to the merchants, in exposing the frauds that are practised, and by which many men may be circumstanced, as I am, when even by accident, or misfortune, or, at the very worst, the incaution of his servant, he may be involved in the appearance of guilt. I am far removed, by my situation in life, from the temptation to commit the crime with which I am charged. Had the evidence brought against me been positive and unsuspected, I could not have appealed to situation and character; but, in a case like the present, when guilt is only to be established by inference, I am persuaded the justice of the Court, and even the candour and humanity of the Counsel for the prosecution, will concur in the testimony of the most honorable men well acquainted with trade. I trust, that I shall not only be acquitted by your verdict, but that my character will be delivered from suspicion.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Murphy.) Q. Was there not a great quantity of far in the warehouse? - A. There was some all about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was there any in the fallow warehouse? - A. No; there was some at the door over which they were rolled, but to prevent its touching, they put down some of the broken cases to roll it over.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. I am a wharfinger, and have been fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is the practice with respect to the drainings of sugar? - A. The sweepings and the drainings of the sugar upon the wharf are allowed to the wharfinger, or any person he shall appoint to sell them, for the purpose of keeping the warehouses clean; that is a resolution of the West-India merchants, and a practice known to all who are interested in the commodity; the wharfinger is to dispose of the sweepings and drainings if he pleases, or he may give them to his clerk in order to keep the warehouses clean; if that was not to be done the warehouses would be knee deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Are these warehouses, which you say but for this would be knee deep, your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the persons employed in them are your servants? - A. They are gangsmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Employed by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For which you are reimbursed by a small profit from the merchant? - A. No; the gangsmen are appointed by the wharfinger to superintend that part of the business, and they have the porterage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which they have from the merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of a wharfinger's clerk's place? - A. I don't know; if it was a considerable matter, I should think the wharfinger would take it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it understood that the price which the west-India merchant pays to his wharfinger includes an obligation to superintend the business, or is it a sinecure? - A. Certainly to superintend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a part of the perquisite of sweepings and scrapings, to prevent its being knee deep, to take three parts of a hogshead. - Is that the course of the trade known and approved by the whole body of West-India merchants? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was, the West-India merchants must be the greatest fools that ever lived. - I take it, the scrapings are small quantities of droppings from the bulk of the commodity? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever occur under your eye, as a wharfinger of reputation, as I know you are, to see your labourers taking out the best of the commodity for their own perquisite, and leaving the flush only for the merchant? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a sort of thing which falls within the description of perquisite? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know perquisites to the clerk amount to eight tons and a half of the best and brightest? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a thing did occur, should you not think it a most nefarious thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it frequently happen, in the management of one ship's cargo, that there shall be sent out from your wharf four puncheons, one barrel, one hogshead, and one tierce, as perquisites of sweepings and scrapings? - A. Certainly not; if it had I should have paid for it as a wharfinger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. Though a ship's cargo could not have scrapings to such an amount as these wicked men have taken, might not such a quantity as two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150051"/>puncheons be accumulated, not from one ship's cargo, but from many, so as to be sold as drainings and scrapings? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, supposing me to be a scum-boiler, and I, not knowing where it came from, might have purchased fairly and honestly to such an amount? - A. Yes, and more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. If it is collected fairly, some today, some to-morrow, some next week, and from different cargoes, will it be all bright, and of the same quality? - A. I know nothing of Havannah sugars.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Havannah sugar so common a commodity in the market, as that in a short space of time it would be probable that sair scrapings and sweepings would amount to two puncheons? - A. It depends upon quantity.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By management, or rather mismanagement, may not scrapings and sweepings be increased? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you mean to say, from the quantity of Havannah sugar imported into this country, which is comparatively small, there would probably be an accumulation of two hogsheads as a perquisite? - A. If the cargo came in damaged, I don't know what it might do, it depends upon the quality of the goods; I have known a hogshead pass the scale that has run a pail-full.</p>
               <p>Q. We know that this is not like the ordinary colonial produce, it can only come here in one of two ways, either as prize, or by misfortune, under the King's key; I ask then, is it likely that such a quantity should be accumulated from any one ship's cargo, to any wharfinger's clerk? - A. It certainly would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. Considering the quantity that might run from damaged sugar, or the scrapings and drainings from damaged sugar, if two puncheons were brought to a scum-boiler by the clerks of a wharf, is it a quantity so unlikely to arise from such a cause that the man must immediately see it was not scrapings and sweepings? - A. No; the quantity is not enormous.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Is it a part of the custom to make no enquiries? - A. I never sold any, and therefore I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this molasses and scrapings worth thirty-eight shillings - upon your oath, is it worth more than fourteen shillings? - A. I can mention one circumstance - last year a hogshead of sugar fell into the water, and was with great difficulty saved; it was taken up upon a tarpaulin, Mr. Wackerbarth bought it, and gave forty shillings for it; it was worth seventy or eighty shillings before it fell into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to see how far the water had penetrated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Thames water is very different from the North Foreland, I fancy, - supposing it to be fair scrapings, reduced to molasses by sea-water, observe, mixed with tar, and running about in the cart, do you mean to represent, that thirty-eight shillings is any thing about the price? - A. I would answer the question if it was in my power, but I really don't know sugars at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. - (To Hort.) Q. Have you, upon any occasion besides this, had dealings with Mr. Wackerbarth for fair scrapings? - A. Yes, drainings and scrapings, two puncheons, he gave me fourteen shillings per hundred weight; it was very dirty, scraped off the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, which was the best of the two? - A. The Havanah sagar,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever before get, for any scrapings, thirty-eight shillings? - A. No.</p>

Yes; I remember, in July last, Mr. Cleaver's cart coming from simmons's wharf with two puncheons, Mr. Beaumont, the clerk, was there, he is now dead; Mr. Beaumont took the bung out, and looked at them, he put a stick in and examined it all over; some of the stuff worked out upon the floor, it was in a liquid state; I examined it, it contained water, dirt, and sugar, mixed together, and a very strong smell of tar; I sent it to the scum-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been employed in this trade? - A. For thirty years; it was more than a fortnight working up in the scum-house; but I took very little notice of it after it first came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I have got some of this to sell, will you give me thirty-eight shillings for it. - I should drive a hard bargain with you, should not I? - A. At that time it was not worth so much.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of bastard sugars at that time; if they were good bastards, after a fortnights labour, would they not sell at four pounds the hundred weight? - A. Yes; but there is a great deal of waste.</p>

               <p>Q. When it was craned up, did you see what it was? - A. No, not till it came down again; it did not suit to make any thing more of it than molasses, and it was sent down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to work any part of it into bastard sugar? - A. Yes, but it did not succeed; it looked a little better than common scrapings, but it smelt of tar.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was it better? - A. There was a little more sugar in it than there is in the ordinary scrapings; there was no dry sugar in it though at all.</p>

               <p>Lord Kenyon. All the evidence that presses against this gentleman is, that seeing the bill of parcels describing it to be so much the hundred weight, he gave a check upon his banker for the amount; I do not say it is not evidence to have some weight, but it is not that forcible evidence, that if it came without other evidence to support it I should much have pressed upon a Jury. The prosecution is as fit an one as ever was instituted, the safety of the merchants of London seems to me to be involved under the protection which the law holds out to them, by subjecting people who do wrong to prosecutions. I confess it appears to me, that neither the wharfingers, or any body employed for the wharfingers, care one single farthing whether the property is protected or not; instead of protecting it, they hold out hires and temptations to plunder, to those who ought to protect. I put one question to Mr. Ogle, whether management, or rather mismanagement, might not increase the perquisite? Oh, undoubtedly it may. So thus, the very persons who have the care of the property have every temptation, and find it their own interest to neglect their duty to the public, and this the wharfinger ( I don,t know the gentleman, I dare say he is a good man upon the Exchange of London) says, without the least hesitation, as if it was right; I confess I do not think it right, it is shameful, scandalous, and infamous. I could hardly believe there might not be some little exaggeration in the accounts which the West-India merchants have given of the unprotected state in which they are, but I am ready to believe it now up to that extent; I only mention this, because I think the cause is of the very last importance. Upon the question whether the sugar was stolen or not, the Jury, in Surry, have decided; but they have not decided that point so that it might not be enquired into here; and God forbid it should, when another person's guilt, or innocence, is to be enquired of. I certainly agree with the verdict given by the Jury in Surry, but the present enquiry, with respect to the prisoner at the bar, is of a different nature; I was ready to make an observation or two, when the evidence for the prosecution closed, but I reviewed my notes, and put my own judgement, to try it again in my own breast; I thought, upon the whole, it would be fit to go further, and see upon what ground character should put this case, for this is a case in which, of all others, character is the most momentous - in a doubtful case. I was you to shew, that this gentleman was present at the contract which Beaumont made; for though in civil contracts the principal is bound by the act of his agent, yet an agent cannot transfer the criminality of an act so as to make the principal answerable for that criminality if he has no part or share in it. god forbid that any thing I say should reflect upon the character of this gentleman, but it seems to me that the whole evidence resolves itself to this must it be so apparent to this gentleman, as a man of business, that these sugars, or whatever they might be, must be worth so much more than the thirty-eight shillings, that it must carry demonstration home to his mind that they could not have been fairly come by? - I cannot feel my mind verging toward an assent to that proposition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Certainly every purpose for which this prosecution was instituted, with respect to this gentleman, is already answered; I mean to state in the outset, that his character, up to this time, had been as irreproachable as it could possibly be. The business of to-day, I am perfectly satisfied, must be of some value to the West-India merchants; it will be their own faults if it is not.</p>
               <p>Lord Kenyon. When there is a something in either<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150053"/>scale, and the matter is doubtful, character is to be thrown in; character is then of more use than any quantity of pounds, shillings, and pence, that can be produced against him. I know nothing of the gentleman at the bar, but this I know, if a man of fortune does offend, it is much fitter that he should be picked out as a subject of prosecution, he having no temptation, from the pressure of the times, deserves punishment much more than when the assent to a wicked act is given by a poor person; the example of the punishment of one man of fortune, will do infinitely more good to society, than millions of the poor wretches who are crawling about the streets in wretchedness and beggary. I ought not to conclude without bearing testimony, that this person is not reached by the evidence that has been given, and that his character will, in my opinion, if you find him not guilty, go from hence unstained. <rs id="t18010415-74-verdict418" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did you pay him any thing in the course of that month? - A. No, I did not; I paid him 20l. some day in February, but I cannot say what day; and on the 13th of March I paid the prisoner 8l. in penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of the 31l. that you owed Mr. Burks you have paid 28l.? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Can you now state positively that there is a deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Magistrate you could not? - A. There is a deficiency now of 12s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there is now a deficiency of 8l.? - A. I mean to say there was a deficiency of 8l. from Friday, the 13th of March, till Monday, the 16th; there was no entry at all on the 13th; I made an entry on the 16th of 7l. 8s. which was the money he received; Martin, the carman, then brought 7l. 8s. before I came home on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you now then speak with positiveness of there being a deficiency of 12s.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to say positively that the prisoner has brought no more money to account? - A. No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are perfectly sure there is now 12s. deficient? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Murray.) Q. When you paid the 8l. the prisoner and Martin were in company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were put into the cart, of which Martin was the carman? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Burks.) Q. When the prisoner had made an entry of 10l. copper money received from Murray on the 26th of January, did not you find that you had 10l. less than you ought to have? - A. No; that 10l. was entered, "Mr. Murray, copper," only, the figures 10l. were not entered then; it was entered between the 26th of January and 13th of March; the entry Mr. Murray, copper, signified, that next time he went that way he was to call for copper; I do not know when the 10l. was entered; it was after the prisoner had been charged before I observed it; I am sure it was not there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you cast up your books? - A. That was lest to Bligh, he had the management of all the books, he was in-door clerk; he discharged the ledger from that cash-book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When you charged the prisoner with this, you took him up? - A. I took him up before he was charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after he was taken up, he had no access to that book? - A. No; here is another book,(producing it); here is "Murray, 20l." and then there is a leaf torn out, and upon that leaf, I remember seeing it wrote, "call at Mr. Murray's for ten pounds worth of copper," that was wrote by syset, the collecting clerk; that ten pounds were never received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who was the little book kept by principally? - A. Kept by the prisoner to discharge it; this is the in-door clerk's book, but when the out-door clerk went out, he always took it in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. And you said, if they would not charge you with it, you would tell of Bligh? - A. I was not charged with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be taken up then, and sent to Clerkenwell? - A. I was taken up upon suspicion of breaking open my master's desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the man that brought the money home, and we have only your word for all this conversation with Bligh? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, upon being taken up for breaking open your master's desk, did you not say, if they would not prosecute you for that, you would accuse Bligh of having advised you to take these halspence? - A. They did not say any such thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you yourself did not make the offer of accusing Bligh, if your master would not prosecute you? - A. I never touched the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you that; were you not under some degree of alarm at being taken up and sent to prison? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long has the prisoner lived with you? - A. The beginning, of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not foolish enough to take a person into a confidential situation, without a character? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. Steele.</p>
               <p>Q. The house was preparing for you and your partner to go into business? - A. Yes, but the premises are my property; I did not take any partner till the 3d of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the property of that house belonging to the partnership account? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the weights were concealed? - A. I believe they were concealed from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not live in the house, did you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had the care of the property in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These weights were concealed between the bed and the sacking, were they not? - A. No, they were upon a shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. These sash-weights were fixed to the freehold? - A. They were taken down by the carpenters.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever asked him for these weights? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in custody before you thought fit to charge him with this? - A. He was taken up on the Friday, I cannot say exactly, but I think it was about a week.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not send for you to give him a character before the Lord-Mayor? - A. He told the Lord-Mayor that his master would give him a character, and at that time I had discovered the weights in his closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not solicit him to go for an East-India soldier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was it not upon his refusal to go for an East-India soldier, that you thought proper to charge him with felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he prevented the carpenters from taking away what they called chips, but which he called pieces of wood, of your property? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that in consequence of that, they charged him with stealing this apron? - A. He said so.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of William Lovemore: On Monday, the 16th of March, I lost these things from my lodgings; I had seen them about two or three hours before they were taken; I saw them at twelve o'clock, and missed them about three; the prisoner was a stranger to me; I saw the property at the pawnbroker's the next morning; the prisoner was then in custody, and as soon as he saw me he begged for mercy, and said he would take the things out of pledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No, I did not; he owned that he went into the room to take them; I received the property from Mr. Perryman. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>- PERRYMAN sworn. - I took in these things from the prisoner on the 16th of March, between one and two o'clock, as near as I can guess; they are pledged in the name of John Jones, No. 5, Hemming's row; the prosecutor lives about four hundred yards from our shop; I am sure the prisoner is the man; Mrs. Lovemore came to me in the evening, and the next morning the prisoner came with a Jew to sell the goods out.(The property was identified by Mrs. Lovemore.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 17th of March I saw a Jew pick up a paper in Hemmings's-row; I asked him what he had found; and he said, a duplicate of a gown, I told the Jew I would buy the gown of him, and I went with him to the pawnbroker's; the pawnbroker said, he believed I was the man, and sent for a constable. <rs id="t18010415-95-verdict535" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. What description of goods were deposited in that warehouse on the 10th of March last? - A. I do not know; I went that day to fetch the prisoner to the Excise-office, in Thames-street, to Mr. Harris, by the order of Mr. Harris, the <rs id="t18010415-104-viclabel591" type="occupation">surveyor</rs>

               <p>Q. Was there any offer of favour, or any threat? - A. None to my knowledge; the pockets were searched, and a quantity of coffee taken out, I dare say there may be five pounds of it; Mr. Harris asked him how he could think of having such a thing as that in his pocket; he said, it was a small quantity for his own use, as he had a few friends coming out of the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner is a locker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duty of a locker, I believe, is to take possession of every thing till it is discharged? - A. Yes, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, he has the possession of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. He is placed there to prevent any frauds? - A. Yes, to see that nothing is taken out without an order signed by the warehouse-keeper.</p>

(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been King's locker? - A. I have been in the Customs altogether twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been dismissed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been suspended? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Griffiths who keeps a wharf near Tooley-street? - A. I know Griffiths's wharf, I was stationed there once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not make a complaint against you? - A. I was cried before the surveyor, and I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, in consequence of that, any dispute or quarrel with the prisoner at the bar? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the prisoner the man who made that charge against you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I ask you, whether or not, in consequence of that complaint, you had no quarrel with the prisoner? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to the prisoner, that in consequence of the accusation made against you, you would bed d-d if you would not be revenged? - A. Never in my life to him, or any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. From your vigilance in rubbing down the man, a man could hardly expect to escape with such a quantity as that? - A. This was too great a bulk to be passed by, there may be small parcels conveyed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for a man to carry out such a parcel as that without being discovered? - A. I think not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. He said, he had always been despited by the trade, and he would have his revenge when he was at the warehouses, at Griffiths's wharf; they could not get any man to work while he staid there, and that was the reason why he was removed to these warehouses.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Court. Prisoner, - I feel it to be my duty to distinguish your case from that of ordinary larcenies, and it is necessary that the public should know why that sentence is passed upon you which I am about to pass. Nothing can create more misery and anguish in the mind of a mother, than to have a child taken from the place it knows; it is therefore not only an act of great injustice, but of great brutality and cruelty; I have, therefore, in every case of this sort, immediately passed a sentence as severe as the law would permit me; I regret that I cannot pass a more severe sentence upon you. If children are taken from their parents by the visitation of Providence, they must submit to that; but if they are in a state of suspence, not knowing whether they are living or dead, and unable to find them, it is the utmost misery that a parent can feel. I therefore pronounce upon you, that you be <rs id="t18010415-112-punish637" type="punishmentDescription">

             Sworn. - I am one of the officers of Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: I went with Brace to Loney's house, opened the door, and found the butter under the table covered over; I asked the prisoner how it came here; he said, some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150073"/>person brought it, and left it there; it is about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This tub of butter was found in my entry, by my children's account, about seven or eight o'clock at night; I went down with the vessel to Gravesend, being in that line; I landed at Bluckwall, and it was eleven o'clock when I got home; my children told me there was a cask in the entry, and butter in it, my wife was out with her friends; I went to bed, and left it in the passage; my wife brought it in when she came home, but I said, for God's sake take and roll it out, or worse will come of it; it remained in by my wife's persuasions, but I left my door open all night, and the man came in the morning; my children had rolled it under the table, the man is here who saw the man take it into the passage; I never was in trouble in my life before, and have lived thirty years on the spot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Every thing that this man told you turned out to be perfectly true? - A. Yes.</p>

I heard a scuffle behind me, I turned round, and saw a man seized, and charged with having picked a gentleman's pocket, but who it was I do not know, I cannot say that it was the prisoner, I only had a glimpse of him; he was taken into custody, and a man held up a book in the crowd, which I thought looked like mine; I knew it to be my property; I was desired by a man to give him my address, which I did; a few days afterwards I received a summons to attend the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. There was a very great crowd about you at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were trying to get into the Exchange, but could not on account of the crowd? - A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Backrow, the constable, that made the charge? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - On the 6th of April, as I was coming past the 'Change, between twelve and one, the blue-coat boys were going to the 'Change, there was a great crowd at the Change gate, and I saw the prisoner and two more, jostling several gentlemen about; two other men stood before the gentleman, and would not let him go by; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, take something out, and put it into the breast of his coat; I hit the gentleman upon the shoulder, and said, sir, you have been robbed; I took hold of the prisoner, and insisted upon seeing what he had got in his bosom; he said, I have got nothing at all, and began to pull himself about, and in pulling about I saw him drop a book from under his coat, upon the ground, it turned out to belong to Mr. Davies, a clergyman, in Surry-street, in the Strand; the Lord-Mayor was obliged to summons him twice before he would appear; there was another person saw him drop it as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before? - A. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never was guilty of the least offence in my life to any fellow-creature: On the 6th of April, Backrow came up to me, d - d my eyes, and said, you are reputed thief and pick-pocket, you know I have had you before; I told him I would satisfy him to the contrary; I said, go with me to Mr. Chadwick's, and mentioned several other names; he would not, but said, no, and at that moment an officer came up; I said, I throw myself under your protection, these men have used me exceedingly ill; he searched me, and said, that young man has nothing about him, let him go, or take him over to Mr. Chadwick's; that boy, I solemnly declare never interfered, nor did I ever see him, till I saw him before the Lord-Mayor.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a dealer in glass, in Coppice-row, Clerkenwell: I have seen the two Backrows since I have been attending here; I asked one of them when he thought the trial would come on, he said, the next day, perhaps; he said it was a great pity the matter should ever have been brought here, for it might have been settled for a very little expence at first; I did not make him any reply.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was that gentleman with his own hair that said that to you? - A. Yes; the other Backrow was standing by his side, and they both said it, upon my oath; I have known the prisoner from a child, he was in the plated line in Coppice-row; he has been my neighbour about two years; I have lived in the parish eight years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150079"/>Q. Is he in partnership with his father? - A. I believe his father's name is to the bills.</p>
               <p>Waterman. He called at my uncle's house, and said, he wished it was all over; he said I was not to take any notice of what the Jews said; my uncle said, he has no right to take any notice of what they said, only to say the truth; I was on the stairs, and heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Pattenden). Q. When was this conversation which the Backrows? - A. On Monday evening, about half past seven o'clock, in the Sessions-house yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew they were witnesses in this cause? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were one of the bail, and had heard them examined before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes; I asked them if they knew when the trail would come on; they said they could not tell, they thought it would the next day; to the best of my recollection, I said it was a great pity a person of character and respectability should be in such a predicament; the reply the short one, Lyon, made, to whom I was speaking, was, that Mr. Lawton acted very foolish, in suffering it to be brought here to this Court, for it might have been settled at first for a little trifle, or a mere trifle; the other was close to him, and he said it might have been settled for a trifle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him how it might be settled? - A. I did not; it struck me at the moment that there could be but one meaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to this young man's uncle, did you or not go to him? - A. On Friday last, I went with Mr. Gilliard, a schoolmaster in Islington-road, in his chaise, to enquire the character of the lad of his master, who, I suppose, is his uncle; but as to the conversation that he has stated, I deny it, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy? - A. No; I went purely to ask the character of the lad; the gentleman that went with me, was to be the spokesman, and he did speak; we found he was a lad of good character; Mr. Gilliard said we did not come to stop any thing from going on, but to ask his character, and that he might not be dictated to by people of bad character.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you any conversation with either of the two Backrows? - A. Not till about half an hour ago; they were taking the boy on one side, and I told them it was very improper; I had no other conversation with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Waterman? - A. Yes; he lives with Ball and Brewen in Leadenhall-street; I went there last Thursday, or Friday, with Mr. Pattenden, I saw the master of the shop; I told him, the person that had been charged with taking the book, was a person of respectability, and wished him to caution the boy to speak nothing but the truth, and that the two men, who were the prosecutors, I had heard, were persons of very indifferent character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is a boy of character or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Messrs. Abbott and Newbury, and eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010415-130-verdict732" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am in the service of Messrs. North and Company: In consequence of information that we received, I marked some stick liquorice; I saw two sticks of stick liquroice, and four bags of stone blue, in Mr. North's stable; Jewell was sent out with his cart: immediately upon his being gone, I went to see if the stick liquorice was there or not, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - A. On the 4th of March, from four to five o'clock; I then followed the prisoner up Ludgate-hill as fast as I could, till I got to <placeName id="t18010415-132-crimeloc738">St. Paul's Church Yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. Has one of those pieces of Spanish juice any mark upon it? - A. Yes; there is an R upon one of them; I asked Brettell how he came by it, and he said Jewell gave it him; I then asked Jewell how he came by it, and he said he had taken it from his master's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garney. Q. What did you say to him before he said that? - A. Nothing more than I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took it out of his master's warehouse, or that he found it in the stable? - A. To the best of my recollection, he positively said he had taken it out of the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who the two men were? - A. Yes; the prisoner, who was the waggoner, was one of them; the other was Mr. Cox's porter; they brought a parcel, and flung it down at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150082"/>tail of the waggon; he took his ladder and let down the tail of the waggon, and Mr. Cox's porter assisted in putting it into the waggon; when the prisoner first came to the waggon, I called out, who is there; he answered, it is I; what have you got, says I; says he, a little cabbage; then I knew his tongue, and said, oh, master waggoner, is it you, how do you do; he said, middling; I said, let it be what cabbage it will, it is heavy cabbage; Mr. Cox's porter said, it is a hundred and a half, I helped him to it, and I am to give him a shilling for carrying it; then they wished me a good night.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Cox; I was sent by him after the Newbury waggon; I overtook it near Slough; the prisoner was driving it; he was in the tail of the waggon; I asked him what he had taken up the over night at the Swan, Holborn-bridge; he hesitated a little and said something, but I do not recollect what.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner know you? - A. Yes; he went on to the Reindeer, at Slough, and I went with him there; I had the indigo taken out and put into another waggon that was coming to town, and had it brought to the Swan, Holborn-bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you come to town with it? - A. No; but I remarked the number, (it is produced); here is a hole in the bag which the prisoner cut when I came up to him, to see what it was; he said he thought it was smuggled tobacco; it turned out to be indigo; he wondered that Cleveland should ask him to put up such an article as that into his waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Cleveland the porter that helped him up with it? - A. No; another porter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Cleveland? - A. He was taken up, and discharged before the Alderman.</p>

               <p>Q. When you overtook the waggon this article was not put under any thing by way of concealment? - A. No, he sat before it, but there was nothing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not immediately tell you he was requested to carry this? - A. Yes: he told me Cleveland had promised him one shillings-worth of something to drink for carrying it. (The property was identified by Mr. Cox.)</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I think it would be too much to convict the prisoner upon this indictment; the charge is not for defrauding his master of the carriage of this parcel; but the question for you to try is, whether the prisoner stole these goods, or whether he merely took it up as cabbage; it will be for you to say, whether it was not the other persons who stole it, and whether he did not carry it merely for the sake of the shilling: if you should be of that opinion, you must acquit him. If the prisoner had disposed of these goods, if they had been in a state of concealment, or if he had denied that he had such goods, the case would have been very different; there was, it is true, a little hesitation; but that might arise from a consciousness of his having taken up goods which ought to have been brought to the master's account. The question therefore for you to decide will be, whether he carried this parcel for the sake of the shilling, or whether he was connected with those porters in taking it away: it does not appear to me upon the whole of this transaction, that you can see your way safely to the conclusion that he was concerned in stealing it. <rs id="t18010415-137-verdict768" type="verdictDescription">

G. on the near side in a circle tarred; I missed it before five o'clock in the morning; I saw it again in the afternoon, at Tomkins's, in Webber-row, Sr. George's Fields; I am sure it was the same sheep I had lost; you go through a shop with a wash-window into a yard, and in that yard I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the yard from the street? - A. Not without the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open when you went? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alteration? - A. The ochre mark down the face appeared to be daubed over with dirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It is not customary for the salesman to go with his drover to market? - A. No; he takes the sheep, and then I go to the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these sheep before they went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150083"/>to the market? - A. I had seen it on the Sunday; it was one of a lot of ten.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not your own marks? - A. No; the mark of my employer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary for you to put a private mark of your own, besides the mark of your employer? - A. Sometimes if there are sheep marked much alike, our men have a private mark of their own to put upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. But these sheep had no private mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear that the dirt on the face was occasioned by design? - A. No, I cannnot.</p>
               <p>Q. Tomkins's is a butcher's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tomkins made no difficulty in telling you he had the sheep? - A. He was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had no difficulty in finding the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the proprietor of these ten sheep? - A. Mr. John Graves, of St. Alban's, grocer and miller.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more than ten with that mark? - A. No; they were all horned sheep, and the rest were all pole sheep; if they had been all horned sheep, I should not have missed it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am drover to Mr. Payne: On Sunday night, the 1st of February, I took his sheep into the pens before eleven o'clock in the evening; there were ten horned sheep among them; they were marked with a round O, and J. G. in it, with tar, and an ochre mark down the forehead; I missed one of the sheep about twelve o'clock at night; I searched about, but could not find it; on Monday afternoon I found the same sheep at Tomkins's, with three others; I am sure it was the same sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you venture, upon your oath, to say, that these ten sheep were ever in Smithfield-market? - A. I cannot say that they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you dare swear you ever saw it in the market? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That one might have been lost before you penned them? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not often happen that a sheep may mingle with another drove? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. And all the diligence and anxiety you can use for your master, cannot prevent it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far had you drove them? - A. From Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not miss it between Islington and Smithfield? - A. No, not till I parted them, and then I missed one.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a master drover; I drove for Mr. Fountain, in Newgate-market: On the 1st of February I was out all night in Smithfield-market; I saw the two prisoners in the market against Mr. Payne's pens; I saw them lurking about the pens, as they always made it a practice of doing; I saw them first between eleven and twelve o'clock; I saw Fossett take a sheep out of Mr. Payne's pen; Hannikin was standing by; it was a horned sheep; they put it into Mr. Boys's pen; they were both together; they turned some more sheep out with it, and drove them down to Durhamyard, Chick-lane; when they had gone a little way, Hannikin said to Fossett, take them to Tomkins's, in Webber-row, and tell him they came from me; I then went and told Mr. Payne's man of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep were there? - A. I think there were about a score.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Don't you know that Fossett is himself a <rs id="t18010415-138-viclabel773" type="occupation">master drover</rs>? - A. He has been a drover some years, and Hannikin is a master drover.</p>
               <p>Q. You are all drovers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked of lurking about the market just now - it was where they ought to be, in the way of their business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never say it was Hannikin, the boy, that lifted the sheep over the pens? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both in the pen? - A. No; Fossett was in the pen, and Hannikin stood outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not see you? - A. No; I was in the pen, doing some business for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You were watching these men then? - A. No, I was doing some business.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed they were going to steal the sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call out to them, and tell them, if they did not desist, you would punish them? - A. I was afraid, I had been threatened so often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Robinson, Mr. Payne's drover, there at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as Robinson returned, you told him what you had seen? - A. I did not see him till the morning, I had to go to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the market immediately after this? - A. As soon as they turned down Chick-lane, I went to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. Half past three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you tell a single creature in the market, though you were in there till half past three o'clock? - A. I told Gordon of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell a single creature of it, till after you came from Holloway? - A. No, I did not see Robinson till after I came back, and then I told him they were gone to Tomkins's.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, have you never said it was Hannikin that lifted the sheep over the pen? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard of a reward of twenty pounds, if these men are convicted? - A. I have not,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150084"/>I did not do it for the reward: I did it to stop such people; I have lost fourteen sheep myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the man? - A. Yes; there were about a score in the drove, and four of them were put into Mr. Tomkins's; there was one horned sheep; it was marked down the face with ochre; I did not observe the other mark; I stopped the sheep for him; I staid there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; Tomkins helped to get them in.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did he go then? - A. He went up Duke-street, which leads to Blackfriar's-bridge, and the Borough, both.</p>

               <p>"Please to send by your man twelve yards of each pattern, hope to be in town in a few days, when I shall call at your house; I want a fine piece of yard-wide Irish, about five shillings a yard, to make the doctor some shirts; you may send a good one by the man now, or omit it till I see you. Don't fail of sending the dimities, as the woman is waiting, till he returns, to cut them out for A. LETTSOM.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant, Caseby? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your house soon after her discharge? - A. Yes; sometime in the month of February, but I am not certain of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house? - A. In Edward-street, Surry-road, Blackfriars; Mrs. Gray let him in; I was in the front parlour; after she let him in, he came into the parlour, I asked him what he wanted; he said he had come on a very unpleasant piece of business; he said he had a warrant for taking Mrs. Gray into custody for shoplifting.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did he produce any authority for so doing? - A. He produced a warrant, and said that was his authority for so doing; he then put the paper into my hand; I told him I believed she was very innocent of the charge; he said, he believed it too, but she must put on her cloaths, and go with him; he then said, he thought he could get her discharged from that warrant, if we would give him something; I asked him what he required; he said, as she was so lately discharged from one prison, in consequence of her having a great family, if I would give him two guineas, he would get the warrant discharged; Caseby and I then left the house, and went towards Guildhall; we went to the <placeName id="t18010415-143-crimeloc793">sign of the Paul's Head, close by Guildhall</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he, either the first or second time, shew you any badge of office? - A. No; when be returned from the Paul's Head, he asked me for the money for getting the name of Mary Gray erased out of the warrant; I gave him a guinea, and told him I would give him the other the first opportunity, then we parted; the next time I saw him, he came over to my house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Yes; I always considered him as an officer of the City of London.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he represent himself? - A. As a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. And he produced no authority, except this bit of paper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You live in Edward-street, Blackfriars-road, do you? - A. No; I did then.</p>

I will tell you, to save you a deal of trouble, for I know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had advice? - A. I have for a considerable time lived very honest and upright - for six or seven years since I have been in England.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence, I suppose, I may conclude you were not perfectly honest before? - A. I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. State, distinctly and loud, what took place? - A. He said he had got a warrant, to take me up; he produced a warrant, which I saw; he said, he brought it to take me before the Lord-Mayor, for shop-lifting. I told him it was a thing I knew nothing at all of, but if he insisted upon it I would go with him; I said I would put on my bonnet and cloak to go; he said it was a very hard case, but he thought it might be settled for a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or Barnesley, say any thing upon that? - A. No; he stopped and had breakfast with us; he then said there was no occasion for me to go, Barnesley and himself could settle it; he said something about two guineas, and, I think, Barnesley gave him a half-guinea then, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any more of the warrant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Are you a married, or a single lady? - A. I live with Mr. Barnesley; and have done for six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that six years, what was your name? - A. Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean a man that we know very well here? - A. I dare say it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean a man who was transported or hung? - A. No; I lived along with
