Hoffmann said, "I am an honest man; I have not done anything," and he suggested that I should go back to France, and that he would find the money to enable me to goâ€”I made up my mind to stop in Englandâ€”if I had known that my bonds had been stolen I should have gone to Franceâ€”I obtained my luggage, and opened my valise in the prisoners presence and two other Frenchmenâ€”I said to the prisoners, "You have not stolen anything"â€”all my papers were thereâ€”neither of these letters dated September 11th and 16th were signed by me or by my authorityâ€”tin's cheque is not endorsed by meâ€”I never saw it till I was at the police court the other dayâ€”I afterwards went to the police.</p>

I have some difficulty in getting the money as the cheque is crossed, but it is only a question of a few hours, and I think I shall be able to get it to-morrow morning. I am writing to my children at the same time as to you to ask them to send me back the receipt for the deeds which I left with them. Immediately I receive it I will return it to you.

I did nothing, nor signed for it"â€”we went to the station, where I showed them the chequeâ€”Consauve, in Hoffmann's hearing, said, "Yes, that is the cheque, and the endorse<lb/>ment on it is mine; I and my friend Hoffmann were in Charlotte Street one day, I don't know the date, and a young man came to us and asked us if we would do him a service; he then took us to a bank in the City, but before going into the bank he took us into a public-house and gave us something to drink. He then produced a cheque and a letter which bore the signature Menez, also a sheet of white paper and told me to copy the signature Menez on the paper. This I did several times. He then told us to go to the bank and ask for the money, and if they wished it to sign the name Menez on the back of the cheque. He came outside the public-house; at the bank they were not willing to pay, and said we must go the next day; we told the man"; the next day we saw him again; we went to the bank and the stranger remained outside; I endorsed the cheque on the back on the counter, and they gave us the money in gold as the man had directed us; I went outside and gave the gold to the man; the man gave me Â£1, and as Hoffmann owed me 2s.

"Yes; is it nice and sharp?"â€”I showed her another knife; this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)â€”a flush spring knife has a spring which does not project as this one doesâ€”a projecting spring once in operation fixes the blade absolutely firm in the hasp of the knife, and can only be released by pressure of the springâ€”I said, "You will be able to manipulate this better, it has a projecting spring"â€”upon my showing her how to open it, she said, "Oh yes"â€”she asked the price of it, I told her 6s.â€”she asked me if I had not got one for about 5s.â€”I said no, and then I said, "I will let you have it for 5s. 6d., and eventually she bought it at that priceâ€”she again asked if it was nice and sharpâ€”I said, "Oh, yes"â€”I think sheâ€”paid me in silverâ€”I asked her if she would have it in paper, and she said, "Oh, no," and put it into her muff which she was carryingâ€”the knife was closed thenâ€”I had closed it before handing it to her; she then; left the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Lombard Street Post Officeâ€”I was there on November 10th, about 1.55 p.m.â€”I saw the prisoner on the top step leading to the post office door in Lombard Streetâ€”she looked through the glass door several timesâ€”after a few minutes' delay she came in and said to me. "When will that boy be back"â€”I went and asked a question and then returned to the prisoner and told her that owing to its being Lord Mayor's day the lad was probably delayed, and could not deliver the messageâ€”she remained in the office about fifteen or twenty minutes altogetherâ€”she seemed to be labouring under some sort of excite<lb/>mentâ€”she walked up and down the office and looked at the various notices on the wallsâ€”she leant on the counter at the telegraph end of the officeâ€”she had a muff in her left handâ€”Coleman returned almost as I was speaking to herâ€”he told her that he could not deliver the message, and she said, "Take it back, Mr. Baker will come at once when he knows I am waiting"â€”the boy went away again and the prisoner left the officeâ€”whilst she was away the deceased returnedâ€”I did not see Coleman come inâ€”after a short conversation he left the office by the Lombard Street, or north, doorâ€”almost as he left the prisoner came in by the same door and placed herself with her back to meâ€”I heard Mr. Dunn explain to her that there was 2d. due because Coleman had had to wait more than ten minutesâ€”she</p>

               <p>replied, "All right, old boy, I am worth 2d."â€”I saw the deceased then come in by the Lombard Street doorâ€”he made straight for the prisonerâ€”he said something which I did not hear, and she said, "You must pay the 2d., pay it with this," and she put forward her right hand in which she had a florinâ€”she tried to put it into his waistcoat pocketâ€”before she took out the florin the deceased said, "I shall not," he backing towards the Lombard Street door; the prisoner followed him, holding the florin out all the time, and attempting to press it into his waistcoat pocketâ€”they went through the door where there are three stepsâ€”the deceased went down themâ€”the prisoner paused for a moment on the top of the steps and she then seemed to spring from the top steps in the direction of the posting boxes which are immediately outside the door on the right as you pass from the doorâ€”Coleman made an exclamationâ€”I did not go to the door; I remained behind the counter.</p>

Smith, asking me to call at 27, Chancery Laneâ€”I called and saw the defendantâ€”he showed me a copy of the rules of the British National Thrift Society, and told me that I should have to handle large sums of money in connection with the society, and he should require a guarantee of Â£500â€”I agreedâ€”the Law Guarantee Society was mentioned, and he asked me whether I should take it out myself or whether he should do so for meâ€”he told me he could get it at a cheaper rate, and I gave him Â£3 to cover the expenses on July 7thâ€”my salary was to be Â£3 a weekâ€”I entered on my duties at 27, Chancery Lane on August 25thâ€”all I did was to fill in policies appertaining to the Pension Tea Societyâ€”I stayed in the employ about seven weeks, but never received any salaryâ€”on October 8th, the day before the offices were closed, Smith called upon me at Brixton and told me that Brown had the money of the company, and that after Adams had been settled with I should get my money in fullâ€”the next day I spoke to Mr. Brown about it, and the day after I lodged an information with the police at Bow Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The financial condition of the society was never explained to meâ€”my salary was Â£3 a week, not Â£2â€”I was to be paid monthlyâ€”at the end of the month I did not make an application for Â£8â€”I did not see anyone named Drummondâ€”I never heard you personally assume the name of Drummondâ€”with regard to the Â£3 I gave you, you distinctly suggested going to the Law Guarantee Societyâ€”I do not recollect telling you that Mr. Adams was in communication with Bow Streetâ€”I have not been employed by the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have never been in communication with any society in reference to a policy of guaranteeâ€”after I had been to Bow Street I tried to trace the defendant, but I was not employed by the police; I was a fortnight altogether doing so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Law Guarantee Society, of 49, Chancery Laneâ€”no guarantee policy has been taken out with that Society by Mr. Smith or Drummond and Co., Ltd., in respect of Mr. Fordâ€”I have not seen any proposal form, nor has any money been received by the Societyâ€”we have had some communication with the firm in con<lb/>nection with other peopleâ€”Smith is not in a position to obtain guarantee policies from the Society at a cheaper rate than any other person.</p>

For a good many years previous to 1901 I was in business as a retail grocerâ€”I first met Smith in 1901, and we discussed the formation of a company to run, among other things, the Pension Tea Societyâ€”Henry Drummond and Co., Ltd., was then formedâ€”I became one of the signatories and one of the directorsâ€”I knew Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Belcher as directorsâ€”as soon as the Company was registered I paid Â£150 into its account, and I have since put in another Â£200â€”some of my friends have also put in about Â£100 between themâ€”I have assisted the Company on and off right from the startâ€”Smith held the position of secretaryâ€”several meetings of directors were held and minutes drawn upâ€”I do not recollect any arrangement by which Smith got 50 per cent of the receipts from the general commission business apart from his salaryâ€”I do not think he was drawing Â£600 a year from Drummond and Co.â€”I remember the transactions in connection with Bull, Johnson, and Adamsâ€”their moneys were received by the Company and applied for the carrying on of the businessâ€”I do not think any of it reached Smithâ€”in June, 1902, the Pension Tea business was in a flourishing conditionâ€”the members were about 800â€”in October, the business had practically doubled itself, the number of members was between 1,500 and 1,600â€”the business is now at a standstill owing to these proceedingsâ€”I had nothing to do with the signing of cheques for Drummond and Coâ€”Mr. Belcher used to keep the cash book, and I saw it occasionallyâ€”when I went to Chancery Lane, Mr. Middlemiss was occupying the offices with Smithâ€”Middlemiss continued in occupation till Marchâ€”when he left I bought the furniture and the lease of the rooms from himâ€”I do not know how he got itâ€”I understood Drummond and Co., Ltd., had taken it from Jones, Lang and Co.â€”after the formation of the Company most of the time was occupied in framing rules of different friendly societiesâ€”it was arranged to finance the societies before they were really registeredâ€”amongst the societies formed were the Pension Trading Society, the Traders' and Consumers' Provident Association, and the British National Thrift Societyâ€”in the formation of these societies Drummond and Co. were acting practically as agents of eminent financial peopleâ€”no false representations were made to Mr. Adams or Mr. Bull about the businessâ€”at the time Mr. Adams paid in his Â£100 I had arranged to invest some more money in the Companyâ€”it was the rule that the agents should pay their salary out of their takingsâ€”very few agents took less than Â£3 a weekâ€”all Mr. Adams' orders were executedâ€”the British National</p>

For working expensesâ€”the National Thrift was a genuine societyâ€”I do not' know who the trustees wereâ€”they were mere nonentities for the purposes of registrationâ€”I do not know that anyone was appointed to look after the pensionsâ€”I have no record of the net profits funded with the Societyâ€”the business of the Pension Tea Company indirectly involved life insurances, but the British National Thrift was not formed to get over the difficulty of depositing Â£20,000.</p>

                  </hi>, L.R.C.P. and M.R.C.S. I am Divisional-Surgeon of the Police at Walthamstowâ€”on November 29th I was called to 39, Wins Terraceâ€”I got there about 7.55 p.m.â€”I there saw the dead body of a male childâ€”I attended the prisoner in her confinementâ€”I think that was the same child that she had been delivered ofâ€”when I saw it on November 29th it was lying in a zinc bath, undressed, on its right sideâ€”I got there after Dr. Bellâ€”the child's face was quite paleâ€”its tongue</p>

I am the wife of the last witnessâ€”I met the prisoner on November 1stâ€”I called upon her about 5.45 p.m.â€”I knocked at her door, and went into her roomâ€”she was there with the baby, which was awake, and she went out to get the baby's bottle and some milkâ€”I half-filled the bottle, and handed it to the prisoner, who gave it to the child"â€”she then suggested that I should go and tell my husband at the top of the street that she would not be long, but would see the baby to sleep and then join usâ€”I did so, and about five minutes afterwards she joined usâ€”she was asked if she had seen the baby to sleepâ€”she said, "I have tucked my baby in, bless her heart"â€”we all went as far as Vauxhallâ€”we met an uncle of my husband's, Frederick Kirkâ€”we were all together till about 9.45â€”I went back with the prisoner to her roomâ€”she went in firstâ€”as she went in, she said, "Good God, someone has been in my room"â€”she nearly pushed me downstairs in her excitementâ€”I do not know if she fainted, because I tore downstairs and fetched my husband and uncle from the top of the streetâ€”I did not look into the room before I wentâ€”I had only got as far as the top stepâ€”I did not go upstairs when I got back.</p>

I am divisional Surgeon of Police, and practise at Batterseaâ€”I went to see this child at 32, Austin Roadâ€”it was then deadâ€”it had a cut across its throat, which had only gone through the small vessels of the neckâ€”the windpipe was cutâ€”I afterwards found that the cause of death was asphyxiation, from a clot of blood having formed in the windpipeâ€”the blood had fallen backwards and there coagulatedâ€”the child was well nourished and very clean.</p>
