            . I am an officer. On the 25th of January, between six and seven in the evening, I was in Shoreditch, near the Ship public-house; I observed the prisoner cross the road, he was by himself at the time he passed me; I perceived he had something under his coat on the left side, with his left arm supporting it, apparently to me; I followed him into Cumberland-street, and when I came nearer to him in Cumberland-street, he hastoned his pace; I ran forward, and collard him, and asked him what he had got; he said nothing. He scuffled with me, and this soap in the handkerchief as it is now, dropped from him at his feet. He scuffled with me a long time, and struck me several blows, and endeavoured to make his escape; I kept my hold. He denied stealing the soap, he said, he had bought it then. I was obliged to strike him a violent blow; I secured him. Where I took him was about a mile from the prosecutor's premises. This is the soap in the handkerchief that fell from him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 25th of January, the prisoner was under examination at the office in Worship-street; I searched him at the office; I found these four cakes of soap concealed in his breeches, extended up under his smock frock. I sent for Mr. Nowlan; Mr. Nowlan came the next day, and knew the soap. This is the soap.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the soap, first look at that found by Barratt - A. I have seen it, I have no doubt it is my property; the other soap found by Armstrong, that is also my property. The prisoner had access to that soap; he was packing it that morning; I have not the least doubt it is mine; I wish I had.</p>

His brother said, you must know there are coals in the boat, and how did they come there; he said. I took them off a boat going up the River to lighten it. He asked him what boat; he could not tell him the name of the boat, nor who she belonged to. I then said, I saw clearly how it was, and went home, and sent to Kingston for a coal-metre to measure the coals, his name is Perchmouth; he measured the coals; he is here. The prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150004"/>apprehended in December; Redoap and Moore have absconded.

Mr. Turner called; his man got a boat and went after them, and when we got to the lug-boat, the men whoever they were, were then gone; in the lug-boat there were coals: there were three sacks filled.</p>

               <p>SECOND COUNT. They stood charged, that they three round blanks of metal, each of them resembling a shilling, falsely and traiterously did colour with materials, producing the colour of silver; and also one other blank of round metal as and for a sixpence, did colour with materials, producing the colour of silver.</p>

               <p>JOHN RAY. I am a constable. On the 18th of January, I apprehended the man prisoner in Aldgate High-street, just as he came out of a stationer's shop, I had been watching him; I saw him go into Mr. New's shop, who is a stationer, I saw him go in there, and come out; when he came out, he had a sheet of brown paper and a pen in his hand; I went in the moment he came out, and gave information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150005"/>there; I followed him, and apprehended him; I took him into the Blue Boar Inn, Aldgate; I searched him; I found upon him a quantity of good money, twelve or fourteen shillings in good money, a quantity of good copper, and sixpences; there was no more bad money upon him; I have the sixpences here. I then brought him back to the shop from whence I saw him come out; a shilling was produced by the person that took it, the shop-woman said the prisoner was the person that she took the shilling from; the prisoner made no answer to that. I have got that shilling. I then took the prisoner to the watch-house. I asked the prisoner who he was, and where he lived, and his name; he told me he lived down a lane near the Red Lion at Ilford. I asked him what business he followed; he told me he had nearly enough to live upon, he now and then dealt in a little corn to make things comfortable, and to make all things meet. I know he lived at No. 12, George-street, Stepney Fields. When he told me he lived at Ilford, I told him, he told me a story; I told him I was going to a house in George-street, Stepney Fields, that I knew to be his lodging; he made no answer; afterwards I left him in the watchhouse, and I went with William Kennersley, the officer, to No. 12, George-street, Stepney Fields, when we got down there it might be a little after two o'clock; I knocked at the door, being a small house, I heard somebody run up stairs; the woman that stands in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her name - A. Jennings; she gave her name in then, she is the wife of the man prisoner. She throwed up the one pair of stairs window, looked out of the window, and asked me what I wanted; I told her there was a mistake in some taxes, I wished to speak to her. I left Kinnersley at the front door. I got over the wall backwards, I got into the house; I observed the two women very busy at the fire-place in the kitchen, as I was out of doors upon the wall, I had to get upon another wall, and upon the tiles: at last I got into the house; I found the two women prisoners in the kitchen down stairs; I let the officer, Kinnersley, in at the front part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the women - A. After Kinnersley took and secured them, their thumbs and fingers were dirty, as if they had been rubbing of metal, the same as coiners hands are; I searched upon the shelf, in the kitchen; I observed a quantity of base metal; these are them.</p>
               <p>MR. NICOLL. Q. You are one of the moniers of his Majesty's Mint; look at the money produced by the officer, what are they - A. Base, and counterfeit, thirteen base and counterfeit sixpences; they all have been coloured except one, that is a blank.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings are there in that parcel -</p>
               <p>Ray. The shillings were found upon another shelf, in the same room five shillings, and six sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. They appear to have been coloured, they are counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Ray. I examined the saucepan on the fire; this parcel was found in a drawer in the front room, there are six shillings and a half crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. They are all of them counterfeits, part coloured, and part not.</p>
               <p>Ray. I found these thirty-five blanks in the same room; I took the saucepan off the fire, which had peas soup in it; in that saucepan I found one hundred and ninety-two shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. The one hundred and ninety-two shillings are all counterfeits, they are coloured, and fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Ray. I found by the side of the fire-place this ewer with some liquid at the bottom of it; I poured that liquid into this bottle, in the presence of the two women, it is a solution of aquafortis, in another pot in the same room was some cream of tarter, which the middle woman got hold off, Mrs. Jennings, otherwise Lacon, she got hold of that, took it into the front room and threw it in the fire place; I scraped part of it up, and this pot with backing in it; here are two pieces of blankets very much stained with aqafortis; these were on the top of a table in the same room. I then went up stairs to a room with two beds in the room, and under one of the beds on the floor, was a quantity of good silver, near two pounds; Ward owned the handkerchief and the silver, she said she slept in that bed with her child, on that bed under which I found the good money; I returned the good money to her, there was no bad money found up stairs. The prisoner Ward said she was a servant out of place, she was in the habit of lodging there. I took the two women into custody. Mrs. Lacon acknowledged to living there, she put on some things that were there, and said the house was her's, I had seen

             four or five times before, I have seen him feeding his fowls, and go in and come out of there, I supposed that was his house. I got into the house at the window, and when I came down into the kitchen, the women they were standing up near the fire; I laid hold of them one with one hand and the other with my other hand as they were standing up near the fire.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM KINNERSLEY. I am an officer. I went with the last witness to apprehend the coiners: I never was at the apprehending of coiners before. Mr. Ray shewed me their hands; their thumbs and fingers seemed very much daubed; I know no more than what Mr. Ray has told you. Ward's thumbs and fingers were the same as Lacon's; their thumbs and fingers had the same appearance in both of them, their hands were coloured as if with a liquid all over, but there was a difference between the thumb and the finger to the rest of the hand.</p>

            . I live in Fleet-place, Hackney-road. In the early part of November last, I went to the <placeName id="t18150215-5-crimeloc23">Caledonian coffee-house, in the parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch</placeName>

I sat down in the coffee-room, pulled off my great coat, and placed my great coat and my umbrella on a table in the coffee-room. After I had taken the coffee, I desired the master of the house to bring me the great coat and umbrella. He returned, and told me it was not there; I did not go myself, I sent the landlord; I then suspected the prisoner, who was sitting by me; I went immediately with the landlord in search of the prisoner, suspecting he had gone off with the great coat; I did not find him. I did not see him afterwards until the 9th of January last; I have never seen my great coat and umbrella in the mean time; I have not seen it since. On the 9th of January, I saw the prisoner, he was apprehended on that day; he was brought into the City; I charged him with stealing my great coat and umbrella. I asked him what he had done with my great coat; I gave him no encouragement, nor any body in my presence; he said he did not know what he had done with it. On my repeating that interogatory, he said he did not know what he had done with the coat, he was so much intoxicated immediately he was taken to the public office; I went with him to the public office, and stated to the magistrate; I stated to the magistrate what I have stated to you. Mr. Chapman, the master of the coffee-house, gave his evidence, he will speak to you. When I told the prisoner he was not intoxicated, Mr. Chapman was present at the time; he told the magistrate that Mr. Chapman told him to say so. He acknowledged taking the great coat and umbrella, and pleaded intoxication, and said he did not know what he had done with them; he only denied it when he first came before the magistrate. I have never found the great coat and the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay in the coffee-room - A. About twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; he went before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the coffee-room part of the house - A. Yes, it is part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you fall in company with me first - A. At the George.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, go into Sadler's gin shop - A. I have no recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. The landlord asked you to go into the back room - 
               <persName id="t18150215-5-person107">A. </persName>
            He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And me also - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You left your great coat and umbrella in the front coffee-room - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th, you was not transacting your business at the Bank of England, were you - A. No. From the 11th to the 13th I was confined to my bed.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CHAPMAN. I keep the Caledonian coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner and Mr. Rickard being at your house in November last - A. Yes, I do, in the early part of November, I think about the 12th; the prisoner and Mr. Rickard came in together. The prisoner said he had brought in a gentleman to have a cup of coffee; the prisoner came to me again, and desired me to make him a cup of coffee, and a cup for a gentleman. I desired him to ask the gentleman to walk into the parlour; another gentleman was in conversation with Mr. Rickard, and while that gentleman and Mr. Rickard were engaged in conversation, the prisoner walked out through the coffee-room out of the street door. After sitting some time, Mr. Richard wanted to go, he asked for his great coat and umbrella; I said, I knew nothing about it. He said, he brought a great coat and an umbrella in? where was the man that came in with him; I said, I did not know; I did not see the great coat and umbrella; we went and enquired in the coffee-room; we could not see the great coat, nor the umbrella in the coffee-room. I never saw either of them; I had not an opportunity of seeing them. I found the prisoner one day when I was out, in Whitecross-street, about six weeks afterwards, I stopped him in the street, I asked him what he had done with the great coat and umbrella that he took from my house; I told him I was determined to take him to the gentleman. He asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150007"/>me if I was determined upon it; I said, I certainly was; I told him he had better tell the truth to the gentleman when he saw him,</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told me the prosecutor would not prosecute me.</p>

            . I live in Hackney-road. I was at the Caledonion coffee-house, in the early part of November, I remember seeing Mr. Rickard and the prisoner, they both came in together; I was sitting in the right hand box by the door. Mr. Rickard had a great coat on, and an umbrella; he took his great coat off, laid it on the bench, and the umbrella, he put on the right side of the room. After the two had been in company together a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, the prisoner came out of the inner room; he took the umbrella, and the great coat he folded up, and took it off the bench. That is all that I recollect, that I saw with my own eyes. I said nothing to him, I thought the gentleman might have sent him home with it. I never saw the prisoner before he came into the room that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. to Prosecutor. What is the value of this great coat - 
               <persName id="t18150215-5-person109">A. </persName>
            Forty-eight shillings, it cost me seven pounds, the umbrella we will say seven shillings.</p>

            . I am a shopman to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner coming into the shop between the hours of six and seven, on the 25th of last month, she and another woman came together, she bought a small quantity of muslin of the value of one shilling and ninepence. Mr. Clively came down in the mean time, and suspected them, and soon after they went out he followed them; I had not missed any thing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clively. You followed the prisoner - A. Yes, I followed them home to her house; after they went in, in consequence of suspecting them, I went to the office, got an officer, and searched them. When we came back both the women were gone, the prisoner after some time came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you when you first went there - A. No, not till I followed them. When she came home we searched the house, and found a piece of print, which I knew to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that print before the time that is was taken - A. I had seen it in the day; Jones had taken the print down just before they came in.</p>
               <p>Jones, The print was on the counter at the time the prisoner came in; I never missed it until it was brought back to the shop; the shop mark was taken off, it was a fag end.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be yours - A. It was on the counter when they came in; I looked on the counter and missed it; when the print was taken there was more in quantity: the fag end was taken off; when it was brought back it was seven yards, and when the print was taken it was fifteen or sixteen yards. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it -

On Wednesday, the 11th of January, I was putting on my child's frock, all of a sudden, I heard a rattling at the window, I said God bless me, what is that. Afterwards I found the rattle was in the window, but I did not know it at the time; I ran to the door, I looked at the window, the glass was all safe then; it was a damp night; I did not miss the ribbon; the window was not hurt in the least; I missed nothing then. My little girl came home from school, she went to the window to double up the ribbons, she said mother, have you sold all the green ribbon; I said, not. She said the ribbon is all gone. I looked in the window; I could not see which way it could he gone; then I thought it might be taken at the time that I heard the ratling. I saw my empty rolls, but no ribbon. I missed a piece of green figured sattin ribbon, not a whole piece; I have them in in half pieces; a green figured sattin, and a piece of brown ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. I cannot say. All my ribbons had been cut, nor can I say how many yards I lost; I cannot form any judgment to set any value at all upon them. When I missed them, I concluded they could go no way out but through the bolt holes that holds my shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them afterwards - A. No, never.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I have seen him before. Three boys came to me, I do not know what month it was in, the prisoner was one of the three boys, between eight and nine o'clock at night, they asked me to let them leave a bit of ribbon; I asked them why they did not leave it at their mother's, I knew their mothers, I did not know much of them; I believe Church was the boy that laid it down on the table; the mother of the prisoner took it away. I never saw any more of them. The mother of the prisoner and Mrs. Church took it away in about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I believe it was a bit of dark green ribbon. The boy Abbing came in half an hour afterwards, and asked me for the ribbon; I told him I had given it to Shaw's and Church's mother.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Lukes parish. Upon the 30th of January, I was upon my watch, about a quarter before five in the morning, I stopped the prisoner, and another man; I thought the prisoner had property on him that did not belong to him; I stopped them both at first; they both made their escape; by springing my rattle, my brother watchman caught the prisoner, and brought him back; the prisoner was never out of my sight. I delivered the harness to the constable of the night, that I took from him. This is the harness.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With submission being deprived of my parents at the early part of my life, and left without a protector or adviser, I unfortunately deviated from the path of rectitude. On the report being made to his Majesty, he was graciously pleased to spare my life, and by the humane benevolent interposition of the Recorder of London, I experienced a further extenuation of Royal clemency, and was pardoned, on condition of serving in the army abroad. In the month of August, 1811, I quitted London for the Isle of Wight, where I served six months to the entire satisfaction of my superior. On my embarking for the regiment that I was attached to, I not only received a certificate of good conduct, but was permitted to take my wife with me to the West Indies, and on joining my regiment, no man could devote himself more chearfully than I did to my duty, for which I had the happiness of obtaining the good opinion of my officers, so as to be selected myself and wife for an important situation in the family of Sir

               <p>COLONEL MAHONE. I belong to the regiment of Royal York-rangers. I was at Barbadoes; the prisoner was a private soldier in the Royal York-rangers nearly two years. I speak from recollection, I have no document, his conduct was that of a good soldier, I heard no complaint against him; if there had been I must have heard it, I had such an opinion of the man, that he and his wife were selected to serve in the Govenours house; the man and his wife conducted themselves with propriety, they merited every attentton. I could bestow upon them.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 14th of January, the prisoner came into my house, about eleven o'clock at night, he asked me if I would let him have a bed; I first told him no, he was not a lodger I liked to take in I took in respectable people; I did not altogether like his appearance he said he had just come from the country; out of humanity to him. I thought he should have a bed as he was distressed; he gave me a three shilling piece to take for the bed. The next morning, the girl who has the management of the beds, told me to get up immediately, the man had robbed the bed of a sheet; when I came down, I saw the man surrounded by several persons in the parlour, who had assisted my girl in taking him; the prisoner begged me to let him go, he would never do such a thing any more. I said you do not deserve to be forgiven, you were not distressed. My girl went up stairs, she came down and said he had taken a pair of window-curtains.</p>

               <p>Q. On Friday afternoon the 20th of January, was a parcel of dollars brought by Mr. Lee - A. Yes, they were brought there to be weighed by Mr. Lee, the purser of the Bridgewater; Mr. Lee, the purser of the ship, was present, and the prisoner; the dollars were weighed, each bag separate, and returned into the bags from which they were turned out, the seven bags were weighed separate, we weighed them by troy weight, seventy-two pounds weight, odd ounces, each bags, about sixty a verdupoise, and the odd bag weighed fifty pounds ten ounces: after the seven bags of dollars were all weighed they were put into the chests in my presence, and in the presence of the purser of the ship; four bags were put into one chest, and three in the other; the chests were made secure, and sealed; on Friday it was too late for shipping; they remained until the 21st, I saw nothing of them after the 21st, On Saturday morning I went to the office, I suppose it might be twelve; I found the prisoner in the crane room, which is opposite the Bullion office; the doors and windows appeared as I left them, there was nothing to excite suspicion. About two in the afternoon on Saturday the chests were removed into the crane room out of the Bulion office; the chests were weighed by the prisoner; I saw him weigh them. The chests were then lowered by the crane into the cart, that cart had been hired by the prisoner, for the purpose. I delivered to the prisoner the usual documents for the shipping of these chests, and he went away with them as usual with the cart; he returned in about an hour, or an hour and a quarter; he made the usual entry of the delivery of the chests of Bullion in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's desk - A. In the crane room; I was present when the prisoner's desk in the crane room was searched; I saw the Police officer take out some dollars, he counted them; I think he said, they were thirty-seven, and I saw the officer discover two melting pots under the desk, on some part of the floor. The dollars found in the prisoner's desk appeared to be the same as we had weighed and put into the chest by the prisoner. The prisoner had no use for these melting pots in his business whatever. I saw some metal in one of the pots, which had been melted. The chests were marked No. 1, and 2; No. 1, contained three thousand of Captain Hughes's dollars; the prisoner marked the weight on the outside of each; the book is here; the weight of No. 1, one hundred two quarters and twenty-seven pounds was the weight of the chest No. 1; No. 2, two hundred and twenty-seven pounds; it is in the prisoner's hand-writing; these entrys are all in the prisoners hand-writing; nothing else was found that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any chissels and hammers that lay about in the room - A. Yes, to open the chests,</p>
               <p>Q. Were the chests securley sealed - A. They were, by two seals on the side of the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any appearance with respect to the top of the chest of any damages the chest had received - A. I do not know of it; the chest is here; this is the chest. The chest was nailed all round, and hoops came across. The prisoner put the Company's seal upon it, one at the top and the other at the bottom; the seal remained in my custody in the office, not in his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now sir, when you saw this delivered the next day; if there had been any appearance of the seals being broken, it is a matter that would have struck your eye - A. It might or might not, it would have been subject to it certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had broken the seals, it would have been subject to your eye; you saw it taken from the Bulion office to the crane room - A. Yes, and I saw it drawn by the crane to the top; I was in the Bullion office the moment he took it out; then I saw it in the crane room; I saw him drawing it, I was within half a dozen yards of it when he was lowering it down in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me there are two doors to the Bullion office - A. Yes, and only one has a lock to it; it is my usual practice to see that the door that is fastened by bolts is fast; I rattle it; I invariably do it, and I have no doubt I did it that day; I may do it a thousand times, and omit it once; I believe it is my invariable practice.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it you first heard of there being any thing wrong respecting the dollars - A. On Monday. The prisoner said there had been an enquiry by some person wondering why the dollars had not come on board.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did not a person come up from on board a ship, saying, that they had received them, and that they were deficient - A. That was on Monday fortnight we received information that the dollars had been plundered; I informed the prisoner of the dollars being stolen, and another person was charged of the thing. The prisoner very readily went with me to the wharf.</p>

            . I was on board the Bridgewater on the 28th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see there a box containing dollars - A. I saw it when it was opened; I saw two bags in chest 1, which I supposed contained dollars; instead of that, I saw a weight, which I supposed to be half a hundred weight; I thought there might be an enquiry about it, as the ship was under weigh, I put my seal upon the weight in conjunction with another gentleman; my attention was not called to the box until it was opened. I cannot speak to the weight of the box.</p>

            . I belong to the Thames Police office. In consequence of suspicion, I searched the prisoner; I understood he had a desk in the crane room at the East India House; I requested him to shew it me; he produced a bunch of keys, on which was a small tally mark of the Bullion office, and one of these keys he described to be the key of his desk. I also found in his pocket four one-pound notes, and a letter dated the 6th of January, 1815; it was written as he told me, acknowledging the receipt of ten pounds, he had borrowed of an officer at the Treasury House. I told the prisoner to leave me the keys, as I should have occasion to look at all his drawers, as well as his room in the India House. When I went to the India House, Mr. Cobb told me he had the key of the crane room. I sent to the prisoner for the key. I searched his house; in one of his drawers I found seventy-eight or nine duplicates, of spoons, tableclothes, and wearing apparel, that had been pledged. I returned to the India House; I met the messenger that I had sent to the prisoner for the key. When I returned to the office, I saw the prisoner at night, he told me he had not given me the key, but it was hanging behind the shutters in the Bullion office. The next morning I found the key as he described. I entered the crane room, opened his desk, and in his desk I found thirty-seven Spanish dollars rolled up in a piece of an old newspaper; by the side of the desk on the floor among a parcel of paper that was laying about I found these two new crucibles, or melting pots, and I found a piece of run down metal, which I believe to be grain tin. The prisoner told me the melting pots were given to him by a servant of Mr. Brown. who is a refiner to the Company, and in regard to this chest, the prisoner stated that he split the lid in driving in the nail; now it fits so close that it is hardly perceptible, and being so split, he said he observed it to the purser; the purser said it was of no consequence. The chest is sealed on one side, on the other it is not sealed, and being so sealed, the wider part takes off without disturbing the seals, and there is room to take dollars out, and to put in the weight. The nails to the hoop might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150015"/>be drawn in half an hour and the dollars taken out and the weight put in; I know there is a great deal too much of that done on the River.</p>

            . I am a clerk at the Thames Police office; I took down the account of the prisoner at the time he was under examination; he said the dollars are my own property, I bought them on Monday last; I expected to have some more to day, if I had not been here. People bring parcels to me when they have dollars to sell? He meaned persons about the India House; these who brought them up belong to the India House, I don't know their names, nor where they live; I buy and sell dollars for the purpose of getting two or three halfpence by them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of seeing persons coming to the Bullion office, and offering Mr. Cobb dollars for sale; it is more than twelve years past when Mr. Mead was in the Bullion office, that he used to find me with money to buy dollars; I gave what I liked for the dollars, and the surplus of the money I had a part of it; there are people coming to the Bullion office offering Mr. Cobb dollars for sale; when they attend I give them something to drink; I never know who the parties are, I generally give a halfpenny more than the silversmiths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cobb. Three or four instances have occured where dollars have been offered to me; persons have most assuredly come and offered dollars to me for sale.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called twenty witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I came to London along with my husband, in the cart; we stopped at Mr. Cable's door, I went to get another bundle of linen, I returned to Mr. Cable's house, I saw the bundle dragged from the cart; I only saw the head and arms of the prisoner; I went to the door-post and seized the prisoner by the collar, and with my other hand I seized the bundle. I said to the prisoner, you have robbed my cart; he said I was mad, he had put it in the wrong cart by mistake; I said it is no such thing, it is my bundle it was then exactly, as it is now in this sheet, in my cart; here are three table cloths with my marks on them, and the sheets have my marks on them, I can swear to them.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 24th of December last had the Captain ordered you to take the boat, and go with a message to another ship - A. Yes, about four o'clock in the afternoon, it was just dark at that time we pulled round the teer of ships on the Middlesex side by stone stairs, I and my brother were both pulling our oars, against the tide, we met the prisoner in a scull by himself; I told him to go on one side or the other, he made no answer but struck our boat, upon which my brother called him a nasty name; he then hit me upon my right arm; I asked the prisoner why he struck me, it was not me that called him that nasty name; our boat then was alongside of another boat, the prisoner run his boat on the tide, and came near us, he struck my brother on the shoulder, my brother run out into another boat, the prisoner took up the scull stretched it out at arm's length and hit my brother on the back, my brother had a guernsey frock on, it is a wooley thing, he set it against my brother's back. the scull held fast of the frock; the prisoner shoved him overboard, I am sure I saw the prisoner shove him overboard.</p>

I came home between five and six o'clock, my porter had the prisoner by the collar in the shop when I came home; I had been out an hour and a half, I suppose the door was open when I left it, I usually shut my shop of a night, as soon as it is dark; the name of my porter is Scott, I asked Scott what he had the man there for, he said he saw him taking a piece of carpet out through the window; I found the window broken, and one piece of carpet gone, the other the prisoner had in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen the carpet last - A. I saw it the same day, it was placed near the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so near that a person could take it out, without putting their hand through the window - A. No, they must have put their hand through the window; there was one carpet taken away, and gone entirely, it did not hang up it stood on its end. I do not think it was shut close.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been quite close it might be taken out without a person putting in his hand - A. No I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner - A, The constable did, I was there when he was searched, he had a bag, and some duplicates, nothing else I did not see any instrument of any sort; I had observed the pane of glass that day, there was not a bit of glass gone; it was a simple crack across the top, in part of the pane.</p>

            . On the 13th of January, about ten minutes before five I took in a few rolls of carpet, that had been standing at the door, I shut the door, and lighted the lamps in the shop; I put up one rool of carpet in the window close to the side where this piece of carpet stood, I believe it touched the frames of the window. I bolted the shop door; this is the piece of carpet, I found the prisoner had hold of it stood up in the corner of the window, I fastened the shop door and bolted it, and went out at the private door for my tea, I left the young woman at work in the shop. About twenty minutes past five, I was returning from my tea. before I got to the shop. I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of the shop window. I passed them, I thought they were after no good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No, I never saw him before; I passed them, I passed the shop ten or a dozen yards, and crossed over the way I went under a gateway opposite of the shop; they seperated as I passed the shop. and returned again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150019"/>I came from under the gateway; I walked about ten yards further on the right, because I could not see what they were doing of then; I observed one of the men with an umbrella keeping the light off another shop, and the prisoner stooping down pulling the carpet out; I ran across the way and laid hold of him while he was pulling the carpet out; the carpet was almost a foot out, he had shoved it down to get it out, he could not have got at it without putting his hand in at the window. I did not see him break the window; I seized him by the collar, and asked him what he was doing of; he said he saw something he did not see what it was; I asked him where the other man was; he said he knew nothing at all of him.</p>

I got up in the morning when he went out of the yard; I went into the loft to see if he had taken any hay with him; I missed one truss. and I conceived two more; I then followed the cart to the Old Mother Red Cap at Highgate; at the yard of the Old Mother Black Cap beyond Kentish Town on the North road; I jumped into the cart, and rid in the cart; he did not know I was in the cart; I got out of the cart; I backed on one side of the horses, and he on the other, until he came to the Green Man at Finchley Common; he stopped his horses there, pulled down his tail board, and pulled the hay out of the cart; he had got two trusses and three quarters in his cart; I saw it when I was in the cart; I considered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150020"/>the three quarters of a truss he might want for his horses at the Green Man; he delivered the hay to a man with a white smock frock. Bromley delivered it into the stable belonging to the Green Man; I stopped a little time; I went to the bar window in the tap room; I saw Bromley drinking at the bar; I then went on to Whetstone to get my breakfast, he never saw me at all. I got my breakfast; I made general enquiry whether the landlord, or the ostler found hay on the road. I returned back to the Green Man at Finchley, and had a glass of wine and water; I saw the man to whom he delivered the hay to; I cannot swear that the prisoner Warren is the man.</p>

On the 14th of January, as I was coming from Guildhall about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner carrying a large bundle in a suspicions manner; I challenged him where he was going to carry it to; he said, Drury-lane. I was sure he would never carry it to Drury-lane in the slovenly manner he had it, it was not packed up as if in the fair course of business. I asked him where he brought it from; he said the water side. I asked him whether he brought it from Mr. Maberleys. the clothier; he first said, yes, and afterwards he did not give me any direct answer, he said somebody gave it him to carry from the water side. I stopped him and took him before the sitting Alderman. This is the piece of cloth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any muskets being deliver-there. A. I remember the prisoner taking one out on the 13th of January, about a quarter before one o'clock; it was taken out of Sir James Cunningham's office, he being head of that department. I was coming out of Sir James's office, I saw the prisoner with a musket in his hand; I know him perfectly well, he had a musket in his hand; being before the usual time to have the guns inspected, suspicion arose in my mind of something being uncommon. I knew he worked for Mr. Thompson, therefore I had no suspicion, only of his being too soon. The guns had not been inspected; we do not take them in as the property of the Company until they are inspected. I and my assistants inspect them for the company; until they have undergone inspection, they are the property of the makers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with the musket. A. No, he took it out of the room where it was deposited; but wherever he went with it I do not know. On Saturday the 14th of January, Davis came down with some muskets on his shoulder; I do not know how many he brought, he put them down with the rest. On Tuesday or Wednesday I saw Davis, I said did you send Bird for a gun. I saw Bird when the constable had him in custody. Mr. Thompson told him he would forgive him if he would tell who he sold it to; the gun has been found, it is worth thirty shillings.</p>

I came down, and saw him go out of the yard with a gun into Devonshire Square, where he went with it I do not know.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q, to Davis. Were all these muskets in the view room of your manufactory. - A. His and mine together, he is a journeyman under me; I am answerable for all that are missing, if any are missing I am to make it good.</p>

I asked him what he had got there, he did not give me a satisfactory account; he asked me what it was to me. I asked him to go into some public-house with me to give me a satisfactory account; I got him to a public-house door, he put the basket down. The prisoner Hopkins then came up, and while we were talking, the prisoner Hopkins took up the basket, and run away; I had got hold of Bennet.

The prisoners had full employment at our house from seven o'clock in the morning until eight at night.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 1st of February, the prisoner came in, and asked for a lodging, he slept in the same room with me that night; I got up about seven o'clock, I left him in bed; he was seen to go out of the house about half after nine o'clock; the house-keeper asked me if I had any thing laying about the room, as the prisoner had gone out with a bigger bundle then he came in with on the over night. I went up stairs to see; I found my things gone, and the box open. I saw the prisoner, and pursued him in the fields at the back of the house; as soon as he saw me he stooped down underneath of the edge, and where I saw him stoop I went, and found some of my clothes. The prisoner was stopped, and brought back to the house. I then saw a pair of worsted stockings in his possession of mine. I had fifteen farthings in my box, ten were found upon him. These are the stockings and handkerchiefs; they are mine, and one of the farthings I believe to be mine, I had such a farthing as that.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he left the shop then - A. Not at that time; when he said that it gave me suspicion that he had something of mine. The jacket was then on his back, he had been over the counter, and taken it; he went to the street door to get away, I followed him; he pulled the jacket off, threw it down; I secured him. He went from the counter to go into the street; he threw the jacket into the mud; I secured him, and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought that jacket in the middle of the street. I asked him for a suit of clothes, he said that jacket is mine; I told him I never was in his shop in my life before, I was taken in custody, The ship I belonged to is now gone away, I have lost every thing.</p>

On the 3rd of February last, between ten and eleven in the morning I saw the prisoner coming out of my masters premises, I saw him through a loop hole, I saw him coming out, the prisoner came there to fetch the grains away,; I saw him coming out of the sugar warehouse, he had a basket on his shoulder, and a bag in it; the cart was at the door. He digged a hole in the grains, that were in the cart, and put the bag in it, and covered it over with the grains, and put the basket on the top, over the sugar in the grains; I came down immediately, took the basket off the grains, and uncovered the bag, and there I found a loaf of sugar done up in paper with a string round it, I taxed him with it, at first he denied it, at last he owned it, he said he was sorry for it. I know the loaf of sugar to be my employers property; I mark all the loaves of sugar, before they are tied up. I know it by the mark that I put on it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hanwell, I received the prisoner in charge of Dowdell upon the charge of robbing Mr. Commerell's premises; I searched the prisoner, and gave him into the charge of Davis at the Spencer's Arms Hanwell; I sent with with Dowdell, the last witness to inspect Mr. Commerell's premises; the outer door towards the brew-house was broken open: the window had been broken open at the kitchen; I found a considerable quantity of lead had been taken from the house, and gone; the case of a kitchen dial was carried into the wine cellar, the inside works of the dial was gone; the curtain of the library door had been torn away. I matched the curtain, Dowdell found it in the prisoner's pocket, it matched exactly. I then went back to the Spencer's Arms, where I had left Barrenger in custody; when I came there, I found he was gone. On Sunday I went to Hayes from information; I apprehended Carr there, he is the accomplice, the next morning Carr made a compleat disclosure of the whole transaction. I told the magistrate; he made the same confession to the magistrate, in consequence of what I learned from Carr; I searched Mr. Commerell's pond; we pulled out of the pound five hundred pounds weight of lead; it was lead that covered Mr. Commerell's house, I fitted part of it, it corresponded exactly. In consequence of information I went to Mr. Merrill's, a clock and watch maker, at Brentford; there I found the works of a dial, I fitted the works to the case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150027"/>on Mr. Commerell's premises, it fitted exactly; I am a watch and clock maker myself.

               <p>Q. Do you find by inspection, that your house has undergone a considerable loss of lead - A. I have been there myself, I have seen that a considerable quantity of lead has been taken away; the lead has been taken away from the roof of the house.</p>

            . Q. Now, say nothing else but what is true - A. I have known the prisoner Barrenger about seven weeks before this happened; I saw him on the 3rd of January, at the Waggon and Horses at Hayes; I had a little conversation with him there, he told me he had been at Hanwell, he had taken the inside works of a clock, and some lead, and some bells; the inside works of the clock he had sold to a clock-maker at the market place at Brentford; the bells he had sold to Mrs. Muckelow at Brentford. He asked me if I would go with him. The next morning we both went from Hayes to Hanwell, and took some more lead at Mr. Commerell's house; Barrenger said he had left the door open; he went in; then he shewed me a hole in the window, that he had broken to open the shutters to get in and unfastened the door; he shewed me a piece of lead on the stairs, about half an hundred weight; Barrenger took the lead up, and put it in this green stuff bag. He told me there was a copper down stairs, which he had removed from one room to another. He said he would take the lead if I would take the copper; I took the copper, and sold it to Mrs. Muckelow at Brentford; she gave me sixpence a pound, it came to twelve shillings; I took the copper in a sack. Barenger sold the lead at Mrs. Muckelow's; I do not know what he received for the lead. Mrs. Muckelow keeps a shop, buys old iron and rags. We went back again to Mr. Commerell's house; the next day we took three trips to the house, and took lead each time. We left a large quantity of lead in the pond, it was taken from the roof of the house, and some from the pump. I have told all I know, and no more than the truth.</p>


               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the clock case - A. It has been taken out of my house; it is mutilated now to the best of knowledge; I positively swear it is my clock case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. to Dowdell. You told me you saw Barrenger and Carr together - A. I did, I saw them coming from Brentford, and going back again; I am a labourer; I live in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ross. I produce three bells; I found them on Mrs. Muckelow's premises. I fitted the bells to Mr. Commerell's premises; they fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have never been with Carr since he and I worked together at Mr. Faggs at Bellfont; I happened to meet him as I was looking after work; I was never with him in the premises in my life; we have never been in a house together.</p>

            . My husband's name is James Gorden; I lodge in the same house as the prisoner.

I found her in my room when I returned; I gave the prisoner the rum; she went into her own room; I was in my own room. She told me she would come into my room again; she did not come; I then had suspicion that she had done something wrong. I went to my bonnet box; my bonnet was gone; I had seen my bonnet in the box that morning. I saw my bonnet in the prisoner's room when the constable came; I went with the constable into her room; I found my bonnet and two handkerchiefs, they were found in a bundle that she had in her room on the table, two caps, two handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, and two handkerchiefs, she had in her pocket; the bonnet, the velvet spencer, and two handkerchiefs, were in a bundle; all the rest were upon her, they were taken out of her pocket.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Clobury. On the afternoon of the 17th of January last, between the hours of four and five, I was engaged with a customer at the back part of the shop; on looking towards the shop door I saw two men, supposing them to be looking at the articles in the window, I stepped towards the door. I saw one of the men strip the coat off the horse at the door; I saw him give it to the other; on my approaching still nearer to them, they made off; I pursued them. They dropped the coat about a yard from the door. I pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped; he was brought to the shop again; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him; I am certain he is the man; I followed the prisoner from the shop door, I was close at his heels until he was stopped, and never having lost sight of him until he was stopped; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was this - A. This was Monday, the 6th of February; the seventeen one-pound notes he took away with him in his hand, I was counting out the silver and the halfpence when he went away with the notes, he said he would be back in a minute. I found he did not come back; I looked in the pocket-book; I found some blank paper in the pocket-book, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he shewed you a twenty-pound note at all - A. He had a piece of paper in his hand, it looked like a piece of writing paper. Finding he did not come back, I went to Mrs. Holmes's after him, and then to his wife; his wife said she expected him in; I could not find him. I went and gave information at the Mansion House; I saw no more of him until he was brought to the Mansion House on the Monday.</p>

It is a truss of blue and white woollen cloth for aprons. I followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him until he got into Gutter-lane; I stopped the prisoner. This is the truss.</p>

            . On the 27th of January, in the evening about 7 o'clock, I was in the Upper White Cross Street, I saw the prisoner in company with another, and knowing them when they passed me; I looked after them, I perceived the prisoner with something concealed in his blue apron in the front of him; I followed him into Lower White Cross Street, in the City; I watched them, suspecting where they were going with what they had, until they came to a receiving house. I stopped him when he was going in, the other made his escape at that time; I asked him what he had got, he replied nothing; I caught hold of the bacon; I perceived it was bacon; I asked him how he came by it; I told him it would save me a great deal of trouble if he would tell me where he bought it, if not, I should take him into custody, which I did; I locked him up at last, I went into the house of the prosecutor, I asked the wife of the prosecutor if she had lost any thing; she said she had, and she should know it if she raw it. This is the bacon, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

There was no person in the shop; I expected the street-keeper to come to shut up my shop in a minute; I thought I would speak to him when he came, and when he came, I said to the prisoner, I was afraid there was none that would suit her; she said, she did not think that I had, she would call to-morrow along with her landlady. Then I told the street-keeper to take hold of her; I went round the counter, thinking she might drop it at the door; he laid hold of her; she came into the shop again; she asked me what I wanted; I told her she knew what I wanted, she had taken a lace shawl; I saw the lace shawl laying on the floor. A shawl and a veil is the same thing. When I said she had taken the lace shawl, I observed one laying on the floor; I said there was the shawl. She said she had knocked it off the counter with her elbow; then the street-keeper picked it up, he said he would go and get a regular constable, and deliver her and the shawl to him.

I was reading aloud to my mother, my room is near the passage door; I heard the lock of the house door turn, and immediately came a man's foot into the passage; I said to my mother that I thought Mrs. Tenant's watchman had gone home to his supper. The instant I opened the door, a man ran upon me with a large stick in his hand, and a pistol; he said your money or your life. I told him I had very little money; I gave him a one pound note in the note book; he then said more money or I will murder you. I said I had no more money, I have a watch, I endeavoured to cut it from my side; I took a knife from the table and cut the watch off and gave it him also; there was a noise afterwards, a rattle sprang. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man; his face was black to the best of my belief; I could entirely distinguish he was a dark complexion man with a prominent nose, his face was black, but I could see his nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever acquainted with the man before. - Never, Sir, he said your money or your life, and then more money, or I'll murder you; I had no light, I had only fire light, I could not swear to the man.</p>

There is a dry ditch in the field, and a wet ditch. The prisoner came opposite me, he stooped down in the dry ditch, as though he would hide himself; immediately I hallowed out halloo there; he sprang out of the dry ditch, and stood upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150036"/>bank, and as he stepped over the dry bank, he fell into the wet ditch, he said, oh, dear, he got out of the ditch, and proceeded on.

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, have you known him long - A. Yes, a year and a half or two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the evening of the 4th of February - A. I really think it was him that I saw pass me, he was quite close to me almost; he was very wet indeed, the wet ran from him, he had his coat tucked up; he was running in a great hurry, extremely wet; he lives very near me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does he live to you - A. I could walk it in two minutes. I certainly think he is the person that passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that he was the man - A. It was star light; I cannot say that I saw his face; I have no doubt at all that he is the person.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. Q. You are a police officer - A. Yes; I in company with Smith, apprehended the prisoner; I went to see Mrs. Tennant's premises. After apprehending the prisoner, Smith and I conducted him to London. I went to examine the premises; I found the marks of shoes with large nails in them; I traced them from the stable to the orchard; I plainly distinguished one shoe; I thinking the prisoner might have shoes on with that description of nails in them; this was going from the garden into the orchard; the way that the man run was not a thoroughfare. At the office I examined the shoes the prisoner had on on the 10th in the afternoon, and seeing the nails in his shoes corresponded in the garden and the orchard, and seeing one nail was out in one of the shoes at the toe, we compared it to that part with the marks of the shoe, it corresponded exactly; to be more exact we made a fresh impression with the shoe, they were both alike.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. The 4th of February, was on Saturday; you took the shoe on the 10th - A. Yes, the man and the shoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Barnes. About half past eight, I was walking up and down before my door; two little boys came up, and said, Jack, there is somebody gone into Mr. Hoard's shop; that drew my attention; I looked into the shop; the prisoner was then creeping along the side of the counter. The coat was on a chair at the end of the counter. He took it up, put it under his arm, and came towards the door; I met him, and asked him what he wanted; he dropped the coat on the sell of the door, half in the shop and half in the street; I took him into Mr. Hoard's shop.

            . On the 14th of January, I was patrole of St. Sepulchres. I was in St. John-street; I had known Allcock to be a suspicious character; the two prisoners were loitering about there, and the one that made his escape, they were loitering about at every shop window until they came to the prosecutor's; the two prisoners were placed at the window, and the third over the way watching; the two prisoners committed the act, and the other was over the way upon the look out: I saw Allcock had some instrument in his hand that he cut the window with; he made a cut at it; he went on one way and the other the other way; the moment he drew up to the window, he gave it a cut; the second attempt he made he broke the window; one went one way and the other the other way; I apprehended the two prisoners, and took them both within the shop, searched them, and found the knife that would star the window.

She told me that she gave the prisoner four shillings and sixpence or five shillings to purchase the sattin for her, and this was the sattin that he had brought for her. The prisoner denied ever having stolen the sattin from our premises at first; afterwards he confessed it; we neither promissed or threatened him; he afterwards confessed that he had stolen it from our warehouse, and by some means we found some of our property in the house of Mrs. Bellis; I saw her deliver it up to the officer.</p>

            . I am a taylor. On Thursday the 19th the prisoner came into a public house where I was having a mutton shop in the evening, he had some dinner, and a woman with him, they dined at the same table; he dined there on the Friday. On Friday evening, as I was going home he asked me if I could reccommend him to any place where he could get a good lodging, it was in my road to pass the prosecutor's house; I told the prisoner they had very good beds there, It was a respectable house, as I thought. We then went into the parlour of the Angel Inn, he called for a pint of ale, the officer came in, and took him in custody.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Pike. On the 21st of January a lady informed me, that our goods were in danger at the door, and in less than three minutes after a man came in and said our handkerchiefs were gone from the door. I pursued after the prisoner, and overtook the prisoner, with the handkerchiefs under his arm; I brought him back to our house, he said, he picked the handkerchiefs up in the street, I said that was impossible, as the street was very dirty, and there was no mud on the handkerchiefs. I knew the handkerchiefs to be the property of Mr. Pike, I gave the handkerchiefs to the officer with the prisoner. The handkerchiefs were hanging inside of the door, near the door, there was great violence used in taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other persons in the shop see the prisoner taking them - A. I should suppose so, because they said they saw the man dragging the handkerchiefs; there were three of us in the shop, they are not here.</p>

            . I am a neighbour to Mr. Higginson, I saw the two prisoner's go out of my neighbours house, I knew one of them to be a bad character, knowing Greetrix, I watched her, I saw her go into the prosecutors shop, she came out she went to the other, I thought she gave her something, Greetrix immediately returned to the shop door; I immediately went and gave the prosecutor information, he looked round directly, and missed a piece of cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Higginson. Did you miss any thing - A. Yes, I missed a piece of cotton print from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prime cost of it - A. Twelve shillings. I had put it upon the horse inside of the shop, between five and ten minutes before, on my receiving information from the last witness, I went with the witness, and met Greetrix. I took her into custody. I took her into the shop, and charged her with the theft, she denied it, I sent for an officer. Plank the officer came. When Plank came she told me where to find the print.</p>
               <p>MR. PLANK. I took Greetrix into custody at Mr. Higginson's shop, I went with Greetrix to No, 2, Malborough-row, she told me the prisoner Adland was there in the kitchen, Adland was sitting there before the fire with something in her lap, I asked her what she had there, she said bacon, I took the bacon out of her lap, and under the bacon was this cotton.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my own cotton, my own hand writing is upon it, in figures to the amount.</p>
               <p>Greetrix's Defence. The gentleman searched me and found nothing, he asked me where I was going to, I said to Malborough row, and on our going there the officer found the cotton in her lap. I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Adland's Defence. On my passing Cranby street, I had my apron on, a woman threw something into my apron, and instantly departed, it was dark, I could not see what it was, I had scarcely entered my home when a man entered my room, and owned the property I had in my lap, and took me in custody.</p>

I saw the ten-pound note at Mr. Banton's, a pawnbroker, in Skinner-street, I saw it on Wednesday, and I saw the one-pound note on the same day; I missed it on Monday. On the ten-pound note was my own hand-writing, of the name of the person I took it of; I have not seen neither of the two other notes; the notes I have seen, they are my own property; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>COURT. When had you seen the prisoner last in your shop - A. On the Saturday prior to the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had not seen the prisoner since Saturday preceeding that you missed your property - A. I had not.</p>

            You living in the house, and she living in the house? What share have you in the business - A. I have no share, but only my keep; I do not receive any salary; I have a busines of my own besides that.

            . I am a oil and colourman, in Whitechapel, High-street. The prisoner formerly had been my servant. This took place on the Wednesday; I had discharged him on the Friday before, he never had been in my service after; he had only been with me two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his keeping a horse and a cart - A. I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, supposing oil to have been in that paint, could it be in the state that was found - A. No, it would have dried up. The officer, Miller, brought the paint to me. I went with him to the Police office, and then to the prisoner's house; there I found two oil casks, and several other articles, which I could not exactly identify. The brown paint has my young man's mark upon it; I know that to be mine; I was present when he marked it.</p>

On Thursday the prisoner came into master'e shop for a pair of shears that we had to grind; I delivered the shears to him; there was only me in the shop; master met him at the door, just coming out. I was looking on the counter for the shears, and while I was looking, the prisoner was standing by the shelf that was behind the door, where the knives and forks were. He had his apron up when he went out; I suppose he put them in there. I suppose he put them in his apron while I was looking on the counter. I am sure I did not see him do any thing. I went with master's son to the pawnbrokers; I saw two small desert knives; I knew them; the prisoner's wife was offering them to pawn, and the prisoner's wife was waiting; the pawnbroker sent information to us.</p>

               <p>JOHN FEATHENSTONE. I am clerk to Messrs. Clark and Cox, on the 13th of February, I went to a person of the name of Cormick M'Coy, in Duck Lane, he complained of the beer; on his complaining, I found that was part of the beer that we fur- furnish St. Ann's, in consequence of which the two prisoners were apprehended.</p>

               <p>CORMICK M'COY. I live at St. Paul's, Shadwell, on the 11th of February, the two prisoners brought me a barrel of beer; I was to give thirty-five shillings for it. I paid them twelve shillings in part.</p>

               <p>FEATHENSTONE. I called upon Cormick M'Coy, he said what kind of beer have you sent me in. I said you gave me no order; he said your men have left me a barrel, it is so bad, I cannot draw it. I went down into the cellar with him, he

I told him I did not know that any had come; he said our men had been there and left it; it was so bad he could not draw it. The prisoners had taken it there he said. I know they had no order to dispose of it there.</p>

In consequence of what I then saw, I went again in the evening to the house; I went the back way, across the garden, there was a wheelbarrow standing at the back door, and the room door wide open; that door was fastened when I left it. I put my head, and one foot in the house, and then I saw the prisoner drawing the kitchen range along the passage; I am positive to the prisoner's person; I saw him quite plain, it was a beautiful moon light night; I went down the garden to get assistance. I returned, I saw the prisoner with the barrow; I catched hold of the prisoner; he struck me, but the next witness coming up, he gave over. I am sure the prisoner is the same man I saw with the barrow, and the same man I saw in the house, I swear positively to his person; the stove and the range were both standing down by the barrow.</p>

The prisoner got up about five o'clock in the morning; he told me he was going down into the yard, and after he was gone, I missed my things off my bed; I missed a pair of small clothes, a great coat, seven shillings and sixpence in money in my pocket, a pair of gaiters, and a large silk handkerchief.

            . On the 9th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, the flannel was standing in the flannel rack in the shop, I was behind the counter; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and lay hold of a piece of flannel and run off with it. I immediately pursued him, and took him, with the flannel under his arm; this is the flannel, there is twenty two yards of it, it cost my master twenty two shillings prime cast. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and delivered him and the flannel to

            . I am eleven years old, I live with my father and mother, my mother takes in washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Be sure you say not a word less than the truth or more - A. My father and mother lives at Chelsea Common, near the Red house. On the 8th of January, I was carrying things home that had been washed; I was to take them to Mrs. Hawkins, she lives in Couzen street, May Fair, at the back of Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got, before any thing happened to you - A. In Piccadilly. I got to Piccadilly about eleven o'clock on Sunday the 8th of January, I had these things in a bundle; I was alone, in Piccadilly, Kemp came up to me and said, do not you live in Sloane street, I was in Piccadilly near Hamilton place; I told him I lived at Chelsea Common, near the Red house; then he went on a little further and he asked me my name, I told him where I was going; I did not tell him at first, he stopped me, and asked me my name, there was nobody by him then, he then said, which is the way to Piccadilly, I told him to go round the corner, and go up there, he was not gone two minutes, he came back again, he was still alone, he said, can I go across the Park<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150049"/>I told him if he would go a little higher, he would see a street where he could go across the park; I told him where I was going, he said he would go down Couzen street with me. Then this other gentleman came up to me, that is the prisoner Renney, he said, is not your name Redkinson, and said, are not you going to Mrs. Hawkin's. I had told the other prisoner whose house, and where I was going to before this; he came down as far as Harford street, he said he had got to go as far as Harford street, in Park lane; he said, he had to go there for Mrs. Hawkins he would call there as he came back; he went a little way down Harford street, then the prisoner returned and said, never mind, I will call as I come back. I had my bundle still in my own possession he went as far with me as the iron shop in Park lane, he said, you can deliver the message to your mother as well as I can, that was the prisoner Renney, the man that came up to me the second time, the other man was gone down Cozen street; he went strait on, Renney said, tell your mother to come up, and to bring a large basket on Monday morning and she will recommend your mother to some more washing; he took my bundle, the shawl that the things were in, and said, your mother can have the shawl on Monday morning; my mother had put the things up in her own shawl; he took the bundle from my arm, and said good bye, that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look after him to see whether he joined the other or not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover that you had lost the things - A. I went back, and told my mother what had happened, and delivered this message, my mother immediately said, I had been robbed of them, I have never seen the things again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have any of the things been found since - A. No, I am sure these are the two persons that accosted me on this occasion; I am quite sure of both the prisoner's; I think on the week following, I saw them again they were walking together in King's Road, nobody was with them when I saw them again; there was a race in an open place, upon what they call Chelsea Common; I pointed them both out to Mr. Pell, in Chelsea Common, he said run and fetch your mother, tell her to come directly, my mother got a constable, Mr. Pell watched them, he is not here. Mr. Rouse the constable took them in China-row, I pointed them out, he laid hold of them I was present when Mr. Rouse laid hold of them; I charged them with having done this on a Sunday; they said they never saw me in their lives; I am sure they are the two men who came up to me. My father's name is

            . I am the wife of Thomas Redkison; that boy is my son. On Sunday the 8th of January, I sent my son to Mrs. Hawkin's, Sun court, May Fair; I sent him from my house about ten o'clock, he returned at about half past eleven, he told me what had become of the bundle; I have not found the things again; I am to pay for the things on Tuesday the 17th of January; I saw the prisoner's, I saw them in the King's Road, near us, my son pointed out the two prisoner's as being the persons that were concerned in taking the bundle from him; Mayhew kept the prisoner's in sight. while I fetched Mr. Rouse the constable, I was present when the constable took charge of them in China row. Mr. Rouse charged them with taken the linen from the boy, they said, they had never seen the boy before the boy pointed out Kemp as the person that first entered into conversation with him, and Renney who took the things away, I have never recovered my own shawl. I carry on the washing myself.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Friday evening January, the 20th, I was going on my duty, I met the man prisoner with a large basket on his shoulder a little before seven o'clock; I saw he had a basket full of coals; I took him to the watch-house, he said cannot we make it up without going to the watchhouse, I said, no, you must go and give an account of yourself there; when I took him to the watchhouse, the watchhouse keeper told him he had brought them from No. 28. Douglas-place, at the boarding school, he said yes, the cook had been down to his house in the evening drinking tea, and if he would go with her and take his basket, she would give him a few coals, he said he did not much like the job, she told him there could be no harm in it, and now he said you see what I have brought myself to; the constable of the night sent me to the Rev. Mr. Tomkin's, and Mr. Tomkins took me to Mr. Vye's house; I took the cook up she was in the parlour fastened in; I threatened to break the door open; she came out; I took her in custody, and took her to the watchhouse.</p>

On the morning of the 31st of January, about half past six o'clock, I saw the prisoners Cox and Bell close together in Mrs. Norris warehouse; I saw Gibbons go into the warehouse with a basket, and a sack in it; I saw the prisoner Cox empty two baskets into a sack, which the prisoner Gibbon's held in the basket; Cox lifted the basket on Gibbons's head; I followed Gibbons, and saw him take the potatoes to the Bunch of Grapes, public-house. This was before Mrs. Norris came down stairs. When Mrs. Norris came down stairs, and asked the servants if they had sold any, I went, and got the potatoes, and had the prisoners taken into custody.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I went in company with my father and Limbrick with a search warrant to the prisoners house in Field Lane. On the 2nd of February, a warrant was taken out to search for other things; in searching, we found these sheets wet, we found two of them; the prisoner was in the same room where I found these two sheets up stairs. Limbrick can produce the other sheets. I produce one sheet marked and the other not marked. I told the prisoner I apprehended him on suspicion of stealing these sheets; he said he bought them; I saw two footsteps at Mr. Hobler's Garden, they appeared to have got in the back way.</p>

On Monday, the 23rd of August, 1813, I was standing opposite Mr. Fisher's field, at half past seven, two men came to me, and asked me whose sheep they were; I told them. They told me they were going to take twelve out the next morning. I told Mr. Eland of it, a sheep salesman, in Smithfield market.

He said he could not write unless I did that. I fetched him in a glass of gin, and a sheet of paper, and as soon as I came into the room, I missed a tumbler off the press, I gave him the sheet of paper; he sat down and wrote it; he then wished me to go to this gentleman's house; he said, I should bring home some sheets and blankets, at No. 8, Brunswick-square; I refused going at that time in the evening, I was afraid he was no good, and my missing the tumbler I wished my husband to get up, that I might get the umbrella from him before I went out; I was afraid to say any thing to my husband, he being dangerously ill in bed. I got my husband up. The prisoner lifted his hand up, and took my shawl from off the line; my husband laid hold of him, and desired me to get a constable; my husband saw him do that; the prisoner twisted the shawl up, and put it in his pocket; I went down stairs, and fetched Mr. Broad up stairs; then the prisoner dropped the shawl close behind him; Mr. Broad took the tumbler out of his pocket.</p>

On Thursday, the 16th of February, the two prisoners came in to pledge a shawl; I had some things laying at the end of the counter; I was busy for some time; I had just marked them ready for putting into the window, and I was at the window putting some things in when the prisoners came in; I took in the pledge of them; they went away. After they were gone, I turned round to put the other things into the window; I missed two pillow-cases. I understood from their discourse that they were going up to the Sessions House; I immediately went there; not finding them there, coming from Clerkenwell green, I met a constable that I mentioned the circumstance to, he said he would give a look out. I knew the woman before; I am quite sure they are the two woman; the constable found them on them, with my private mark inside, the ticket outside.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 16th of February, I met Mr. Wright, he told me he had been robbed of a pair of pillow-cases at home. As I came up from Clerkenwell green, I met the prisoners coming down; I saw they had got something looking at under a shawl; I saw something under the shawl; they went up a passage; I went up the passage; they were looking at these things; I went up to them, and asked them what they had got there; Deane said she was going to purchase them. I asked them if they were hers; she said, yes, and after that, she said they were her mother's, she had just fetched them from the manglers. I catched hold of them, and asked them to let me have a sight of them as they were going to sell them. I unfolded them, told them it was the property I was looking for; I detained them on suspicion of felony. These are the pillow-cases.</p>

He offered to give me any thing to release him, I took him to the watchhouse. This is the piece of timber,</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. I am acting manager for the Company. I have the care of these pieces of timber. I believe the piece of timber produced, to be the Company's timber; I cannot swear it.</p>

I called the prisoner down for the keys, and asked him if he had any more work-boxes than what I saw in the cutting room; he denied any more boxes in the house. I asked him whose box that was; Squires said, it was his box, it contained nothing but his clothes; I pulled out an old coat, and under that coat was a lady's work-box, half a skin of morrocco leather, and three steel spring purses. Squires said they were his master's property; he allowed it was a wrong place for it to be in. We went a little further, and between the sacking and the bed of an old bedstead I found five skins of leather, as we have them from the leather dresser at Bermondsey, and some pocket-books of a large size.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday I went to Mrs. Morgan's; in the top shop I found a work-box, and three steel spring purses. I found five skins in a room where there were some property concealed, and on looking a little further, I found as many materials as would make twenty large gentlemen's pocket-books, ready cut up, secreted under some clean paper; in the top shop was this box, those purses; the leather I have kept locked up ever since. The next morning I went to the watchhouse, I said Squires, I have got a box out of your box; he said, I know you have. This is the box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the same box I found in Squires box, it is my property, and all the property now produced is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master in his life time gave me that box to finish one month before he died; my master told me to put a top pocket to it, and to keep it till he called for it; that box had been in my box a month before my master died; I did not place it in my box with any intention to defraud my mistress of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a copper bowl at any time - A. Yes, on the 11th of February, about one o'clock in the day; it was a bowl that I made myself; I left my house about eleven, and returned at one; I saw the prisoner running down Broad-yard, with my bowl in his hand; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to sell it. I said, sell my bowl, you rogue; I snatched it out of his hand; he ran away; I after him; I catched him in Castle-street. This is the bowl; it is mine, I am certain of it, it is worth seven or eight shillings.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH LINTON. I am a widow, I live at No. 3, Bowman's-place. I lost my coat, three basins, three cups and saucers, and a bowl. The prisoner came to me on the 3rd of February, she brought me some things to mangle; she said if I could accommodate her with a bed until the family came home; which I did. I missed the articles in the indictment, and then I told her to go away.</p>

She denied having them, and said, she had delivered them to a girl that described the things in the bundle she gave them to her; she said the woman that mangled for her had sent the little girl for these things; I enquired where this mangle was, she said in George street Union place; I went directly there; I asked the woman if she had sent any girl for the things, she said, no, she had not; I went to the prisoner,

I did; I took the cook and the house maid to Queen-square office, Mrs. Vyse came forward and gave her a good character, therefore I dropped it until I heard she was taken into custody, and as I had not found the clothes, I had to make them good; I got a search warrant, Gillmore the officer searched her box, and found an apron remaining, and a pair of stockings.</p>

            's. On the 23rd of November last we sent a few things to mangle, and on the 24th, Webber brought some mangling home; I asked Webber what the money was, she said three pence, I paid the money; in a short time afterwards, the prisoner came home, she said, they were not our things; the prisoner went to our manglers and told her she had not sent our things, the Mangler delivered up our bundle, she paid her for them. On Saturday morning, a girl came for the things that had been left by mistake, the prisoner asked her what they were; the girl described them, the prisoner delivered them to her: Webber came afterwards, she was told they had been fetched away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you quite sure a girl came to whom this bundle was delivered - A. Yes, I mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Gillmoor. This is the apron I found in Morgan's box.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dunn. Is that the apron you gave to Webber to mangle - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Webber. This is the apron I received from No, 27.</p>
               <p>Smith. This apron the prisoner lent me, I wore it on August the 20th; I am sure this apron, I saw in the prisoner's possession, long before this took place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you say that before the magistrate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dunn. Look at that apron, and describe what you know it by - A. I am positive it is my apron, I darned it here myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Mr. Vyse's on the 14th of October, on the 15th, my fellow servant borrowed it of me, I darned the apron myself, my fellow servant saw me darning it, that apron was made out of a petticoat, and one of my gores are in it now.</p>

When I returned on Tuesday morning, I found three parts of one piece of bockilow gone, in that part there were one hundred and sixty-nine heads gone; on the over night the heads were there; I had a man to watch all night, his name is Watson.</p>

               <p>COURT. Gentlemen of the Jury; the indictment must be made out with satisfaction to you, that it was done in the night, at the time that Mr. Potts came to the ground there had been day light some time; by the evidence it is impossible for you to say when it was done; it is for you to determine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of salts any time - A. Yes, yesterday afternoon, about four o'clock; they were on a table in the shop; they were worth four shillings. I was backwards, and a person in court came running, and telling me that the salts were gone; I went, and found the prisoner up a gateway; the prisoner was putting the salts down his pantaloons, he had got one down to his ancle; he appeared as a working man then, as he does now; I should not have had any suspicion of him; he pleaded so much distress, if he had delivered them up, I should have forgive him, but he swore he had not the other so many oaths, that I would not forgive him; he never was out of the constable's sight I believe.</p>
               <p>JESSE PHILLIPS. I am a constable. I was going by the prosecutor's house on the opposite side of the way; I saw the prisoner take the salts off the table; I called Wyman out, and told him he was robbed; Wyman followed the prisoner across the street up a gateway, and took the salts from him one at a time; the prisoner denied that he had taken the other; he gave up one, and kept the other; Wyman found the other at the bottom of his pantaloons. These are the salts.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my salts.</p>

               <p>JOHN RAY. On the 18th of January, I observed the prisoner in High-street, Aldgate; I watched him; I saw him go into Mr. New's, a stationer's shop; in a little time he came out; I went in, I made some enquiry of Elizabeth Church; she produced me a shilling. I followed the prisoner, and took him into the Blue Boar Inn; I found three counterfeit sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know much about money - A. I do. In his coat pocket I found sixteen pennyworth of good copper, and three good sixpences; these three counterfeit sixpences were put in a pocket by themselves; in his other pocket I found a quantity of good silver, about twelve or fourteen shillings; the good money I returned to him, that he has had; there was a small quantity of tea and about twopenny of soap.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CHURCH. Q. You live at Mr. New, the stationer's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the prisoner coming to your shop - A. Yes, I do; he came for two sheets of brown paper and a pen, he put down a shilling; I gave him ninepence change; Ray came in, and asked me what the man had changed; I produced the shilling; he desired me to mark it; I gave the same shilling to Ray, that I am sure I received of the prisoner, and no other. This is the same shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly did change a shillings with her.</p>

            . I am clerk to the solicitor of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that shilling - A. It is a counterfeit; it is merely washed, it is quite fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ray. Hand over the sixpences - A. These are them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sewell. They are all counterfeits; they are quite new.</p>
               <p>Ray. The sixpences were in paper, and the paper folded over each of them to prevent their rubbing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of paying money at the Excise Office for brokerage, and in the habit of paying money at the Chronicle Office, and the Star Office. I always look, over the money; I am very cautious what money I take; I thought they were three bad sixpences, I put them in paper not to offer them to any person; the reason of my putting them in paper was not to offer them to any body; I put them in my coat pocket; the shilling I thought was a good one. I wanted to buy two fish at the corner of Petticoat-lane to send to Ilford, I went back to this lady's house to get two sheets of brown paper to put them in, and likewise a pen to put the direction on the paper; when I came out of the shop with the paper, this gentleman went in; I went away; I was gone no great while, I had not reached Petticoat-lane, this gentleman beckoned me; I voluntary went back. He searched me, and returned me the bag, containing three dollars and two three-shilling tokens; I considered these three sixpences doubtful; I would not offer either of them for the paper; I knew I had halfpence, but it was extremely difficult for me to get at them; I am an old man. When I went back to the lady, I said I was very sorry for giving her the shilling.</p>
