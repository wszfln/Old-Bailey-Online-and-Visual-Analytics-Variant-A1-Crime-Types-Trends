Last Wednesday night, about nine o'clock, as I was coming out of my master's shop, which is behind the house, I saw the prisoner and another man up at the one pair of stairs window; one of them, I know not which, had his head in at the window, the other was assisting him to get in. They dropped down, and one said, d - n her a b - h, she will not come. I said, Who will not come? One of them struck me; I called out for help. One ran up Church-yard-alley, the prisoner made up Fetter-lane. I ran after him, and called Stop thief! when in New-street square, he turned about, and attempted to strike me; then he ran again, and went against a man on horseback. He swore to me, D - n you, I'll stop thief you. He was stopped by a man, and we took him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210003"/> the watch-house. Going into the watch-house, he dropped some wet linen, which I saw in his left hand under his coat; I took it up, and gave it to the constable.</p>

            . Last Wednesday night, a little after nine o'clock, I was at a public house with some friends. A little girl came and said, I had been robbed, and they had catched one of the thieves She ran down Shoe-lane to shew me where the prisoner was; there I saw my apprentice have the prisoner by the collar. I sent for Mr. Bell, the constable, and we took him to the watch-house by St. Andrew's church. Just before he went in he dropped this wet linen. My apprentice took it up. The constable searched him in the watch-house, and found two silk handkerchiefs upon him which were dry, (the linen that he dropped was wet.) The prisoner said, Give me the handkerchiefs again, they are my own. They must get over a wall eight feet high to get into my yard. They had unbolted the gate on the inside to secure a retreat. It had been bolted a little before; my maid was hanging up wet linen to dry in a two pair of stairs room at the time. This linen may, or may not be my property; I cannot swear to it, not being marked. I don't know that any of my linen is marked.</p>

               <p>Jer. Neal. I live in Ratcliff-highway. I lost the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) on the 19th of December. I found one of my shirts on the prisoner's back, the evening Mr. Wyn stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wyn. I keep a sale-shop. The prisoner came to my shop, and told me, he was an unfortunate man that had lost his ship in Yarmouth-roads. He appeared in a creditable manner. He brought this cardinal, and asked me a guinea for it. I said, You never bought it, or you would know better what to ask for it. He said, his wife bought it, and she was dead. I gave him seven shillings for it. Two or three days after, Mrs. Neal came to my house and described it. I shewed it her, and she swore to it. I said, if the man comes again, I will stop him. The prisoner came again, and I stopped him, and before the justice the prosecutor owned the shirt he had on; and the justice ordered him to take it off.</p>

I do not know the prisoner. The other was an Irishman, named Maden; he is an evidence. He rifled my pockets, and took my two pence halfpenny. The other person desired him not to take it. Maden said, D - n the bougre, it will serve me to buy a pint of purl. He had a stick in his hand. Then he looked at my legs, and saw I had an old pair of boots on. He bid me pull them off, and said, if I would not, he would. He pulled them off; I believe the other person at that time laid his hand on my shoulder; then Maden took my coat off, and said, D - n your eyes, you bougre, let us have the handkerchief from your neck.</p>

               <p>Summer. I did not see any thing in his hand; all the words I heard him say, was when Maden was pulling my boats off; then he said, Pull them off; make no words about it. The same night I met Maden in East Smithfield, with my boots on: I collar'd him; he struck me, and I struck him; we were up and down several times. At last he stripped himself out of his jacket, which I had hold of, and ran away. He was taken the next day by one of Justice Fielding's men.</p>

The evidence came up to me. It was a very moon-light night; he had a stick in his hand; he clapped it across my breast, and bid me stop, and said, Give me your money. I said, I have none. He said, Give it me, and don't look about you. I gave him a six-pence. He searched my right hand pocket, and took out a green silk purse, with a silver two-penny piece, two silver pennies, and a pair of Bristol-stone studs. He said, I had more, and made use of many bitter words, and said, You bougre, you have more money yet. He took out some, (I heard it chink) he said, Here is some cash here. He called Nicholls, and bid him search me. Nicholls took one buckle out of my shoe, and the evidence the other; they were plated buckles. Then he bid Nicholls take my hat and look at it. Nicholls took my hat and looked at it, and gave me his, and put mine on. Then the evidence said, You have a good coat on, we must have it. Then Nicholls pulled one sleeve off, and he the other. Nicholls doubled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210006"/> it up, and took it upon his arm. Then the evidence said, You have a good pair of buck-skin breeches on, we must have them. No, said Nicholls, don't take them, let him go about his business. Then Maden said to Nicholls, Deliver me my pistol. Whether they had one or not, I don't know; I saw none. Then they bid me go along, and make no noise, and left me. They did not use me ill. I never found any of my things again. They both of them had blue jackets on, and the evidence had a pair of boots on.</p>

               <p>Wil. Mylam. On the 26th of December, I was called out of my work-shop, and told I was robbed. Some of my neighbours brought the prisoner back; he would not stand search: I bid him go about his business. He went away, and they brought him back again in about five minutes time. They told me where my things were. I went with them into Old Gravel-lane, and saw my things lying in a shop on a counter. Then we took them to my house. I took the prisoner before Justice Camper, who made his mittimus to Newgate.</p>

               <p>I buy old clothes about London. I was in Old-Gravel-lane; a woman called to me, to know if I would buy a looking-glass. I bought it for seven shillings and six-pence. I went into a shop to buy some tea, and desired the gentleman to let me put them there till I came back. I was going to buy some goods. I went to that broker's shop to buy a bedstead. We could not agree for it: there they took and searched me: nothing was found upon me. They offered to make it up if I would pay a guinea and a half, and I would not.</p>

               <p>Kennet Dixon. I live opposite Galley-key in Thames-street, at No 47, and am a merchant's agent and porter at the water-side. On the 20th of January I was in my own warehouse, a person came to me, and said, Mr. Dixon, if you don't take care, you will lose a piece of linen out of a chest; my window looks directly on the chest. It was what we call Pomerania linen, or narrow German. I looked, and saw the prisoner take it, and detected him with it. At that time I did not know whose it was, but now I do. (Produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210008"/> in court, and deposed to.) I had hold of him before he let it fall. It is the property of May and Cothoi, merchants in Fenchurch-street.</p>

I went home immediately, and found those things missing that are laid in the indictment; some of them we have found again at different pawnbrokers. I was informed somebody that belonged to the house did it; I had a suspicion of the prisoner. I took her up, and found a pair of my stockings on her legs; this was the 30th of January. She lodged over my kitchen. She denied the charge utterly. Mr. alderman Harley thought it a matter of little consequence; he then discharged her. She went to lodge at a particular friend's of my own mother's by which means we came to a farther knowledge. I took her up again; she then owned it, and by her directions I found at three different pawnbrokers a shirt and a handkerchief that I can swear to, four linen shifts, six linen aprons, six handkerchiefs, a pair of black stockings on her legs, two soosee handkerchiefs, a shirt, three yards and a half of linen cloth, and two napkins.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barker. I had been out and returned about five o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of January. I could not get in; the prisoner ran down, and asked me, how I did? While I was trying at the padlock, she pulled it and undid it: I went to go into the parlour, and found my door open, and the things in a confusion. I found the wood of my closet was broke, which I had locked at my going out. I missed the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them.) We have found them all but four handkerchiefs, and one apron, and one shift. She produced one shift and two napkins out of her drawers. (The things found produced and deposed to) They were found by her directions at three different pawnbrokers, except what she produced.</p>
               <p>Wil. Windsor. On the 27th of January the prisoner pledged this piece of new cloth with me. (Holding it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>The other pawnbrokers deposed the prisoner pledged the other goods with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>They came and told me they had a suspicion I had robbed them. I showed her my stockings on my legs, and told her I bought them in Field-lane. I went with her there, and the woman was frighted, and said, I did not buy them there. I was put in the Compter, and brought to be re-examined. I said, I had carried some things to pawn, to raise money for my husband. I did not open the door; but I took a bundle that was upon a chair. I shut the door after me. Mrs. Barker promised me I might make use of that bundle to fetch my things out of pawn.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I met the prisoner between three and four o'clock that morning, in Pick-ax-street, with a new board on his shoulder. I suspected he had stole it from this new building in Fan's-alley. I went there to see, and found a breach made, and another board loose. I put out my candle, and watched to see if any body would come for that. The prisoner came back in order to take it, and I stopped him. I got him into an alehouse, under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210009"/> pretence to give him some purl, and sent for the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Q. Does your warehouse join your dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No; it is cross the yard from my dwelling house; it joins to my kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body sleep in that part?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No; I missed some cheeses; there being a great quantity, I cannot tell how many were missing. My servant seeing mark of feet upon some coals, told me of it I went into the cellar, and saw it myself; they led to the hole where the jack-weight went down. I went into my warehouse above, and saw marks of feet on some cheeses. The prisoner Wild had lived with me about two months, and had been gone but the Sunday before. I suspected him. I ordered the watchman, if he saw any body about there, to secure them. On the Monday, the watchman called me up before twelve at night, and told me, he had got one of them. He had got a boy. I examined him if he was not concerned with Wild? He said, No, he never was; but he had told him, he could get up a hole and get things; and he had received some nutmegs from him. Then I went w ith the watchman to the woman's house at the bar, where Wild lived, and called him to get up; he was some time before he did. When I charged him, he cryed, and desired to speak with me backwards. He then told me he had taken a cheese. Soon after he said he had taken two, and that they were in that house. We found one in the cellar cut in two, and about three pounds of it gone. The man of the house declared his innocence; he went up stairs to his wife. The other cheese was found in his bed-room, but I was not by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not the man indicted, and not the woman?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Wild charged her only, and said, she told him, she would find a secret place to put what he brought.</p>
               <p>The watchman confirmed that of Wild's confession, and finding the two cheeses.</p>
               <p>Stevens junior gave the same account his father had done.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners denied knowing any thing of the cheeses.</p>

I said, home, will you go with me? but with no intention to have her with me. As soon as the word was out of my mouth, Duncken came up and knocked my hat off my head, and Carral took it and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Evans. No; I had never seen either of them to my knowledge. I followed them, and called stop thief! Duncken turned about, and threatened to knock my brains out if I made a noise. I followed him at a distance, full the length of the street, behind, and saw him by the light of the lamps. There were very few people stirring: I met a man. I told him, that man had stole my hat. he went up to Duncken and told him, that man says you took his hat. Said Duncken, You see I have no hat about me. Said the man, then you had better stop and clear yourself. Then a watchman came up, and he was taken and carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk?</p>
               <p>Evans. I do not remember he ran; he walked a pretty quick pace.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you lost your hat, before you took the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Evans. This might be ten or twelve minutes from first to last. I described the man that ran away with my hat, and my hat; and Carral was taken the Tuesday following by the same watchman. I was sent for before justice Welch; he had my hat on his head; I have it here.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you quarrelled with either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Evans. No. I did not see which way they came from; they came all on a sudden.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of February instant, the prosecutor called, Watch! I made up towards him; but he being in another parish, I went no farther. I heard a dispute between the prisoner and him; the prisoner threatned to dash his brains out if he made any noise. After that I went and took Duncken into custody. The prosecutor said, he and another had robbed him of his hat. Duncken owned Carral and he had been together. We took him to the watch house. After that I met with Carral, knowing him before; and the prosecutor had described him. He made his escape out of a public house; but on the Tuesday night after, he was stripped to fight another man, and I took him. He had the prosecutor's hat, which he had put off with his clothes. I asked him how he came by that hat? He said, he had lost his own, and he found that in the street. coming up Holborn. At first he said, he would be evidence against Duncken; but afterwards said, he would clear Duncken, and himself also. I have known Carral many years; he and I went to school together.</p>
               <p>Jos. Brown, another watchman, confirmed the evidence given by Chapman, as to the taking both prisoners, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I never saw my prosecutor in my life before; he was coming without a hat on. I walked along; he came behind me, and said, You are the man that took my hat off. I said, Here is a watchman, I am willing to go with you to him. I know nothing at all about it.</p>

We had them examined before Justice Miller; he granted a warrant to take the man at the bar: he was committed and brought up again to be re-examined. It was reported the watch was thrown into the kennel; then the soldier gave me the key of a little box, and sent me to his room where he lodged.

Colebeck, Murphy, and I broke this house open; about one o'clock that morning Colebeck and I tried to wrench open the shutter; but could not: then we went to the area and wrenched open a shutter there: then he desired me to hand him over the burner from the lamp, which I did. Murphy was standing by the watch-house to watch. I brought out a clock, silver spoons, a punch ladle, and several things that I cannot recollect; then Colebeck took and carried them to

               <p>Robinson. I was there informed so. He lodged with one Bush that had been an accomplice of his before; under his pillow I found this pistol (producing a pocket pistol) under the suit of clothes that the prisoner has now on, and in a box in the same room was this hand crow. (Producing an iron crow about eight or nine inches long, with two claws). I found also this stock and two center bits (produced in court, one of the bits bigger than the other), and this brass box with tinder, flint and steel (produced in court ): when I brought them to the alehouse to him, said he, I hope you have not meddled with my toggs ( meaning his clothes). I asked him if the clothes were his; he said, Yes. Then I went and took them, and found the buttons were all plate. (I thought they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210014"/> might be some matter of evidence). He was taken to the Justice, and his clothes were returned him.</p>

            . I went with the prisoner to Justice Welch's. I carried the clothes there. The evidence and he were both put to the bar together. The Justice said to Crookhall, Now ask him whether he knows any thing of Mr. Nightengall's house being robbed. Crook-hall asked him and bid him speak the truth; he said he did, and that he was down the area, and he also had two guineas of the money, for what the things and clock were sold for; that they had from Mr. Nightengall's the man of the house where he lodged, who was taken up and examined but was set at liberty. He gets his living in the same way. He is in no visible way of getting his bread.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. My daughter went up with me and locked me into the closet and carried her father the key; there is no key-hole on the inside. After I had been there about two hours, or more, Linsey came to the door and shook it as if he would have shook it to pieces; then he stopped a little and shook it again; he had something in the key-hole, what I cannot tell. Then he shook it again, and the door flew open. I said, Is it you, and called out and knocked with my foot; then they came up and he was taken and examined; he confessed he had taken four shillings that week, and had been there twice before and no more. The prisoner wanted to make his escape.</p>

There being a great croud, I had an order from Mr. Garrick to attend the house this being the Queen's birth-day. I saw the prisoner by the side of this lady, and, to my apprehension, he took something out of her pocket. I saw a box in his hand which was thrown down and trod-upon. (The snuff box produced; he takes it in his hand). I cannot say this is the same. I called Mr. Rogers, and we apprehended him. I took this box up by the side of the prisoner; then we took him into the lobby. He was not willing to be searched in the play house. We took him before Sir

He told me, he saw the prisoner take the piece of cloth out of Mr. Saxby's shop. The prisoner said, he was not the thief. The Jew said, You are the thief; I saw you take it out, and give it to another man at the door.</p>

When he came to Mr. Hales's window, he took a pump from the grate, and clapped it under his waistcoat, near the waistband of his breeches, on his left side, and was walking on: I was within a yard of him. I collared him directly, and said, You rascal, how came you by that pump?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210017"/> He said, he did not take it. I took him back to Mr. Hale's house. He had not gone with it above three or four steps. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

I called out, I was robbed. The two prisoners were soon taken, and the things and dish brought back. (Produced in court.)

I had sent a little girl for some beer: she, on coming in, said, she met a woman with some bottles in a tub, coming up out of my cellar. I went out, and there was the prisoner. She had them in a tub with which she cries about for kitchen-stuff. I desired her to bring them back; there were thirteen of them. She said, she had bought them of a servant. She would not go back for some time. She persisted she bought them. I sent for a constable: then she began to cry, and fell on her knees, and implored mercy, and acknowledged the fact. She said, she was necessitated to go down into the cellar to make water, and the D - l tempted her to steal the bottles. That door is usually open in the day-time.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Potter. On New-year's day, about eight at night, or a few minutes after, I heard a noise in the house. I went down and saw the doors open. I then went and looked in the parlour, and found all the place was gone. I went and called in neighbours to search the house, but we found nobody in it.</p>

            . On Friday seven-night in the afternoon, a gentleman came to me, and asked me, whether or not there were some people in the information about the coiners, that were not taken? I could not inform him. I took him to the justice: he made information against the prisoner's wife and one Morris. He imagined the prisoner to be Morris. There was a warrant granted. He said to me, You must use some stratagem, or you will never get into his house. There is a door to go in under an arch-way, and when people knock at the door, he looks out at a window and fees who it is, before he will let any body in. I made up a piece of paper in the form of a letter, and sent Mr. Taylor with it as a porter. I said, Knock at the door, and if he looks out, tell him there is a letter for him. Mr. Taylor went and knocked at the door: the prisoner looked out at the window, and asked who was there. Said Taylor, Sir, is your name Martin? He said, yes. Said Taylor, I have a letter for you. The prisoner came and unbolted the door, but it was fastened with a chain, so that it opened about nine inches. I put my knee in, and said, Mr. Martin, open the door. He would not for a long time; but at last he did. I went in, and up stairs, and in searching on the top of a shelf in a closet, I found this plate, all but the milk-pot and tea-tongs. (A silver half pint, a silver pint, a silver pepper-castor, a milk-jug, a punch-ladle, five table spoons, tea-tongs and boat, produced in court.) The others I found in the house.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These I believe to be my property. Here is a private mark which I made myself on the half pint. I don't absolutely swear to the spoons; they have taken the cyphers almost out. I have one here which matches with them, which they did not take, which makes the half dozen complete. Here is a bruise on the milk-pot, by which I can swear to that. I can swear to all but the spoons; and I believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

            . The prisoner sells watches and things. I have known him nine or ten years. I am a peruke-maker, and live at Marybone. On the 15th of January last, I carried him home a new wig, between ten and eleven in the forenoon; he lived on Millbank, Westminster. There was a man they called Arnold, and a good deal of plate on the table, and a pair of scales and weights. There was a pint pot, a half pint pot, some spoons, some foreign pieces of silver, and broken buckles. This person they called Arnold, asked five and eight-pence an ounce for it. Mr. Martin said, it was too much. At last they agreed for five and six-pence, and Mr. Martin paid him the money upon the table. Then I tried the wig on, and he paid me for it, and I gave him a receipt. I was served with a subpoena to come here. He paid me a guinea for the peruke; and I believe he has the receipt in his pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that Arnold before?</p>
               <p>Lee. I believe I have seen him before. I did not then know his name; but when he was going away, the prisoner said, Mr. Arnold, I wish you a good morning.</p>

            . I live in Holborn. I spent my evening on New-year's-day, at the White-horse in White-horse-alley. I went there about six, and staid till ten. Mr. Martin was there; I remember he had a pint or two of beer before I came in. He staid there all the evening, as long as I did. He might go out to make water, but I don't remember missing him. I think he went when I did, and took his leave of me at my door, at ten, or a quarter after; I remember it by being come home from Birmingham on the day before.</p>

               <p>Q. to Bond. Was you present before Sir John when the prisoner was examined?</p>
               <p>Bond. I was. Sir John asked him, how he came by the plate? He made no answer. I found some watch-cases in a desk at his house, and a gentleman has seen them since, and owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out this prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Bond. By a hand-bill from Goldsmith's-hall, that he had had dispersed about. I could perceive the spoons had cyphers on them, but were in part filed out, which made me suspect the plate was stolen; so I brought that and the prisoner away together. When he was examined about the plate, he did not mention a word about buying it of Arnold; neither did he mention being in company with this last witness. All he said was, he desired Sir John would discharge the woman that he lived with: he said, she knew nothing of his affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you at the prisoner's examination declare the time you lost the plate?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did; and that in the prisoner's hearing.</p>
               <p>Jos. Lucas. I live in Litchfield-street, and am a watchmaker. I have dealt with the prisoner nine or ten years; he dealt in Lancashire movements. He did live in a court opposite Tavistock-chapel; and the last place I knew him at, was near the Middlesex-hospital, at Marybone. I always believed him to be a very honest man.</p>

I went to the Coach and Horses in Whitechapel; there was the prisoner and another woman with her; they asked me to drink; after I had drank, the prisoner asked me to treat her with a dram: I told her I had no money. She asked again; I told her, if she would get me change for a guinea I would treat her with a dram. I gave her a guinea; she went and brought some change, but it was not right; she said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210020"/> was: I said it was not. I never minded it but put it in my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I had had two glasses of brandy and part of a pint of hot. I was a little in liquor, but not much. She saw I had other money in my purse. I came out there, and was going home; she followed me, and said she wanted to speak to me. I went up <placeName id="t17700221-39-crimeloc228">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

She began fumbling about my breeches: then she said, There is somebody coming: then she went away about a couple of yards and came directly. After some little time she said again there was somebody coming, and ran to the corner of Petticoat-lane: as soon as she got to the lane, I clapped my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket-book; then I felt in my breeches-pocket and missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Edwards. In all it was 20 l. 6 s. 10 d. It is impossible to tell what species of money it was, I had some at one house and some at another, and gave change at some places. I know I had fifteen guineas, two moidore, two half guineas, a six-and-ninepenny piece, and two quarter guineas. I ran to the corner of Petticoat-lane, and looked about Whitechapel, but could see nothing of her. Then I went to the Three Jolly Weavers; there I found her and the other girl. I took her to the Coach and Horses, and told her she had robbed me. She said she had not seen me, and had never been out of the Coach and Horses with me, and had just then come from the Coach and Horses. I know I had my money in my pocket after I got to the corner of Petticoat-lane. Nobody came near me but she.</p>
               <p>Q. What pocket was your money in?</p>
               <p>Edwards. It was in my right hand breeches-pocket. I will not say the pocket was buttoned. I never got a farthing of it again. She never owned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He came in at the Coach and Horses, and asked me if I would drink part of a pint of purl: after that he asked me to drink a dram of gin. I would have rasberry. He gave me a guinea to change. I got change and gave it him. He said he lived with Mr. Matthews, a butcher. He went out and came in again, with his face all over mud, and said he believed I had robbed him. He knocked me down. I asked what he meant by that; he insisted upon my being searched. I was searched by a constable, and nothing found upon me.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton. I was going with a cart and some potatoes to London, last Saturday. The two prisoners desired I would let them put two baskets up in the cart. I let them. When we were come on about a mile and a half, I being in the cart, put my hand on the baskets, and found there were fowls. I took my horse and rode on to Shoreditch, and got a constable; he brought a watchman. Then it was six o'clock; they were then at the White Hart at the Stone's end; I gave charge of them. We found two dozen of fowls in the baskets. The prisoners said they bought them of two waggoners at Edmonton. I met one Mr. Pigot at Newington, who told me he had lost some; he went and looked at them, and said he could swear to several of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Two of them hens were my property; I saw them at justice Girdler's.</p>
               <p>The prisoners in their defence said they were coming to London, and met with a man at Endfield-wash, of whom they bought the fowls for 20 s. 6 d.</p>

When we came to the turnpike on the other side Buckingham-gate, I sent Mr. Taylor to keep about an hundred yards before me; and if any thing should happen, I would be up before he was attacked. Going on, I met the prisoner. I said to the person with me, I believe that is he that is gone by. I observed he had a stick under his arm. We went to the other end of the field, where I had ordered Mr. Taylor to wait. Then I told him, I believed I had met the man. We went back again. When we came near the spot where I met him, I saw a man's head looking just over the bank. I took no notice to them with me. I jumped over the bank, and saw his full body. He was leaning against a bank, looking over a hedge about five yards from me. I went up to him and said, What do you do here? He made no answer. This was about seven in the evening; it was a moon-light night. I called the others to me, and ordered them to hand-cuff him. At last he said, he was easing himself. He had this stick in his hand. (Producing a large broomstick.) It was the prisoner at the bar, I took him before Sir

            . I keep a public house in Wood-street, Westminster. On Sunday the 25th of December all four of the prisoners, and one Grant, came together to my house, between five and six o'clock in the evening: I knew Grant: the prisoners I knew nothing of. They called for liquor: I served them. They drank plentifully. I was backwards and forwards in my business. After they had drank their liquor they came out of the room where they had been, into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q What time was this?</p>
               <p>Mallard. I take it to be something after nine. By what means I cannot say they began to jostle one another, and make a sort of a riot; Grant was thrown down. I went to assist him and got some ugly knocks from some of the company; I cannot say which of them. There was

               <p>Q. What liquor had these five persons?</p>
               <p>Mallard. They had two half pints of brandy, a pot of beer, a paper of tobacco, and four half-crown bowls of punch. They behaved very honourable: they paid me for the liquor before they had it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in liquor when they went away?</p>
               <p>Mallard. They certainly were. They went something after nine o'clock. I did not go a yard from my own house after them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they sober at coming in?</p>
               <p>Mallard. I believe they were perfectly sober. They behaved like gentlemen, and had a room to themselves, and behaved quite peaceable. This affair of their riotous behaviour was in a quarter of an hour, just before their going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>

            . (A Black).</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I have been in England about twenty-six years. I am servant to a gentleman. On Sunday the 24th of December, I was at the house of Mr. Mallard drinking a pint of beer with an acquaintance. There came the four prisoners, and another man named Grant, out of another room where they had been drinking, into the tap-room. They began to quarrel. Patrick and Grant fell down; they got up again by the assistance of the landlord and somebody in the room. They wrestled again, and Grant gave Kennedy a fall; the landlord went to pull Kennedy off Grant; the others fell upon the landlord: my acquaintance said to me, Robert, we will go away, here will be nothing but quarrelling. As I was going out, I said, That is the landlord, don't hurt him. Then they struck me. They were all five upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in this quarrelling way?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. About a quarter of an hour. They tore my shirt off my back. I remember seeing the landlord down and all five upon him in the tap-room. I ran up stairs to call a brewer's servant who was coming down. I cannot say I had a blow from any one in particular; they all struck at me several times, They said one to another, at last, Get your hats and run as fast as you can, at their going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when they went out?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. This was, as I imagine, half an hour after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any sticks in their hands at going out?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I cannot say I saw any.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you live with?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I live with Mr. Blunt in Abingdon's Buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I knew nothing of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wrestling together by way of diversion?</p>
               <p>Wadeson. I really do not know that; my companion did imagine it was a kind of roguish motion among themselves to make others fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not in liquor?</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Mallard. The prisoners are like the men that were at our house, but I cannot swear to any of them. They came in about candle lighting, and staid there till about nine o'clock. They had been drinking in a room. They came out there to the bar. Three of them went out at the door, and the other two came to the bar and insisted upon having more punch; master refused letting them have it. One of them said, Let us have a guinea's worth of punch, and laid half a guinea down. Said the other, I'll cover it. One of them took the half guinea up, and he that put it down challenged another man with it. Said he, I have not got it. Then the other answered, I have got your half guinea. They threw the plaisterer down: his name is Grant. My master went to take him up. (I was backwards and forwards, not in the tap-room all the time). I did not see the whole. They got hold of a man in a white waistcoat: they all struck at him: three of them got beating the black with sticks. They were very much in liquor, but yet they had sense enough not to strike one another.</p>
               <p>Q. When three of them went out at the door, and the other two wanted to have more punch, how long did they three stay before they came in again?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. The were not absent above five minutes. They all quitted the house about a quarter after nine. They said, Take up your hats and run; and when out of the house they cried, Go your length. I saw one of them have the poker in his left hand as he went out. I cannot swear who took it. Their dress is altered, and I was too much frightened to recollect them. One of them, I remember, broke his stick, and that was the reason, I believe, that he took up the poker.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they mean by that expression, go your length?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. I cannot say I ever heard that expression before. I do not know what it meant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your master down?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. I was in the kitchen when he was knocked down. They knocked the things about in the house in shoving one another about; two of them laid hold on the black, and they beat him. I thought they were only joking when Grant and the other were wrestling. I saw one of them wring my master by the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Grant used to use your house?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. He did on Saturday nights. I saw Grant strike my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Grant that had the poker?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. No, it was not. Grant had white clothes on, and the man that had the poker had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Grant that wrong your master's nose?</p>
               <p>A. Cotterell. No, it was not. That was a man that had a white coat and red waistcoat on. Grant had not a red waistcoat. It looked to me, by the candle, to be a white coat.</p>

            . I was coming along Wood-street about nine in the evening, or a little after, on the 24th of December. The first person that I saw was a brewer's servant coming out at the door. He reeled as he came out. I thought he was in liquor: his head fell forwards, and a great quantity of blood fell from his head immediately. He fell against me. I put my hand out to give him assistance. When I got him by the arm, I supposed him. I believe, the space of half a minute. I said, Are you hurt? he made me no answer. Before I could turn myself round somebody struck me across my shoulders. I turned round immediately and saw a man at the door which struck me. I immediately made an attempt to run away. (What became of the brewer's servant I do not know). I fell with my shoulder against a post near the door. There came a blow upon the post; I suppose it was aimed at me. I got up and ran a hundred yards; a man followed me with a green coat and red waistcoat trimmed with gold or silver. He d - d my blood twice, and said, Where is my hat? It was pretty dark: the way I turned was the means, I believe, of my escaping. There were only two lamps. I do believe that man was

            . I am a brewer's servant. I was at Mr. Mallard's the 24th of December in the evening. I remember seeing the four prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210026"/> there; there were five in the whole. I came to the house about nine, and was in the tap-room; the prisoners were then in another room. I had not been in the house above ten minutes before they all five came into the tap-room. They began first of all throwing money about: they wanted half a guinea's worth of punch. The landlord desired them not to have any more. They threw some money upon the table, saying they would be half a guinea a-piece and have a guinea's worth of punch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sober or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Bliss. They might be a little in liquor; I believe they were. They wanted to lay the half guinea that was put down upon a coachman, that he had taken it up. I saw one of them take it up. Upon my saying I saw such a one take it up, the man that put it down asked the other if he took it up; he said, Yes, he did take it up, and it was all one between you and I after that, Kennedy, and the man not taken, named Grant, began hustling and wrestling: they had fall and fall in the house. Mr. Mallard hearing a noise, begged of them to be quiet, and not to have any disturbance: he strove to help Grant up, who was upon the ground, and they fell upon him. I seeing him so used, came to his assistance. I pulled one of them off him; and they fell upon me with their sticks as hard as they could; one and all fell upon me. I received several blows with sticks. I had one tooth knocked out of my head: I had one terrible blow on my head. The blows came so fast that I cannot swear to one man more than another. They continued in that manner upon me about two minutes. I had a blow upon my head that drove me into the passage, and I then got out at the door. There was a gentleman met me as I got out at the door. I did not know him, but he knew me again, and told me of it. My head bled much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the gentleman laying hold of you?</p>
               <p>Bliss. I do not. I gave a snatch away, as he told me, and got away, and saw no more of them. By all accounts they followed me out; but I cannot tell they followed me in particular.</p>

             in Old Palace yard, I can't justly say the time of night; it might be about nine o'clock; they were facing the Ship alehouse. I was going home towards Wood-street. I saw a mob; there might be seven or eight people of them. One of them in a brown coat, asked me if I wanted to rob him? I said, No. Another in blue, with a laced waistcoat, said, Let the lad alone. No, said he, I shall not let him alone; and held up a piece of iron, as I took it to be, and went to hit me. I slipped on one side towards the Ship alehouse door, and the man belonging to the alehouse pulled me into the passage. There was a coachman stood with a coach facing the alehouse door; he said, Gentlemen, you had better go about your business; and one of them struck him. There was a stone-mason at the door was knocked down by some of that company; with a cane with a brass-coloured head; the man that struck him I took to be in a blue coat and a laced waistcoat: then they made off towards the bridge, and I went home.</p>

               <p>Vincent. The man that had this iron, I think, had a brown coat on. There are not many lamps there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you formed your notion of the colour of the coats and the bit of iron at that time, or by the conversation you have had with the other witnesses since?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I formed my notion at that time. I went home, and told the same then at home. If I had thought this thing would have happened, I should have taken more notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a lamp at the Ship alehouse?</p>
               <p>Vincent. There is; and another at the next door but one: but I don't know whether the lamps at the new building were up then.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the brown coat was a furtout coat?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I think it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Grant?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I do; he works for my master: my master is the king's plaisterer.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they appear in regard to liquor?</p>
               <p>Vincent. I think they were in liquor; but I think not so far but they knew they were doing good or evil.</p>

Gentlemen, said I, I don't interrupt you in the least, why should you me? let me go home about my business. One of them said, D - n him, he is a servant, let him alone. There was a young man named James with me, he is a groom; they struck at him with a stick. There was another man came out of the Ship alehouse; they knocked him down. One of the company came up to strike me. I held my hand up, and put the stick off. The man fell backwards, and I upon him, and as I was getting up from him, another of the same company took me a blow on my head with a stick. I went to the Ship and got my head washed with some gin. It was cut to the skull. When they hit me that blow they ran away. After my head was washed, and I came out, two of them were taken; the constable or watchman was leading them down Westminster bridge. I saw one of them knock the man down; whether there were two or one there I cannot say. I left them then and went home. I swear to the knowing only Patrick Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you received the blow was it that you saw the man in custody on Westminster-bridge?</p>

               <p>Lucas. It might be about a quarter of an hour after that; that was at this hither end of the bridge. As soon as I saw the man fall, I ran after the man.</p>

               <p>Lucas. No, I imagine it was the constable of the night; I saw his lanthorn fly out of his hands. There were then many people gathered together; one of the men had boots and spurs on, he was in blue and gold; the other, when taken, was in a brown coat.</p>

When I recovered myself and got up, we ran after them, (I had lain for dead some time ) we ran up towards Westminster-bridge; walking up the bridge, we met the two Kennedys coming down again.

I know the two Kennedys particularly: as for the tall Kennedy, (that is Patrick) I swear to him; he knocked two men down at my door. I and my wife were obliged to go from my door into the house, or we must have shared the same fate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>

My boy was going over with a couple of pots of beer to one of my customers. He came in again and said, Uncle, Uncle, here is mischief going forwards. These men that were knocked down at my door, came out with nothing in their hands; that was Rowlinson and the coachman, named Lucas. My wife, my boy, and I came out, we got the two men into our house, and dressed their wounds. I saw Rowlinson and Lucas knocked down by

               <p>Quick. I believe they staid about a quarter of an hour in a riotous manner, endeavouring to knock down every body that came nigh them. They made a stroke at me, and the post-screened me, and my wife pulled me into the house. After the mens wounds were dressed, they proceeded after these men to help to take them.

               <p>Bracegirdle. No, he had not. I came to him on the bridge about a quarter after nine. I was walking up the bridge with him. Coming from the foot of the bridge towards the middle of the bridge, two men came up and ran against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts on the bridge was this?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. It was between the second and third porch; I take that to be the second that is shut up; and it was a little beyond that, on the right hand side as you go out of Westminster towards the country. I was close to him when they came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. They ran up to him and I: one of them had a came in his hand. They had been running before, but they seemed to be out of breath; they were seemingly upon a little run. They both turned about, and one struck me on the head with a cane; the other began to beat Bigby with his hands. Bigby ran backwards and said, YO-I! and called for help a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to them?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. We neither of us had said a word to them; we were walking quietly along with our backs towards them. It was the shortest of them that struck Bigby. I have seen him since, and know him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Look about, see if you see him.</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. That is the person that struck Bigby, in the blue clothes, ( pointing to Matthew Kennedy) and that is Patrick, in brown clothes, that struck me, (pointing to him.) Bigby ran back, and called for help. There came two more, I can't tell who they were. The tall one was beating of me; after he hit me with his cane he hit me with his hands. The other was following Bigby, and kept striking him at the same time, till the two men came up. One of them had something in his hand.

               <p>Q. What sort of a thing was it?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. The end of it was square: it looked like iron, about a yard long. ( Describing the length of it with his hands) It was round on the other part of it. He knocked Bigby down.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him when he was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. I was not near so far from him at that time as I am from you. (Meaning the council, which was not six yards distant) The other of the men came up, and laid hold of me. I then had the came in my hand which I was first hit with: he said, Take it out of his hands and knock his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man?</p>
               <p>Bracegirdle. I will not pretend to say I should know him. The other two prisoners look very much like the two persons that came up to the two Kennedys, but I will not pretend to swear to them. Bigby fell down flat on his back with his arms open, near me. When I was stooping to pick him up, one of the men gave me a blow over the back with something, I know not what. I had thrown the cane through the bannisters of the bridge. They all made their escape.</p>

               <p>Bracegirdle. I can't say that. When I got that blow I had not power to help him up, it had hurt my back so. A man came by; I said, My good soul, lend me a hand to pick the man up. He and one of the watchmen belonging to the bridge, named

Coming by the Bear at the bridge-foot, he struck the watchman over his forehead, and knocked him down. The watchman got up and went into the house. I could not hold the prisoner alone; he got away, and I went into the house also. Then I went to look for Bigby, and he was gone. Patrick is the tallest of the two Kennedys. I went to Bigby's house, then it was near ten o'clock, to see whether he was got home. I helped to carry him to the hospital. Then I went back, and heard the two brothers were carried to the round-house. I went there, and knew them immediately.</p>

               <p>Bracegirdle. They came up in a very short time: after that they all four ran away, but I cannot say they all went together. I saw two or three run towards Westminster.</p>

            . I was a watchman on Westminster-bridge. I remember an outcry for assistance that night. I went upon the cry as far as the lower end of the bridge on the Westminster side; there was the constable of the bridge in at the Bear anointing his head. I was on the bridge; between nine and ten o'clock the tallest of the Kennedys was leaning against the side of the bridge, beyond the centre arch.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you know him again?</p>
               <p>Best. I think I should know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Best. It is hard swearing. I cannot swear to the person. He gave me his hat to slap. I told him I could not do it. Then he said, D - n you give me my hat again. (This was at the third row from the centre). Said he, Unfortunate I am, and unfortunate I shall die. I said, Why do you say so? You seem a little in liquor, go home. He swore d - n me I should go home with him. I walked with him as far as the centre arch; he then said, D - n your blood, neither an Irishman nor a Scotchman will speak to an Englishman now. There were some gentlemen behind; they said, Why should an Irishman or a Scotchman be against speaking to an Englishman? He answered, D - n your eyes, give me a stick, I'll clear the gang-way of you all. Before I got to the bridge foot the watch word was given.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the watch word?</p>
               <p>Best. The watch word was YO-I. I went to the place as fast as I could, and found the constable that belongs to the bridge dressing his head in at the Bear. There was a mob in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they that answered to this expression of his?</p>

            . I am constable of Westminster-bridge. On the 24th of December I came from the watch-house about a quarter after nine down on the South side the bridge where this unfortunate fellow was knocked down, which was about twenty minutes after nine. I spoke to Bigby: there was a person with him. I said, Will you have a pint of beer along with the rest of the watchman? Aye, said he, I will be glad of it. I had not been gone above two minutes from him when I heard the watchman call out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210031"/> the watch word YO-I! I returned back. This was about four or five lamps from the foot of the bridge, on the Westminster side. The poor man was lying there; I helped to take him up: we set him up against the bannisters. I asked him how he did: I could not understand him. He was taken from thence, and, in about a minute after came one of the Kennedys; he had been over towards the other end of the bridge, and was coming back again. He came and stood by me: there are two brothers of them: this was the eldest (Patrick ). He had boots on and a sort of a green coat. There were people coming over the bridge said to me. That is one of the men that knocked the man down. Said I, Are you sure of that? They said they were, and would take their oath of it. I called him directly. There were two of the watchmen took hold of him. We were taking him down to the watch-house; when we came about two yards from the Bear, there was a sort of a rescue. They gave me a blow on my head. (Showing a diagonal fear about the middle of his forehead about an inch and a half long ). I was under the surgeons hands about three weeks with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you taken him when this happened?</p>
               <p>Shillitoe. I believe I had got him about thirty yards. There was no moon at that time. I cannot tell who gave me the blow; a man came up and gave it me, and the prisoner got away. I was knocked down. They took me in at the Bear. Howson and another watchman were there at the time. Bigby never watched upon the bridge before that night.</p>

            . I was a watchman on Westminster-bridge on Christmas eve. About a quarter of an hour after nine I heard the watch word given YO-I. I looked round and saw the deceased on the ground. I crossed over to assist him: I asked what was the matter. A man made a snatch at my stick. I put it out of his way, and was knocked down; then I gave the watch word; there came assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that struck at you?</p>
               <p>Hewson. I do not know. He got away; after that the tall Kennedy (Patrick) came back from towards the other side of the water. There were people that said he was one of the men that struck the deceased. The constable took hold of him. I assisted to bring him down to the watch-house. Kennedy and I fell down. The constable went to secure him, and he was struck, and so was I, but by whom I know not. He got away, but was taken again in Channel-Row.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lanthorns?</p>
               <p>Hewson. No, we had not. I saw the two Kennedys in the watch-house after that.</p>

I examined his head: there was a very large wound on the back part of his head, and it was swelled a great deal. There was a contusion and a plain fracture appeared; the skull was divided: the man lived about two hours (hardly so much) after he was brought in.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased the next day; and on examining his head I found a large confused wound on the back part, and round about much swelled. On dividing the scalp, the pericranium was covered with extravasated blood, and there was an oblique fracture which extended from the bottom of the us occipitis to the sagittal future of near seven inches in length. On dividing the skull I found the fracture had penetrated both tables,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210032"/> and went down as low as the foremen magnum on the as occipitis; there was a large quantity of coagulated blood covering the whole surface of the brain; and that part of the dura-mater, which covers and contains the cerebellum, was almost full.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think this might come by a fall or a blow?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. It was most likely to come by a blow.</p>

               <p>We went to take a walk to Westminster-Abbey: we could not see any thing to our satisfaction: we met with an acquaintance of M'Mahon's, and he took us to that house to drink: he asked for a back room and we went in there. After we drank one half pint of brandy we had more. We had beer and three half crowns worth of punch, and a penny worth of tobacco. I wanted them to go home, and said, I would give them a glass at the bar going out. There Grant and I went to wrestling: I threw him down and he me: the people interested among us and we struck at them and they at us. I went out, and M'Mahon went in again for his came: I had neither cane or any thing in my hand. As soon as we came out of Palace-yard, I ran on the Surrey side of the bridge, and came back again, and heard murder cried out. I walked along: just as I was going along they pursued me. They got me into Palace-yard, knocked me down, and took away my hat and four guineas, some halfpence and silver and my watch: they ran off. I got up to run after them; not knowing my way, I got into a place, and was taken there. My brother cried murder, and he was taken along with me. They found neither stick nor any thing on me. They tied both our hands behind out backs, and carried us to the round-house. They brought a chairman along with them while I was in Tothill-fields Bridewell, and wanted me to give them money, and they would not appear against me. I took down directions to a man that used the Ship in Old Palace-yard, and those men could not be found.</p>
               <p>M'Mahon's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of December I dined at Mr. Kennedy's house, and we four agreed to take a walk to Westminster Abbey. We met with Grant: we asked him if he would come along with us to the Abbey; he said, Yes. It was so dark we could not see any thing. Grant knowing that public house took us in there, saying there were genteel people used there. Grant said he would have some brandy. We called for half a pint, a tankard of beer, and pipes and tobacco; after that we called for another half pint of brandy, and half a crown in punch. Mr. Kennedy went to the man of the house in the bar: he gave him a guinea, and desired him to give change. He took his reckoning. Mr. Kennedy said to us, Gentlemen, I'll treat you with a glass of shrub at the bar going out. Grant was going past; we all drank a glass each. Grant came into the tap room, and fell to pulling Mr. Kennedy about; Kennedy threw Grant down; Grant made a hideous noise, and said it was not fair, and would wrestle again. There was a black man and a brewer's servant. They came and interfered directly; they both made a blow at us; I was next to the door. I opened it, and Kennedy was the first that went out, and I after him, and the rest of our companions followed us. The house is a corner house, and,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210033"/> instead of turning on the left we went strait on. I missed my cane, and went back for it; the gentlewoman gave it me. I went out to bid them all a good night. When I went out I heard a great noise in Palace-yard. When I came there, there were four fellows came up, and one of them knocked me down; who I do not know. Mr. Grant struck me in the face. I lost my hat some time, and at last I found it in the street. I lost my cane there. I desired Mr. Kennedy to make the best of our way, as their intent was to kill and rob us. We made the best of our way (not knowing our way) to Westminster-bridge. We went under an arch way: we all parted. Mr. Evans and I ran a-cross the foot of the bridge and to Channel-row. As we went round there Kennedy called to me, and said, There is a great mob that way, and you will be killed. We turned back again, and when we can to the foot of the bridge we could see nothing of them. I went thirty or forty yards from th of the bridge; there were four fellows came up, and said, Here is one of the Irish ves: somebody said, By G - d he has but a row escape for his life. The four struck at e one after another. I struggled some time; at last, as they could not knock me down, they made an attempt to take me by the breast: I put my hand out and shoved them off, and got a little wind, and off I set. There was another struck me at the foot of the bridge. I was knocked down. The man which I believe was one of the first fellows that came to me upon the bridge, was the man that made a blow at me: I moved from the blow, and the weapon that he had in his hand having no support, came to the ground. I took it up, and what should it be but this poker. There were fifty or sixty people, more or less, about it. I took it over my head, and turned upon my heel, and off I set as fast as I could, and made my escape, and never made a blow. I went to the Globe alehouse in the Strand, with the poker in my hand. Where did you get this? they said. I said I got it in Bridge-street.

             came in, and presently M'Mahon, when we proposed to go and see the Abbey; we went all four together. When we came to Palace-yard we met Grant; he was acquainted with M'Mahon: he took us to the Abbey, and after that into Dean's-yard. I thought that was not our nearest way to go home. He asked us if we would drink; we agreed to it. He took us to that alehouse, and turned around, and said, What will you drink? A tankard of beer, I said; No, said he, we will not: he called for half a pint of brandy: after the brandy, half a crown bowl of punch: then he began to try which was strongest, by turning of hands. Mr. Kennedy and he went out into the tap-room. I heard a noise. I went; there were Kennedy and Grant on the ground. Grant got up, and then he threw Kennedy. The landlord and a black interfered in the affair: they struck at us several times. As soon as we could get out we made off. I did not know my way very well. People called, Stop thief! after us. They came and stopped some; and some they let pass. I went on. I looked back, and saw the coachman near them. I desired them to come along. I did not know my way home. I saw Mr. Kennedy and his brother going the wrong way, over the bridge. I called to them. I went down a paved alley, I think they call it Fishmonger's-alley, into Channel-row. I went home to the Globe, and left them all. There was old Mr. Kennedy. I asked him if his son were come home: I was told they were not. I went and waited at the door a little while. It occurred to my mind that there was somebody taken by the watch. I went to St. Margaret's watch-house; there I found Mr. Kennedy without his hat and his brother with him: he desired me to go home to bed. I went back to the Globe: M'Mahon was there. I told him the affair: there were four or five of us went in a coach to bail them. I lent Patrick my hat. The bail could not be taken. When we came back, said M'Mahon, I do not know what to do with this poker; I am ashamed to carry it to my lodgings. I took and carried it home. I was playing at cards with my brother when the people came; I desired them to walk in; then they took me, and I was committed to New Prison.</p>

               <p>Culvertson. He had a lanthorn and stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his lanthorn and stick?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. Some people said he had a lanthorn and stick in his hand; that was when it was all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. I can't say I did, for the croud of people.</p>

             before?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. I did; I have seen him at the Globe in the Strand, but I never drank with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or a dark night?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. It was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give notice of this to any of the Kennedy's friends?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. On New-year's-day I spoke to old Mr. Kennedy. I went to the Globe in order to tell him. I was told by Morris Corner he was their father. There was an account of a watchman being killed on Westminster-bridge, and one Kennedy being robbed of his money and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210035"/> watch; and for people to come to give an account of what they knew.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think there might be round the man when he was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. There might be fifty or sixty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body attempt to take the man?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. He ran away towards the Surry side directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body run after him?</p>
               <p>Culvertson. Some ran and some walked.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John. I had a transaction last night with some people, which I think very material with regard to Bracegirdle. I had reason to think there was an attempt to prevent justice. I had frequently heard there had been offers made by him, that if they would give him a certain sum of money which he had specified, he would not give evidence. Hearing this, I desired the relation of these Kennedys would send Bracegirdle to me, that I might have some conversation with him. Last night there was a single knock at my door; no servant being at home, I opened the door myself; there I saw three very ill looking people. I was afraid to trust myself in their hands. I went out of the house with them, and called at Mr. Murphy's chambers, who was not at home. Resolving not to trust myself with them, they having a very suspicious appearance, I took the resolution of going with these three people to another gentleman's chambers, in order that he might be witness of what passed between us; that they might see I had done nothing that should impeach my conduct. When we came into the room I did not say a single, word that should be construed as a proposal from me. I said, Gentlemen, have you some proposal to make to me? if you have, let me hear, then I shall know how to act. There was Bracegirdle and two others. One of these people said, You know upon the account of Mr. Kennedy. I said, Who are you? He said, I am a friend of the witnes's. I then said, If you are only a friend of the witnes's, I had rather hear from the witness himself than you. I could get nothing from the witness himself for some time; it is evident he had some intention of making some proposal. I could not get from him his business for some time, till at last the other man interested, and said, Sir, it is about the Kennedys that are in prison, and you know, some satisfaction - I said, I did not know what that meant: what is your proposal, and what do you mean? He after some time said, He had for a long time lost his labour, not been able to apply to his business, and he thought it was very hard - and at last it came out 10 l. Upon which I said to Bracegirdle, Do you mean then from what I have heard from this man and yourself to make a proposal to me? You will refrain from giving evidence, if I will give you 10 l.? He said, Yes, I do, that is the proposal. Upon which I said, You have made application to me of a nature extremely criminal, with intent to obstruct justice; upon which I declined all conference, and departed.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom had you this account of this application having been made?</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John. From one of the relations of the Kennedys that was known to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that relation had application made to them by Bracegirdle?</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John. They said application had frequently been made, I should rather believe, not by Bracegirdle himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had another witness, but he is decoyed away, and I can't find him.</p>

On the 25th of January, between seven and eight in the morning, my servant came into my room, and asked me if I had been called up in the night, (which I frequently am) I said, No. Then she said I had been robbed. I ordered her to call my man. I went down, and saw the outward door was broke open, the pannel of the shutter cut down: they had cut the groove all to pieces, and let down the shutter, and a pane of glass cut out of the door. It is a door half glass, by which means they unbolted the door. They had tryed at the kitchen-window, but could not get in. I missed four table-spoons, a pair of silver salts, a pair of silver salt-spoons, four silver tea-spoons, two hats, some shoes, an ebony shaving-box, with two razors, and a razor-strop in it, and a pair of leather breeches. I had wore one of the pair of shoes the day before, and the plate had been used the day before; they were for common use for the table. On the 31st of January I received a letter from Justice Lane, desiring I would attend him; he believed he could give me an account of my things. I went there. I made oath to the things of mine in the indictment. (Produced and deposed to, a court produced) This is the property of my servant, named Button. Two of my spoons were found at a silversmith's in St. Martin's-court, or Round-court. The accomplice informed me where they were. There was a table-cloth also found that I had used the day before they broke my house. The spoons are at home.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Lane sent for me, and desired I would go with the evidence Tibbs in search of the prisoners. I and a brother constable went and took the prisoners, and in searching their lodgings, we found these goods here produced. Jarvis lodged in Swan-yard, that goes out of the Strand, and the other in Stand-lane. In Jarvis's lodging we found the shaving box, razors, razor-strop, and a man's hat. The two prisoners were both there. Then I left them to the care of my brother constable, and went to Millison's lodging. There I found the black leather breeches, coat, and a pair of shoes. We carried the prisoners and goods to Mr. Lane's. He examined them, and committed them for farthe r examination upon the evidence of Tibbs, and the things being found. The prisoners seemed to be very sorry for what they had done, and said it was the first offence. Jarvis acknowledged more the first examination than he did the second. Millison begged his master's pardon.</p>

            . On the 24th of January, the two prisoners and I were together at a new public-house in Gloucester-row in Knightsbridge. Then we went to Kensington; then we came back into Piccadilly; then to Knightsbridge again; then it was between one and two in the morning of the 25th of January. We got over a wall belonging to a garden, and cross the garden; then over another wall; there we found a ladder, that carried us over all the rest of the walls, among gardens. We got a shutter down of a glass door. After we had broke the shutter with a chissel, which Jarvis had, and unbolted the door, and all three went in together, we found two silver spoons, over the sink, and two more in the safe: we had two silver salts out of the kitchen closet, two silver tea-spoons, two silver salt spoons, a coat, a pair of breeches, five pair of shoes, a large table cloth, and three yards of new cloth. We staid in the house almost a quarter of an hour. We had agreed upon this house the night before. I have known Millison two years. I was apprentice to a barber, near this house. We sold the plate to a silversmith for five shillings an ounce. He lives in St. Martin's court, a corner house. We divided the money among us.</p>

               <p>I am quite innocent of the charge. My acquaintance with the evidence is very slight. This is spite for my shewing some civilities to the person he calls his wife. It was he that brought the things to my house and desired to leave them there.</p>

               <p>The evidence swore he would be revenged of me. I gave two guineas for the coat and breeches to an acquaintance of the evidence Tibbs.</p>

I detected the prisoner in Mr. Taylor's house; she had a key in her hand, which we found would open the room door where the things were taken from. We went and searched her room in a house in Holloway-lane; there people came and told Mr. Taylor they had bought things of the prisoner.</p>

I was out, and saw the prisoner and another lad looking about: I stopped; the prisoner came up to me and asked me, if I stood to hear music at the puppet show. I have known him three or four years. I went home and told my master, there were a couple of young men looking about that were bad men, and asked him to go and watch them: we saw them go into Mrs. Lawrence's house, and come out again: the prisoner came out first; then I called stop thief! they ran, and, finding they were pursued, they dropped the things; one sell, and my master ran after the other, but neither of them were taken. I and my master found the prisoner on the Tuesday after at Sir John Fielding's office, and we took him.</p>

               <p>Storer. Going on the sneak, is to go into houses that are open to take things: going on the budge, is to burst the doors open. I was acquainted with the prisoner when I used to be in bad company. (The things produced and deposed to).</p>

On the 27th she asked her mistress to go out for about an hour, or an hour and a half. She did not return till the next day between eleven and twelve: this confirmed my suspicion. Then I accused her again with taking the spoon; at first she denied it, but afterward she owned she did take it, and had offered to sell it to Mr. Wood in the Minories, who had stopped it. The next morning she went with me to him: I asked him if he had a spoon offered to him to sell on the Saturday; he said he had. I described it; he then said it is your spoon.

            . About a quarter before five in the afternoon, on the 19th of January, just before I came to Mr. Strutton's door, I saw two men take up this copper and weighed it in their hands, and put it down again. I crossed the way, thinking the copper was about going. There happened to come a dray by. I looked over the horses and saw the prisoner come up to them and put it on his head and walked along with it. I called down Mr. Strutton's cellar and told them three men had got the copper, and were going off with it. His man, named Newman, and I ran after them, and came up with the prisoner in John-street. We brought the prisoner back with the copper, and Mr. Strutton met us when the prisoner had it on his head.</p>
               <p>Newman confirmed the account he had given.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Swallow-street; there were two men offered me a shilling to carry the copper to King-street, Seven Dials. I had not got three hundred yards before they came and laid hold of me. I looked round and the two gentlemen were gone.</p>

               <p>Teesnel. He is either a bricklayer or a labourer. We went to examine the house between the hours of two and three in the morning. We were obliged to get over the iron pallisades and break the boards at the window to get in. We found the prisoner concealed up in a corner in a wash-house. We secured him. I saw another man run across the top of the tiles; he got off. In the first floor we found two parcels of lead rolled up, near one hundred weight of it; and up two pair of stairs another parcel rolled up. We went upon the top of the house, and saw the place where the lead was taken from; then we took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

He came for a guide to show me the way to Lad-lane in a coach. There were two men with us; one was the boatswain of a brig that I came home in; the other a labouring man. I had bid farewel at my lodging, and was going to Liverpool. We went to <placeName id="t17700221-71-crimeloc399">the Swan and-two-necks in Lad-lane</placeName>

I paid it; the prisoner was present when I took my money out: there was nine guineas and a half in a piece of cloth. The boatswain had cut his finger, and a doctor was trying to stop the blood. While the prisoner and I were standing at the coach door, he having seen where I put my money, he catched it suddenly out of my pocket, and ran away with it. I pursued him, but could not catch him. He was taken the next morning by the boatswain. I was sent for before the bench of justices: the man that took him found four guineas and a half upon him, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Jos. Levi. On that Sunday night, about eight o'clock, I went into the Bee-hive in Nightingale-lane. This sailor was there with two others. There were a parcel of girls of the town, I dare say twenty. The next morning I was at the Rotation (I attend there.) I there heard this man had been robbed by a man that was with him the night before, of nine guineas and a half. I saw the prisoner in Red-Lion-street. I took him up, seeing him with the sailor the night before. I went to search him: he said, You need not search me; and gave me his money out of his pocket, four guineas and a half, and three shillings and six-pence in silver. He said, he received it two days before for wages on board a ship. The prosecutor came. When before, the Justices, he was asked if he knew the man that took his money? He said, he was much in liquor; he did not know him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210044"/> He was bid to look about; he did, and said he did not see him. After one of the sailors said, the prisoner was the man; then the prosecutor said, he believed he was the man.</p>
