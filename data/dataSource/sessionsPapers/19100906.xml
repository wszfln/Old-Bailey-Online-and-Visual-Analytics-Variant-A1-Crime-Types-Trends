               <p>Mr. Forster Boulton prosecuted; Mr. Huntly Jenkins appeared for prisoner.</p>
               <p>The fraud method in this case was an ingenious variation upon old tricks. Prisoner sent ten telegrams to a woman bookmaker at Ham<lb/>mersmith, backing every horse in a race. He then waited about in the vicinity of the bookmaker's office and when the telegraph boy Prender<lb/>ville came with the ten telegrams he asked for them, and the boy, thinking that he was either the bookmaker or a clerk, gave him them. Prisoner waited until he knew the result of the race and then slipped the telegram in, which the winner was named into the letter-box.</p>
               <p>Evidence was called to the previous good character of prisoner, who was stated to be very, well connected and to have been made a tool by others who had conceived the fraud.</p>

On August 24 I went to the restaurant at 11 a. m. and remained there till 2. 30 p. m., when the officers came in. I was seated at a table with six or seven others, and a young man next to me said, "Hold this a minute," and put the handkerchief containing the coins in my pocket. He then slipped out as the officers came in. I was arrested. I said, "I knew nothing about it. "I put my hand in my pocket, felt something hard in the package, and a coin came out of the handkerchief. I said to the officer, "The dark man who has just walked out just gave me this," and handed him the package of coins. I did not say what the officers have stated. I am an English Jew.</p>

The boy was on a bed, partially dressed; he was groaning and crying with pain; he looked very emaciated and ill and was in a very dirty and verminous condition. I called in Dr. Rostand and on his advice the boy was sent to the infirmary. On July 25 I saw prisoner and told him the boy was in a very serious condition. He said, "I was not aware the boy was so ill; I own the boy asked for a doctor, but I did not think he was so ill or I should have called one in; I own I have neglected him now. "</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I called twice on July 23; on my second visit I saw your daughter washing the boy's legs.</p>

                  </persName> On July 23 I was called by Ford and went to 44, Durban Road, and saw the boy. He was in a most pitiful con<lb/>dition, extremely emaciated, and very filthy; he had not been cleaned for a long time; I did not notice any vermin. He complained of being in great pain, and was so tender that he could only be moved with the greatest difficulty; in fact, he could scarcely bear the weight of his clothes. I found his left hand was inflamed; there was a large collection of fluid, probably pus, in his right knee; the left knee was also inflamed and very tender; both ankles were inflamed; there was a large wound below the right knee, which was very septic, with several sinuses or ulcers. His condition must have been perfectly apparent to anyone who examined him; it clearly called for medical attention, and this had certainly not been given. I sent the boy to the infirmary and did not see him again.</p>

                  </persName>, medical officer of the infirmary. When I ex<lb/>amined the boy on July 24 he was in a very deplorable condition; very pale, thin and emaciated; he had a large patch of inflammation just below the right knee, which was perforated by four ulcers; there was an abscess on the right forefinger and another on the right hip. He was so weak that he could not be at once operated upon. On the 26th I opened up the leg and found the whole of the large bone of the leg bare and dead; I should have amputated the leg, but his condition was so bad that he might have died on the operating table. He had septic peritonitis and his heart sounds were almost inaudible. He died on the 28th. The cause of death was general blood poisoning from septic inflammation. If the boy had had proper medical and surgical treat<lb/>ment at the first appearance of the inflammation he might have re<lb/>covered. His condition had existed, and must have been apparent to anyone, for two or three weeks; in the separation of the membrane from the bone of the leg he must have suffered very great pain.</p>

                  </hi> I am prisoner's daughter. On July 23 when I came home from work, I found my brother George lying on the bed in his clothes; he was taken away that night. He had been washed all over the week before that and we washed his hands and feet just before he went. I do not think he was verminous. Prisoner did everything for the child, getting him nourishment and drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The boy had been ill for about three weeks. He did not cry and complain of pain; he lay very quiet. He slept with father. I did notice that his leg was swollen. I never heard him ask for a doctor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner handed in the following statement in writing: The first knowledge that I had of my son's leg being bad was when Mrs. Barker carried him down to me. I asked him then if he had had a kick or a knock; he said he did not think so. Later, from what he told me, I thought he had got rheumatics, and I sent for some medicine. Mean-time he had been rubbing it with oils. About the tenth day after his leg broke out I got some ointment to draw the stuff away from him. Then each time I asked him how he was he said he felt much better; that is what stopped me from sending for a doctor, thinking he would be all right. I should have treated myself in the same way if it had been me. The lad never asked me to fetch a doctor or I should cer<lb/>tainly have done so. It was my intention to fetch one on the Sunday morning previous to his being taken away. I contradict the statement that he was dirty and verminous; he slept with me and his two brothers in the same bed, which was brand new; none of us got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060014"/>
               <p>verminous; how could he have been? I was very particular about them keeping themselves clean. I have had a toad partner to put up with for years, otherwise things might have been different; she is also practically without mind or reason, through illness. "</p>

                  </hi>, 4, Hayward Street, Soho. On Sunday afternoon, July 10, I was going through Berwick Street. Just outside the "White Bear" I saw the two prisoners with a man named Bergman. I heard Bergman say to Michael McCausland, "We will do him in properly this time"; Michael put his hand in his pocket; I did not see what he took out, but he said, "This will do the trick. "A little later I saw Michael standing at the corner of Maidenhead passage; Byfield and a woman and Dyer came along; someone cried out, "Here they come; here's ginger Byfield"; the two prisoners rushed out and I heard a revolver shot; I think Michael fired it, but I am not sure. Byfield ran across into Tyler's Court; the two prisoners followed him; Matthew threw a beer glass and a bar of iron at Byfield, but they did not hit him. I did not follow into Tyler's Court, but I heard some more shots; looking up the court (where there was a big crowd) I saw Byfield with a life preserver struggling with Michael.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Upon my statement, Bergman was charged, and he was acquitted. I did not say at the police-court that Bergman's words were, "They are doing me properly this time"; if that is on my deposition it is taken down wrongly. What Michael pulled out of his pocket may have been a handkerchief. I did not see Byfield with a knife or dagger.</p>

                  </hi>, 57, Johnson Street, King's Cross. I know Byfield. On this Sunday morning I met him with his cousin Sue in Berwick Street. I knew he had a life preserver on him; I knew nothing of any revolver. As we were walking along near the "White Bear" I heard someone say, "There's ginger Byfield. "I saw the two prisoners and several other men. Matthew rushed out with a revolver in his hand and fired what I took to be four shots, pointed to the ground; Byfield was then in the middle of the road, six or seven yards from him. Byfield ran into Tyler's Court and the others followed. I could see up the court Mike and Byfield struggling; Byfield held the life preserver over Mike's head; I heard another two shots fired;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060015"/>
               <p>I think these were fired by Mike. Then the police came into the court, and all the men ran back towards the "White Bear"; there was a crowd of hundreds. Matthew ran through Maidenhead Passage, and Byfield and I and others ran after him. At the top of Broad Street Matthew turned round and fired two more shots. On July 8 I was in a public-house in Soho with Byfield and Bergman and Kent; there was a fight between Bergman and Byfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a commission agent; I work for a book-maker. I have been twice convicted of felony, with sentences of twelve months and one month. I never had any quarrel with the McCauslands. Byfield had told me that he was anticipating trouble with them. I did not see Lulker during the row. I think the first four shots by Matthew were fired at Byfield's legs.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant to a butcher at 34, Broad Street, Soho. On June 10 I was outside our shop when I saw two men run into Broad Street; one was Matthew McCausland, I don't know the other. Matthew had a revolver; the other man said to him, "Put that revolver down"; Matthew would not do so, but fired one shot on to the ground; he then ran into Marshall Street, followed by the other man. On July 19 I went to the police-station and picked out Matthew from a row of men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before I went to the police-station I had given a description of one of the men—I saw; I do not remember what my description was. Matthew had a cut on his face; none of the other men put up at the identification had cuts about their face. I only heard one shot fired. (Byfield was brought into court.) I do not recognise Byfield as the other man I refer to; I did not see the man's face. I am sure the revolver was in Matthew's hand.</p>

                  </persName>, 233 C. On July 10 about 2.25 p.m. I was on duty in Berwick Street when a crowd came down towards me from the direction of Broad Street. I saw Matthew rush into Tyler's Court followed by Byfield and the crowd. Byfield drew a revolver from his pocket and fired deliberately into the court. I blew my whistle and ran into Wardour Street and entered Tyler's Court at the other end. When I got there the McCauslands were at the Ber<lb/>wick Street end; there was a big crowd in the court. I got through and caught Michael at the end of the court in Berwick Street; he was bleeding from the hand. I saw Byfield run into Maidenhead Passage followed by the crowd. Having handed Michael to another officer I continued the chase through various streets until I was exhausted, and then went to the station and reported the facts. When I took Michael he said, "He shot at me while I was running away from him"; at the station he held up his injured hand and said, "Cannot I counter-charge him with this?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw Byfield when he was brought to the station; he said he had been shot, and there was a bullet hole in his jacket. I only heard one shot fired; there might have been others which I should not hear, as I was blowing my whistle and running. Only one revolver</p>

I caught hold of Matthew. While I had him in custody Byfield ran up and with the knife or dagger produced stabbed him four or five times. I released Matthew and arrested Byfield; when I had handed him to another officer, Matthew had run away.</p>

               <p>Statements before the Magistrate. Michael McCausland: "On Sun<lb/>day afternoon I was going to see my brother Matthew; we took a walk; we went through Berwick Street to the 'White Bear. 'While we were there I noticed through the door that several men were gather<lb/>ing on the pavement outside. One looked in and said, 'Here we are, if you want us. 'I knew that alluded to Matt and me; Bergman was having a fight on the previous Friday with Byfield, and Matt and I happened to come along and see it, and I suppose they thought we were taking Bergman's part, although nothing occurred while they were fighting. On going outside I saw that the men separated. Some<lb/>one made a hit at me sideways; I turned round and noticed that Matthew and Byfield were struggling in the court; Matt's head was bleeding, and I saw Byfield at close quarters with him with a life pre<lb/>server. I rushed to his assistance and separated them. I dashed out of the court with Matthew, and was arrested by Forrester; while I was standing there with him, Byfield came through the crowd and stabbed me."</p>

Forrester handed prisoner over to me and Fleckner. At the station prisoner made the following state<lb/>ment: I was in Berwick Street with my pal, John Dyer. As we passed a public-house Matt and Mike McCausland, Joe Leonard, and Sid Bergman came out and fired revolvers at us. We ran away into Maidenhead Court; then I saw later Michael McCausland in custody; I stabbed him with a knife; I then ran after Matthew, and he was in custody of a constable at Piccadilly Circus; I struck at his heart with a knife, and intended to kill him out of revenge, as he intended to take my life. The McCauslands have been trying to cause a row with me and my pal Dyer ever since July 2. "</p>

I ran through Maidenhead Court and came up with Michael, who was in custody, and I stabbed him with a knife. I then gave chase to Matthew. As I came to Broad Street he turned and fired at me, and I felt a pain in my left side; I followed him; in Golden Square he fired at me again and then ran towards Air Street and threw the revolver away; a boy picked it up and gave it to me. I kept running after Matthew, and in Piccadilly Circus I saw him in custody. I struck at his heart with my knife, and intended to kill him dead, to revenge myself, as he intended to take my life. "He then mentioned an incident of July 2, and continued, "The McCauslands and their pals have been searching for me and John Dyer, my pal, since, to cause a row. "When formally charged (as to Matthew) with causing grievous bodily harm by stabbing him with a knife, prisoner replied, "I never stabbed him; I struck him with the life preserver. "</p>

"He said, "Yes; they tried to put me out"; he pointed to the left side of his abdomen, and I found there a hole in his jacket and in his trousers and a small red mark on his abdomen. I told him he would be charged with attempting to murder Matthew McCausland by stabbing him with a knife. He said, "I am sorry I did not murder him; if I had known there was a bullet in the revolver I would have done it. Matt, Mike, and Sid Bergman came out of a public-house in Berwick Street as I was passing with Dyer, and as soon as they saw us they all commenced to shoot; Mike hit me with a bar of iron and threw a glass at me. I pulled out a life preserver and hit Matt over the head. It is all over a fight I had with Bergman the other day." Later I charged him with attempting to murder Matthew McCausland, and secondly with feloniously wounding Michael; he replied, "That first charge, sir, I did not stab him in the head; that was done with the life preserver up the court.

                  </hi>, manager to T. Guntrip and Sons, commis<lb/>sion agents, Catford. About March last prisoner opened an account with us. It is my duty to open the letters. On June 22 I received this betting slip from him signed "Guss" (Exhibit 9), backing Mer<lb/>cutio for the three o'clock at the Newcastle Meeting and Royal Realm for the 3. 10 at Newbury and 2s. 6d. each way. We always pay by the results as announced in the "Sportsman. "The two horses won their races and prisoner stood to win as the result of that week's betting £7 4s. 9d. Our week ends on the Friday and we pay on that day. On June 25 we received another letter from him (Exhibit 1), enclosing a betting slip signed "Guss" backing Crooked Answer Filly in the 2. 30 race and The Major in the four o'clock at Sandown Park for 5s. each way. Crooked Answer Filly won and The Major came in second. In the result we lost to prisoner about £1. We sent him this cheque for £7 14s. 1d. dated June 24 for balance due to him up to the week ending Saturday, June 25. The date June 24 is pro<lb/>bably an error, because the cheque included prisoner's winnings on the 25th, as is shown by this copy account that was sent to him. On July 23 I received this betting slip (exhibit 10) signed "Guss" from him backing Swynford and Vigilance, which both won. The amount shown on the ticket as due to him is £3 15s. 11d. On July 22 I received another betting slip (Exhibit 11) signed in the same way backing Bouton Rouge and Chateau Vert at Hurst Park which both won, with the result that we owed him £2 19s. 10d. All his winnings were paid him by cheque in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was introduced to us as A. H. Goddard; Guss was his nom de plume. Sometimes at the end of the week he lost and then he would pay us through George Davey, one of our agents, who had introduced him to us and who drew a commission from us in the event of our winning. I was under the impression that Mouton Rouge had won, but for all I know it may have lost and Davey sent us prisoner's money in postal orders.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. This cheque for £7 14s. 1d. is in John Guntrip's handwriting. An account of which a copy is kept would always be sent with the cheque. We did not pay on Exhibits 10 and 11 in conse<lb/>quence of information we received from the General Post Office. (Mr. Lynch here admitted having received an account dated June 25, which showed that the cheque for £7 14s. 1d. included prisoner's winnings on that date, and that Exhibit 12 was a correct copy of that account.)</p>

                  </hi>, postman, Forest Hill Post Office, At 1. 30 p. m. on Saturday, June 11, I was in uniform in the Swiss Cottage Hotel when Watson, saying he had seen me about on my bicycle, said that he knew of a way of defrauding bookmakers by means of forged date stamp impressions and that he had been doing it with the help of a postman for four years. He said that he would give the postman an envelope which he stamped at a time earlier than the race and then returned; that he Watson) then ascertained the name of the winning horse, enclosed it in the envelope, and returned it to the postman, who put it in the course of post. He asked me if I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060021"/>
               <p>could do one for him, and I said I thought I could. In accordance with the rules issued by the Post Office I reported the matter to my overseer. I afterwards received instructions from Mr. Stratford as to what I was to do. I saw Watson again on June 14. He said he had been that morning on his way to Catford to see a postman about getting a letter stamped and he asked me if I could get one stamped for his on either Thursday, Friday, or the Saturday following. I told him my hours of duty would not permit of my doing so. He offered me 2s. 6d. for each envelope I stamped and a share of the proceeds. It was I who put this postmark June 22, 1. 15 p. m.," on this envelope (Exhibit 9). At 8. 55 a. m. on that day I was in St. Jermyn's Hotel when he came in, branded it to me and asked me to get the 1. 15 stamp on it. It was unsealed and contained a blank piece of paper. We arranged to meet at the Swiss Cottage Hotel about 1 p. m. I handed the envelope to Mr. Stratford, who marked it with invisible ink. I then put on the stamp. I gave Watson the envelope at 1 p. m. and he gave me 2s. 6d., which I gave to Mr. Stratford. Subsequently Watson told me he had given the envelope to another postman. I got no winnings in respect of it. About 8. 45 a. m. on June 25 I met Watson again at St. Jermyn's Hotel. A few minutes later prisoner came in and talked to us, but not about this matter. After he had gone out Watson handed me another envelope (Exhibit 1), which I dealt with in the same way; it was marked by Mr. Stratford, I stamped it and returned it to Watson later that day on the arrival at the Swiss Cottage Hotel. He gave me 2s., which I gave to Mr. Stratford. I cannot remember whether I got any winnings out of that. I got Exhibit 11 from him on July 22 and I stamped it. I did not give it to Mr. Stratford but I manipulated the stamp so that I could identify it again. I returned it to Watson. I used to see prisoner almost every morning at the St. Jermyn's Hotel but I had no conversation with him with reference to these matters. I got Exhibit 10 from Watson on July 23 and I dealt with it in exactly the same way as I had with Exhibit 11. I cannot remember whether I got any money when I returned this to him but I generally did get something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was a butcher's assistant. He was never really introduced to me; I used to call him "Butcher," like other people.</p>

                  </hi>, messenger, G. P. O. On various dates between June 21 and July 12 I had kept observation on Watson. I had seen him frequently with prisoner. About 8. 30 a. m. on June 25 prisoner drove up in a cart to the St. Jermyn's Hotel, and Watson whistled to him. He then went into the hotel with Watson, and they stayed there 10 minutes. About 1 p. m. Watson met Denhert at the "Swiss Cot<lb/>tage Tavern. "I followed Watson to Brockley, and from there to Deptford Broadway, where a newsvendor lent him an evening paper. About 3. 26 p. m. he went to a telephone box in the High Street, where he remained, a little time. From there he went to Honor Oak Park, where he entered at 3. 55 p. m. a telephone cabinet in a tobacconist's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060022"/>
               <p>shop. From there he went to the stables of a Mr. Lyne, prisoner's employer. He remained there for two minutes speaking to someone. I followed him from there to Catford, where he remained in the vicinity of a pillar-box in Catford Road. At 4. 15 p. m. a postman cleared the box; Watson was waiting for him about 20 yards away. On June 22 I saw him go to St. Jermyn's Hotel, where he met Denhert. At 11 a. m. he went to Honor Oak Park Station, where he spoke for about 10 minutes to prisoner, who was in his butcher's cart.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, Secretary's Office, G. P. O. In June I put myself in communication with Denhert, who from that day acted under my instructions. On June 22 he handed me this envelope (Exhibit 9), and I put "E. S. 1" in invisible ink upon it. I subse<lb/>quently developed it before the magistrate. I gave it back to Den<lb/>hert, who later gave me 2s. 6d. He handed Exhibit 1 to me about 12.15 p.m. on June 25, which I marked "E. S. 2. "It was open and contained a blank piece of paper. At 5 p. m. Newy handed it to me, and it was put in the course of post. Denhert reported to me with re<lb/>ference to Exhibits 10 and 11, and I gave him instructions as to them. On August 11, having communicated with Guntrip's, I had all the letters in my possession. On August 10 I saw prisoner at the G. P. O. and told him I was an officer in the Investigation Branch, and was making inquiries respecting these fraudulent betting letters, and cau<lb/>tioned him in the usual way. He made this statement, which I took down in writing (Exhibit 5): "I look at the letter dated June 22. I posted the letter myself soon after 12 noon on June 22, I believe, in the pillar-box at the corner of Rosedale Road, Forest Hill, but I can<lb/>not be certain as to the letter-box I posted it in. The betting slip was written by me and placed in the letter before I posted it. I look at the letter postmarked June 25. The betting slip is in my hand-writing, and I posted the letter in Forest Hill, I believe in the pillar box at the corner of Herschell Road about 12. 25 p. m. I look at the letter postmarked July 22. I posted it about 12. 35 p. m. in the box outside Honor Oak Park Station. The writing on the slip, with the exception of the figures is mine. I look at the letter postmarked July 23. I posted it soon after 12 noon in the pillar-box at Bovill Road. All the writing on the slip, with the exception of the figures, is mine. The cheques shown to me dated March 25 and June 24 were re<lb/>ceived by me from Messrs. Guntrip in payment of winnings made by me. I cannot be certain whether or not the cheque dated April 1 was re<lb/>ceived by me. "In my opinion the slips contained in the letters of June 22, July 22, and July 23 are all in his handwriting; they are all signed "Guss. "The slip in letter of June 25, which is signed "Gus," may or may not be in his handwriting; he said at the police court it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060023"/>
               <p>was not. I had received on August 8 a letter from him (Exhibit 13) from his address: "Sir, I understand from Messrs. Guntrip and Son, of The Park, Bromley Road, Catford, with whom I do business, they are making inquiries of you with respect to three letters I sent them on July 19, 22, and 23 last respectively. I wish to inform you that each letter bore Messrs. Guntrip and Son's printed address. Two of the letters I posted at the grocer's shop, at the corner of Rosedale Road, Forest Hill, at about 12. 30, and the other one in a pillar-box at the corner of Devonshire Road, Honor Oak Park, about the same time. Messrs. Guntrip duly received my letter and I am at a loss to under<lb/>stand what the inquiries are about. I should, therefore, feel obliged if you would reply to them at your earliest convenience, so that I can learn from them the result in due course. I am, sir, yours obediently, A. Goddard. "</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not aware of this letter at the time I inter<lb/>viewed him on August 10, when I told him I was making inquiries about fraudulent betting letters and cautioned him; it did not have much apparent effect on him. He did not ask me what I meant. I never referred to the fraudulent postmarks. He had no objection to signing the statement. I did not mention Watson's name.</p>

                  </hi>, butcher, 45, Honor Oak Park. About June 27 prisoner, who was my servant, asked me to cash this cheque for £71 4s. 1d. for his father, and I did so. I have three assistants. He is a roundsman and does stable work. The other two do the rounds and shop work, but not any stable work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His hours on a Saturday would be from 7 to 1.30 p.m., and he would then start again at 3 or 4 p. m. He has always borne the best of characters; he has been with me just under twelve months. He came to me with a good reference. His people are highly respectable and have lived in the neighbourhood all their lives.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I drive Mr. Lyne's, a butcher, cart. About February last I started an account with Gun<lb/>trip's. My winnings would be paid me direct on Monday mornings, the accounts being made up to the previous Saturday, and my losings I would pay through a Mr. Davey, their agent. Watson told me he could get very good information and I allowed him to make bets with Guntrip's in my name. I limited him to a sovereign each bet. He was to tell me what bets he had made for me. I had no knowledge that he was doing anything wrong. I would give him about a fifth share if I won. He paid nothing when I lost. This betting slip of June 25 (Exhibit 2) is not in my writing; it must be Watson's. Exhibits 9 and 10 and 11 are in the same handwriting. They are bets made by Watson for me on my authority. I learnt in August that it was suggested that the bets were not properly made and I told Watson what I had heard, and wrote on the 8th to the G. P. O. I was invited to attend there and I went and saw Mr. Stratford, who told me that I need not answer any of the questions he put to me, but that he was making inquiries as to fraudulent betting letters. That dazed me a bit. I made a statement to him which he wrote down and I signed. It is not true. I did not know what I was saying at the time. I did not understand what he was talking about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My wages are 23s. and a joint a week. My limit to Watson was £1 a week. I betted at times myself with Guntrips, who gave me £2 a week credit. At times I made the bets myself and then I would write the slips; sometimes I lost, sometimes I won. Exhibits 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 shown to me are betting slips all written by me, on all of which I lost. They are written on bits of envelopes off letters that came to me. I see Exhibit 9 is written on a piece of envelope also The handwriting on it is a bit like mine; it is rather larger writing than mine. I believe Watson can give a good imitation of my writing. The writing on Exhibits 1, 10, and 11 is a bit like mine. I cannot swear that Exhibit 16 to 20 are in my writing; it is like it. Exhibits 9 and 19 have both got the name "Mercutio" on them. I first met Watson on Derby Day this year; he stopped me on my rounds and suggested he should make bets for me and save my time. I had seen him about before but not to speak to. He asked me if he could send on to Guntrips any tip he got and I said I did not mind. I let him have Guntrips' printed envelopes to do so. Sometimes he would find his own slip of paper to write on, sometimes I would supply him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060025"/>
               <p>with scraps of envelopes. I gave him a specimen of my handwriting to copy, so that he should write in such a way that they should think it was I who was writing. I do not know what that was for. I wrote the letter of August 8 to the. G. P. O. on Watson's instructions. I had not heard from Guntrips, but he had. He asked me to go to Guntrips to inquire why I had not received the winnings from my bets and my father went on August 3, as I had not the time, and they referred him to the G. P. O. I told Watson about this. The facts contained in the letter of August 8 are not true. Watson had given me to understand that the letters were just as if I had posted them. Watson did not tell me to mention his name either in the letter of August 8 or at the inter<lb/>view of August 10 and I only did what he told me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I am living at home with my parents. There was nothing in the accounts I got to arouse my suspicion as to what Watson was doing. The account of June 11 shows three winners and three losers resulting in a win of 5s. 4d. for me. The account of July 2 shows a loss of £1 18s. 2d.</p>

Finding I had lost them I notified the American Express Company to stop payment on July 15. I do not know prisoners.</p>

On July 15 Williams came in at about 11.45 a.m. He handed in a letter unaddressed and asked me to send it to the National Provincial Bank. I asked him which branch. He said Queen Street or somewhere. I looked it up in the directory, addressed it to 112, Bishopsgate Street, and sent a lad with it and told him to wait for an answer. Williams said he would call again. He returned in about ten minutes. In the meantime the boy had returned with the message that the bank manager wanted to see Williams.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Williams. I looked in the directory and found the address of 112, Bishopsgate Street, and you said, "That is the one."</p>

I was at my desk in the City manager's office, which is screened from the general office by a glass and mahogany partition. Opening the envelope I found the four American Express Company's cheques. Our bank is one of the paying agencies of that company; it states so on the face of the cheque. I noticed "Charing Cross Hotel" on the flap of the envelope. I gave the boy a message and said I should keep the orders. Sitting at a desk adjoining mine was Mr. Gardiner. While Collins was waiting I saw Wilson at Mr. Gardiner's desk. I am not certain he was there while I was talking to the boy. I did not hear what he said to Mr. Gardiner. I should say he could not hear what I was saying to the boy. The police called while I was out at lunch. (To the Judge.) Nobody came back for the cheques.</p>

I asked him to give us a specimen of his signature in our signa<lb/>ture book, and asked if we might make inquiries at the Chartered Bank as to his respectability. I gave him a paying-in book and he left. I could not read his signature at first; he spelt it over afterwards as John Whitham.

               <p>ask at the bank if you liked. I said I had signed my banking account over to my father. I did not say I did not think it was legal or that I would like to have it transferred so that he should not have it. I recollect no occasion when I have sent you to cash a cheque. I have no recollection of asking you to write a note to the bank to stop a cheque for £18 which I had given in respect of a pony. It may have occurred you went with me to the bank when I stopped a cheque.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On July 15, about 11.5 a.m., I was in Leadenhall Street. I saw prisoners with another man, who gave the name of Liston, by Bishopsgate Street. They walked to the District Messenger office, 120, Leadenhall Street. Williams entered there, leaving the other two in the doorway of No. He came out, spoke to the other two, then ran along to Bishops-gate Street to the National Provincial Bank, where Wilson entered. I followed him in. I came out before him. He took three paying-in-slips from the receptacle on the counter, then came outside, stood on the steps several minutes and again entered the bank. I went and stood some distance across the road. He came out of the same door that he went in. Williams was on the opposite side of the road. He walked along to Crosby Square and had a conversation with the other man not in custody. They returned one behind the other to Leadenhall Street, where they stopped, spoke, parted, and returned to Crosby Square. They stood there several minutes, then left, one following the other hurriedly to Leadenhall Street, East India Avenue, where they met Wilson. After a minute or two's conversation, Williams left them and entered the messenger office. I went in to see what his business was and he left as I was entering. In consequence of what the manager told me I followed Williams back to Wilson and Liston. He spoke to them a little while. They left hurriedly. I followed them to Whittington Avenue, and through Leadenhall Market, where I obtained the assistance of several uniformed officers and had them arrested. I said, "I am a police officer, and shall arrest you for being concerned together as persons frequenting Leadenhall Street and Bishopsgate Street. "Wilson replied, "Oh, God!" The others made no reply. At the station they were detained for inquiries. They were afterwards placed with ten other men and identified by the boy Collins. I found out about the cheques after I had been to the bank. I said to Williams, "Can you account for how you became possessed of these cheques?" He replied, "They were given to me by a man I do not know, but I was going to meet him later. A paying-in book was found on Wilson. Nothing relating to this charge was found on Williams except Exhibit 6, a piece of paper with Mr. Whitham's name on.</p>
               <p>To Wilson. I have the wallet that was taken from you at the station. The papers were wrapped up; they were not in a piece of elastic inside the wallet. They were loose.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On July 15 I was going to Sandown Park. Going into York Road, Waterloo Station, I met a man named Wilkins, who asked me to go to the City for him. I con<lb/>sented. At the Bank of England he gave me an envelope sealed up, which he asked me to take to Leadenhall Street Messenger Office, and wait for an answer. I did so, and the messenger boy came and told me the manager wanted to see me. I was walking away to try and find Wilkins (I had an appointment with him) when Detective Gunner and three policemen arrested me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was three or four hours after I was arrested when Detective Gunner asked me where I got the notes from. I had known Wilkins two or three weeks. I do not know his address. He travels race meetings and can be found at any race meeting, I believe. He makes a small book. I met Wilson by appointment at Waterloo that morning. Then we met Wilkins going up the slope. I had £3 12s. or £3 14s. on me and was trying to get some more to make a small book. Wilson was going to clerk for me. We met Wilkins by accident. We had not taken our tickets because it was too early. Wilson was there when Wilkins asked me to go to the City. Wilkins said, "If you go and do some business for me I will pay you what I owe you," about £6 8s. I did not ask what the business was. Wilkins had the money to pay me then, but told me he would pay me if I delivered the letter and brought back the answer satisfactorily. He told me he had other busi<lb/>ness to do. We three went in a taxi to the Bank of England, then Wilkins went off in another direction. I do not know if Wilkins invited Wilson to come or why he came. Wilkins gave me the letter in the cab. I do not remember but I do not deny saying at the Mansion House that it was in York Road. He told me to take it to the mes<lb/>senger office in Leadenhall Street and send it round to the National Provincial Bank. It did not occur to me to tell him it would be less trouble to take it to the bank myself. Wilson went with me to the messenger office. I did not ask him to go; he followed voluntarily. Nothing was said about him getting anything for coming. He was coming to the races with me if Wilkins paid me. Wilkins arranged to meet me at half-past 12 at Leadenhall Market. I did not know Wilson was going to the National Provincial Bank; it was a pure coincidence.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I have nothing further to add to what I said at the police court. (Statement read.) At the time we transacted business at the Chartered Bank, Mr. Whit<lb/>ham said to me, "I wonder if I have written any more cheques which I was not aware of," and he asked Mr. Burgess to bring his cheques to see if he had written them. When they were brought Mr. Whitham</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060032"/>
               <p>said all the cheques were in order except one for £18, which had been presented that morning and stopped. Mr. Stephenson said I was in the bank 10 minutes, so it would have been impossible for me to have been there during the time the boy was there if he was back in 10 minutes. The assistant manager said he had never spoken to me; Mr. Stephenson said he did. The manager was not there at all while I was there. I went in and asked Mr. Stephenson what procedure I would have to go through and he evidently took me to be Mr. Whit<lb/>ham. When he asked for references I gave the Chartered Bank of India. I told him where Whitham worked and that he could apply to Sir Thomas Barlow, of Eastcheap, for his reference. The messenger boy said the first time he had seen me was at the Mansion House Police Court. I asked had he ever seen me in the office and he said, "No. "If I was watching the messenger boy is it likely I should go into the manager's office and want to transfer another gentleman's account; would not that be rather giving myself away? I went there by the authority of Mr. Whitham. He admits he gave me permission to go to find out how much money was to his credit. If I had been to the National Provincial Bank to watch the messenger boy my sus<lb/>picions would have been aroused and I would have gone back to Williams and told him not to go near the messenger office; instead of that I went back and asked him had he transacted his business; he said, "No; I have to call back at the messenger office here. "He went there and came back a moment afterwards and said, "I want to see Wilkes, or Wilkins—I do not know the man's name properly—they want me to go back; they want him"; he did not say why.</p>

I said, "No," and turned to walk away. I felt him punch me about the head, I do not know whether it was with a knife or not; I fell to the ground unconscious.

                  </persName>, R Division. On June 25 I saw prisoner at the station and told him he would be charged with attempting to murder Florence Stevens by stabbing her with a knife. He said, "It cannot be helped. "Then he said, "Who said she is Stevens? she is Flo Richardson."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath) said that he had lived with Stevens happily for ten years and looked upon her as his wife. Last February he had an attack of asthma, which led to a huge abscess on his shoulder; he had to be operated upon and was in hospital for a month. When he came out he found that his reputed wife had left him. Prisoner continued: On June 24 I went to 5, Stanhope Street, to fetch</p>

I said to her, "Flo, why don't you come home and let things be by-gones; you know how bad my back is; I shall soon have to go to the infirmary and I don't want to go there any more. "She said, "I cannot come back no more now I have done this. "The knife produced I have had four or five years, and I always carry it with me; it is hard to open, and I keep it in my pocket open with a little plug of wood at the end of the blade. On this day, being in such misery and pain, I had been walking about drinking from public-house to public-house. When I saw Stevens I must have lost control of myself; I do not know what occurred. I certainly did not go there with the intention of going her any harm.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Thomas Lee, blacksmith, 65, Gray's Inn Road, W.C. On June 8 prisoner came to lodge with us. On July 6 I could not pay £13 11s. 4d. due for taxes, and prisoner said he would go and see the collector and try and get him to give me time to pay. He came back and said it had to be paid at once, and asked me how much money I had towards it, and I told him £3. He said, "Could you not make it half?" and when I said I could not he said he would try and manage it for me, but I must give him that and £3 15s. more on the Saturday, which would be half. I gave him the £3 and promised him the further sum on Saturday. This was on July 7. He went away and on his return he said he had paid it and gave me this receipt for £13 11s. 4d., headed "197, High Holborn, W. C," and signed "George Clarke West, Collector of Rates and Taxes. "He said West was an official of the Holborn Borough Council. I thanked him for his kindness. This was on the Thursday and on the Saturday the official receipt, which he had promised, not having come, I sent to the offices to inquire. My husband spoke to him. He wanted the receipt back, but my husband refused to give it up. On the following Monday prisoner came to the shop and I asked him if he would give me my money back and he said he would try and get it for me. He went away and I never saw him again. On the morning of that day I found on inquiry from the rate collector that nothing had been paid and I have since been called upon to pay the whole rate. I gave him the £3 to pay the rates with.</p>

Shortly afterwards prisoner came to me and said that Mrs. Lee was rather alarmed at it and asking me to extend the time for payment. I told him I would do the beat I could, and he suggested she should pay by instalments. I told him it was not usual, but that if she would pay half the amount at once I would allow a further time for the balance. The next thing I heard of the matter was when Mrs. Lee sent her daughter to me to ask why I had not forwarded the official receipt and she brought with her this receipt (Exhibit 1). Prisoner has never paid me anything and this was never issued by me or any one connected with the borough. I</p>

                  </persName>, E Division. On July 23 I saw prisoner detained at Gray's Inn Road Police Station. I told him I was a police officer and held a warrant for his arrest for unlawfully converting £3 entrusted to him by Mrs. Lee to his own use. He said, "I understand. "On reading the warrant to him he said, "I am sur<lb/>prised. I had a letter from Mrs. Lee and was going to pay her back as soon as possible. I have been out of town just lately. "On search<lb/>ing him I found some memos. I said to prisoner, pointing to the bottom of one of them (Exhibit 2), "This is your handwriting, is not it?" and he said it was. On being charged he said, "This is a fine thing for trying to do anybody a good turn. "I found no money on him. After he was committed I asked him who West was and his whereabouts. He replied that he was a friend of his and that he did not know where he lived or where I could find him.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On the Thursday Mrs. Lee asked me to help her with the payment of these rates as I had money and I went to see Mr. Mather to see what I could do. He said if she paid half the amount by Monday the other half could be paid by the end of the month. I told Mrs. Lee and she gave me £3 towards the half, I saying I would try to help her. As I was going out of town I asked a friend of mine, George Clarke West, who had worked with me, and who owed me £8 17s. 6d., which he was to pay me on the Monday, to look after it for me, giving him £4 13s. 10d., so that he could pay the taxes in full on the Monday. He gave me a receipt for it, which I wrote out because he had hurt his right arm in falling off a bicycle. On Saturday night Mrs. Lee's husband told me the money had not been paid and I said it would be on the Mon<lb/>day or Tuesday and that I had given it to a friend to pay. I showed him the receipt and he grabbed it out of my hand, along with a postal-order for 10s. that I had. I then went to the police-station and told them the circumstances and they told me to wait till the Monday. I wrote, telling Mrs. Lee what I had done, and then went away on my own business. I returned on July 22 and found the money had not been paid, and I immediately offered to repay her the money, but she has taken no notice of it. I am willing to refund it now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never told Mrs. Lee that I was going to get somebody else to pay it. I have known West for years. He lives somewhere in Bermondsey, but I do not know his address. I have</p>

On August 13 it midday with other officers I entered the front room on the ground floor of 2, Baldwin Terrace, St. Peter's Road, Islington, where I found the two prisoners and a woman named Collins. I said, "We are police officers, I have good reason to believe that you are in possession of counterfeit coin and that you make it here. "Taylor said, "I am a friend of Wallace. "Wallace made a statement. I afterwards said, "Who has the key of the next door, which is locked?" Wallace pretended not to understand me. I burst the door open and entered the back room on the ground floor with the prisoners. It was unfurnished, apparently a workshop. I found a packet of 11 5s. pieces, counterfeit, dated 1889; a packet of nine florins, dated 1887; 15 florins, dated 1900; one florin, dated 1901; seven florins of 1887; a packet contain<lb/>ing four florins of 1887 and eight of 1900; two bent florins in paper, dated 1900; two moulds, one for florins dated 1887, one for florins of 1900; a third mould broken; ladel containing metal, tiles, saucer containing sand, bottle of cyanide of potassium, packet of plaster of paris, spoon, candle, packet of alum, file, and a photograph of Wallace. Wallace said, "My missis I am living with is the land<lb/>lady of the house. I see what has been found, but it has nothing to do with me. Taylor is a friend of mine, and uses the room when he comes sometimes, that is all I know about it. "Collins said, "I am a machinist, and rent No. 2, Baldwin Terrace. Wallace is living with me. The room in which the coins have been found I do not know anything about. Mr. Brown (i. e., Taylor) rents the room—these too and the back kitchen downstairs are mine. "Taylor said, "I say I am a friend of Wallace. I met him yesterday in Shoreditch and came here with him. I have known Wallace about three years. I have met him before, and he asked me to come. "The prisoners were taken to Upper Street Police Station. Taylor said, "There was none found in my possession. "He was searched. In his possession was found 10s. gold, 20s. 6d. silver and 3d. bronze, good money, a watch, metal chain, and a purse.</p>

I received one week's rent. I got in a quarter of a hundredweight of coal and some wood on the Wednesday or Thursday. I heard the fire going in the back room. I received 1s. from Taylor for the coal and wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have had the back room empty a long time; it was unlocked; we used to go in and out. It was locked on the Wednesday after I had let it. I never showed the rent book to Taylor.</p>

He said, "You have made a mistake; I have been away since Wednesday; I am on my own; don't make a mistake; my child bought two cases, she wanted a box to put her clothes in and got them outside Tanner's. I ain't going to mention names but I gave him threepence. That is all I know about it. "When taken to the cells he said, "I know all about it; I could say something, but f—you, you bastard. "</p>

On August 15 I went to the rooms that had been occupied by Leveall, 1, St. Stephen's Square, Tabard Street. In the backyard we found this portion of the chest of tea and in the front room on the ground floor this portion. On the 16th I went with Detective-Sergeant Digby to Southwark Police Station, where I saw Leveall. I told him we were police officers from the City and that we had visited his rooms and explained where we had found the portions of the chest. I said he would be taken to Cloak Lane Police Station, where he would be charged with stealing and receiving same. He said when arrested, "I bought it with old firewood in Leadenhall Street two days ago. "On the charge being read he said, "Have you been to my house? My wife can give you more account of that chest of tea than I can. That chest of tea came to the "Crown" public-house in a taxi, the two men got the key and put it in my place and took it out again in a sack. That is the truth. Mrs. Rayment knows all about it.

                  </hi>, 1, St. Stephen's Square, Tabard Street. I let prisoner my ground floor. He had a wife and one child, a girl eleven years old. I was at home on August 9. Between 5 and 5. 30 p. m. I was looking out of the window and saw two lads, and a package, I believe with tea in, came into the house into the ground floor room. Taylor was one of them. I could not recognise the other. They were carrying it. I did not see them go away. Later that day Leveall brought a barrow, and went away with it and his child; his wife followed behind. Next day I told him to clear out as I could not have stolen property in my place. He said, "All right, I will go at once and give you no trouble." I did not speak about the chest of tea. He was too drunk to speak to him properly. He gave me one piece of the chest (produced) and asked me to put it under the copper. I said, "I am done washing to-day. "He put it in the yard. The police had not been when I asked him to clear out; they came the following Monday.</p>

I lit the fire with a portion of it. I told the landlady she could burn a piece of it; I said, "I do not know who it belongs to, it is no good to us.

               <p>was the night it was brought to the house. I complained to my wife. I did not tell the police because I did not know what to do about it. I did not know whether or not the chest came with the boxes I bought in Leadenhall Market: I bought a lot of firewood. My daughter bought some boxes outside Tanner's off a man called Curley. I and my missus were there having a drink. I acknowledge I have told two stories—that I bought them in Leadenhall Market and also that I bought them outside Tanner's. I was away from home when the chest was brought; I was not in. Mrs. Rayment did not know whether I was in or out, as far as I can see. Taylor told me Mrs. Rayment gave them the key to take in the chest. She would therefore know whether I was in or not. I say she is wilfully lying. I asked her who had been in my place and she said, "I had to lend my keys because three policemen came and worried me. "I might have said I would clear out at once and not get her into trouble with respect to stolen goods. I had a barrow on August 9, Mr. Sargent's, that I have used sixteen years, to take all the old sacks I had in my cupboard to sell to Solomon in Dover Road. He would not buy them because they were damp. This was the night the chest had been left. I sold the bags to a ragshop in Crosby Road. Mrs. Rayment had given the lads the key before the box came in. My wife had been at home and came out to look for me. That was when the box was put in.</p>

The two of us carried it to the door. My friend went to the house first. I carried it up to the house on my back, not the two of us. We had to get it off sharp from the van to the taxi. I waited at the corner of the "Crown," which is about a second's walk from the house. My pal come along with the key, said, "Come on," so I took it off my back and we carried it in between us. Leveall must have heard that the tea was brought in a taxi-cab from the people in Tabard Street, who put me away. I saw Mrs. Rayment looking out of the window. I could not say that she gave the key to my pal. I expected the tea would be sold and I would get my share. (To the Jury.) I only went in the front room.</p>

                  </persName>, C Division. At 8.30 a.m., on July 23, I was at Fresh Wharf with Detective-constable Miller. I saw the three prisoners amongst a number of persons attempting to go on the board the pleasure steamers. I was about a yard and a half away. Tippett said something to Clark and Lockyer and both com<lb/>menced to push behind prosecutor. Tippett crouched down and with his right hand took this purse from prosecutor's back hip-pocket and put it in his right-hand jacket pocket and commenced to leave the crowd. I made my way amongst the people and said, "I am a police officer; what have you got in that pocket?" I took him into custody. I had not seen prisoners before. On the way to the station Lockyer struggled to get away and struck me in the chest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Black. Miller had Clark in custody then. I said at the' police-court I was afraid he was going to get away. When I put the hold on him he stopped struggling. I put my arms round his neck. He might have struggled to relieve the pressure I was putting upon him. 10s. 10d. was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Purcell. There were few people where I was because I was over some ropes where the public were not allowed to go. When I arrested Tippett, Clark turned to leave. When searched at the station Clark had 14s. 4d. on him. Clark had no ticket for the boat upon him. I said at the police-court, "It is, I believe, absolutely necessary to take your ticket before going on the boat, but I am not certain. "Clark might have intended, as prosecutor did, to take his ticket on the boat.</p>

               <p>the direction of Loampit Vale. Davis was on the opposite side of the street a little behind them. When prisoner caught sight of him he said, "Hallo, I've got you now, I owe you one," and crossed the street, struck him in the face, and knocked him down; he fell heavily; he got up and prisoner knocked him down again with another blow in the face, and rejoined his brother. Davis got up again and walked along till he reached a grocer's shop, when prisoner again crossed the road towards him. To avoid further violence apparently, Davis fell to the ground, and while there I saw prisoner kick him with his right foot. I said, "That's a dirty trick; be a man and let him get up and have fair play. "He made no reply, and walked away. Pri<lb/>soner was a bigger man than Davis.</p>

On examining the body I found under the left eye a recently inflicted bruise; on the upper lip there was a small quantity of recently drawn blood and another bruise with slight abrasion, and there was also a bruise over the right eye. The injuries were consistent with (blows from a fist. I found no traces of a kick. I made a post-mortem examination of the body and found the cause of death was heart failure, preceded by shock. Deceased had heart disease in a very advanced stage, and was generally in a bad state of health, but in my opinion the violence to which he had been subjected accelerated his death.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). We had been drinking to<lb/>gether all day. I was very good to Davis. I had given him money for beer and for his lodgings, and often looked after him.

               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. When I saw you at the police station you were very nervous and agitated and shaking from head to foot. The only sign of drunkenness about you was your breath, which smelt very strongly, I think, of brandy. I do not think you were drunk.</p>

                  </hi> I am a married woman, living at the time of this occurrence at 154, Rushmore Road, Clapton. About 9. 15 a.m. on August 3 I heard a knock at my door and on opening it I found prisoner there. He came into the parlour and I followed him. He put his hand into his right-hand coat pocket, took out a revolver, which he pointed at me and said, "I have come to kill you all. "I ran out of the room into the street and as I ran I heard a shot and the breaking of glass, then a second shot, but neither of them hit me. I saw Police-con<lb/>stable Penny, who came back into the house with me and took the revolver from prisoner. I have known prisoner 15 years and before I was married he lodged with my father and mother; when they died</p>

               <p>he lodged with my husband and me until about three weeks before this occurrence. I had occasion to complain about his drinking and he left us. I had seen him on the previous Saturday, when he seemed to be all right. There was no ill-will between us.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You have always behaved very kindly to me and to my children, of whom you were very fond and to whom you made frequent presents. I do not know that you bought the revolver to shoot a cat, but you did shoot it. We met several times after you left my house and were on friendly terms. I should think you must have been out of your mind at the time you fired at me.</p>

I seized him and took it from him. He said, "I have done my bit, now do yours. "On searching him I found in his left-hand pocket 27 live cartridges and in the revolver there were four live cartridges and two spent ones.

                  </hi> I am prisoner's wife, and on July 3 resided with him at 1, Cornwall Square, Bethnal Green. On the night of July 2, between six and seven o'clock, I was lying on the bed drunk, when my husband came into tea. He afterwards went to the London Hospital to see our little boy who was there ill, and on his return he was crying, and said the nurse had told him there was no hope of the child's re<lb/>covery. There was 1s. 10d. on the mantel-piece, which my husband had put there. I got up and took it and went to the beershop. My husband came for me between eight and nine o'clock, but I refused to come out. I stayed there till eleven or half past, and then went home and went to bed, leaving my husband sitting in the armchair with his head between his hands. I kept on jawing to myself, but he did not answer me, and I remember no more. The 1s. 10d. was all we had, and me taking it and spending it I suppose made him lose his head, because he is so different at other times. I have recovered from my injuries.</p>

                  </persName>, H Division. At 3. 15 on the morning of July 3 last prisoner walked into Bethnal Green Police Station, and said, "I have murdered my wife at 1, Cornwall Square; go and see I'm very sorry for it. There's one of my children in London Hospital through her neglect. "On reaching the house I found the woman sitting on the bed, her right arm apparently broken, and bleeding from a wound in her head. A child about two months old was lying on the bed, its face splashed with blood. The woman was under the influence of drink. A doctor was sent for. I found the poker (produced) in the fender. There were fresh damp blood marks on the knob. On return<lb/>ing to the station I asked the prisoner to show me his hands and I saw that the inside of his right hand was very black.</p>

I told pri<lb/>soner that in consequence of the decision of the doctors it was proposed to take a statement from his wife, and I conducted him to the hospital. On the way he said, "She has not pegged out? Good luck. I did not mean to do what I did. I was asleep in the chair. She kept on jawing about me and the kid. I got one in the hospital; something wrong in his head. I jumped up and did it on her, and, blimy, I did not know what I was doing. I had half-a-crown, gave her 1s. 10d., and 4d. I paid for barrow money. I didn't have but 2d. myself. She's always jawing me. "</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath) said that he had had a lot of trouble lately with his wife owing to her giving way to drink. On the night in question he had been to the hospital to see his dying child; returning home, he found his wife had taken what money there was and gone out; He followed her to a public-house and begged her to come home, but she would not. Then he met some friends and talked over his troubles and had several drinks. After he got home at midnight he did not remember anything until he found one of the children pulling him off his wife, saying, "Oh daddy, don't do it any more. "Then he realised what he had done, threw the poker down, and went straight to the police. He was very sorry for what he had done. He was drunk and dazed when he did it.</p>

               <p>The bigamous marriage took place on March 29 last at the Regis<lb/>trar's Office, Fulham. Prosecutrix was a waitress at the time and had only known him a month before she married him. She stated that prisoner had told her he was a bachelor and she left him immediately after she heard that he had a wife living. She did not notice until after the wedding that he had given false addresses in the marriage certificate and prisoner then explained the fact by saying that he wished the marriage to be kept secret.</p>
               <p>After evidence had been called as to the state of prosecutrix's mind at the time of the ceremony, the Recorder said he was not convinced that prisoner had deceived the prosecutrix, but in falsifying file register he had committed a serious offence.</p>

On June 8 prisoner took a por<lb/>tion of the shop on the ground floor of 24, Tachbrook Street, Pimlico, at 8s. per week, giving as his references Edwards and Co., 54, Corn<lb/>wall Road, and H. E. Bourne, 12, Bessborough Gardens, S. W. He said he lived at 1, Park Crescent, Clapham. I went to 24, Tachbrook Street, where with the assistance of a lad I saw him carrying on a con<lb/>fectionery business. I have seen him write and to the best of my belief the pencil marks on Exhibits 5, 6, 8, and 9 are in his writing. I am doubtful about Exhibits 11 and 13. I should think Exhibits 17 and 21 are in his handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>, house agent. I am the agent for the owner of 54, Cornwall Road, Brixton, which was a shop let to a man named Brax. About May 10 I called and found prisoner, who called himself "Edwards," there as tenant of half of the shop, Brax, a barber, having sub-let it to him, and he was using it as a sort of office. Brax had gone, and telling prisoner he was a trespasser, I told him to go. I saw a batch of 13 or 14 letters addressed to "Edwards: and Co.," which I left there. On going there on the 14th I found he had gone, leaving about two or three sackfuls of torn-up letters. There were no books in the office at all and nothing which could be described as a manufactory.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. The day following I first saw you you were still there; you had a boy in the back garden who was moving your goods. I "believe you did not go out on the same day that I told you to go. I put the sacks of letters in the garden and someone took them away.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, 41, West Street, Bedminster, Bristol.</p>
               <p>In November, 1909, in consequence of an advertisement I saw in the "Bath Weekly Argus," I wrote to Edwards and Co., of 44, Old Town, Clapham, in reply to which I got this circular (Exhibit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060053"/>
               <p>2), telling me to send a postal-order-for 4s. 6d., in return for which I should get an instrument by which I could do profitable home-work for them. I got a pantograph, like this, with printed instruc<lb/>tions (Exhibit 4), which I did not understand. A sample sketch of a head was sent for me to copy, two or three plain sheets to copy on, and a few crayons. I returned it at once, realising it was impossible for me to do the work, and asked for my 4s. 6d. back. I got this letter in reply (Exhibit 13): "We cannot understand why you have sent your outfit to us, which is damaged, but on receipt of 6d., cost of packing and postage, we will return it to you. If it is not sent for after one week it will be sold to pay for storage. "I did not send for them 6d. I wrote them three or four letters, but got no reply. At the time I sent the 4s. 6d. I believed "Edwards and Co. "were a genuine firm of art publishers, and were in a position to give me genuine home work. I had no idea of buying a pantograph.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I did not buy the outfit. I only sent for it as a means of doing the work, and I paid the 4s. 6d. to cover its value temporarily as a kind of deposit. If I had tried to do the work I should have spoilt the sheets you sent. In signing the application form I was not agreeing to purchase the outfit.</p>

                  </hi>, lady's maid, Twickenham. On April 3 I saw this advertisement in the Weekly Dispatch": "Earn money at home. Particulars and easy work sent by return. Stamp. Edwards and Co., 54, Cornwall Road, Brixton, London, S. W. "I wrote to the address and received Exhibit 2 in reply. I filled in the application form and sent it with a postal order for 4s. 6d. I received in reply a pantograph, a small piece of pencil, and a postcard to copy, with a letter (Exhibit 5). I made a sample copy of it, but without the pantograph as I could not use it, and returned it with the postcard. I think it was a very good copy. I got no reply until I had written them three times, enclosing a stamped addressed envelope each time. They wrote me on April 16 (Exhibit 6) saying they could not trace my sample, and I must enclose stamped addressed envelope with all samples. I wrote to them again, and received in reply this picture postcard (Exhibit 7) with a piece of drawing paper round it. I copied it without the pantograph, and sent it back. In reply I got Exhibit 8, returning my samples, and saying it required a little improvement to the nose and lips. I improved it and returned it. On April 26 I got Exhibit 9, returning it, and saying it required a little improvement to the eyes and nose. I altered it, and two or three days after went with the pantograph and copy to 54, Cornwall Road, and found it to be half a barber's shop in a very poor quarter. It looked as if no one lived there, and I could not get in. I then went to the police. At the time I parted with my money I thought that "Edwards and Co. "were carrying on a genuine business.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I called to see you at 6 p. m. I sent a stamp with every letter I sent you. I understood the pantograph would belong to me after I started working, and you would return me the money</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060054"/>
               <p>I had paid for it: the 4s. 6d. being merely a deposit. I gathered that from this passage in the circular you sent me: "This small amount we are compelled to charge, and must require each beginner to pay for the first material as they are not only valuable, but we must pro<lb/>tect ourselves from persons who might send for materials without having any intention of working for us. As soon as you start to work for us this amount is returned to you with the payment for the first dozen pictures done. "In addition to that you say: "If we find from your samples that you will be unable to do the work we will have the outfit returned to us and refund the amount of it to you. "</p>

I filled up the application form, and with 4s. 6d. sent it to "Edwards and Co.," 54, Cornwall Road, Brixton. I received a pantograph and a post-card with instructions as to how I was to enlarge it. I made what in my opinion was a good copy and sent it. Not receiving any reply I returned the pantograph and asked for my money back or I would take proceedings.

Rutter, of 24, Tachbrook Street, enclosing 9s. for one dozen shilling pantographs in box complete, no label to be on boxes (Exhibit 17). The wholesale price of these things is 9d. each, the retail price 1s. We have been supplying them to him since June, 1909, in that name at Cornwall Road, Brixton, at 44, Old Town, Clapham, and 1, Park Crescent. There is nothing to justify 4s. 6d. being charged for them. He has had from two to three gross of them. They are used for enlarging maps, plans and drawings—outline work generally. You could enlarge the outline of this picture postcard (Exhibit 7), but not the shading. I have been in the same employ nine years, and I know of no business carried on by anybody of dealing in pencil copies of picture postcards.</p>

The business carried on was the confectionery and the home work, which was sending out circulars like Exhibit 2, which 1 put into the envelopes and posted. I addressed some of them. The name over the letter-box was "The Copying Company"; there was no name of "Rutter." About one or two dozen letters came every day. I used to get the cash for some of the postal orders that came, and with some I used to buy stamps. I used to go there at eight in the morning, and he came at about eleven or twelve. I shut up at 8. 30 p. m. He used to go away sometimes and not come back, and I was left in charge; there was only he and I there. There were no books kept and no list was made of the people who replied to advertisements. I have seen drawings, some of which were sent back.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060056"/>
               <p>for?" I said, "I saw you leave 24, Tachbrook Street, and I hold a warrant for your arrest. "I took him to the station and read the warrant to him. He said, "I have never defrauded anybody. "I found upon him 2s. in silver, 6d. in bronze, 34 halfpenny postage stamps, 20 postal-orders for 4s. 6d., one for 2s. 6d., and one for a shilling, with three stamps attached to it. There was a P. O. Savings Bank book, showing that an account was opened in the name of "F. W. Rutter" at the beginning of 1909, with a credit balance of £13 0s. 4d., the balance at the end of the year being £24 16s. 11d. In 1910 there was a balance of £8 16s. 11d. I went with him to 24, Tach<lb/>brook Street, where I found a small quantity of confectionary in the window, about 2,000 circulars, with "Edwards and Co., 54, Cornwall Road," on them, and 166 application forms addressed to "The Copying Company," which had been filled up and sent in from all over the United Kingdom, dating from June 16 of this year to the day he was arrested. They represent a sum of £37 7s. I also found a roll of plain drawing-paper, seven empty pantograph boxes and one full, two small cardboard boxes containing map pens, and under the counter on the floor a quantity of pencil drawings, which do not seem to have been done by the pantograph, with two framed pictures. In the till there was 1s. 8 3/4 d. in bronze. On my inquiring he said he had no business books. I took him to the Clapham Police Station, where he was charged, and said, "There is no intent to defraud. "After the first hearing I asked him if he wished me to make any inquiries con<lb/>cerning him, and he said, "No, I do not want any enquiries. I admit I have advertised from these places, but there is no fraud. "I found among the papers this small brass plate with "Edwards and Co." upon it.

It was stated that although in the day-time he did a little work at night his associates were dangerous thieves, and his arrest arose through his being found in possession of 13 pairs of trousers which had been stolen from a neighbouring pawnbroker.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of William Kirby, landlord of the "Lamb and Flag" public house, 69, High Street, Homerton. On July 5 the prisoners came to my house with another man at about 8. I next saw the prisoners alone on July 11 at about 8. 30. My daughter served them with refreshments. My husband was talking with them. Longhurst said he wanted a postal order for £8. I said they could not get it as the post-office closed at 8 p. m. I went to serve other customers. My husband afterwards called to me to ask my daughter Ada to write out a cheque for £8, which she did. She asked in what name; Long<lb/>hurst said, "A. Litten," and spelt the name. My husband then signed it. It is the cheque produced, which has been altered into £80 and the crossings have been taken out. Longhurst counted out eight sovereigns; my husband gave him the cheque, he gave it to Kennedy, and he put it in a blue letter-card and put it on the counter. After serving customers I noticed that it was still on the counter, and I said to Longhurst, "If I were you I should put that in your pocket, and not let it lie about like that. "He took no notice, and some time after I saw it was gone. On July 16 I picked Kennedy out from a number of men at Hackney Police Station, and on July 17, I similarly identified Longhurst. I am sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Longhurst did not ask for an envelope. I believe the letter-card was already addressed. They did not ask me if I had any postal orders.</p>

I sat in the saloon bar when Longhurst came and asked me to have a drink. I had some whisky, and we were talking when he asked me where the nearest post-office was as he wanted to get an order to send away for the morning. My wife said, "You cannot get any order to-night; the post-office is closed. "Longhurst looked at Ken<lb/>nedy and said, "That has done it—I must have that to send by the morning. "He then turned to me and said, "Governor, could you jet me have a cheque for £8. "I said, "Yes, if you want it par<lb/>ticular I can let you have a cheque for £8. "He thanked me.

"It lay there for a minute or two when Longhurst gave it to Kennedy: he put it to his mouth and put it in his pocket. Prisoners stayed till 9. 50 p. m. and left. On July 16 I went to the station; I was unable to pick Kennedy out, but afterwards I recognised him. On July 17 I picked out Longhurst.</p>

I first met Longhurst about the middle of June at the "Portsmouth</p>

               <p>Arms," where he used to lunch. He told me he had had several public-houses and I thought he could introduce me to hotels to sell honey. He was about starting a street-betting business and we went to Homerton; we were three times at the "Lamb and Flag" to view the neighbour<lb/>hood. On July 11 I understood from Longhurst that he was going to get a man named Litten to act as his agent in the neighbourhood of the "Lamb and Flag. "I met him at the "Portsmouth Arms" at 7. 30; we went in a taxi to the "Lamb and Flag," arriving there about 8; Longhurst wanted to send Litten some money to start betting the next morning. He asked Mrs. Kirby where the post-office was. She said it was shut. He then asked Mr. Kirby if he had any postal-orders. Kirby said, "No," and he then asked for a cheque for £8. Kirby told his daughter to write a cheque, signed it, and gave it to Long<lb/>hurst; Longhurst asked for it to be crossed. I had a few letter-cards and gave Longhurst one; he put the cheque in, addressed the card and handed it to me to seal, which I did and handed it to Longhurst; he put it on the counter; Mrs. Kirby told him to put it in his pocket; it afterwards fell on the floor; I put it on the counter again. He put it in his pocket at about 9.50, when we left. We then returned by tram; I got off at Old Street to go to Rowton House. The cheque was never in my possession after leaving the "Lamb and Flag"; I have had nothing to do with forging and altering it. I have had none of the proceeds and do not know who has. When charged I said I knew nothing whatever about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Since May I may have been regularly sleeping at Rowton House except a night or two—it is on the records. I have never seen A. Litten. I knew nothing of Longhurst's business. I said nothing in the "Lamb and Flag"—I was reading the paper.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). At the time of my arrest I was living at Bowling Green Lane, Clerkenwell. I had known Kennedy two or three weeks previously. My object in going to Homerton was to start a street-betting business there. I had arranged with Harry Alexander Litten to start on July 12 for the Newmarket meeting if I sent him money. Going to the "Lamb and Flag" on July 11 I decided to start him; finding the post-office closed I asked Kirby for a cheque, for which I paid him £8. I owed Litten £1 for tips he had given me of two horses which won at Lingfield. I asked for the cheque to be crossed. I then asked for an envelope; Kennedy gave me a letter-card which I addressed "A. Litten, Hack<lb/>mans Folly, Bermondsey," writing inside, "From A. Longhurst," with the pen which Kirby had used to sign the cheque. I asked Kennedy to seal it up, which he did and put it on the counter, where it lay for about three-quarters of an hour, when we left. We returned by tram. I posted the letter-card in Farringdon-oad. I heard nothing of the cheque until Sunday night, July 17, when I was arrested. Gosling's evidence is false. Immediately he arrested me I said, "Why, you must be mad. "I have not lost two boys. Seven years ago I lost a baby three weeks old. My other boy is 13 and in robust health.</p>

               <p>(Saturday, September 10.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known Litten for several years; he has worked for 10 or 12 weeks at Homerton for the Labour Bureau or the Council; he has been a street-betting agent in Bermondsey, but has been caught there twice. He wanted the £8 for betting requisites and to pay out if he had a bad day. I had no receipt; I did not expect one; he would report to me at the end of the week or the fol<lb/>lowing Tuesday or Wednesday. I do not know Tom Leahy, Trevel<lb/>yan, Butter, or Jno. Mahony, as associates of Litten. I have not paid Litten any money or bought clothes for him; I have given him enough for a drink or for refreshment while here. I took Kennedy with me to Homerton for company; he is a learned man and I was taken with him; he had nothing to do with my betting business. I knew Gosling by sight. He told me he arrested me for forging a cheque "with others," not "with Kennedy"; I had no idea what cheque he referred to and said "You must be mad. "I afterwards said I knew nothing whatever about it.</p>

                  </hi> (waterside labourer). On the evening of August 20 I was in Blackfriars Road. Prisoner came from the "Railway Tavern. "He said to me, "I am going to do it for you to-night." I said, "Don't be so silly." He then said, "This is what you are going to have," and brought a glass tumbler from his right-hand pocket. I said, "Don't be so silly," and started to edge away from him. With that he struck me with his fist on the left-hand side of the face. I re<lb/>turned the blow. We closed and he hit me on the head with the glass in three places. We rolled over and over on the ground. While on the ground he dragged the glass across my face and ear and put it against my forehead and turned it round. I have three scars on my face and one on the finger. I took the glass out of his hands, put it in my pocket and handed it to the police. A. the station I was examined by the doctor and prisoner was charged. After a little consideration at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060065"/>
               <p>the station he charged me with using a knife on him. I never carry a knife. I was searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I was not drunk when I first saw you, and did not go in the public-house and kick your leg. I never spoke to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say you never stabbed me with a white-handled knife.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. Have you a mark of a stab?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, five, bandages and all. There is my waistcoat to prove it.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. What is to be said to that, Mr. Boyd?</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyd. I said in opening that the prisoner, when examined by the doctor, was found to have upon him six or seven stabs. He charges this man with having done it. Prosecutor denies it. Except the prisoner's own statement there is no evidence that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>Witness (to prisoner). I was under the influence of drink. I would not be in your company. I know you as a desperado. You got hold of my head, pulled the glass out of your pocket and hit me. Your motive was because a friend of mine the week before told me you had stabbed another man, and it was a shame. (To the Judge). I never had a disagreement with prisoner in my life before.</p>

                  </hi>, late draper's assistant. I saw Pellatt come from the public-house doorstep. Prisoner followed, and spoke to him. Pellatt seemed as if he wanted to walk away, but prisoner went after him and told him he wanted to fight him. Pellatt said he did not want to fight. With that prisoner struck him in the left jaw. They closed; then prisoner put his hand in his right-hand pocket and took out a piece of broken tumbler and struck Pellatt on the head through his cap. They fell to the ground and I lost sight of the glass. Four constables came up. I did not see Pellatt do anything before he was struck. Barlow was the first to start it. I did not know either of them.</p>

Barlow produced a glass-from his right-hand pocket. With that he put it in Ms pocket and struck Pellatt with his fist on the left side of the face. Pellatt struck back in self-defence. They closed, fell to the ground, and Barlow produced the glass again and struck Pellatt on the head and face with it. (To the Judge.) Barlow struck the first blow, and with his clenched fist.

Barlow took a glass from his right-hand pocket and struck Pellatt on the head with it. Pellatt closed with him, and Barlow struck him in the face with the glass, and both fell to the ground. I rushed across to separate them, but was unable to do so till assistance arrived. (To the Judge). Barlow struck the first blow with his fist, without the glass. I do not know whether there had been a previous quarrel. At the station Barlow said to Pellatt, "You have chive's me and I have chiv'd you several times with the glass; you have touched lucky. "He also said, "If I had a razor I would cut his f—g heart out." I found the broken glass in Pellatt's coat pocket. He said he took the glass from Barlow when they were on the ground to prevent him doing further damage. Pellatt's face was bleeding freely. Nothing was found on him except the glass.</p>

I was in charge of Kenning<lb/>ton Road Station when Barlow and Pellatt were brought in. Both were bespattered with blood. During my investigation of the charge, Pellatt said, "I was in the 'Engine'"—meaning the "Railway Tavern"—"when him and some more of the gang come in and started on me. "We went outside and he took a broken glass out of his pocket and jabbed me in the face with it. Barlow said at once, "Yes, you f—g bastard, you know what it is for, but if I only had a razor I would do you in properly, too, now." To me, Barlow continued, "Ask him what it is for. The f—g cow's son is not man enough to tell you. He tried to chive me with a white-handled knife, but he could not. God blimy, I will do him in yet. I will swing for that sod." When prisoner was examined he had some wounds, which he said Pellatt had done with a knife. He then said, "That is all right. I don't want to pros"—meaning prosecute—"I will get my own back with him in another way when I come out. "Pellatt was charged with wounding him. When searched Pellatt had a portion of the broken glass on him, but no knife. Pellatt said, as to Barlow's wounds, "I did not do it. I did not have a knife. That must have been done by some of his own mob. "</p>

                  </hi> I live at Ruislip, and have a business in London. I have a season ticket between Ruislip and Bishopsgate on the Metropolitan Railway. On August 9, returning home, I caught the 2.15 p.m. train from Baker Street; I got into an empty first-class carriage at 2. 5; I took a corner seat; I had with me a leather bag; it contained nothing of value; I placed it on the seat at my side. About 2.10 prisoner entered the carriage and sat opposite me. When the train started I was reading a journal; prisoner appeared to be reading a morning paper. Within a few seconds the train entered a tunnel, and prisoner, without saying anything, produced a revolver, pointed it at my head, and fired two shots; I think neither of these hit me. I commenced to grapple with the prisoner; a third shot caught me in the chin. Prisoner had opened both doors; the revolver having fallen to the floor in the struggle, I managed to kick it out of the door. I called loudly for assistance and tried to find the communication cord, but there was none. Prisoner was trying to push me out of the car<lb/>riage. As the train slowed down into Swiss Cottage Station prisoner got out into the tunnel. At that station I was attended to and sent to the hospital. I had never seen prisoner before. I was wearing a gold watch and chain and a pearl pin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The revolver was held quite close to my head, so that I was absolutely at prisoner's mercy. The shot that actually hit me was fired at very short range; the grains of powder had to be picked out of my skin. I do not adopt the suggestion that prisoner, finding I was more than a match for him, simply wanted to push past me and get out of the train; he was, in fact, doing his best to push me out.</p>

                  </hi> I was guard in charge of the 2.15 train; it does not stop between Baker Street and Kilburn. There are no communi<lb/>cation cords on the train. After passing through Marlborough Road Station I noticed the train slow down and heard some shouting; looking out, I saw a man running along the tunnel in the direction of Marl<lb/>borough Road; he had no hat on. At Swiss Cottage Station we stopped; on going to the carriage I saw Frost, who was bleeding and seemed quite dazed. In the carriage were two hats (the prosecutor's and prisoner's). Prosecutor's bag was under the seat. There was blood about the carriage and evident signs of a struggle.</p>

I wrote on it, "Sorry we have no Jap paper," etc. He went away and came back in a short time. He said he would take the paper we had and also asked for some panels. The price of the paper was 7s. 9d., the two panels 8s. 9d., 16s. 6d. in all. He tendered a cheque for £4 17s. made out and endorsed by William Shapira. I gave him £4 Os. 6d. in change. The cheque was dishonoured. I went to the police-station and identified the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I do not know you as having dealt with me for years. (To the Judge.) At the station I said, "I know the name of Bass but I do not recognise prisoner at all. After identifying prisoner I turned round and saw his features. I said, "Why, that man is one of the Basses," and I was told he was named after Bass. That was my first recognition. (To prisoner.) Mr. Collins was about seven or eight yards away when you were at my place. He can see every<lb/>body who comes in if he likes. I think the cheque was changed between two and four. If it had been before two the cheque would have gone to the bank on the 7th instead of the 8th.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath.) I picked up the cheques about eight days before I went to the police-station with the constable, as he told me there was a warrant out for a case of assault. When the con<lb/>stable went to search me I had the handkerchief and case in my hand. I put the handkerchief back in my pocket and put my hands in my trousers pocket. The case slipped through. I had holes in both pockets at the time. After they charged me with that I was charged with burglary, remanded for a week and allowed out on bail. I showed up to my bail and then the case of forgery was put up against me. I do not think any man would have turned up in court to answer such a serious charge if he had known he had been guilty, only being out on £5 bail. I never took the cheque to Mr. Westbury. He is wrong in his identification. If I had gone there he or somebody in the firm would have recognised me in a moment, as I have dealt there over twelve years. Mr. Westbury was hardly ever there when I went to do business. I used to go soon after eight in the morning. I had a busi<lb/>ness of my own for fourteen years. It is the first time I have been in trouble such as this.</p>

                  </hi>, seaman, 13, Fingal Street, East. Greenwich. About 12 a. m. on August 16 I was in Paternoster Court. I had got to the bottom of the court and turned to go back, when prisoner rushed at me and tore my trousers pocket open and took out a sovereign that I had loose. He ran away. I chased him. He stood in a doorway and hit me in the mouth with his 1st. I had never seen prisoner in my life before. He ran into another court, I followed him, I heard a scuffle behind a door and saw prisoner, who struck me, loosening my teeth and splitting my lip. He ran 14 or 15 yards. I shouted "Police," and a police-constable captured him. He threw the sovereign in the street I saw its face. I saw the constable pick it up. I had been drinking but knew what was going on.</p>

               <p>"Police!" and ran in the direction of the cry. I saw prisoner running away. Police-constable Jarvis was with me. Prisoner ran into 31, Duval Street, We and prosecutor followed. I captured prisoner. During the struggle I heard some money fall. I saw Jarvis pick it up. Prisoner was the only man near. Prisoner made no statement. All he said was, "You f—g bastard. "Prosecutor's mouth was bleeding. His right trouser leg was torn, where he said the prisoner had got the sovereign out of. (To the Judge.) When my eye first fell on prisoner there were three or four altogether scuffling. Then prose<lb/>cutor called out "Police!" Directly I got hold of prisoner's arm he threw the sovereign down. I only heard it drop. It must have fallen from him; nobody else was within 20 yards.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a labourer. I was born at Pietermaritzburg. On the night this happened me and my friend had just come away from the dock, where we always go down to see if there is anything doing. Just coming down the street we passed the two policemen. My friend is another coloured fellow. I bids him good night, and goes in my house. I gets arrested. The reason my friend is not here is because he was indoors and did not see it. I know nothing of this at all. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The sovereign was found before I was arrested. I did make answer to the charge; I told them I was not the man. The last constable in the box said, "It is no use saying anything whether you are the man or not. When we get to the police-station our word will go before yours. "I was arrested while I was standing there innocent at the time. I was not running. I gave 9, Miller's Court, as my address. I have lived there nine months and pay the rent through my missies, Jessie Smith. I have been employed the last six months at Royal Albert Dock. My foreman is Harry Jordan. The police did not ask where I was employed. (This was denied by the police).</p>

At the foot of the bridge she made an attempt to throw the baby over; I heard her say, "Good-bye, Dolly"; I ran in front of her and caught hold of her arm and Wharton went for a policeman. She walked away; then the policeman came and she again attempted to throw the baby, and the policeman caught it.</p>

                  </hi>, builder, 814, Garratt Lane, Tooting. I live at 159, Pope's Grove, Twickenham. Amongst others 77, Foun<lb/>tain Road, Tooting, occupied by a Mr. Heath, belongs to me. On June 6 last, in consequence of what I had heard, I went to No. 71 and saw Mrs. Field. From there I went to No. 77. On June 14 I got a letter from a person of the name of Bristow. I do not know prisoner's writing, but he has admitted he wrote it. It stated that his wife had an accident in consequence of the gate at No. 77 swinging open. On the 19th he wrote me: "Dear Sir,—I have called at Toot<lb/>ing several times to try and see you concerning my wife's accident, but I have been unable to do so, but if you will give me a satisfactory reply to this letter not later than Thursday, it might save you a lot of trouble. I am not wishful to instruct my solicitors in this matter but failing a reply at the time mentioned above and without giving you any further notice I shall have no alternative but to do so. "I replied to it. On June 18 I received another letter making an appointment at my place for 1. 30 that day. In consequence of the letters I re<lb/>ceived I communicated with the police. Prisoner came to see me on the 20th. Sergeant Jocelyn was concealed in a motor car in my work-shop. A little before this I met prisoner in Garratt Lane. He said he had come to see me about the accident to his wife. He said that she was hurt in the stomach, which was rather serious as she was in the family way. I told him I had a few questions to ask him and asked him to come into the workshop. In reply to my questions he said that his wife was collecting money in Fountain Road, and that he did not know how the accident happened; that he would give me the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060076"/>
               <p>names and addresses of the witnesses at the proper time; that it was at 10 p. m. on the Saturday and that he was at Balham when it hap<lb/>pened; that she was helped by two witnesses to the tram about a quarter of a mile away, but refused to give me their names and addresses, although he knew them; and that on arriving home she saw a doctor and she had to go to St. Thomas's Hospital. He then left, saying he had an appointment and that he would settle it for £3; if not, it would cost me a lot more. I told him I should not settle until after I had made inquiries. The gate referred to is 2 ft. 9 inches high, and cannot swing outwards unless it is pushed. Within a few hours of this interview I went to his address, 27, Fernlea Road, and said I should like to see his wife. He showed me into the front room where I saw Clara Bristow in bed. I asked her whether the accident was the cause of her being ill. She made no reply but looked at her husband who said, "Yes, it was. "The blinds were drawn and she had her face powered; she looked very bad. I told her to let me see her hospital card, as her husband had promised to show it me. She said she could not find it. I said I was in no hurry and that I would wait while they looked for it. They would not look for it. I was there about ten minutes and never saw it. I asked her the name of the doctor whom her husband said she had seen on the Saturday night and she said that she had not seen a doctor but had gone to the hos<lb/>pital on the Monday morning. She also stated that she did not know the names and addresses of the two men who had helped her to the tram.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They never obtained any money from me. I say there was no accident. The gate was not, to my knowledge, out of repair. I had it removed after the accident (it might have been a day or two or a week) because somebody had stolen the catch from it, and I wanted another put on. It was not a dangerous gate. I know it did not project over the pavement. I have not a suspicious mind. It was as a result of my inquiries that I went to the police. Sergeant Jocelyn wrote down the questions I asked prisoner in my workshop. I was not in a hurry when I saw prisoner's wife; it was prisoner who was in a hurry. I suggest they refused to produce the hospital card. I heard the inspector say he had found it after searching. Bristow did not say to me, "Don't come here any more. I want nothing more to do with you. "I did not suggest settling it with a cash payment. I was assisting the police in the matter and I acted under their instruc<lb/>tions.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Samuel Heath, 77, Fountain Road. About 11.30 p.m., on June 4, a man called at my door and asked if it was No. 76. I told him it was No. 77. He asked for a name which I did not know, and he then went away. About five minutes later he re<lb/>turned, and asked for the same name, and went away again. A few minutes later I beard a woman scream and a gate bang. I went out to see what it was, and saw a woman leaning against my gate in a stooping position. The man came from the opposite side of the road and asked her if she was hurt. A stouter man then joined them. I did not see him sufficiently to recognise him afterwards. The woman</p>

               <p>remained at my gate about 15 minutes, and then the young man led her away towards the tram. She was stooping is if in pain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see male prisoner at all that night. I could not recognise Clara. The gate was pulled back inside after the accident. (To the Court.) There was nothing wrong with the gate before the accident that I know of. I do not know who took the latch off. The woman did have an accident.</p>

                  </hi>, having corroborated his wife's statements as to two visits of the man on the night of June 4, added: As I got to the door this man had just turned to leave. He pulled the gate out on to the path. I caught hold of the gate and put it into its place again. Seeing him go slowly to the corner, I thought there was something wrong. I went to the back and saw him standing against the fence. A male and female were standing at the corner of the road leaning against my fence. I got a little closer to try and hear the conversation, when he opened the door into the chicken run and I heard a scream and a bang. I ran into the front and saw Clara Bristow leaning against the wall in a stooping position and the male standing beside her. I went to the corner to see if it was the same female, and it was. A young man, who appeared to be a stranger, came up and helped her to the tram. The gate was shut when I heard the scream. I could see afterwards that the latch had been taken off. The Recorder here intimated that he would direct the jury to acquit prisoners on Counts 1 and 2, as he did not think there was sufficient evidence to show that the accident had not taken place.</p>

                  </hi>, claim inspector, General Accident, Fire, and Life Corporation, Limited. On June 27 I received a letter (Exhibit 7) from "C. Bristow" asking me to let him know by the following Wednesday what I was going to do concerning the accident that had befallen his wife on the 15th inst. in consequence of a fanlight at "The French Horn," failing which he would have to resort to litigation. On the 29th I called at the address mentioned, 27, Fernlea Road, Balham, where I saw prisoners. He said that his wife when leaving "The French Horn" had caught Her foot in a defective pavement light; that he had taken her to St. Thomas's Hospital, where she was attended to by Dr. Greig or Gregg, and that she was eventually discharged from there when Dr. McNabb, of Balham, was called in. I left saying I Should like our own doctor, Dr. Cripps, to examine her, to which he consented. Re examined her on July 6. I again called on the 12th Clara Bristow was lying on a couch with her left foot in bandages. Male prisoner remarked that he did not expect the affair to have turned out like this, and that he expected his wife would be incapacitated for a considerable time. She made remarks to the like effect. I finally agreed to settle for £15 and laid the money in gold on the table, receiv<lb/>ing a receipt signed by them both. I believed their account of the accident to be correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I settled after our doctor had examined her.</p>

               <p>of a complaint and on the following day I saw male prisoner. He said his wife coming out of the bar had caught her foot in a broken pave<lb/>ment light, that she had been thrown down and her ankle had been fractured. He wanted to know what I was going to do, and I said I would see my employer and let him know. I then found that the house was insured with the General Accident, Fire, and Life Corporation, Limited, and I referred prisoner to their agent. There was a light broken just outside the lounge bar sufficient to take the heel of a boot. Prisoner said he had taken his wife to the hospital in a van. As a matter of fact, he borrowed a chair from the house for her to sit on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Estimates were out at the time to have these lights repaired. After the accident they were cemented in. The light was in such a position that if anybody did put their heel in it it would probably cause an accident.</p>

About the middle of June I was at work at "The French Horn," when I saw a van drive up containing two men and a woman, who went into the public-house. The female prisoner came out, looked round, and went back again. A few minutes after she came out again, and made a bit of a tumble from the step on to the glass. She made two steps and went on to her knees, and fell over on to her side. Some friends came out and took her into the bar, where she remained ten minutes. They then brought her out and put her in the van; she seemed to require assistance. None of them seemed the worse for drink. The broken piece of glass was nowhere near where she fell; she made a false step from what I could see of it. It was quite light at the time—about 4.30 p.m.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was about 10 or 12 feet away in the next lobby to where she fell. The lights are just underneath the entrance to the public bar, and extend about 8 to 10 feet. I can swear that there was no piece of broken glass near where she fell. Some lights were out but wood was let in. These were not where the accident occurred. She fell two or three feet away from the broken glass. She fell over to the right, and the lights were to the left. The insurance agent did not see me on the matter.</p>
               <p>The Recorder expressed the view that, although the circumstances were very suspicious, the prosecution had not proved that the acci<lb/>dent had not taken place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hurrell stated that the allegation of the prosecution was that, although an accident had in fact happened" it did not happen in the circumstances and at the time alleged.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, 28, Portobello Road, W. About 11.30 p.m. on July 30 I went into a urinal near Chepstow Villas. I was coming away to go into Chepstow Mews, when prisoner walked in front of me and snatched my chain. I asked him what he was doing and he said, "Don't you b—well play with me," and demanded my money. I said I had none to give him, and he said he would murder me if I did not give it to him; he used filthy language. Saying I would give him 1s. 6d., all I could afford, I gave him a shilling and two sixpences as far as I can remember. He put them into his pocket and then said, "Now I want what you have got. "He had heard the rest of the money I had in my pocket rattle. I said I could not give him any more as I had to get through the week and he struck me in the eye and said)" You will not leave this place alive until you give me what you have got." I said, "I shall call for help," and started calling, "Murder! Police! Help!" He then got me up against the wall and put his right hand into my pocket. I said, "You can kill me, but I am not going to let go your hand. "His left hand was over my mouth and I got the door open somehow and got out. There were about 20 people outside, none of whom had attempted to help me. He attempted to run away and I said, "Hold that man. He has got my money. "Mrs. O'Donovan held him. I had on me a chain attached to which were some keys and a medallion. I value the chain and keys at 1s. I do not know whether the medallion is silver. Stevens, a police-constable, came up, and in prisoner's hearing I said to him, "This man has my money. Arrest him."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. A sixpence was found in the urinal. The other must have fallen down the grating or been thrown over the wall. My face was one mass of blood, and my coat collar was saturated with it. I did not meet you at Notting Hill Gate and ask you to have a drink. We did not have drinks at the "Swan. "I did not suggest your coming on to the "Chepstow. "There was no discussion about my being able to ride racehorses nor did we fight in the urinal about it. If you had a black eye, I did not give it to you; you must have made it yourself against the wall. I did not say when we got outside the urinal that I was going to lock you up because you had tried to rob file, and you did not say, "What for?. It was only a drunken argu<lb/>ment."</p>

                  </hi>, wife of John Donovan, 14, Chepstow Tavern Mews. On the night of July 30 I and my husband were coming down Chepstow Place, when we heard shouts of "Murder!" and "Police!" My hus<lb/>band went down the mews to the urinal, where the shouts came from, while I stayed at the top. I then saw prisoner rush out of the urinal, the prosecutor crying, "Stop him. Don't let him go like that. "Prose<lb/>cutor was covered with blood. My husband shouted to me to stop prisoner and I rushed across and held him until the police came, which was about two or three minutes after. He was struggling to get away. My husband then came up. I had seen prisoner loitering about the "Chepstow Tavern" previously the same evening. He had been there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060080"/>
               <p>hanging about since the previous Thursday—this being the Saturday. I saw him drop prosecutor's chain and the constable picked it up.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I did not say at the police court that I saw prosecutor come out first and you followed him. I put all my grocery down except the meat, which I had in one arm and held you with the other.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WALTER STEPHENS</hi>, 241 F. A little after 11 p.m. on July 30 I was on duty near the "Chepstow Tavern, "when I saw a crowd outside there. I went up and found prisoner being held by the prosecutor surrounded by about 12 or 15 people. Mrs. O'Donovan and her husband were holding the prisoner. Prosecutor's eye was cut and blood was dropping down on to his coat. He said, "This man has nearly strangled me and has taken my money. "Prisoner said, "Search me. I have not got his money. Look in the urinal." I found prosecutor's hat and umbrella outside, both smashed, and in<lb/>side the urinal 6d. I went up to prisoner, who was being detained by a sergeant, and asked him what he had in his hand, and he dropped this chain and medallion on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. When prosecutor came to the station he did not pull his chain from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: I call witnesses. I met the man at Notting Bill Gate and we had drinks together in 'The Swan., He said then, 'Come as far as Chepstow.' On our way an argument arose about horse-racing. He said, 'We will go to the urinal first. 'When in there I told him he could not ride a donkey let alone a racehorse. He then smacked me in the eye. I struck him back and then we went at it for all we were worth. During the fight I got so exhausted that I did not know what did happen, but I had no intention of robbery whatever. I do not remember ever seeing the chain until it was produced at the police station. When the charge was read I denied it. I had been on the drink for several days, and it was nothing but a drunken freak. When drunk I do not know what I do. I am of weak intellect."</p>

                  </hi>, bootmaker, 1,100, Harrow Road. In 1906 I had invented an advertising device and saw advertisement in "Daily Telegraph": "All inventors requiring capital should write or call on Crozier and Co., limited, patent experts, 110 and 111, Strand, who have many capitalists on their books who will finance or buy good in<lb/>ventions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060082"/>
               <p>The simplest inventions are often the most valuable. No results no charge. "I wrote and received reply headed, "110 and 111, Strand, September 18, '06. Crozier and Co., patent experts, trade mark agents, consulting engineers. Patents, designs and trademarks for every country in the world. Patents sold and negotiated. Searches made. Agents in every country in the world", asking for particulars of my invention. I saw prisoner and showed him the model. He said he could no doubt get me a client who would pay £500 for it. He advised me to take out provisional patent, his fee for which would be £3 3s., for which I sent postal order the next day. Prisoner then wrote that he had a client who would purchase, but it was necessary to take out a complete patent for which his charge was £10. I saw prisoner and asked if the purchasing client would assist and if he could intro<lb/>duce me to the client. He said he never brought the purchasing and selling clients together. He said the client would pay £750 for the British patent. I sent prisoner the £10. After a lot of correspondence prisoner wrote stating that his client wanted the French and Belgian patents; that he (prisoner) had asked £750 for the British, £450 for the French, and £300 for the Belgian patents; that his client had to arrange with the other directors in Brussels and that it would be neces-sary for me to send £20 for taking out French and Belgian patents. I then sent the £20 by cheque (produced). Prisoner then wrote that it was necessary to take out a German patent as his client required a cer<lb/>tificate of universal novelty, the cost of which would be a further £10. I saw him and refused to spend any more money with him. Further correspondence and interviews ensued. I told prisoner I wished to sell off the patents already taken out. I tried to get my money back. He then called me a blackmailer, told me he had me in his clutches and could squeeze me, and said that Von Veltheim had had 20 years penal servitude for blackmailing; that I had blackmailed him and it was only time I could get for it. I invited him to ring up on the telephone and call the police in. He declined. I afterwards com<lb/>municated with Scotland Yard myself. Before I left him he showed me a letter from the north of England asking for particulars of any<lb/>thing in the way of advertising. I agreed to return my model which I had had back for that client to see, and did so. I have since received the model back, apparently having never been unpacked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I received from the prisoner the patents which I paid for. I had paid prisoner £34. I demanded £65 from him to cover cost of models, samples, and expenses I had been put to. I had also borrowed £20 for which I paid interest.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I should not have paid the prisoner for taking out the patents but that I believed the representations he made.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, Nelson Ho, Nelson Street, Lowestoft, not practising. In November, 1906, I invented a method of communicating between a ship and the shore for which in July, 1906, I had taken out provisional protection. I saw prisoner's adver<lb/>tisement, and in consequence of his representation that he had a capitalist client who would purchase at £750, sent him £10 to complete the patent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have had upwards of 50 patents, about eight of which I have completed. The charge of £10 was a fair price for obtain<lb/>ing the patent, which I duly received from prisoner.</p>

I in<lb/>vented an improved lady's purse; in 1905 I took out provisional speci<lb/>fication and in 1906 the full patent for Great Britain. In August, 1907, I saw prisoner's advertisement and on his representation that he had a client who would buy for £1,250, sent him £20 to take out the French and Belgian patents. He then demanded further money for certificate of universal novelty, which I refused. I should not have paid the £20 but that I believed his assurances that he had a client who would pur<lb/>chase.</p>

I saw and re<lb/>plied to prisoner's advertisement, received letters stating that he had a client ready to purchase if the patent were completed, and forwarded him £9. He then required me to take out French and Belgian patents, which I refused. I forwarded the £9, believing prisoner's statement that there was a client. Prisoner was unable to complete the British patent and I afterwards completed it through another firm.</p>

Mr. Bartlett was simply applying and taking out patents in the ordinary way, the same as any other client would do. Can you give me any information?" I said, "You know what happened between yourself and Mr. Bartlett. "He said, "Mr. Bartlett is a blackmailer—you can put that down if you like—he wrote me threatening letters." He afterwards said, looking at the summons, 'Valuable security.' I do not know what that means—no security at all. He spent more than £10; he got, what he paid for. 'With intent to defraud. 'Well, that is absurd altogether. Can I see the information?" I said, "He alleges like many others that you intend him to spend money in taking out patents on the strength of your statement that you had a client who was going to purchase the invention. He also says, like others, that that client is mythical, and has never existed. "Prisoner said, "You will have to prove it. "</p>

At 8 a.m. on July 28 I was on duty at Pond Lane Bridge, which runs across Hackney Cut, when I saw a man coming along the towing-path with prisoner, who was on the marshes. The man on the towing-path could see me. He whistled to prisoner, who was then 10 to 15 yards away from me. Prisoner looked round and seeing me he dropped the sack he was carrying and ran away. I followed him for about 200 yards, when I stumbled and fell. I lost sight of him, and he got away. I recog<lb/>nised him as a man I had seen before. They called him "Lord Mayor. "I returned to the sack, which I took to the station. It contained copper wire, of which this is a sample (produced). On August 18 I went to Victoria Park Police-station, where I picked prisoner out from ten other men. I am absolutely certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. The morning of July 28 was fine and clear, and I could see his face clearly.</p>

I am not certain as to how long before this I saw you. I do not know you have been in the infirmary for the last 18 months.

I told him I was a police officer and should take him into custody on sus<lb/>picion of being-concerned with another man, not in custody, of stealing a quantity of copper telegraph wire from the telegraph poles adjoining Hackney Cut on July 28. I had been given on July 28 a description of the man that was wanted for stealing copper wire. He replied, "I heard you were after me. I had a good mind to come and see you in Hackney. What date did you say it was?" I said, "28th July of this year. "He said, "Do you mean that day when the 'copper, chased me across the marshes?" I said, "Yes. "He said, "Oh, all right—you've made a 'bloomer. '"When charged at the station he made no reply. It was in consequence of the description given to me that I arrested him.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. The description I received was, "Aged 22 to 24. Height 5ft. 5in. or 6in. Very fair. Clean shaven."</p>

                  </hi>, postman, Forest Hill Post Office, repeated the evidence he had given in Goddard's case (see page 463), as to his interview with Watson on June 11, and what had happened thereon. I next saw him on June 14. I afterwards saw him at 8.40 a.m. on July 5 at St. Jermyn's Hotel, when he asked me if I could put one in for him for that day at East Ham. I told him I could get one stamped at 2. 45. I saw him at 10. 40 a. m. by arrangement at the "Swiss Cottage Hotel," from where he followed me to the "Telegraph Hotel. "He there handed me two envelopes of which this is one (Ex<lb/>hibit 1a), with the printed address, "Mr. R. Chandler, 161, Fishwick Grove, East Ham, E., saying he wanted the 11. 30 stamp on it. It was open and had a piece of blank paper in it. I took the two envelopes and agreed to meet him at the "Swiss Cottage Hotel" at 1. At 12.15 I gave it (Exhibit la) to Mr. Stratford, who marked it with invisible ink. He gave it me back and I put the 1130 stamp on it. At 1 I met him and handed it to him. He gave me a shilling and said he would want me to work it in. I met him at 2. 55 in Devonshire Road, where he handed it to me again, stuck down. He gave me another shilling, I put a blue mark on it and put it in the course of post. I saw him the next day in Devonshire Road. He said, "I have not got any money for you now. I will go up and see Tom and get some for you." I knew Tom to be Connelly. At about 4.15 p.m. I met him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060088"/>
               <p>again there and he gave me 3s., saying, "I have been up to see him. He gave me 5s. Here are 3s. for you and 2s. for me. "I got 10s. from him on the 13th and 5s. on the 14th; he said, "This is something out of that one for Chandler. "I gave all the money I received to Mr. Strat<lb/>ford. The next time I saw him was at about 6 p. m. on August 6 at the "Railway Signal Hotel. "He then introduced me to Connelly, whom I only knew as the manager there. I was in uniform. Watson said to him, "This is the friend that puts the letters in down the road", and nodded his head in the direction of the postmen's office, which is in the same road. He continued, "He knows it's all right down there. It's a bit rough on him. He keeps working them letters in and don't get any money for it. "Connelly said, "How about me—getting a cheque for £18 and sending it back and getting £1 15s. for it? I don't get much out of it myself.,"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I first agreed to do this for Watson on June 14. I acted under the instructions of Mr. Stratford throughout. I swear I did not encourage Watson in this. About three weeks after I met him I told him what was true—that I was hard up and showed him a pawn-ticket, but I had no object in doing so. It is true I said at the police-court, "I did not want to choke him off. I wanted to be able to report it. "I told Mr. Stratford about the pawnticket the following day. He passed no comment upon it. I was not endeavouring to get evi<lb/>dence against Connelly. The first time I spoke to him was on August 6. Watson was talking to him and he (Watson) called me in as I was coming up the road. Watson had previously told me about the post-dated cheque for £18 that Connelly had received. I did not make a note of it because I did not think it important. Until August 6 I knew nothing of Connelly, except what Watson had told me. My account of the conversation is not a pure invention.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have been in the service of the P. O. for five years and six months and up to this time I have not been connected with any of these frauds. I find I have made a note of a conversation about Connelly on June 29: "Watson showed me an envelope which had a penny stamp on it and bearing a Sydenham postmark 11.30 and a part of the address, and showed me a marking on the 'back of it, saying,' This is one for Tom Connelly. I would not send it through for worlds.' He handed me the envelope and I examined it, and it bore on the back marks of invisible ink. I handed it back and he put it in his pocket. He remarked that a paper called the 'National Sporting Life' which was shown him by Tom Connelly had printed in it that Forest Hill was very hot." I reported each day to Mr. Stratford as to what had taken place. I see I have a note on July 9 that Watson told me that Con<lb/>nelly's father said that "he had heard from Brown that his son's letters were not delivered; that it was wired to be stopped from Willesden; that the Post Office had his postal order and the telegram written by Watson on the day after. Old Tom (Connelly) is in a funk about it. He sent me down to see you to see if it is all right. He is in such a funk I could easily blackmail him for £20 to-night. "I told him I thought it was all right. I have a note that at 7.30 p.m. July 12 Watson</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060089"/>
               <p>said, "Tom has got a cheque to-day. He would not pay me anything yet. He is going to see if the cheque is stopped, like the one for Fry. He told him about me and said I could do with it; expects there would be 1 for me, but would not do anything whilst the fuss was about. "All these notes I am reading were made at the time. (Mr. Lynch objected to further extracts being read on the ground that they did not arise out of his cross-examination. On the Recorder re<lb/>marking that he did not consider it worth while to read further Mr. Muir discontinued.)</p>

                  </hi>, messenger, G. P. O. Between June 21 and July 12, I was keeping observation on Watson. I saw him daily with Connelly in the "Railway Signal" public-house. Shortly after 9 a.m on July 5 I saw Watson go there. Shortly after he left, fallowed closely by Connelly, who entered the Forest Hill Post-Office. At 2 p.m. Watson went into the "Railway Signal" again, remaining there about 30 minutes. On coming out he went to a telephone call office at Perry Vale. After four minutes he left there, and returned to the hotel. At 2. 55 he left there and walked to Devonshire Road, where he met Denhert, to whom he handed a letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe there is a telephone at the "Railway Signal." There is not one at the post-office at Forest Hill.</p>

The object of our inquiries was to discover what post-office servants had been corrupted by Watson.</p>

                  </hi> I carry on a betting business at 161, Fishwick Grove, East Ham. I accept bets by post if the postmark is earlier than the race. I received this letter (Exhibit 1A) by special delivery on July 5, at 6 p.m. I noticed the postmark was 11.30 a.m. There are two deliveries after 11.30, 2.30, and 6 p. m. The letter would not have reached me any way before 6. 30. It contained a betting slip (Exhibit 2A), backing "Bellemontine "for the two o'clock race at Bibury, and "Rockbourne "in the 3. 40 at Nottingham. The former won, but not the latter. Connelly stood to win £15 17s. Id. I re<lb/>ceived a communication from the G. P. O. with regard to it. I sent this cheque (Exhibit 4a) and £18, which includes those winnings, pur<lb/>posely post-dating it August 8. On July 19 I received a letter from Connelly, returning me cheque as arranged and saying that he ex<lb/>pected I would send him a cheque deducting losings for the past week. He had rung me up on the telephone previously, telling me that it was a post-dated cheque and I arranged that he should return it. At the time I drew the second cheque the balance due to him was £1 15s. 5d., a cheque for which I sent him, dated July 30, together</p>

               <p>with this corrected account (Exhibit 7a). I wrote, saying, "Please consider account closed, as I am not satisfied with the way commission of July 5 was sent." All the bets that Connelly made except this one were made on the telephone. I did not see him at all; I only knew the voice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew he was manager of an hotel. All his tele<lb/>phone bets were straightforward and he always paid me promptly. He had been betting with me about six weeks. I do not know his writing. The week after July 5 he had five winning and 12 losing bets.</p>

He was not in custody but we are instructed to caution in all cases where we are seeing a person who might possibly be charged. If he had told me to go about my business I should have gone. I showed him Exhibit la and the betting slip and told him there was reason to believe that the bets made in it were fraudulent and asked him if he wished to give any explanation of the bate being made in his name.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am manager of the "Railway Signal" Hotel, Forest Hill. This hotel has a telephone in a large public dining-room and customers often use it. I always betted by telephone or telegram. I used to pay for tips on horse races. Shortly before this Watson, whom I knew as a tipster, arranged that on his giving me good tips which won I should pay him £1 or so. About three months ago he asked me if I would allow him to make bets with my bookie in my name. I arranged that he should do so with a limit of £2 each way, I to receive all accounts direct from Chandler. Exhibit 2a is in his handwriting and the bet was made tinder that arrangement. I had not the slightest notion that he had backed those horses after the event. Chandler's evidence about the £18 cheque is correct. It was Watson who rang him up asking why it was post-dated. I know Denhert as a customer using the house, His account of the interview at which he was introduced to me by Watson is untrue. Denhert simply asked me to have a drink, and I said I would not, but I had a cigarette instead. I have no complaint to make about the £18 cheque. I never mentioned the matter to Watson at any time. I always considered Watson to be an honest man. I have some interest in the public-house myself.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I could not, owing to the Post Office opposing it, get bail until I was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had no interest in any other people's bets besides Watson. It is true Fred Hoare, a customer, had his letters addressed to the hotel, as did several others. I cannot say whether he used the address for betting. I do not know what has become of him. He was not making bets on my behalf. I believe I only made one bet through the telephone with Chandler. Watson made every one of the bets on Exhibit 7 with him; they are between July 5 and 29 and represent £30 5s. I had accounts with other bookmakers with whom I betted myself. There were two other bookmakers besides Chandler with whom Watson betted on my behalf. Brown and Headley's account was not opened only for that purpose. Watson only had one bet with him The account has been open four or five months. We opened the account in case anybody refused our bets. Headley's account has been open five or six months. The account I had with Guntrip's I only used myself. I also have accounts with Baxter and Reed, Fry's, and Bate<lb/>man. Chandler's, Headley's, and Brown's accounts were all opened by me at the same time on the introduction of my father, and they were all operated on by Watson. I did not write to Tate, of Brighton, or to Wembridge, of Sandwich, to open an account, nor to my knowledge did my father. Watson wrote this letter of July 21 (Exhibit 9a) to the secretary of the G. P. O. in my name at my suggestion; it is asking why two letters I had written to Headley and Brown had not reached. This is the letter referred to (Exhibit 10a) written to Brown by Watson and me containing a betting slip and a postal order. The postal order is in my writing. I see that the envelope has a blue pencil mark and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060092"/>
               <p>invisible ink which has been developed. I cannot say what amount I was betting each week; it all depended on how much I won. Watson had to tell me everything he did. I was earning £3 a week and had accounts open with seven bookmakers. I knew Denhert was a post-man. I never gave Watson money to give to him. Denhert's evidence is absolutely false as to what he alleges Watson said to me. If he did say it, I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The balance against me for week ending July 5 was £3 13s. 6d.</p>
               <p>(Wednesday, September 14.)</p>
               <p>Walter Smith (dining-room keeper) and Charles Augustus Cox (licensed victualler) gave evidence as to character.</p>

                  </persName>, Bucks Constabulary, stationed at Slough. On August 15 in Saltfield Road, Slough, I saw the prisoner Shaw driving a gray mare attached to a van towards Maidenhead. I stopped the van, got on the step, and saw Humphreys and Denham in the van. I asked Shaw where he was going. He said, "I am going to see my aunt. I work for Game and Son, and he has lent me the horse and van to go to Maidenhead. "I asked Shaw who the other two were? He said, "They are my friends, they are going with me. "I said I was not satisfied with the story, and should take the three prisoners to the station. I then drove the van with the prisoners to the station, and asked if they wished to give any further explanation of being in possession of the horse and van. Humphreys said, "We lifted it; it is no use arguing about the point now; we cannot get out of it, and we are all about as bad. "I told the three they would be charged with stealing the van. Shaw said, "We must put up with it. "Denham said, "That is right enough; we were all together. We have been trying to sell the lot for 12 quid, that is four quid each. "Humphreys said, "That is right, we lifted it; it is no use trying to get out of it now. "The same day I found two rugs and an overcoat stolen with the van in a field by the road from the village of Denham to Slough. Prisoners were afterwards handed over to the City Police.</p>

I took charge of prisoners at Slough Police-station, conveyed them to the City, and told them they would be charged with stealing a horse and van from Smithfield Market that morning. Humphreys said, "Quite right. We should have been all right if the man at Uxbridge had given us the 12 quid for the horse. "When charged at Snow Hill Police-station they made no reply. Each said he had no fixed abode. At the police-court they all pleaded guilty.</p>

               <p>on June 11 and what had happened thereon (see p. 463 531). I saw Watson again on July 28 at the "Telegraph "hotel, when he gave me this envelope (Exhibit lc) unsealed, containing a blank paper. I stamped it with the 1.15 stamp, reversing it so that I identify it again. I returned it to him at 1.40 p.m. at the "Swiss Cottage Hotel," and he gave me 1s. I met him at 5.10 p.m. in Stanstead Road, and he handed it to me with others, saying, "Here you are. I do not think they (the Post-Office people) will see them in London. They are all right." I put a blue mark on Exhibit 1c, and put it in the course of post. It had a printed address, "John McLaughlin, Flushing, Holland. "I have been in Attree's company several times. I was in "St Jermyn's Hotel" with Watson, and after he left Attree came in, and we had drinks together. When it was closing time, instead of going out, we went with five others into a room below the bar, Attree saying, "Come on. You are with us. It's all right. "We had some more drinks. There was no conversation about these bets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been a postman in this neighbourhood for some time, and as Attree was a tradesman there I got to know him. I got Exhibit lc from Watson at 10.55 a.m.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. He was often in the "Swiss Cottage" with Watson. I cannot say whether he spoke to me first or I to him, but he was alone at the time.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, secretary's department, G. P. O. On August 9 I saw Attree at the G. P. O. and told him who I was and that I was instructed to make inquiries respecting a certain betting letter; that I was going to ask him certain questions which he need not answer unless he liked, but that anything he said would be taken down in writing and might be used in evidence against him. I showed him Ex<lb/>hibits 1c, 2c, and 3c, and said there was reason to believe that the bets made were fraudulent and asked him if he had explanation for their being made in his name. He then made this statement (Exhibit 6c), which I took down in writing and he afterwards signed: "Simply that I made the bet. I have sent to him two or three times since that letter; I mean I have made bets since. I sent the postal order you show me with the letter. That crossing on the order is my writing. I filled in the betting slip at my shop. It is my writing. I enclosed the betting slip and the postal order in the cover. I think I sealed it. I posted or gave it to my son Walter, aged 14, to post. I cannot remem<lb/>ber which. I look the letter of August 3 to Mr. McLaughlin asking for the winnings in respect of the letter of July 28. I also wrote all that letter. I sent and posted it myself. I think I wrote it in the 'Telegraph' public-house, Forest Hill."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. As regards the suggestion that the statement should read, "I enclosed the betting slip and postal order in the cover, I think. I sealed it," he read it over and could have altered the punc<lb/>tuation. An officer went down to invite him to come to the Post Office. On the officer saying he had no warrant Attree said, "Well, I am not b—well coming. "I did not hear anything about him want<lb/>ing to go to a quoit match. I did not notice any signs of drink about him when he came. Nothing was said between us which led me to be<lb/>lieve that he supposed the inquiries were concerned with his not re<lb/>ceiving his winnings. He did not say as regards Exhibit lc, "As near as I can think it was posted at 12 o'clock. "He never said anything about Watson having posted it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. No mention was made of Watson at all.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been a fish-monger for 25 years, and five years in this neighbourhood. I have never been in trouble before. I occasionally go to race meetings. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060096"/>
               <p>knew Watson for five years as a casual acquaintance, but since he came to live near me a few months ago I have seen more of him. I would meet him in the mornings at the "Rail way Signal," where I would go and have a drink after returning from the fish market. I could not help running across him when I was out. I understood him to be a racing tipster. I got to know Denhert because he used the "Swiss Cottage" Hotel as well as I. I wrote out the betting slip (Exhibit la) for McLaughlin (from whom I had received a circular and a printed addressed envelope) soon after 12 a. m. on July 28 in my shop. Watson did not give me the tips for the horses; I picked out Spanish Prince in his previous race, and I backed Sandwich be<lb/>cause somebody pulled out a sandwich coming up in the train that morning, and that gave me the idea. When I had written them on the slip Watson came into the shop and said the horses were no good. I asked him to post the letter for me to save me the trouble of going out and gave him 6d. to get the stamp. I am not sure whether I sealed it; but I know I put the slip with an open postal order for 6s. inside the printed envelope. This was a little after 12 a.m. He took it for me. Although the horses won I never received any win<lb/>nings. When the Post Office official came to me at the "Swiss Cottage "I was going to play a quoit match, but after two or three "Scotches" I went to the post office. I had an idea what letter I was being asked about. On my way home after I had made the statement I recollected that I had given it to Watson to post for me, and I had a good mind to go back and correct my statement, but I was a little bit muddled (I had been drinking a lot that day), and I did not do so. I took no further notice of it. The only explanation I can think of as to why Watson should have got this letter fraudu<lb/>lently postmarked is that, thinking the horses would not win he took my postal order, and finding that they had won he must have sub<lb/>stituted the one which he got postmarked for my envelope.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He would not get anything from me if they won. The postal order is in my handwriting, I think. I see now that it is not open. I do not believe I saw him on August 9, nor did I make any inquiry about him. I had been seeing him daily, but not by special arrangement. Sometimes, however, I would not see him for two or three days. I was under the influence of drink when I made the statement. The signature is not so nice as my ordinary writing. This is the only letter Watson ever posted for me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elliott. This claim was the subject of an interpleader proceeding by the Sheriff as to which £15 was paid into court. My clients agreed to accept 8s. in the £—that offer was after<lb/>wards withdrawn by me because other firms were getting 10s. in the £.</p>

Evans to pre<lb/>pare bill of sale of the business, stock-in-trade, and furniture at Japan House to Edwin Evans. On February 29, I called on E. Evans. He said, "I am not going to pay my son £500 for the business. "I said, "If you are going to purchase the business from your son it must be properly done. "He said he would see his son. On March 2 A. E. Evans called on me. I told him his father had said he would not pay the money, and that I could not have anything further to do with the matter, I did not like it. He then got into a rage, and said I had made mischief between him and his father, and that he could find a better solicitor than I was. I said, "Well, you may go to them. "</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Elliott. E. Evans became my client in the spring of 1907. I regard him as a highly respectable and substantial man. I understood the indebtedness of A. E. Evans to his father was £1,169 16s. 5d.</p>

I said, "I am a police officer from Scotland Yard, and I want to serve a summons upon Albert Edward Evans. "He said, "That door will not be open to anyone. You cannot come in without a warrant. "I said, "I have no warrant—I have a summons. "He said, "If you want to make an arrest I will be out in five minutes. "I waited about an hour, knocked at the door several times, and could not serve it. At about 8. 30 p. m. I went to 89, Holloway Road, where I saw the elder prisoner and read the summons to him: He said, "Yes, that is all wrong. I know nothing about it. I was never at Bell Yard. If it is true, my son owed me several thousand pounds at the time. "The following morning, at 10.45, I went to Japan House, and was invited inside, saw A. E. Evans, and read the summons. He said, "You need not have read it. I have an answer to it. You have questioned Thomas Reddington. He came to me and said that you called upon him and asked him where he worked and whether I paid him the sum of £50, and what work he did for me, and when and how I paid him, and whether I paid him £50 by cheque. "I said, "What he told you is correct. I did take a statement from him, and be signed it. "He said, "Well, I have three witnesses who heard what you asked him. You detectives put a lot down in the book and get a man to sign it. You have no right to. You will not get me to sign any statement. You have exceeded your duty."</p>
               <p>Mr. George Elliott submitted that there was no case against E. Evans.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060099"/>
               <p>The Common Serjeant held that there was no evidence that E. Evans acted in fraud of either the general body of creditors, or of the par<lb/>ticular creditors named.</p>
               <p>The Foreman stated that the jury were of opinion that E. Evans was not guilty, and a verdict to that effect was entered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis Bennett submitted that there was not sufficient evidence to support the indictment against A. E. Evans. At the time of the assignment there was only one judgment of £31, and creditors amount<lb/>ing to about £200, whose debts were being paid.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant held that there was some evidence against E. Evans; that the object of the assignment was to defeat all the creditors; there was not sufficient evidence on the counts with regard to particular creditors.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, 66, Chancery Lane. On March 11 A. E. Evans told me that he had sold his business to his father for £500 because he (his son) had been ordered by two doctors to go to a hospital; that he owed nearly £500 to creditors, whom the father would pay with the £500. I then saw Mr. Coupman, and asked him to let the question between his clients and A. E. Evans remain open until I could look further into the matter. I saw E. Evans, and told him that when the £500 was paid to the creditors there would be nothing left for A. E. Evans's wife and children, and suggested that I should try to get a rebate from some of the creditors. E. Evans said, "Whatever you advise I will do. "The son was present. I settled with the creditors. Some were paid in full; others accepted a rebate. Mr. Coupman agreed to take 5s. in the £ if I satisfied him that the amount alleged to be due to the father was really due. I saw him the next day, showed him receipts, etc., for the debt to the father, and he wrote me agreeing to accept 10s. in the £ and costs. I called at his office with the money, when the clerk told me that Coupman had wired me that his acceptance of the offer was withdrawn.</p>

               <p>In discharging A. E. Evans, the Common Serjeant said he had brought this upon himself by stating untruths in his public examina<lb/>tion; if he had been tried for perjury the result might have been different.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Muir and Mr. Forster Boulton prosecuted. Mr. Cecil Whiteley defended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whiteley asked that there should be a fresh jury, on the ground that the jury had already made up their minds and convicted in two similar cases [Connelly and Attree]. The Recorder refused the application, remarking that the fact that the jury were acquainted with the character of the evidence, which a new jury would not be, was an advantage; and that Counsel was casting an improper asper<lb/>sion upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir, in the course of his opening, said that a clerk from the Secretary's office of the General Post Office called upon prisoner in order to give him an opportunity of furnishing an explanation. He submitted that it would have been an exceedingly dangerous thing if the Post Office had not given him an oppor<lb/>tunity of explaining. The public would have a right to complain if people were arrested in such circumstances without having had an opportunity given them of making explanations. Prisoner was cautioned that he need not say any<lb/>thing at all unless he liked, but that anything he said might be given in evidence against him.</p>
               <p>The Recorder asked whether Mr. Muir suggested that there was any difference between a private policeman of the Post Office and a Metropolitan policeman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. I say that, even in the case of a Metropolitan policeman, before he arrested any person on facts such as these it would be his duty to the public to give that person an opportunity to explain.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. And ask questions?</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. Yes.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. All I can say is that you are propounding a doctrine which is opposed to that laid down by some of the most distinguished Judges who have occupied the Bench.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. I have studied a series of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal, in which the principle laid down is that a policeman or Post Office official is entitled to ask questions of persons if they are not in custody, provided that he holds out no hope of exemption and no threat of consequences. And not only is he entitled to ask the questions, but the answers to them are admissible in evidence. That principle has been upheld again and again in the Court of Criminal Appeal.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. The question is not whether the answers are admissible in evidence—they are—but whether it is a desirable practice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir suggested the case of a tradesman in the possession of stolen goods; was not a policeman going into his shop entitled to ask him where he got the goods?</p>
               <p>The Recorder said a case of stolen goods was entirely different from this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. I submit that the cases are exactly the same. I submit that the Post Office clerk did his duty to the public and to his employers in the most proper way.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060101"/>
               <p>The Recorder. I said distinctly yesterday in Attree's case that no blame was attachable to the clerk. All I was endeavoring to suggest, is that the practice was undesirable. Having regard to the fact that public departments have now increased powers, their police ought not to exercise the power, which all the Judges in my experince have condemned and said they ought not to exercise, of putting questions to persons who are about to be charged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir. The Post Office is a great public department, and its legal branch is under the control of persons of the highest standing and attainments. They have studied the series of decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and they have sanctioned this course of conduct. In their judgment it is a proper course, and it will be continued.</p>

                  </hi>, postman, Forest Hill Post Office, repeated the evidence that he had given in Goddard's case (see page 463, 531) as to his interview with Watson on June 11, and what had happened thereon. About 8.45 a.m. on August 4 I saw Watson at the "Napier" public house, Forest Hill. He said, "I have got to get some money somewhere, I know a chap that has lost a lot of money lately with a bookie at Le wish am. Do you think you could get one stamped for me?" I said I could. I met him at 10 a.m. at the "Swiss Cottage "Hotel. He told me to go over to the "Telegraph" public house. He gave me a plain envelope (Exhibit lb), which was open, and contained a piece of blank paper. At his request I date stamped it 1. 15 p. m., manipulating it so that I could recognise it again. About 12. 30 p. m. I gave it back to him, and at 2.55 pm. I met him in Devonshire Road, where he handed it to me sealed and addressed to "Mr. Johns tone, 39, Rime Road, Lewisham," saying "I have just come up from Catford with this, I shall see you about 4, and you can let me know if it goes all right. "I marked it with blue pencil and put it in the course of post. On meeting him at 4.10 p.m. I told him it had gone through all right. I met him by appointment the next morning at 8. 10 at the "Napier," when he said, "We can go to Perry Hill and get the money. I expect I shall be able to get 11s., and you can have a dollar. I had to go right over there this afternoon. I asked him to let me have the postal order in his handwriting, and I would copy his writing on the ticket the same as I did Connelly's, but he would not do so. I had to 'phone for this and go to him to get the ticket made out, as he is ill in bed. His name is 'Williams.' "I met him again at 8. 30 a. m. the next day, August 5, when he said he was going to Perry Hill to get the money from Williams for yesterday, and I was to go down to the "Two Brewers" and wait for him there. I went to Perry Hill. Watson went into No. 60, where Williams lives. He came about 9.10, and I went to the "Two Brewers," Watson following me. He told me to go towards Blythe Vale, and he would see me there, and I went. He came and gave me a. postal order for 4s., saying he had got 8s. from Williams and the 4s. was for me, and asked me if I could do another one for him that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In my transactions with Watson between June 11 and August 4 Williams's name was never mentioned. The first time I saw him was at the police-court. It struck me on August 4 that Watson was in rather a destitute state. It was about 20 minutes'</p>

                  </hi> I carry on business as a bookmaker at 39, Rime Road, Lewisham, in the name of Mr. Johnstone Williams, had been betting with me from about 18 months before August last. This Exhibit lb was specially delivered to me at about six p. m. on August It contained a postal order for 15s. (Exhibit 3b), and a betting slip (Exhibit 2b), backing Waterleaf in the 2 p.m. race that day at Brighton, for 7s. 6d. each way, and Orpiment in the 3 p.m. at Manchester, with instructions to back another horse if they won with the winnings. He signed "Williams "at the back in his usual way. Waterleaf won at 9 to 4, and Orpiment came in second. I sent him his winnings in 4s. postal orders, of which this is one (Exhibit 11b). This account, which I also sent, shows £1 11s. 2d. as due to him, of which 15s. is his stake. On receiving the further betting slip (Exhibit 10b) I wrote to him on August 5: "I am holding over payment of your bet of to-day. Your letter bore the 1. 15 postmark, Forest Hill, and did not arrive until 7. 30 p. m. the same as your letter the day before." I got another betting slip from him on August 6 (Exhibit 8b) on which I wrote, returning it, saying, "No bet with me." I see written on the betting slip, "This bet was made out by 9 a.m. Saturday," and at the bottom, "This bet was posted at Forest Hill by 10 o'clock collection. See you Monday. "I could not say whether the first sentence was on it when I sent it back, but the second sentence was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My transactions with him were always satisfactory. I know that Waterleaf and Orpiment were given as tips in the "Daily Mail" of that day. The horses on abetting slip of August 5 are not in his handwriting. I cannot say about the slip of August 6.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, Secretary's Office G. P. O. On August 11 I saw Williams at his house, 60, Perry Hill, Catford. I told him my name and position and that I was making inquiries regarding cer<lb/>tain betting letters and that I was going to ask him certain questions, which he need not answer unless he liked, but that anything he said would be taken down in writing and might be used in evidence against him. I then showed him all the exhibits and he made the following statement" (Exhibit 6b), which I took down in writing: "I look at the letters of August 4, and August 5 addressed to Mr. Johnstone, the betting slips contained in them and the postal orders. I hear you say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060103"/>
               <p>there is reason to think the bets made in those letters are fraudulent. I hear you ask if I wish to offer any explanation of them being made in my name. I wrote the betting slip contained in the letter of August 4, I did not purchase the postal order contained in that letter. I addressed the cover to Mr. Johnstone. The slip and cover were written by me last Thursday between 10 and 11 a. m. I put the slip in the envelope and gave the envelope to a man whose name I do not know with 15s. to purchase the postal order. I told him to enclose the postal order in the envelope and post it. I wrote the address on the envelope dated August 5. The four postal orders you show me I gave to the said man with the envelope dated August 5. The written communication is not in my writing. I did not know the horses backed on that slip were going to be backed. The man told me he might have something good to send about 12 o'clock and if so he would back it, There is no agreement between me and the man. I was going to give him a couple of shillings for posting it. I gave the letter of August 4 to the man to post because I wag home ill in bed. He called to see me. I do not know why. I have not passed a score of words with him in my life. I received the winnings in the bet made in the letter of August 4. I kept it all myself. The first time I saw the man was, when he came to my house here about an order for some beer. It was about six months ago. I do not know where he lives. I do not know where to find him. I believe his name is Foster. "I reported that to my superior officer and on August 13 a warrant was taken out. I took statements from other persons in connection with this matter and in all eases warrants were taken out. Stratford was also taking state<lb/>ments, and in two cases warrants were not taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took this statement with one other man in Williams's front sitting-room. I put a series of questions to him.</p>

I have never done a crooked thing in my life. I absolutely know nothing about it. When taken to the station and charged he made no reply. On him I found Exhibits 7b, 8b, 9b, and 10b.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I first met Watson last February when he called on me with an order for beer. I dis<lb/>cussed horse-racing with him. I did not know what his name was. I did not see him again until August 4. I was in bed with bronchitis, where I had been since July 26, when at about 9.30 p.m. he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060104"/>
               <p>to the door, my wife came upstairs and said someone of the name of Watson wanted to see me. I did not know the name, but when he came up I recognised him. He said he was sorry to see I was in, and we started talking about racing. I told him I had had two horses sent me on the night before for that day's racing, and I showed him the letter. I wrote them on a betting slip. One was Orpiment and the other Waterleaf, a horse I had seen in the "Daily Mail" that morning. I asked him to get me a 15s. postal order, a packet of envelopes, and a penny stamp, and gave him £1. He went out at about 12. 30 p. m. and returned at about 12. 45. He handed me an envelope to address, and I addressed it in the usual way to Mr. Johnstone, the bookmaker. I was in bed at the time. I did not notice that there was a penny stamp on it, nor that a postmark had been put on it. The blinds were down, and I am shortsighted. I had not my glasses on, and I could not see without them, although I can write. I then put the slip and the postal order in the envelope, and, without sealing it down, gave it to him, and asked him to post it. I told him to put it in up the road to secure it reaching in time for the bet to be good. I generally posted them at Perry Hill by the 12 o'clock post, and this was 12.45. I gave him the difference in the change for his trouble—about 1s. 5d. He left before one p.m. He came to see me the next morning at about 9.30. I was in bed. I told him I did not intend betting that day, and he said if I liked to give him some money, later on in the day he might get some good information, and he would put it on for me. I gave him the postal orders that I had received from Johnstone just previously, three for 4s. and one for 3s. He said he was very hard up, and I gave him a 4s. postal order. The next morning the bet that he had made for me was returned by the bookmaker. I made a bet on my own on Saturday morning, which was again returned to me. The statement made on August 11 by me is correct, except that I did not write the slip of August 4 at between 10 and 11 a. m. I got confused between that and the following day. There was no arrangement between myself and Watson that he should post the letter after the race was run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My sight has always been a little funny. When Watson called on August 4 I understood the name my wife brought up to me was "Foster. "I suppose he came because he had some in<lb/>formation to give me. On my asking him he said he was a tipster. He did not say he had come to see me about racing. I could not have asked him his name because when giving my statement I said it was "Foster. "It is not true that I had been losing a good deal with John<lb/>stone just before this. It is not true that I saw Watson at 8 a.m. on August 4. I could not have told him that I was losing. I never had any agreement with Watson to share my winnings with him. The bet<lb/>ting slip of August 5 is like my writing but it is not mine; it is authenticated in the same way as that of August 4 with "Williams" at the back. Watson had no specimen of my writing on August 5, except the envelope of August 4. There was no reason why I should not have sealed Exhibit 1b.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060105"/>
               <p>Re-examined. Watson saw my betting slip of August 4, with my name at the back of it.</p>

I went to the hospital, and on August 1, after going to the police-station, I saw the hat-pin (produced). picked up in the gutter by Mr. Rushbrook's son. I returned to the hospital for a week.

About four or five hours after<lb/>wards I was woke up by Mr. Coburn saying his missies was locked up. We got home about 12. 30. I did not see or hear that the prosecutor was injured.</p>

Soon afterwards Wright began to come and he used my sitting-room to write his letters, and letters came to me addressed to Wright. Later on Wright took a cottage on the farm. Lilley frequently came there; I knew him as Mr. White.</p>

                  </hi>, coal merchant, Acton. In September I saw Wright at Twyford Abbey Farm. He told me he had some horses for sale which had been working on the railway in Norfolk; I picked out a grey mare; he said it was a good worker and asked £35 for it; I said I would pay him £30, £20 down, and £10 if the mare suited. The day that I took the mare home I tried her in all sorts of ways and she would not work. I took her back and got in exchange a chestnut cob; this also I found would not work and I returned it. I next tried a chestnut</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060109"/>
               <p>mare, and had to return that. Wright told me I should have my money back, but he had not got it then. On November 5 a man I do not know called and paid me £10 on account; that is all I got back. I never saw Lilley at the farm. Later on I called at a house in South London and saw Lilley; he told me that Wright was living at Tottenham and said he would jog his memory when he saw him. At the time I parted with my money I believed that Wright was a genuine farmer and was selling me a sound animal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When the £10 was paid to me it left a balance of £10 due, for which no date of payment was fixed. Lilley subsequently offered payment in instalments of 10s. a week; within four days of the offer Wright was arrested.</p>

In consequence of an advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph" "Farm, cart, and van horses for immediate sale; cause of sale explained," I went to Twyford Abbey and there saw Wright. I said, "I want a young horse to go single or double in a potato van. "He said, "I think I can fit you up. "We went to the stables and I saw several horses. I picked out one and said, "I suppose you can warrant' it. "He said, "Yes; it's a good one; I bred it myself; I have used it on the farm in haymaking; also, it has been let out for a laundry van; it is six years old. "I agreed to pay him £20 for the horse; he said, "You have got a horse that will last you a lifetime. "As to the cause of sale, he said, "I have just done haymaking and have got no further use for them. "The horse was utterly worth<lb/>less; it was impossible to get it to work at all. Eventually I sent it to Aldridge's and I got £6 or £7 for it.</p>

I said, "No. "Later I called with a vet (Broad) and again saw Lilley. After looking at the horses in the stables, Broad asked that they might be trotted up and down the street; Lilley said the police would not allow it; but eventually three were brought out. I selected two horses and agreed the price at £60; I gave him cheque for £50 and £10 in notes; the cheque (Exhibit 43) is endorsed "E.

"When I went to leave he said to me, "What are you going to do?" I replied, "You need have no fear of me if you are carrying on your business straightforwardly. "On November 2 at the Brentford Police Court an information was laid by Standen and a warrant was granted for Wright's arrest.

                  </hi>, medical officer of Brixton Prison. I have had prisoner under observation for some time. He tells me that of late he has had a lot of trouble with his head; that his dreams have been so terrifying that he is kept awake all night; that this has been going on for some five months, and that it is entirely due to hypnotic influences exercised over him by his brother and others; that at the time of this occurrence he was on his way to consult a mental specialist; his brother insisted on following him, and that was the original cause of the quarrel. While under observation he has been perfectly quiet and tractable, but he was very, dreamy and imaginative, and his de<lb/>lusion as to hypnotism still persists. He tells me that he can by some magnetic power diagnose by his own feelings the different ailments of the other prisoners in the ward, as he feels exactly the same pains as they have. Some three weeks before he got to Brixton he heard a voice speaking to him, but did not know what it said. This, in my opinion, was a distinct hallucination. Having carefully gone into this case, I consider that prisoner is suffering from delusional insanity; that he requires rest; and that he may become dangerous to others. At the time of committing this offence I consider that he knew the nature of the act, but he did not know it was wrong, as his mind was so absolutely warped by these delusions that his judgment was entirely in abeyance. It was acting on those delusions that he committed the offence.</p>

About 3. 30 a. m. on August 20 my son heard a noise downstairs. He told me and I went to the landing and listened, when I heard a scuffling downstairs. I went to the front window, opened it, and blew my whistle. On the other side I saw a policeman running. About six minutes after he brought prisoner back I had not seen him before. I found the back parlour window had been forced open, the fern stand was pushed a little back, and there were marks of a knife on the woodwork of the window.</p>

                  </persName>, 73 K. About 3.40 a.m. on August 20 I heard a police whistle. I went towards where the sound came from and I saw a man and two or three police officers running towards me. Before I got to them they all turned down a street. I turned back and ran down another side street and I met prisoner at the corner of Old Street. He was running and out of breath and had his boots under his arm. I detained him. A constable came up and said, "I saw this man leave an empty house in Barking Road. "Prisoner said, "I have not been in any house. "I said, "How is it you have got your boots off?" but he made no reply. I took him back to pro<lb/>secutor's house, No. 593, Barking Road. The doors of No. 595, next door, an empty house, were open. I found prosecutor's back parlour window open, with marks of a knife upon it, and this knife, which had evidently been used to force back the catch, was on a meat-safe out<lb/>side the window. I showed the knife to prisoner, and he said, "I don't know anything about that." I took him to the station and on being charged he said, "I never entered the house. The other man did. I went in to have a sleep and he came and woke me up." He would have no difficulty in getting from the back of 595 into 593; there is only a small fence. At the police-court he said he had taken off his boots for a pillow. I never saw any other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You did not tell me when I stopped you that you were sleeping in an empty house and you had taken your boots off.</p>

He began to put them on, but, observing me, he ran away. I chased him. At 11. 30 the previous evening I saw prisoner with another man about 300 yards from this spot. I went back to No. 595 and found the front and back doors open. There is a fence of about 5 ft. high separating the back gardens of Nos. 593 and 595.</p>

There are passes for personal effects and if there is anything special the men have a pass signed by the company. There was no special pass in this case. I told prisoner his baggage had been detained in the Victoria Dock as I had found the two tins of jam. He said, "I know they are there; they are stores issued to us and I have not used them and I was going to take them home. "He was charged after that.</p>

                  </hi>, superintendent purser, New Zealand Shipping Com<lb/>pany. The men on board our ships are divided into messes, and to those messes are distributed weekly allowances of jam, butter, etc. Other things which have to be allowed under the Merchant Shipping Act are served up already cooked. The tins of jam supplied for the use of the crew are 7 lb. tins. No 7 lb. or 2 lb. tin is served out to any one man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know prisoner and seven or eight others who have been arrested claim these tins as belonging to them. Whether the company like it or not they have to provide every sailor with 1 lb. of jam or marmalade per week under the Act, and it is also embodied in the articles. (To the Judge.) If a man liked to forgo his jam or marmalade, butter could be substituted.) I should not like to say that the men can do what they like with the food served out to them.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060118"/>
               <p>I do not know that a man would be prosecuted if he threw his food overboard; the question has never been raised. I cannot say if the company would consider it a criminal offence. They would certainly take the view that he was wasting the stores and they would have a case against him for wasting. I have never heard of a rule on our vessels that the single men give the jam and marmalade they have left on arrival at Gravesend to the married men. We have now added a clause to the articles that all unconsumed stores that have been issued to the men are to be the property of the company. The clause was submitted to the Board of Trade and approved by them.</p>

               <p>The Foreman. That is so.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. I think the defendant's contention is ridiculous, and it ought to be set out clearly that no such thing is possible or allowable as that a man should take food off a ship. The Government has said that seamen must be supplied with a certain amount of food because it is for the safety of the passengers and the ship. A man could not be allowed to half starve himself—it would be an absurd con<lb/>tention.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warde. I am prepared to go that length.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frampton. I am prepared to go the other length. I opened this case to the jury, I submit, in a most impartial way, and pointed out that it was not a question as to whether, in the view of the defen<lb/>dant, he had a right to do it, but whether he had a felonious intent.</p>

If I had been going to take the tea and convert it to my own use, I had no necessity to obtain orders. I took the orders in on the Friday night, and asked him if he would give me a small amount on account of wages to save me breaking into the money. I think it was a wet day on Saturday, and I was till eight o'clock at night trying to deliver this tea and get people to take it. In the finish I threw the thing up in disgust. I served as many as I possibly could, and thought I had done a fair week's work. I thought at the worst it would be only a small difference, there being no settled arrangement about the wage I was to be paid. I took upon myself the responsibility to make that wage myself, and any difference there would have been I was quite willing to refund.</p>

                  </hi>, widow, 152, Belmore Avenue, East Ham. I am the second wife of my husband, who died in April, 1908. About three weeks after his death I went to live with prisoner, working for her in exchange for my board and lodging. At the end of that April I received £60 from the Post Office Insurance Fund. Prisoner knew it was coming to me; she advanced me £5 the day before it came. I had no banking account of my own, and she told me she would put it through her bank for me and give me the money, but that she cloud not pass it through directly as she had not money enough in the bank. I gave her the cheque. My husband was buried on May 2. On May 1 she gave me £10 or £15, I am not sure which. She said she would give me the rest when she had passed my cheque through the bank. She sold her business of a general shop on September 2, and left after giving me £6. I received £30 in all from her. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060120"/>
               <p>asked her several times between April and September for my money and she said she would settle up when she had sold the business. On the day she left I said I wanted some money to go to the Isle of Wight, and she said, "I will let you have £6 now. I am going to the bank, and when I come back I will pay you up. I'll bring in some<lb/>thing for tea. I never saw her until she was in custody this July. On September 16 of that year I issued a warrant against her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She lent me the £5 to help pay my husband's funeral expenses. She gave it to me in gold in the shop in her husband's presence. I gave her the cheque to cash for me as I wanted to put the money into the P. O. Bank. I expected the money the same day, but she kept putting me off. I was told prisoner went away with a young man, leaving her husband and daughter behind. They told me they had been to the Continent to see her. I did not know where she was. About a week after she left her daughter handed me this letter from her, which she undated, and has no address, saying that she would be home in a fortnight, and that she was looking for another business, when her daughter Lily and myself would be all right. I heard no conversation before she left about her husband buying a house. I do not know if he bought one. He did not offer to give me 5 per cent, for my money to buy one with. When I asked prisoner for my money she did not tell me to ask him for it.</p>

                  </hi> I remember prisoner, who is my mother, leaving the house on September 2, 1908. Prosecutrix asked her on that day for the remainder of her money—£30—and my mother said she was going to the bank and she would give her the money when she re<lb/>turned; that she would not be long, and would bring something in for tea. I did not see her again. I saw mother give her £6, and I think that reduced the debt to the £30. The next day prosecutrix handed me an envelope. I heard my mother had gone to Belgium, and some time that year T went there to see her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We got the address through the bank. We went to try and get her to come home again. I know it was £6 that mother gave prosecutrix because I remember prosecutrix saying that that would not be enough to go away with. I have only her state<lb/>ment that it was £6. I did not count it. My father bought a house, but it was before Mr. Lough died. The letter I received from my mother contained a cheque for the Building Society.</p>

                  </hi>, cashier, London and South-Western Bank, West Ham. I produce a certified copy of prisoner's account be<lb/>tween March and November, 1908. The cheque for £60 was passed through on May 1, 1908, and credited to her. The account was closed in November, 1908, by a cheque of £31 17s. 6d. being drawn out.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant, East Ham. At 11.30 a.m. on July 10 I found prisoner detained at East Leigh Police Station, Hampshire. I read the warrant which was issued on September 16, 1908, to her, and she said, "I did not have the money. My husband had it. "On the way to London she said, "I paid Mr. Lough's fune<lb/>ral expenses and I paid for her mourning before I had the cheque. I did not have the money, although I paid the cheque into my bank. My husband had the money. He told me to give it to him. My husband was going to buy a house, and he asked me to ask her if she would lend him some money. I asked her and she said, 'Is it all right?" My husband said, 'Yes, I am not going to use it; I am going to put it into property, and I will give you 5 per cent. 'Mrs. Lough then said, 'Let him have it. 'I have not got any right in it neither has Mrs. Lough or my husband. I wish I had, but I did not steal it. When the charge was read over to her she said, "I did not have it. My husband had the money. "</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prior to September, 1908, prisoner was carry<lb/>ing on a very prosperous business. She went off to Belgium with a man named Windsor. She always bore a good business character at East Ham. I believe her husband is an undischarged bankrupt. The business was in prisoner's name. (To the jury.) I know it is a pros<lb/>perous business because I have seen the accounts.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I advanced prosecutrix £20 in April, 1908, to pay the funeral expenses, as the cheque she was to receive was delayed. When it came she gave it to me to pay myself out of it and to pay the rest into my bank, where it was to remain until she wanted it. I did so. A fortnight afterwards she came to live with me, and said she did not need any money as I was going to keep her, and I could use it as I wanted it. My husband said one day he wanted to buy a house through a building society, and asked her to lend him the £30, the balance due to her. She asked me if I did not want it, and I said she could do as she pleased with it, and that it was nothing to do with me. She agreed to do so, and I gave him the £30, which I had in the house at the time, he promising to give her 5 per cent, for it, saying that it would be better than paying it into the Post Office. No previous mention had been made of the Post Office to me. On the morning of September 2 she asked me for her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060122"/>
               <p>money as she wanted to go to the Isle of Wight for a holiday. I went to the bank, drew out £40, and gave her £10 in gold; which was the balance left after my husband had taken the £30. My daughter was not present at the time, and she has not spoken the truth in saying I only gave her £6. I had just sold my business. My husband was cruel and misconducted himself and, being a Belgian, I went on that day to my mother in Antwerp. I wrote to my daughter from there and enclosed a letter to prosecutrix because I liked her. Some weeks after my husband and daughter came over and wanted me to return with them, but I refused. I had a public house there, which I kept five months. On November 5 I drew out the rest of my money from the bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I told nobody that I was going. My daughter knew my address all the time; she wrote to my mother. I never went away with a Mr. Windsor. I did not give prosecutrix £10 or £15 on May 1.</p>

Their value is about £7. About July 18 I missed them, and I reported their loss to the captain. A notice was posted up, offering a reward for their return. On August 10 they were shown me, and I identified them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was looked after in the cabin by stewards. No sailors came near. I also missed a watch and chain, which I subse<lb/>quently found in my bag. The reward was posted up in the two vestibules. I have had the glasses nine years.</p>

                  </hi>, detective, Port of London Authorities, stationed at Victoria Docks. About 4 p. m. on August 10 I examined prisoner's kit-bag at the docks. It was being conveyed out by the London Parcel Delivery Company's vans with a number of other kit-bags. I found about three-parts of the way down, this pair of binoculars, tied up in this handkerchief. This shirt was wrapped tightly round them. (Articles produced). It is the prosecutor's handkerchief. About 1.45 p.m. I saw prisoner on the vessel, and told him what I had found, and asked him for an explanation. He said, "I know nothing about them. "I said, "Who packed your bag?" and he said, "I did." I said, "The glasses have been stolen. I shall have to take you into custody and detain you for the time being. "He said, "All right" On being charged he replied, "Yes. "When shown the handkerchief and shirt We said, "They are not mine."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is my common practice to search the kit begs, and the men know it. I was asked on this occasion to search owing to the number of robberies that had taken place of the cargo and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191009060123"/>
               <p>other things on the boat principally on the outward voyage. I am told prisoner was not sailing on the ship then. There is nobody here who can give any information as to the extent of the robberies on the homeward voyage. I should say the able seamen are not allowed into the passengers' cabins, but they can get there. There is nothing on the shirt to show whom it belongs to. Before the ship gets into the dock the seamen, of which there are 120, pack in the fo'castle. The stewards have separate berths. Prisoner's was an ordinary sea<lb/>man's bag. Anybody could have put anything in it. There was no lack of it. It is the general practice of the men to put on a label and have their bags sent to their homes by the Parcels Delivery Co. Some of the men on the outward voyage came home on the homeward voyage. I do not know that there was a search made in New Zealand; I know they made inquiries. Prisoner bears a good character. He joined the ship in New Zealand, where he had been three years. His discharges are excellent. His discharge for his home voyage is marked "Very good," and is dated August 19 after he was committed for trial. Thirty or 40 men's kit-bags would be in the same place and they are left there for the Parcels Delivery man to take. I found five bags containing stolen goods, but there were others searching be<lb/>sides me. I think 20 were found in all.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been a seaman for many years. All my discharges are marked very good. The first I heard about these glasses was when I went down to the docks to get paid off. A seaman told me there were two detectives waiting on board for me to ask me about these glasses that were found in my bag. I went on board and saw the chief officer, who said he did not think I had anything to do with it. I told the detective I knew nothing about this. I have never seen the handkerchief or the shirt before. I found this piece of blue rag tied round with string in my bag. I have never seen that before. Coming up the channel the night before we arrived I was packing my bag. I had packed it a quarter of the way up and then I went at 1 a. m. on the look out till 4 a. m. I left my bag open among a number of others which belonged to the men. I completed my packing after the ship had been tied up along the side. I then tied it up and put a label on it. I have never seen the glasses before. We are not allowed near the passengers' cabins. The stewards are allowed to enter our fo'castle. There is a cupboard there in which they keep things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never noticed the glasses when I resumed my packing. I did not turn out the bag. I was on very good terms with all the men.</p>

                  </hi>. Prisoner showed me these silver articles at his house, Mulberry Street, Whitechapel, last June. He said, "You little think while you are abed and asleep I am doing these little moon<lb/>light jobs. I am sorry to tell you I am a professional burglar. This is my third year. I am going to take the dishes and pig over to Clap<lb/>ham Common and do them into a 'fence. '" We went next day to Clapham Common and he went to the shop. The man was at dinner, so we came back and went to a coffee-shop. Prisoner left me there while he went to sell them. When he came back in a quarter of an hour he had not got them. He saw me speaking to a young man at the coffee-shop. He asked me what he had been saying. I thought he meant about him and said he had said nothing. We had a row. I called him a thief and said I had heard all about him from the coffee stall. I asked him to forgive me for saying it. They used to talk about him at the coffee-stall and that gave me a light on it that he was a burglar.</p>

I said to prisoner, "Do you wish to give any infor<lb/>mation respecting the disposal of the trinkets?" He said, "I sold them to a jeweller at Clapham Junction near the public-house where the 'buses stop. He gave me 11s. for them as old silver. "The jeweller has gone to Brussels on some legal matter. The business is still being carried on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate. "I have read the state<lb/>ment of the boy Gregory. It is not all true. As regards the jewellery and trinkets which he speaks of I bought them two or three weeks ago from a man in Aldgate for 10s. I do not know the man's name or ad<lb/>dress. He was a big pugilistic fellow. Gregory was working for me. I found him out in dishonesty. I remember stating to him I was a pro<lb/>fessional burglar, but that was in a jocular way. I told him that he had better leave my company. I told him since I was out at night on</p>

               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins had appeared to prosecute on previous occa<lb/>sions; Mr. George Elliott, K.C., Mr. Curtis Bennett, and Mr. Eustace Fulton now appeared to defend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins stated that he was not instructed in the case.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor in person asked for an adjournment, stating that he had not the necessary funds, without which his solicitor would not proceed. On it being pointed out that the plea of justification set up was filed as early as August 27, the Recorder refused the application, and asked the prosecutor whether he proposed to offer any evidence. The prosecutor replied that he did not, as he was not in a position to conduct the case himself. <rs id="t19100906-114-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">
