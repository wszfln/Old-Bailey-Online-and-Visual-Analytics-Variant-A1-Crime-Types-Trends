            , Esq., the barrister. On the 4th of November my master went to a party in Harley-street, and about a quarter to twelve o'clock I was directed to procure him a coach; I went to Mary-le-bone-street - there was none on that stand; I was going to Paddington-street, and at the corner of <placeName id="t18250113-1-crimeloc3">Little Chesterfield-street</placeName>

I endeavoured to get away - she told me not to be in a hurry: she pulled me along the passage, and I fell upon my head down the kitchen stairs - she was pulling me up, and at the same time tried my breeches pocket; she pushed me into the kitchen, and bolted the door, and then asked if I was going with her - I said I would not; she demanded 1 s. 6 d., and in order to get away to fetch the coach I gave it to her - she then demanded 2 s. 6 d.; I said if she would return the 1 s. 6 d. I would give her half-a-crown - she did so, and I said as she was so imposing I would not give her any thing. I endeavoured to get out: she called to Larkin, and unbolted the door to let her in. When Larkin came in she put the light out; the door was bolted again. I struck several blows at them, and got to the door, and pulled it open, and was rushing up stairs - my head then came in contact with something; Larkin then came and caught hold of my coat - I got from her, and got up; she followed, and caught me round the waist, and put her face to mine; I shoved her back; she caught me by the cravat, and took out my gold pin. I got to the door; she endeavoured to catch hold of me again - I pushed her into the street, called watch, and she was secured; she denied having my pin, but produced it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far did you walk with her before you got to the house? A. She ran after me, and took hold of my arm about six yards from the door. I was sober. I could see no watchman. I had my hands in my pockets, or I could have got from her, if I had been aware of it. She said she would let me out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Larkin say she had a pin, and if you described it you should have it? - A. No; she denied having it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty, and took Larkin to the watch-house. When the watch-house keeper was writing the charge she produced this pin, and asked the prosecutor if it was his - he said it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she say,</p>
               <p>"I have found a pin on the ground, and if it is your's, here it is?" A. Not that I heard, but I did not particularly notice what passed. As we went to the watch-house she asked if he got his pin would he make it up - he insisted upon her going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Lloyd put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had accosted her, and accompanied her to Larkin's room, where they remained half an hour, when he gave her 1 s. 6 d., having promised her half-a-crown - that he took the 1 s. 6 d. from her in consequence of her complaining to him; words followed, and Larkin came in and turned him out. Larkin's Defence was to the same effect, and stated that she had found the pin on the floor of the room, and he must have dropped it in the scuffle with Lloyd.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ALLEN re-examined. Larkin caught me by the cravat, and took out the pin, I am certain - and when I got to the street door she denied having it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you ever say to any one that you might have dropped the pin? A. I never did, nor any thing to that effect. I saw Peter Hill at the office; he offered me 10 s. to say I had lost the pin when I was in the yard of the police office; I said I would have nothing to say to him - that is all that passed between us.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Lawrence-street, Bloomsbury. I was at the office when this man made his charge - I cannot say whether it was taken down in writing or not. I heard the Magistrate order the prisoners to find bail for an assault. I had a long conversation with the prosecutor at the office; he said he did not know, but he might have dropped the pin, and that he should not have appeared against the prisoners, but from his master's compulsion.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130004"/>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. I live on some little property, left me by my father, who died last Michaelmas twelvemonth. I have known Larkin from her infancy; I met her sister, who told me she was ill custody. I never offered the prosecutor 10 s. to say he had dropped the pin, I swear that. I offered him no money.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to talk with him? A. I wished to know what she was charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the Magistrate when the prosecutor gave his evidence,</p>
               <p>"Why, this man has just told me that he might have dropped the pin?" A. No, I have no recollection of saying so. I am sure they were ordered to find bail, for I attended with bail in the evening. The Magistrate approved of them, but a whispering took place between the officer and Magistrate, and he then required time to enquire.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ALLEN. (Looking at the depositions taken before the Magistrate,) these are the examinations; I signed them that morning - there was only one examination.</p>
               <p>PETER HILL re-examined. Q. Did you hear what Allen stated to the Magistrate? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say,</p>
               <p>"When I got into the passage Larkin held me round the waist, and then I felt my shirt pin wrenched from my breast?" A. I cannot recollect the particular words - he made a charge of taking a pin. I did not tender myself as a witness. I lived in Chesterfield-street last Session, in the same house in which the robbery happened, but at the time of the robbery I lived in New Tuthill-street; I moved to Chesterfield-street on the day after the robbery, as their lodging was vacant; I had lived there three or four weeks before, for about two months. I moved to Lawrence-street three days ago. I have done no work since this property was left me - I may have changed my lodgings ten times since I received my legacy. I was not within two miles of Chesterfield-street on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor's deposition being read was precisely to the same effect as his evidence in Court.</p>

I was called up by my servant, and found the window of a room on the ground floor, looking into the garden, open; the fastening was wrenched out of the wood work, to which it had been screwed. There was a dirty footmark on the bed, which is immediately under that window. About two hours after, upon looking, I found two small matches in the room; the window was propped up by an iron instrument. The plate closet was broken open, and the plate which was in use all gone; most of my plate had been previously sent to my father's. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; some of the stockings were ribbed, and some plain - they were marked with my name at full length. I went into the garden about nine o'clock that morning, and saw footmarks immediately under the window, but the ground being hard they were not distinct. I saw some very distinct impressions about one hundred and fifty yards from the window; they were measured in my presence, with a stick - they were measured again a fortnight after, and a notch cut in the stick to mark the size of the smaller one; the other was the length of the stick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The only footsteps you measured were at some distance from the window? A. Yes, but I could trace them up to the window. The garden is about three hundred feet long. I traced two distinct footsteps, from the bottom one hundred and fifty yards up, till they came to the lawn, on which of course there were no marks. I traced them from the lawn to a soft bed, under the window. The impressions were nearly two inches deep.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Wilberforce's service, and fastened the catch of the window between five and six o'clock the evening before the robbery, and locked the room door when I went to bed; I have the care of my master's linen - he had some plain and ribbed silk stockings; the ribbed ones were marked, in silk, with his name in full. I missed three pairs of ribbed, and two pairs of plain. The garden door was forced open - I had fastened it the night before, and the bed-room door was forced open, to enable them to get to the plate closet; nobody slept in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you shut up the bed-room? A. Between five and six o'clock; I do not think that the shutter was screwed quite tight, as it is difficult to fasten. The hasp of the window was wrenched off; I had fastened it, and barred the shutter. I did not lock the room door till about eleven o'clock - the stockings were in a chest of drawers in that bed-room.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 29th of November I and Shelswell searched a house at Chiswick; we found Pearce in a back room, on the first floor; Shelswell went up first; I was down in Scarce's room, on the ground floor. I found a variety of house-breaking implements in his room - I then went up to Pearce's room, and saw a hat box, with three pairs of silk stockings in it; I took out one pair, and Shelswell two; we did not examine them then, but at the second examination I could distinctly make out the name of Wilberforce, which had been picked out. Mr. Wilberforce gave me a stick at Queen-square: I went to Tothill-fields prison, where the prisoners were in custody, and measured Pearce's shoes or boots - I think he wore boots; they were exactly the same length as the stick; Scarce's differed about 1-8th of an inch from the notch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear that the name is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130005"/>not Wilkinson? A. I read it Wilberforce. Their feet are about the usual length. When Pearce saw that the length corresponded, he said they were too tight for him, as he had had them mended.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th of December, about a quarter past five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Angel-alley, Bishopsgate, and saw the prisoner and another man cross the street, with a chest of tea between them - I immediately ran up, and laid hold of the prisoner - he slipped from me, and ran across the way; the other ran down the alley. I got a man to mind the chest, while I secured the prisoner, who was never out of my sight. I then returned, and took him and the chest to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not at first see only one man with it? A. No, both were carrying it between them. The man who I left in care of the chest is not here - I was absent about two minutes. A carman came up and owned it. I took notice of it, but not so as to know it by any mark.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. Nearly twelve months. I am a widow. He lodged at my house in New Cut, Lambeth. We were married at St. Bride's because I was married there the first time. He came to me as a journeyman carpenter and a bachelor, and said it was useless for a man to be in business without a wife, and that he was forty years of age, and had come from Liverpool - that he had a mother, but no other relation. I lived with him till about two months ago, when he turned me out of doors at twelve o'clock at night. I did not hear of his having a wife till after I left him. I never told any one that I knew of his previous marriage; my son is nineteen years of age - he was not the cause of our separation.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did that son ever give you any uneasiness? A. Never. I have had three children by the prisoner - they are dead. He had 580 l. with me at our marriage. He referred me to his mother, as he called her, at Liverpool, to prove that he was single; I got an answer to my letter - he said he hoped I was now satisfied as to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130007"/>being single - I said I was. I have said to him since our marriage that it was strange he had no letters from his mother - he said she was offended at his marrying in London, and my having part of my property settled upon me - that she had never acted a mother's part by him, and he did not care for her. He has treated me very bad for the last year, and frequently stood over me with a quart pot, threatening to do for me. We both belong to the Westleyan Methodists.</p>

I opened the door to go to them, but they ran off.

            . I am wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner came to our house on the 12th of November, a little after two o'clock; he was in my parlour, where I was ironing - he said he was cold in his feet - that his master had sent him the evening before to his washerwoman, who was dead, and he had recommended me - I got a chair, and set it before the fire for him to warm himself - the watch then hung over the mantel-piece - he got up and put his foot on the bar, reached up his hand, and took it down - he put it towards his bosom and then rushed out of the house, saying he would bring his master's card at six o'clock. I pursued him - he ran into Warwick-place, and on his seeing me he got behind some houses, and I lost sight of him before he was stopped - in a moment he came in a direction towards me - I collared him, and accused him of taking my property - he said he had not got it - I told him he had flung it away. It was found in a lady's garden close at the back of the houses. I am quite sure it is ours. My landlord's son came up, and took him into the house till the officer came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man said he was coming back at six o'clock, but you did not wait to see if he would? A. No. I knew him before - he got a long way before me when he was running.</p>

From his great dexterity he must have been, I think, an old practitioner. He took to his heels and ran away - I immediately followed him and cried Stop thief - I kept sight of him for some time - at that moment a witness, who was standing opposite to Mr. Shepherd's glass-house, pursued him, and another witness, who was a little forward, joined in the pursuit, and he was taken in about two minutes. A constable, who happened to be in the street, stopped him, and he was taken to St. Martin's watch-house, but the watch has not been found. From the general appearance of the prisoner and from one or other of us not losing sight of him, I think he is the man. I had lost sight of him for a few moments while he was turning the corners. It was a metal watch with a gold seal, and had cost me about 9 l.</p>

I had been to receive my pension - the prisoners were quarrelling with another young woman; I stepped up to see what was the matter. I had two or three of my comrades with me; we left the women in the street, and went into a public-house. We did not get very intoxicated, but were a little the worse for liquor. We left the public-house about half-past two or three o'clock. I then met the prisoners again - Mott wished me to go with her, which I declined; she still followed me, and asked for something to drink - Wardle was then gone. I went into a liquor shop at the top of the Haymarket, and gave her a glass of gin; I then came down to the Broadway, and gave to Mr. Fox, a poulterer, one sovereign, to take 7 s. 6 d. which I owed him. I had then two sovereigns and 14 s. in my pocket. I told Mott I did not wish her to go with me; we then went to <placeName id="t18250113-23-crimeloc114">Strutton-ground</placeName>

Three or four other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130011"/>young women came in soon after she had fetched the beer; they pushed me down on the bed and cut my pocket off.

            . I am an officer. I was applied to by Powell, about five o'clock - he said he had been robbed in Duck-lane by some of the women, and he would take me to the house; we went, but there were no women there. He then took me to another house, where he said he had been, but we found no person there. He described the women, and I took them up in consequence of his description. He appeared as if he had been in liquor but had recovered. I took Wardle on the following morning, about half-past four o'clock, in the same house, in the next room. As soon as the prosecutor saw her he said she was one of them; there was another woman in bed with her but he did not accuse her. I asked him if Wardle was the woman who took the money; he said No, she held him down - his hand had a scratch.</p>

            . I am the brother of the person who keeps the Pheasant. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner come in on the morning in question; they called for a quartern of gin, and a pint of beer; they were there some time. The prosecutor put me down a 1 l. Birmingham note; I did not like to take it, but I kept it on the shelf till my brother came down; I believe my brother returned it to the man. I did not see any thing pass between the prosecutor and the prisoner, nor hear that the prosecutor was robbed till Weldhen came. I had heard the prosecutor cry murder, but he was so intoxicated he could not tell me for what; when he cried murder I went and asked what was the matter - he still kept hallooing out murder; I never heard that he had been robbed; the woman and him were quarreling, and he kept crying murder; I asked him what was the matter, but he could not tell me. I did not know that the prisoner was absent from our house one moment; she was taken from our house by the officer. I did not see her searched. When my brother came down he told me to go out of the shop - I did not see what took place afterwards. I had asked the prosecutor what was the matter, but he gave me no answer. The prisoner was in the room, but was not taking hold of him at all.</p>

            . I was sent for to take the prisoner. The prosecutor did not appear to be intoxicated; he had got hold of the prisoner, and was covered with blood. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"You have been doing something wrong" - she said,</p>
               <p>"This old man says I have robbed him, but you know I would not." I took her into the Pheasant, and searched her; I saw her take her hand from her pocket, and put two notes into her mouth, which we took from her. I thought she had swallowed something else, and I took her to the doctor's shop, intending to give her an emetic.</p>
               <p>(Notes produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday morning I met the prosecutor at the corner of Hatton-garden - he asked me where there was a public-house, for he had left a sovereign, and could not find the house again - I told him there was no house open, but the watering house at the corner of Bartlett's-buildings, where he took me, and we had several glasses of rum - he then requested me to remain with him till day light, and he would pay me for my trouble, as he wanted to wash himself, for he was covered with blood; some one had cut his eye, and very much ill-used him. We went to several public-houses, till at last we came to the Pheasant, when he offered a country note, but the publican did not like to change it - therefore he left it, giving me two more to hold till we went to the coach office to get them changed. Before we left the Pheasant he forgot what he had done with his notes - when I told him I had got two, and the publican one, he insisted on having his notes, and called out murder, and said he would have it back from the publican, but I told him it was impossible till we had been to the coach office. By this time there was a number of people collected together, and I lost him. When I found so many people round me, and not having any pocket on, I put the two notes into my mouth for safety, as I found myself the worse for liquor. The man who took me brought me to the prosecutor, who then swore I had robbed him, but he was so much intoxicated he had entirely forgot giving me the notes to hold.</p>

                   the younger, a sovereign, and a promissory note for payment of and value 10 l.
            </rs>, his property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FITCH. Last Friday week I received from my father a 10 l. note and a sovereign, and came to town; I got on the coach a mile on this side of Romford - the prisoner was on the coach, and I sat against him, behind: we talked as we came along. He said he was going to get off at Stratford, and wanted me to get off, which I did not - as we got on this side Mile End turnpike he got off, and said he meant to stop at the Two Bells, public-house; I got off there, and we had some mutton chops, some bread, and a pint of porter. He then asked me where I was going; I said to White's-place, Pimlico - he said he had a brother who lived near there, and he would go with me: we did so - he then said he was going to Doctors' Commons. We then went to Oxford-street, and into a gin-shop, and had a glass of gin. I had paid for the bread and beer at the Two Bells, and he for the chops. In Oxford-street he went into a baker's shop, and called me in; he asked me what money I had got; I told him, and showed the money, and the baker's wife asked me to leave it there - I said no I would not. I took the money in my hand, and when we got into the street again he asked me if I had got my money all right; I said Yes, and then I felt for it, and it was gone. We then went to North Audley-street, and he got me a lodging. When I told him my money was lost, he said some girl had taken it; I had no girl with me, but he had - the girl he had with him snatched a cane out of my hand which I had, but I had the money in my pocket after the girl was gone; he did not sleep in North Audley-street - I do not know where he slept; he ordered a night's lodging for me, and a pint of beer, which he paid for - he came there the next morning, and said he had been with a girl all night, and he had lost his watch; he then had his breakfast, and was looking at the paper, and said he saw a place, which I went after, he appointed me to meet him at twelve o'clock, at the same place, which I did - he then had a girl with him, and was half tipsy. He was taken into custody that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130018"/>you come from? A. I came from Ingatestone, to get a place. I have told all the story which I told to the Magistrate. The prisoner borrowed 5 s. of me, and I had his watch to keep. I never was in London before, further than Whitechapel. I did not go into either of the parks; I was not in any house with a young lady, nor walking in the park with any. I was in a house where there were some young ladies. The prisoner asked me if I had lost anything after we came out of the baker's-shop - the girl had joined us in Holborn - the baker's-shop is in Oxford-street. I never said the girl had robbed me, and if I could catch her I would cut her throat. About four or five minutes after we came out of the baker's I put my hand into my breeches pocket, and missed my money, but I did not use that expression. I do not know the number of the note; I only know the red mark of</p>
               <p>"16" on it; I am sure there is no other red mark on it: here is</p>
               <p>"81" in a red mark on it, but that was put on when I was at the Police Office. I considered some time before I gave an answer, but I did not say I was not quite sure about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you return the watch to the prisoner? A. Yes, on the same evening, in Oxford-street, because he said his brother would want to know where it was. I had only one sovereign with me; I did not tell the Magistrate I had five - my evidence was read over to me, which I signed. I had some other sovereigns, which I paid at Brentwood, before I saw him - I had but one when he came on the coach. I was not with any girls till I got to town; he took me to some house - that is where he borrowed the 5 s.: we did not stop there more than a quarter of an hour. He went out of the room with a girl, and left me there with several other girls; I sat still, and had no particular conversation with any of them. I know I had the money when we went to the baker's-shop, because I showed it there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in Tothill-fields prison; he stated that he had left his place two or three weeks before, and said he had 5 l. or 6 l.; I asked him if that was all, and said he had left a 5 l. note at a public-house, at the corner of East-street and Paddiagton-street - he said No; I said he had, and I should bring the parties forward to prove that he had left it there. I then asked him to recollect himself, and he said if he had he had worked hard for it, and it was his own. He then said he had got it in Scotland, but could not tell the name of the place, and had had it eight or nine months.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I was with Dew on the 29th of December, at Walton's, the White Horse stables, King-street; the prisoner was called to me - I searched his lodgings, and finding no clothes there, I asked where he kept them; he said in the stable - I went to the stable, and in his box I found twenty shillings and four half-crowns; he said he had received 16 s. 6 d. from Dawson, on the Saturday night - I went over to the counting-house, and found the desk had been broken open; it had the impression of a shoe tip on it - I took off the prisoner's shoe, and the heel matched the mark exactly; it appeared to have been knocked in with his feet; I then searched the stable, and found the bags of money as Dawson has stated; Dawson gave me a pair of scissars, which I compared with the door-post, there was an impression which tallied with them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DAWSON. There were some half-crowns among the silver; I know the bags and money; here is a memorandum of the money in one bag, in my own writing - I have known the prisoner seven or eight months; he was as good a servant as I ever knew, and never drunk.</p>

               <p>"I have thrown a box in which is very heavy - I will give you a pint to give me a lift." I returned and told Crockett, and in half an hour I was fetched to Guildhall. I am certain he is the man.</p>

They were afterwards going away, and Savage said her skirt was loose; this made me suspect they had taken something. I went round the counter, and took from her person a piece of Norwich crape - I then looked on the counter, and found it had been taken from there - it was worth 11 s. I had seen the prisoners in the shop twice the day before, and another person with them. Mary Davis had been about five minutes making her purchase.

On Friday, the 3d of December, between four and five o'clock in the evening, (there was another person in the shop as well as myself,) the prisoner came in about a saw which he had pawed the night before; he came up to the counter where the articles were lying; there was no other customer in the shop but him. I had occasion to go out for a few minutes, and left him there. When I returned the prisoner was gone, and the goods likewise; I had been out about five minutes - I have seen the goods at Worship-street; the prisoner was then in custody; I know them to be our goods; the value of the whole might be about 1 l. I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>

On Friday, the 12th of November, at a quarter before four o'clock, the prisoner came and knocked at my door; I looked out at the window, and he asked for Mrs Carley - I said I was the person. He asked me if I had not a son abroad; I said Yes, I had, at St. Helena; he said, should I like to hear from him? I asked him to walk in, and he went into the back-parlour, and said, should I like to see my son? I said, undoubtedly, nothing would give me greater pleasure; my son had been absent twenty-two years. He asked if I should know my son - I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did think I should, indeed; I said I know I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130023"/>should; he told me to consider twenty-two years made a great alteration in a man's appearance. I said it was true, but I was sure I should know him; he asked what made me so positive? I told him, from a mark I gave him before he came into the world. He then told me that the yellow fever removed the marks on the body, and asked me where the mark was? I told him in a very curious place; he then with his right hand pointed to his cheek, and said</p>
               <p>"It was here." My son had been marked there with an apple - I had not told him where the mark was. He then said</p>
               <p>"Are you positive you should know your son?" I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite positive; but I fear that is a happiness I shall never have more in this world." He then said,</p>
               <p>"You say you are positive you should know your son, but I see if you do know me you won't know me; I may as well go." He took his cane up to go - I then said,</p>
               <p>"you are not my son." He said</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear mother, I am your son; why will you not know me?" I then asked him if he was come to stay in England? He said he was come to consult with me respecting his discharge, which he had to buy from the East India Company's Artillery (which my son was in). I said,</p>
               <p>"What will your discharge cost you, child?" He said 22 l. and if I could let him have the money till Monday, he would repay it, as he had 583 l. to take. I told him I had not so much money as 22 l. in the house. I asked him to take some refreshment; I then believed that he was my son. I sent my lodger to get some brandy, and he had some cold beef; he then spoke of occurrences which had taken place in my family - such as my having two children christened together at St. Mary-le-bone church; which induced me to believe that he was my son. I then asked him to go up stairs - I opened a drawer, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here my dear son, is the funeral bill of your late brother;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! poor Joe, I wish I could have seen you once more before you died." I then showed him a pair of spoons I had bought with some of his late brother's clothes which I had parted with - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother, I have promised to make these spoons a present to our captain's lady, who has been such a kind friend to me." He did not take them, because I objected to it; there was a silver pencil case in the same drawer; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother, let me have that - it is just what I wanted;" I told him he might take it if he pleased, as I bought it on purpose for him: he took it. I then opened the drawer where my money was, and took out a small tin box, which had the money in it; there were seventeen sovereigns in it: I counted them, and said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, I have got but 17 l.;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Is there no more mother?" I said, No. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me count them:" I had them in my left hand, and he took them out of it, protended to count them, and put them in his pocket. I then showed him some handkerchiefs which had belonged to my departed son, which I had saved for him, as I supposed - he said,</p>
               <p>"Give me one of those silk handkerchiefs:" I said,</p>
               <p>"Take both child if you want them:" he took one of them which was orange and blue. He then came down stairs, and then was in a great hurry to go, as he said if he did not see his captain that night, he should not be able to get his discharge for nine days; he said he would return that night to sleep, if possible, at my house. I then asked him whether he would sleep in my bed or in the parlour: he said he would sleep in the parlour, because he had come from a hot climate, but if he did not return that night by ten o'clock, he would be with me at ten the next morning, to breakfast: he then said,</p>
               <p>"Don't detain me, my dear mother, let me go, for the sooner I go, the sooner I shall be back;" he then shook hands with me at the door, and told me not to fret, he would be back as soon as possible. He had taken the seventeen sovereigns out of my hand, and said he would return them on the Monday. I never saw him again till a fortnight ago, when he was at the Police Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This money you gave him, believing him to be your son? A. Yes, undoubtedly; I wished for it again, being my all. I told him to take the pencil case and handkerchief: I did not object to his taking the money out of the house, as I expected it would be returned when he took his money. I have never seen any of the things since.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Would you have lent the money to the prisoner if you had not believed he was your son? A. No. I expected he would return it, and he told me I should do no more work.</p>

               <p>MARTHA OAKHAM. I live in Yeoman's-row, Brompton. On the 14th of November, the prisoner came to my mother's house, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; we enquired who was there - a neighbour said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a person who wants to see you" - I got out of bed, and opened the door, and the prisoner came in, and said to my mother,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Oakham, have you not got a son in the army" - she said Yes: he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think you should know him" - she said,</p>
               <p>"He has been gone eleven years, and I don't think I should know him;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"What have you done with your milk-walk, and your cows?" - my mother replied," I never had any cows, I hired them, and my milk-walk I had failed with, before my son went away" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think you should know your son" - she said</p>
               <p>"No; I don't think I should" - he said,</p>
               <p>"If he was to come home from abroad, how is he to get back again?" my mother said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know, What would it cost?" he said 5 l. - my mother said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got 5 l., nor 5 s., nor anything for myself" - he replied,</p>
               <p>"Your son is now in England" - my mother said,</p>
               <p>"Pray do tell me where, Sir" - he said,</p>
               <p>"You can't get to him to night" - she said again,</p>
               <p>"Pray do tell me where my son is" - he said something about her not knowing her own flesh and blood; my mother said to me, as I sat in the bed,</p>
               <p>"Surely, Martha, this is not your brother" - I replied,</p>
               <p>"Mother, I can't see any likeness between him and me, or any of the family" - he said</p>
               <p>"Yes; I am your brother; and mother, it is strange you don't know your own son." (I don't know anything of Mrs. Carley) My mother then asked him to sit down, and asked him, if he would have anything to eat, such as she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130024"/>had got in the house - he sat down, and sent my mother for a pot of porter - while she was gone, he came to my bed-side, and my watch was lying on the chair - he took it up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whose watch is this?" - I replied,</p>
               <p>"It is mine" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you get it?" - I said,</p>
               <p>"I bought it, when I was in service" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I shall have this watch for one of my little boy's" - I replied,</p>
               <p>"No. Tom, I can't spare it" - he replied,</p>
               <p>"What, not give it to your brother, who has been gone so many years; for a keep-sake?" - I said,</p>
               <p>"No, Tom, I can't spare it" - he replied,</p>
               <p>"I will bring you a cuckoo clock for it" - I said,</p>
               <p>"No, Tom, the clock is of no use, if I go away to service, I can't carry the clock, the watch I can take any where" - he then took the ribbon and the seal off, and gave them to me, and said he should take the watch - I said,</p>
               <p>"Tom, I will not part with it." My mother then came, and gave him some refreshment - he stopped there all night, and went away between seven and eight o'clock, the next morning - after we had given him a breakfast, I said to him, while he was getting up,</p>
               <p>"Tom, give me my watch, and I will give you a gold pin for it" - he said a gold pin was not worth a d - n to a soldier; he then went away, and said he should come down to tea, at five o'clock, but never came to us again - he took the watch away with him - my brother belonged to the 83d Regiment of foot, which was gone to Ceylon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not all breakfast together, next morning? A. Yes; my brother and sister-in-law went with him to a public-house, and had something at his expense - I expected he would return with the watch; we had some gin and peppermint; my brother went with him, as far as Hyde-park-corner - I should not have let him taken the watch if I had not believed him to be my brother; he had a handsome watch of his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I at any time in the course of the night, or in the morning, tell you, I was not your brother?</p>
               <p>Witness. No, you did not.</p>

I would prosecute the prisoner - I did not say to Mrs. Hart, that unless she could get money, I would come forward, nor to Mrs. Kirby, nor to any other person; that I swear positively - I went with her mother to have a pint of porter, while we were waiting till the trial came on; her mother and sisters seemed to feel much for me, and said, they would make every effort to find where the things were pawned; I called on her mother the Monday after, but I did not tell her 8 l. must be raised, and if I could get that, I would take care the girl should not be convicted.</p>

He said 8 l., and he would move his lodgings, as he was a single man, and it was immaterial where he lodged. I told him we had considered, and did not intend to give any money. He rose up and said he would prosecute the girl, and take up two more. I cannot tell how he came to find my lodgings. I had seen him on the day the prisoner was committed, before she was committed, and told him I should wish to make it up if I could, rather than have her prosecuted. He said he was agreeable to make it up, but would not give me any satisfaction, till she was committed to Newgate, and I thought then I had no right to interfere; but I had made the proposal, in the first instance - I did not tell him where I lived.</p>

            . I am landlady of No. 1, Mary-place, Duke-street, St. Pancras. Martha Pound lives with me. I remember Hussey coming to Mrs. Pound, a fortnight ago - I did not hear what he said to her.</p>
               <p>- HART. I am the prisoner's sister. The first time I saw Hussey was at Marlborough-street; and after that he ran after me and my sister in Piccadilly; he said if we would meet him on Tuesday, 8 l. would make it up. We were then sitting on the Brentford coach - we had not proposed to make it up. He said he could vary his story more here than at Marlborough-street. When we were at Marlborough-street, we went to a public-house, and the officer wished us not to speak to Hussey; it was at the public-house that he said he could not swear to the robbery; and if we would give him some money he would make it up - that was after the second examination. The officer came there, and Hussey said the officer was afraid he should not get a higher situation, and therefore he would not leave him with us. I did not hear my mother make a proposal to him to make it up. I had heard my sister say she lived in Crown-street; I live at Kew - my husband is one of the King's gardeners.</p>

            . I live at Kew. My husband is a painter. I was on the Brentford coach when Hussey came up and said, if 8 l. were produced he would make it up; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130026"/>was after the prisoner was committed; I was at the police office with my mother and sister - Hussey then said he would make it up for money - that it was of no consequence to him; he was single, and it was no consequence to him where he worked - he could get a place in the country, and if I would make up 8 l. he would take it and say no more about it. He said,</p>
               <p>"When you come before the Grand Jury it is quite different to this place; I will vary it there." He said, over and over again, that he could not swear to the robbery - three times in two or three minutes - the first time we met at Marlborough-street - my mother made no offer to him till he proposed it to her - as far as I can recollect she was not the first person who proposed to make it up - I will not swear that she was not.</p>
               <p>HUSSEY re-examined. Q. Did you ever propose to either of these persons to make it up for 8 l.? A. No; I never said any thing of the kind.</p>

I saw the prisoner with two others, following two gentlemen (one of them was smaller than himself) - they were following Mr. Malloney, and trying his pocket; they went a little further, and tried again, and then went into the road - they went back into Dudley-court.

            . I am the wife of James Burke. I had a male child - it was born on the 8th of August - I went out a fortnight after being put to bed; I was going to the parish workhouse in St. Giles, for medical assistance - I sat down on a stone, near a coach-yard, in a court, leading to Broad-street; while I was sitting there the prisoner came to me, and asked me did I know Mrs. Harrage, a midwife, in Church-street; I said I did not; she then went a little way, returned, and said I looked very ill, and she would give me some porter - I told her I had not had my breakfast - she gave me 6 d.; I then went with her into a public-house in Broad-street - I do not know the sign; she called for a pint of porter, gave me a biscuit, and took the child out of my arms; its name is James. She asked me what my husband was - I said he was a poor dealer. She said if she knew where I lived she would call in the afternoon, and bring me some things for my child; I told her I lived at No. 16, Church-street; she then went away - I took the child, and we parted about half-past nine o'clock. She came to me in the afternoon, soon after one o'clock - my landlady and Ann Miers were in the room. She brought some flannel, and some wine to make pap for my child, and something to make a cap; she staid about an hour - I am sure she is the same person. She took my child again out of my arms, and said he was a sweet little child, and she knew a respectable lady who kept a society in her place, and she would take me to her, and she would give me some assistance to help me to keep my child - she said she would come again to me on the Friday - this was on the Wednesday. She came on Friday, late in the evening, after three o'clock - my landlady and Ann Miers were there at the time. I was not ready, and she ironed a pinafore for the child, and a cap for me; she dressed the child while I was cleaning myself to go out - then she rolled the new flannel about him to keep him warm; she told me she would carry the child herself, as I was weak. We went out - when we got to Broad-street she took me by the arm, and we came down to Little Queen-street, she carrying the child all the time. She then said she had to call in Lincoln's Inn-fields, where she should stay but a little time, and then we should be time enough for the lady - we went into Gate-street, to the Sun, public-house; she called for a pint of porter - she took a little of it, and I had some more; she said there was nothing sold there but liquor, and if we had a bit of bread and cheese it would help us on our journey - she gave me 2 d. for bread, 1 1/2 d. for cheese, and 1/2 d. for onions, which she sent me for. I left the child with her while I went, and when I came back she was gone; I was not a quarter of an hour gone. I enquired about her, but could not find her; I had not been in the house long with her - I made a complaint at Bow-street next day or the day after - the child has never been found since. I saw the prisoner again three days before Christmas. (I had used every possible exertion to find the child;) I met the prisoner then in Newgate-market; it was before ten o'clock; I believe she was alone, I had been selling some thread and tapes - she saw me, and went away very smartly; she was coming out of the market, and I followed her across Paternoster-row into St. Paul's Church-yard - I got up to her before she got to a shop; I asked her how she did - she said,</p>
               <p>"My good woman, I don't know you." - I said,</p>
               <p>"You do know me, you gave me 6 d. in St. Giles's." She said I mistook her, and turned into a butter shop close by. I looked out for an officer to take her up. She came out of the shop, and said,</p>
               <p>"My good woman, what are you waiting for?" I said I was waiting for some person. I turned my back, and she left the shop, and went on very quick to Paternoster-row - I had my little basket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130027"/>and could not run so fast as her - I called out,</p>
               <p>"Hold that woman!" The more I hallooed, the faster she ran. When she came to the end of Paternoster-row, she was going up again to Newgate-market; I kept her in view - she then got into a baker's shop, and went into his parlour - I had not told her what the charge was against her; I only said she had given me 6 d. - I caught hold of her mantle, and said she should not go till I had got an officer. A young man saw her running from me, and he ran after us to know what ailed us. She then said she lived at the Old Change, in Cheapside; we went to her house, and then got a man of the name of Jackson, an officer, to take her - two men there said I was an impostor, and wanted to extort money from her; she said the same, and then Jackson would not take charge of her. The men desired me to beg her pardon, and they would let me go; and, as Jackson would not take her, I came out, and said I would go to Bow-street for an officer - I ran very fast, Jackson followed me, and brought me back; and said, it would be a very fit thing to take me before a Magistrate. I was taken to Guildhall; I was put in the bar there, and the two men charged me with being an impostor, and wanting to extort money; and the Magistrate said I ought to be sent to Bridewell; then I went on my knees to the magistrate, and begged he would send to Bow-street, and he would find I was no impostor. The Magistrate then told Jackson to take me to the Compter, till the next day, at twelve o'clock. One of the men then said,</p>
               <p>"No; set her at liberty, if she will promise not to do so any more;" but the Magistrate sent me till next day - I was liberated on Christmas-eve, and the prisoner was taken last Saturday. It was my husband who went to Bow-street; and they said they had nothing to do with it, as it happened in the City. I went to Bow-street, and gave the testimony there; on my solemn oath she is the woman who took my child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you always said that she was the woman? A. Yes; I have always said that was the woman; but I should not know my child. The first house I went to was in Broad-street - I was there half an hour - I saw the woman of the house there; she had an opportunity of seeing me and the prisoner too; there were two men sitting in the tap-room, but I did not know them. I should know the house again, it was opposite the workhouse. On Friday, the 20th of August, the woman came to my house, about three o'clock - I cannot exactly tell how long she staid; she was ironing a pinafore and a cap for the child, and a cap for me; I believe it was about an hour - then we went to the public-house, in Gate-street; we did not stay there long - it must be more than four o'clock. I am sure that when I went to Bow-street I gave a particular description of the woman who had taken my child - I said she had a fair round face, and had the remains of a mark under her left eye; a person who looked in her face could see it at once. After the Alderman had heard the cause, at Guildhall, I went to her house, and took two witnesses with me; and she gave me a direction, and said if any person wanted her she might he seen at her master's house; and begged that any one who could recognise her might come to see her. My landlady said she was not the woman, at Mr. Evans's, and Mrs. Delany said she was not the woman - I fell down on my knees and begged her pardon, for fear she should lay hold of me.</p>

I only said so, because I wanted to have nothing to do with it - I said at Mr. Evans's that I knew the woman so well I should know her fifteen years to come.</p>

When he had done that he pursued the coach again; Smith followed: I stopped him, and asked where the box was; he denied all knowledge of it. The prisoner Hatt was driving the chaise. The box was locked at the time, but the key was with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where was you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130029"/>at the time? A. I and Smith were walking down Piccadilly; there was one person on the coach besides the coachman. I did not see the guard; it was the Hibernian Holyhead coach, coming to London; it was quite dark, and I was walking on the pavement; we stopped the gig about twenty yards from the coach; they were going the same way, and the gig followed the coach. We stopped it about three minutes after it was taken. Wilson took Titmus by the side of the coach, the second time he went to it; it was not a quarter of a mile from the White-horse cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What distance were you from the chaise? A. I was about twenty yards behind it. When I saw Titmus place the box in the chaise I did not see who was in the chaise; I came up to the chaise in two or three minutes, and saw Hatt in it. I know by their dress that Titmus was the man who took it from the coach; he stood on the spring, and removed it from the off side. I did not see any other person behind the coach.</p>

            . On the evening of the 3d of January, about half-past nine o'clock, I received information from Mobbs - I then saw the prisoner Titmus follow the coach, and get up, and ride about two hundred yards - he then got down, and I apprehended him. I found on him a white handkerchief, and a silver tooth-pick - he had a dark frock on. I asked what he had been doing; he said he had been doing nothing. Down-street is the next turning to Park-street.</p>

            . I am guard to this coach. I was sitting on the top, with my back stooping down, because it rained so fast: my back was towards the roof. I had put this box on the top of the coach myself, at Birmingham - it had a small piece of string round it, and a key; the strap was over it, but it might be taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How is it possible for a man to take a box off the coach without you seeing him? A. He could get up on the off side without my seeing him, as I was looking rather towards the near side - when he was on the spring he could get the box off without my seeing him. I was not asleep. I turned round about half way up the hill, and missed the box. I joined the coach at Shrewsbury, and put this box on the coach myself.</p>

            . I was with Mobbs on the 3d of January. I did not see the box taken from the coach, but saw the man with the box on his arm; he took it to a one-horse chaise, and put it in. I had seen him twenty or thirty yards before he got to the chaise, very distinctly. I looked out for that man afterwards, and can swear to his person it was the prisoner Titmus - I had seen him for three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I was walking on the pavement - I did not see him get from the chaise, but saw him come from the coach with the box; I saw his features plainly: I was about fifteen yards from him. I have been a Bow-street patrol twelve months. I can swear to his person; I was not six yards from the gig when he put the box into it. His coat was a dark one, but I cannot tell whether it was blue or brown. Who else was in the gig I cannot say. I am quite certain Titmus was the man.</p>
               <p>TITMUS'S Defence. I had been looking for a situation, and was returning home to my family when the officer stopped me, for a crime which I am totally unconscious of.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave each of the prisoners a good character.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILSON re-examined. Q. Had Titmus an umbrella with him? A. No. I am quite sure he is the person who came down from the coach - I was not five yards from him. It was Lincoln and Mobbs who stopped the gig.</p>

            . I am a conductor of the patrol. On Monday evening, about half-past nine o'clock, I was going down Piccadilly, near Down-street, an officer came and told me something - we stopped a one-horse chaise, and found the prisoner in it; Mobbs, the officer, got in and searched the chaise, and found the saddle, bridle, and martingale. I found on the prisoner a key, which opened the boot door of Cranston's coach.</p>

            . On Christmas-eve, about nine o'clock, I went into the garden of Mr. William Harvey, where I live: I missed some bottles, which I had seen in the rack three quarters of an hour before. I called for a light, and Harvey came - we found no one in the garden, but traced some persons over the summer-house into a lane. As we were going round we met Lianam, coming from the rag-shop, near a place where four or five bottles were standing. Master then went to the rag-shop, but I did not go with him. I saw Lianam come out of the rag-shop, and asked him to go with me to master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUDSON. Q. How did I conduct myself on Christmas morning? A. Very well; you gave up what you had, and asked if there were any other articles lost - I said there was.</p>

I looked through the side-window, and saw him walk up to a row of shelves, behind the counter - I did not see him take any thing, but he came out soon after, with this piece of kerseymere before him - I took hold of him, and took him back to the shop.</p>

Brown was with his cart at my door about half-past eleven - I saw some person get on the shafts, take a box out of the cart, and give it to the prisoner, at the corner by my house. The prisoner walked about twenty yards down King-street - he then began to run - I took him and the box, and gave him to the officer at my house. He said he was going to Holborn, to the Bell and Crown.</p>

I took him into a house, and said it was of no use denying it, as the waistcoat was found; he said he should tell no more lies - that he did the robbery, and gave the waistcoat to his brother, to pawn for 6 s., and he had torn the duplicate up.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 5th of January, about six o'clock - I was at tea in the room adjoining the shop, and thought I heard a noise at the shop-door - I sent my daughter out, and went into the shop; I saw the window open, and shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130033"/>hanging out; it is a sash-window - I had left it quite shut down, but do not think that it was fastened - I found it had been lifted up, but not broken; some shoes were put under it to keep it up, or it would have come down again - it was quite dark - I missed about fifteen pairs of shoes, worth 3 l., and three pairs of boots, worth 12 s. - I ran out, and along Great College-street, towards Black Dog-alley, and saw three men running out of the alley, in a direction from my house - Hunt was one of them; I knocked him down, and secured him, but found nothing on him; a witness came to my assistance, as he endeavoured to get away; he said I had got hold of the wrong man; I was taking him to Queen-square, and met the officers, who took him - I sent the witness down the alley, and he brought me three shoes - twelve boots and shoes altogether were picked up, but not in pairs - they are worth 1 l.; I don't know that the parish has any other name, except St. John.</p>

Twenty minutes, or half-an-hour before; I am certain it was quite shut down - I have five children, they were all in the room with me; my wife was ill up stairs - I know Hunt by seeing him before - I cannot say whether Fielder was one of them.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. (This witness appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of an oath.) I live at No. 3, Oliver's-court. About six o'clock in the evening, that the prosecutor's shop was robbed; I was playing at hoop with Roger Ryan up and down Little College-street - I knew Hunt before, and one Dignum, and saw them both standing at the prosecutor's window; they both went over, and lifted up the window - Dignum took some shoes out from inside the window, and Hunt held an apron, which they were put into; there were three men's shoes - I saw them take a great many shoes, and an odd boot - I only saw one boot; they took them out as fast as they could, and put them into their aprons - Dignum threatened to throw a stone at me, but did not - they did not see us looking at them, as we went away; and when we came up the street again, they were still at the window, and Dignum offered to throw at us, and told us to go away, and we went; when they had put the shoes into the apron, they all ran down the street; there were three of them altogether; Fielder was the third man; he was standing at the corner of the street, about ten yards off, looking at them, and when he saw any one coming, he whistled; I did not know him before, but am sure of him; there was a lamp at the corner, so that I could see his face - Henson's eldest daughter came out; but I did not see him come out himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you call any body to look at them? A. No; there was only us, and my two little brothers - I knew they were stealing, but if I had gone to tell, they would have knocked me about - Dignum picked up a stone, and said,</p>
               <p>"Get away with you" - we went round the street, and met nobody; I was standing by Fielder - it was a dark night; I saw them cross over, and go to the window; I saw their faces - a woman came out of her house, and told us to go away, and Hunt said</p>
               <p>"Be off, be off" - Hunt stood by her door; it was rather a dark street; there was a lamp at the corner, some distance from the shop; there was no light in the shop; we went by them, and Dignum told us to be off - we were going in to tell, when Henson's daughter came; she came out and asked if I had seen the men, and asked, why I did not come in to tell, but Dignum had threatened to hit me.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. I was playing with Fitzgerald, and saw Dignum and Hunt at Henson's window - Hunt lifted up the window, and held it with one hand, and held his apron with the other - Dignum pulled the shoes out of the window, and put them into his apron; I only saw him take three men's shoes out; Fielder whistled, and they ran down Great College-street; Fielder had been standing at the corner, under the lamp; they all three ran away; Dignum had threatened to throw a stone at us, and told us to go away; I did not know them before, but I saw their faces, about six o'clock that evening, when they stood by a public-house, where there was a light - the public-house is only a few yards from the prosecutor's - I have no doubt of them being the same men.</p>

            . I was near Dean's-yard on this night, and the first thing which drew my attention was Henson holding Hunt down - he begged of me to assist him, which I did; he asked me to go down Black Dog-alley, to look for some shoes; I went, and found three men's shoes, which I gave to Henson; he gave them to a young man to take care of.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. Henson gave Hunt into my custody, about a quarter past six o'clock; I found nothing particular on him. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist - I have heard it so called. I took Fielder in about half an hour, and took him to Ryan and Fitzgerald, who identified him. Henson delivered me these shoes and boots; I have had them ever since.</p>

            . The shoes and boots are mine. The three shoes which Clewley picked up I gave to the officer. I had given them to a neighbour to mind while I went to the watch-house, but am certain they are the same - he returned them to me in a quarter of an hour; the others were picked up in the street, and brought to me by my neighbour while I was returning with the officers.

I found a handkerchief on her, which Powell claimed; and in one corner of it was 20 s. 6 d., and in a purse, the duplicates of two suits of clothes, pawned that day at Cross's, Turnmill-street. I found a pair of pinchers in her pocket, which seemed to fit the marks on the door. She seemed so confused I had a hard matter to get a sight of her face. I went to her room; she seemed in the greatest distress - there was only a handful of fire in the place, and the children round it appeared literally starving; there was not half a loaf in the place, and hardly a bed to lay on - I understand her husband is a drunken fellow.</p>

            . I am the wife of Daniel Etherington. On the 20th of December, we moved from Tyler-street, to a lodging, at Mr. Swale's, <placeName id="t18250113-95-crimeloc494">Marshall-street, Carnaby-market</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have two rooms? A. Yes; and was in one or other of them all the time, and the door between the two rooms open; the house is full of lodgers; another person has a third room on that floor; the money was put there about three o'clock, and he came about a quarter past; it had been brought from our other lodging, in a box - I have never said that I had not seen it under the carpet, or that I was sorry I had said so.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When had you last seen the money? A. Not since the 19th; but I saw the cotton it was wrapped in, under the carpet, when he was coming up stairs; he could have taken it without our observing him; both rag and money were gone.</p>
               <p>DANIEL ETHERINGTON. Our goods were moved to Marshall-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning. I took the money out of the box, but did not open the cotton - I put it on the mantel-shelf, and put it under the carpet, about three o'clock, and have no doubt of the money being in it; and in a quarter of an hour the prisoner came to put up a bed - I helped him, but left the room, about four times; he was nearly half an hour there; and when he left, at tea-time, we went to look for the money, and missed it; nobody but him and us had been in the room - there is no door to that room, on the landing-place.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you drink tea? A. About a quarter to four o'clock; we had not left the room at all - I went after him immediately, and found him at his master's shop, about a quarter of a mile off; no money was found upon him, or at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor bought a bedstead, at my master's - I carried it home, and fixed it up; there was no carpet in the room.</p>

I gave my husband his medicine, hurried down, and the prisoner was then gone; I had left her in the kitchen, and no one else there. I called her four or five times, but could get no answer. I had left her busy washing the tea things; she had left them unfinished, and had brought part of them into the bar, as an excuse. I found the whole of the money gone - it was all we had. We are young beginners, and had collected it to pay away; she had given us no warning. I did not see her again till the 10th of December; and have only recovered 5 s. 8 d.</p>

On the 6th of November, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130036"/>six and seven o'clock, I saw her coming out of the house; she met me on Keen's steps as I was going in with a bundle, to a lodger there; she had a black bonnet with light ribbons on; her apron was folded on her arm; it hit against me as I met her, and sounded like money in it. I went up to the lodger, came down, and Mrs. Keen had lost her money.</p>
               <p>JOHN KEEN. The prisoner came into our service on the 1st of November; I took to my bed on Wednesday, and on Saturday was informed of this robbery. I heard she was gone towards Leeds, and sent an officer after her - on the 6th of December I found her at Wiggan, in Lancashire - I got a constable; she was brought to me; I said,</p>
               <p>"What could you be about to behave as you have to me; what do you deserve?" she said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what - I deserve hanging;" she pulled off her rings, and said she had bought them with my money, and had spent the rest in clothes, and riding about - she had but 5 s. 8 d. left.</p>

            . I live at the Sun, public-house. The prosecutor came in about one o'clock, and had a pint of ale, then went out, returned about six, and Mary Browning made friends with him. His parcel fell down two or three times, and she would not let me take it to the bar for safety. The prisoner came in after that with her child - the prosecutor let the child play with his watch two or three times. The prisoner then went home with her child; I had to carry some beer that way, and walked with her. I left Browning there laying on the parcel; when I returned the prosecutor was quite tipsy - he could not stand, and missed his parcel. My master and mistress were gone to the play.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHAMBERLAIN. I was neither drunk nor sober - I had had rather too much beer. I did not leave Tottenham till after one o'clock. I met a patrol at the door of the public-home; he took me to Hill's house - we found her at the watch-house.</p>

On the 1st of January I went to my workshop, about half-past twelve o'clock, and found the place in confusion - sixteen hats, which had been safe the night before, were gone - I likewise lost a bag. In consequence of what I heard I went to White's house, and saw his mother, but he was not there. When his mother saw me on the Saturday she said he should tell me all about the robbery; I went again, and then saw the prisoner in the kitchen - he said, if I came with any pig man he would knock my head off, but as I came alone he would tell me. I had not said anything to induce him to tell me; I had given the mother 6 d. to get some gin, but she did not have it till it was all done. I asked him who the parties were, and he said if I wanted to know that, he would not tell me anything - he then said they were sold to Philips, in Windmill-street, and went with me; he did not tell me that he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The information was not true; you did not find any hats there? A. No; I had given a quartern and a half of gin, between me, his mother, and him.</p>

I went up the lane, and there laid hold of the prisoner, with this bag in front of him, and his coat over it - he got from me and ran away - I pursued him, and took him. I then took up the bag, and it had two turkies in it - I saw one turkey and two guinea fowls on the ground, as I was running along - they were dead, but quite warm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. He appeared to be a fisherman, did he not? A. Yes; I could not hold him because my hands were full - he got from me, and made himself foolish. I could not get a word from him - he ran about, half-double, and cried</p>

On Sunday, the 19th of December, I had been to chapel in the evening and returned to the poor house - the prisoner let me in, and we went together to the kitchen, and sat down a few minutes by the fire, and he went out of the kitchen. I went up to bed and perceived that he was not in his own bed - we had usually slept in the same room - I thought he might be gone some other way, and I went to bed, but did not go to sleep - I then got up and dressed myself, and I found he had quitted the house, and left the gates unlocked and the keys in them. I alarmed the mistress - he had taken his own clothes away.</p>

I saw the spoon about three minutes before it was stolen; about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. I heard a square of glass broken, and ran to the window - the spoon had laid near that window - I ran out and saw the prisoner; he asked me if I had any hare skins - I told him No, and he ran off immediately; I had some suspicion of him, and I counted over the spoons and missed one; I told my fellow servant of it, and the prisoner was brought back in about five minutes, with the spoon. I am certain it is my master's.</p>

            . I am a journeyman jeweller. I was passing along Upper Gower-street, and saw three men looking down the areas - the prisoner was one of them - an organ was playing in the street; I saw the prisoner pointing Mr. Phillips's house out to the others. I went about one hundred yards to the end of the street, and then returned; I knocked at Dr. Moore's door, which is opposite Mr. Phillips's, and asked the servant to let me go into the parlour, and she could witness what I should myself. I took off my great cost and put down my umbrella. I saw the prisoner go down the area, and another waited to receive what he brought up. I had the door left ajar - I heard the glass broken - then went to the door, and saw the prisoner running - I secured one of his companions, and gave him to another person; I then pursued the prisoner, and caught him before I lost sight of him. When I came up to him he gave the spoon a squeeze, and threw it over a wall on the top of some stables; I held him and he insisted on knowing who I was - as I was not an officer he would try who was the best man. I held him till a gardener brought the spoon to me. I tied a handkerchief round the prisoner's hands, and took him back, and gave him to an officer - the person I had given the other to let him go again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me throw the spoon away? A. Yes; you had a white hat on and a blue apron round your waist, which you let down as you came up.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent on an errand to Somers Town. I staid to hear the organ a little; I was then going on, and turned down a street, which I thought was a thoroughfare; the witness came up and said</p>
               <p>"You d - d rascal, you are the cause of many servants losing their places;" I said</p>
               <p>"If you are not an officer what right have you to stop me?"</p>

I took hold of Wortley, and asked what he had got there?

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you had any conversation with a gentleman on the subject of this charge? A. Yes; Mr. Manning - he asked whether I thought this was laid out in dress for the poor girl? I told him that she had not a shift to her back that was not full of holes, and therefore it could not be laid out in dress. I never told him I had questioned my wife about it; and was surprised to find that she had sent her to pawn eleven table-spoons, nor any part of the property - I never said any thing of that kind. I did not live on good terms with my wife through my servants. I owed her a quarter' wages on the 14th of November. She was apprehended on the 1st or 2d of December - she had applied for her wages, and I told her on account of my things being gone I would not pay her till I had made inquiry. She still remained in my service.</p>

               <p>MARY M'CLELLAN re-examined. She confessed her crime after I had told her I was conscious of her having stolen articles. I had sent for an officer - she expressed great surprise at that; I had before that looked into her boxes - three of them were open, and the other was locked: I took her keys, which laid in the kitchen, and opened her box. I found a pocket with a pair of silk gloves, which I had missed for some time; I looked further, and found a silk pocket book, in which was a number of duplicates. I replaced the book in the pocket, and sent for an officer. I called her into the kitchen, and in the presence of the officer told her she knew I was in the habit of missing various articles, and while I had other persons about me I had not suspected her, but now I had no one to accuse but her. The officer then told me to search her boxes, which I did - but the duplicates had been removed. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the brown silk needle book?" she persisted that she had no such thing - I said I knew it was there, for I had had it in my own hand; she still persisted in not having such a thing; I then said,</p>
               <p>"It will be unavailable for you to conceal it, you and I shall appear in another place, and you will there be compelled to produce it." The officer then left the room, and she burst out crying, and asked if I would forgive her - I said,</p>
               <p>"I will make no promise - the law must take it's course; I fear you are a wicked girl;" she then, after some time, confessed that she had thrown the duplicates into the copper-hole in the back wash-house: I called the officer, and told him the duplicates were found. I went with the officer to the pawnbrokers, and saw the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came you to take the girl into your service? A. From a knowledge of herself and her family; I have known them four or five years: her sister had lived as servant with me. Her father lives about half a mile from my house. She had eleven guineas a year, but had had no wages; there was not any due.</p>

I looked out at the door, and saw the prisoner going down the alley; I pursued, and stopped him with it - I brought him back, and he asked me to have mercy upon him, as he had not had anything to eat for a day or two.</p>

There were a great many pieces of muslin in the same wrapper. In about two hours Spooner brought the prisoner back, with part of two pieces of muslin, about ten yards and a half; I looked into the wrapper, and missed the two pieces. I am certain I did not see her take them. My master and a lad were serving in the shop at the time - I do not think either of them saw the prisoner take it; it is worth about 15 s.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TOMKINS. I live in Camden-town. On Monday the 6th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the New-road - I knew him before. We went to the Buffalo public-house, near Mary-le-bone church - we had a pint of beer, and a quartern of gin; I paid for that with halfpence, which I had loose in my waistcoat pocket. We then had some more at the Portland Arms public-house, which I paid for in silver. He said at the Buffalo, that he had only 6 d. in his pocket. I had changed a sovereign, and had a crown, four half-crowns, and some silver. I put it in my right hand breeches pocket in his presence; there were several other persons at the Portland Arms. I did not know them - we were all talking together, and they drank with us - they sat in the box facing - I laid my head on the table and went to sleep; when I awoke they were pulling me about - I cannot exactly say who was pulling me about - they had got some vinegar, which they wanted to give me, but I would not have it. The prisoner was in the same box when I awoke, but I do not know whether he shook me. I put my hand into my pocket and found I had only the empty purse. I said,</p>
               <p>"I see I have lost my money." He said,</p>
               <p>"It cannot be here." I said I had it when I came into the house, and some one of the company I thought must have it. He said he had not got it, nor had he seen any one by me to take it. Nicholls the pot-boy was there, and he told me something. I went for a constable - and told the constable I had lost my money, and what the person in company had told me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not he and you been very good friends before that? A. Yes; we had drank together very often, and sometimes got tipsy. We met about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and it was about ten when I awoke - the people were treating me as if I was drunk. I found the empty purse in my pocket. I said</p>
               <p>"Jem, I have lost my money." He said</p>
               <p>"No one here has taken it." He said afterwards</p>
               <p>"Well, I have taken your money; and if you like to take me up, do - here it is." He was pretty well tipsy as well as me. He said</p>
               <p>"If you wish to take me up about this joke, do." When we went before the Magistrate we were so tipsy the Magistrate would not hear the charge, till we got sober. After the money had been produced we were sitting down, pretty good friends, and if it had not been for the constable I do not know that I should have had him taken.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Portland Arms. I remember the prisoner and prosecutor being there. The prosecutor was asleep, and I saw the prisoner take some money out of his breeches pocket - he rolled up the purse and put it into the pocket again. The prosecutor awoke in about a quarter of an hour, and said he missed his money, and one of these three men must have it. The prisoner was awake then, but did not say any thing about it. I told Tomkins what I had seen, and he went for a constable - that was about half an hour after he awoke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they both very tipsy? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner take the money, but I did not say any thing about it, because it appeared to me that he was taking care of it till the other got sober. I saw the prosecutor lying on the table, and they got some vinegar to awaken him up to do his master's business. There had been a good deal of talk about the money. I did not hear the prisoner say</p>
               <p>"If you are going to be serious about this money, take me at once before a Magitrate." He seemed as if he wanted to give the man his money again - he did not seem pleased about being taken.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. I told Tomkins that Cole had taken the money, and he went for a constable - I spoke it quite loud, and Cole might have heard it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the Portland Arms on the 6th of December and saw the prisoner there - he was charged by the prosecutor with having robbed him. I beckoned Cole out - I told him what charge I had against him; and he said he had a crown piece, four half-crowns, and four shillings - that he had received 25 s. for work, at several places. He did not say that he had taken the money from Tomkins. I took him to the Magistrate, and he postponed the hearing till next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said it was the prosecutor's money at the time he took me. I thought I had more money about me when I was taken, which made me say I had 25 s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOMKINS. Q. Did the prisoner say at the Buffalo that he had only 6 d. in his pocket? A. Yes; at the Portland Arms, I paid 1 s.</p>

               <p>ROBERT LOCKE. About half-past 7 o'clock on the morning of Christmas eve, I saw the prisoner with something before him.

On the 4th of September he came, and said he wanted a carriage for a fortnight - he looked out one; I said it would be 2 l. per week; he hired it for two weeks certain, and was then to bring it back again; he told me his name was Lawrence Campbell; that he lived at Croydon, and was the son of General Campbell. I asked him if he could refer me to any one for a character - he said he used to live at Mrs. White's Margaret-street - I went there and asked if he had lived there - she said he did and paid his lodging; he came into the house in the mean time, and I asked him what he was going to do with the carriage; he said to go into the county of Kent, and to treat some ladies - I asked him if he had the means - he said he had 700 l. per year. I cautioned him not to make too free. He had the carriage out on Sunday, the 5th of September - it went away with post horses; at the end of a fortnight the carriage did not come back - I gave him another week, and then made what inquiries I could. I went to Brighton but could not hear any thing of him. I found the carriage in the fourth week at Mr. Dixon's, in Barbican - I asked for it and Mr. Dixon would not give it up; the Lord Mayor gave me a warrant and I got it back. I never saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130047"/>again till he was brought before the Lord Mayor - it is worth 120 l. or 120 guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had it four wheels on when it went out? A. Yes. I have heard that the prisoner is the son of General Campbell, and I have no doubt of it. The bargain was that he might have the carriage for two weeks certain, but not beyond that. He did not say that for every week he kept it afterwards, the money was to be sent to me. He never asked me about his keeping it longer.</p>

Mr. Messer came and claimed it afterwards - it was backed for sale at 100 l.; the prisoner gave me a receipt for the money, in the name of Lawrence Campbell. I asked who it belonged to, and he gave me a note, which purports that it belonged to Mr. Joseph Page, of Eltham. We did not make any further enquiries of any one.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired this carriage of the prosecutor for a fortnight, and if I kept it longer I was to remit the money for it, (2 l. a week.) I hired it for a person of the name of Page, at Eltham; when I got down he was not there; I came to town and then saw him, and he said he did not want the carriage, I must go and get him some money upon it. I then spoke to a friend, who took me to Mr. Sadler's, and they would not take it - I then went to Mr. Dixon's - they told me to come again in about an hour - I called again and then the clerk said he could not advance the money till he had seen Mr. Dixon - I went again. and then they wished to know whose carriage it was - I shewed the note, and they agreed to allow 34 l. for six weeks, and if not redeemed then, it was to be sold.</p>

On Tuesday, the 21st December, about half-past five o'clock, in the evening, I found the trunk wrenched open, and the money gone - I had put my clothes away, on the Sunday; the purse and silver were then safe, but I had not seen the sovereigns since the Sunday week - I informed my master of my loss, about half-past 8 o'clock that night, when he came in; the prisoner was down stairs, when I missed the money, and I told him of it; he finished his work, and went to bed - my master searched all the men down stairs, but found nothing; the prisoner was then in bed, and the purse, with 12 s. 6 d. in it, was found in his breeches-pocket, which were under his head; the trunk had not been broken open on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES TYLLIER. I am in partnership with Richard Blunt Tyllier; we both reside in the same house. I heard of this robbery on the Tuesday night, and found the purse in the prisoner's pocket, with three half-crowns, and five shillings in it; he said voluntarily that it was Wilder's purse, and he had taken it out of the trunk; that he only had 12 s. 6 d., and knew nothing of the sovereigns - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WILDER. This is my purse; only eight sovereigns were taken - I had not seen them for nine days before; they were in one corner of my trunk.</p>

            . On the 2d of January I was in Mr. Slater's service, and was left at home; about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, the bell rang; it was then quite dark, and I was alone in the house - I went into the area, and saw the two prisoners standing at the door; they asked if Mr. Slater was at home - I told them, No; they said they wanted to see him, that they had come from Brighton, and asked if they could wait till he came in - I went up and opened the door - Stevens walked into the passage, and said he must write a note, or wait till Mr. Slater came in - he asked me for a pen and ink - I said it was locked up in the counting-house; he asked Wilson for a pencil, which he gave him - he then asked me for a bit of paper - I said I had none; the prisoners then both walked down into the kitchen - I had two lighted candles there - Stevens pulled off his hat, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to tell you, but we are come to rob the house" - be then took his hat, and a candle off the dresser, and went up stairs - I saw no more of him - Wilson remained down stairs with me, and told me to sit down, and make my life happy; and said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't make any alarm, we shan't hurt you, we don't intend to do it; but if you make any alarm, we have things about us that will do it, and we shall do it" - he then laid a pistol on the table - I sat in a chair, and remained quiet; he sat on a chair on the opposite side of the table; he asked me where Mr. Slater kept his money - I said I believed he carried it about with him; he said they only wanted the money, and asked if the doors up stairs were locked - I said Yes; he said I had better give him the keys - I said I had not got them; and he said he supposed they were in the door then - we sat talking, and about eight o'clock I heard the bell ring; he asked me what bell it was - I told him it was my bell - he then took the pistol off the table, and went out of the kitchen with it - I saw no more of him; the bell only rang once - Stevens was up stairs all this time, and had a candle with him, and I heard the doors being broken open - I went up stairs, when my master came in, and found the counting-house door broken open - the counting-house is at the bottom of the shop, and is part of the dwelling-house - the counting-house door was locked, when they came in - I had never seen the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw Stevens for a very little time? A. Yes; I had a light in my hand in the passage - I am sure he is the man - I have not mistaken one person for another; if I had seen him six months after in a crowd, I could have picked him out; he took his hat off in the kitchen, but took it up stairs with him - I am sure I am not mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How soon afterwards did you see him? A. On Monday morning - I was always sure of his person.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I came home with him - I rang the bell, as Mr. Slater was rather behind, paying a coachman - I rang the bell, and waited nearly three minutes, and then the prisoner Stevens opened the door, I saw his face, and am certain of his person - I asked what business he had there; he and another man directly ran out of the house, without answering me - I then saw my husband about two doors off; the two men ran towards him, and then attempted to cross the road, seeing him coming - I called Stop thief! and he pursued one of them; I was too much frightened to know what happened afterwards - I searched for my children, who were out with us; my husband entered the house before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the door opened, was there any light in the passage? A. None; but there is a strong gas-light opposite our door, on the same side of the way, and it reflected strongly in Stevens' face - I am quite sure of him - I did not see the other's face.</p>
               <p>MR. SLATER re-examined. Upon coming home, I saw the two prisoners run out of the house; the pathway is much higher than the road, you must either jump off, or go a good way down to get to the road - I saw them come out of the house - Mrs. Slater called Stop thief! and they ran towards me, and crossed from the pavement, into the road; I followed them - Wilson turned short to the left, Stevens took to the right, towards town, and I followed him, he crossed the road, and I struck at him, but missed him, and struck against a post, but still had him in sight; he ran in the direction of Knightsbridge-green, ran towards a saw-pit, and threw himself down by the side of some logs of timber - I hesitated for a second, then got over the timber, and collared him; he lay flat on the ground, behind the timber - I brought him back to my house; and found Wilson in custody - I said they had got the right man - I found that the wainscot, between the passage and shop had been broken down; two or three persons, who were with me, began to search the prisoners, and while so doing, the prisoners' backs were towards a table; they were both shuffling their hands behind their coats, and on the table was found a pistol, and screw-driver - I then said</p>
               <p>"It has been desperate - I will look at the counting-house, and see if that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130049"/>is all right" - I found the counting-house door broken open - I had locked it the morning before, and had the key in my pocket; the counting-house is at the end of the shop; and communicates with it internally; the first thing I observed was my tin cash-box, turned upside down on the table - I had left it locked up in a drawer, under the desk, which drawer had been wrenched open by some instrument, and the desk had been broken open; violence had been used to the cash-box, but they had not succeeded in getting it open; it was about three feet from the drawer, in which I had left: it contained a 20 l., seven 10 l., and three 5 l. Bank-notes, twenty-five sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a guinea, a gold ring, three half-crowns, five shillings, and ten sixpences - I missed a silver watch, which I had seen on the counting-house mantel-shelf that morning - I have not found it; on my return from the counting-house other things had been found on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure that the cash-box had been left in the drawer? A. Quite so; I did not loose sight of Stevens at all, there was nobody else on that side of the way, till I had taken him; four persons came up afterwards - I am positive of both of the prisoners; there is no door leading from the counting-house to the street, you must go through the shop to it - there are marks of violence on the box; an experienced thief might have taken box and all.</p>

               <p>"Stop those two men; they have robbed the house" - they ran into the road - Wilson separated from Stevens, turned short to the left, and came back under a shallow wall; he came opposite to where I was standing on the pavement - I then walked towards him; he crossed the road, I followed, and took him by the collar - I took him back into Mr. Slater's warehouse - Mr. Slater had then returned with Stevens - they were searched; a pistol and screw-driver were found on the table, behind then - I am sure Wilson is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive them from the prisoner? A. No; from his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that he came himself to your house, and you had him taken? A. No; he sent for a person out of my house - he was apprehended three hundred yards off. I am told that my daughter is since married.</p>

               <p>London, Nov. 8th, 1825.</p>
               <p>MR. JACKSON,</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir - Though I do not think myself worthy to address you now, I think it my duty to return my sincere thanks for your kindness, expressed for me and my safety. Believe me, Sir, it will ever he remembered with kindness. There may come a time when I may have an opportunity of returning it; but, oh! when I think upon what I have done, it chills my very soul. What could I think of - but it is past - God have mercy on me. Once I was respected by every one who knew me - beloved by all my relations, what am I now? - hated, cursed, and shunned. But there is another world and a better one, where I hope you and I shall meet again, if we can meet no more in this. May heaven protect you through this world; may you be prosperous and happy, and may you and your intended spend many a happy year in comfort. For Mr. and Mrs. Leah's kindness to me, I hope, if I have not an opportunity of rewarding them, heaven will. It is impossible for me to express my feelings whilst writing this letter. Ah, it is past. Once I thought I should have been happy. If the news has not reached Gainsborough all may be well-if it has, then all is over. I do not mind about Mansfield - I could not be in my senses. Pray give me love to Matilda - and give my thankful remembrance to Mr. and Mrs. Leah; also to Maria. I must now conclude - and, if it is for ever,</p>
               <p>Farewell, dear friend, unfortunate</p>
               <p>LAUGHTON.</p>
               <p>"N. B. My cousin, B. Robinson, I understand, has said a deal about me, without occasion; he is a bad character amongst the worst of women, I can safely swear, though he took them to a house where he said I frequently went to, it is false - I have known none but Matilda since we made it up. - ADIEU."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a malicious prosecution, carried on by my father-in-law. My wife has not only committed bigamy, but has been guilty of very bad conduct - a gentleman offered me a situation, and this is the reason the charge was brought against me.</p>
               <p>Nine witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHEELER re-examined. The watch he pawned with me I lent two guineas on - it is capped and jewelled - it would sell for six or seven pounds. Every watch here is worth more than 40 s.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Written). I came at about half-past seven o'clock quietly by Britannia-walk, when one of the witnesses seized me - he came one way and I the other. An accident had occurred which I feel convinced, must be the cause of my being committed for trial: I happened to have a stick in my hand, which I made two notches in, just as I heard some one call out Stop Thief! this caused me to cut my hand slightly - I threw the stick away, and as the witness came up, stood still, to make way for him; for a few moments before, just as I first heard the cry of Stop Thief! a young man came running at a great pace, and the witness almost immediately after him. The witness stopped short, challenged me, and said I was the person he had pursued. I informed him that I knew nothing of what he was speaking, and probably no notice would have been taken of me, only for the unfortunate and very suspicious circumstance that some little blood was seen on my hand, from the cut of the knife, and, as I was afterwards told, some blood was found on the piece of linen picked up in the street. I told the witness that would they only go a few paces back, they would find the notched stick, but this they refused. My prosecutor stated, at the office, that he would swear to my face, because about ten minutes before the robbery had been committed, he heard a sort of knocking at the window, like that of an umbrella coming against it, which induced him to move the things from the window, and he was thereby enabled to see my face clearly: after I was apprehended I was taken back to the shop - it was well lighted up, and the night was very dark, so it must have been difficult to have seen distinctly any one outside. My prosecutor seemed much offended with me, because he had, several nights before, lost a shawl from the window, and said that, no doubt, I was the rascal who stole it - he would, therefore, do all in his power to punish me. I am sure that the witness who first seized me, cannot, in justice say, that I am the person whom he saw running - I am certain that some other man came by me at full speed, just before he came up, and had he pursued a little further, he must have heard the man run; but as the piece of linen was found, as he said, about a dozen yards from where he took me, he said he was sure that I must be the thief. Could I have persuaded the parties to have gone a little further back, the stick must have been found; and would any one examine the cut in my hand, it would easily be seen that it is so very slight that it must have been done in the way I say, with a knife. The knife was blooded when taken from me, and I held it in my hand when the witness came up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HAZARD. He had no knife in his hand when I overtook him, nor did he desire me to look for a stick.</p>

             re-examined. About half an hour before the window was broken I heard a noise, and it being a wet evening, I thought somebody had knocked an umbrella against the window - I moved nearly all the things out of the window to shew a gentleman, so that it was clear of goods; the Irish laid by itself - it was the prisoner's left hand that was cut - the Irish is worth 36 s.</p>

Some hosiery and other goods were placed under my care about Michaelmas - I was answerable for them; I placed them in my bed-room, and kept the door locked: the key was in my pocket, except when my sister went to make the bed. I discharged the prisoner the latter end of November, without warning. While she was in my service I missed several dozens of stockings and handkerchiefs, some Irish linen and flannel. The door must have been opened by a false key to get at them. I generally looked the goods over every day, and at one time I missed a quantity of stockings. On the 28th of December the prisoner called at my house, and next morning twenty-four duplicates were delivered to me by my sister. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found my property.</p>

I asked if they were her own - she said Yes, she had just bought them; she gave her address at Green-bank, and said she lodged there. About a fortnight afterwards she brought another parcel of stockings to pawn, for 5 s.; I said she had a parcel of stockings already, and were they her own - she said they were: I refused to take them in. The counterpart of my duplicate is in the prosecutor's possession.</p>

On the 28th of December, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I came to the Dundee Arms, public-house, in a coach, with my trunk, containing the articles stated in the indictment - the trunk was set down by the bar; I missed it in ten or fifteen minutes - having been travelling two nights, I was tired, and had been taking some bread and cheese in the bar the while. I ran to the office, which is within one hundred yards of the house; the officer came with me, and on returning to the house in half an hour I found the prisoner in custody with it.</p>

On the 28th of December, at night, Mr. Hays came to my house, with his trunk, which was put in the passage, opposite to the bar, near the stairs. The prisoner had left my service three weeks or a month, she came to my house about ten minutes after Mr. Hays came in, while he was in the bar, and asked for a Christmas box; I told her I gave no money, but what she liked to eat and drink in the house she was welcome to; she said she wanted nothing, and I left her at the bar door; I do not know what had become of her. The box was missed in a quarter of an hour - she was then gone. I went to the office, and gave information, and met my warehouse-keeper as I returned, and in consequence of what he said, I looked after the prisoner, and found her in about twenty minutes at the lower part of Old Gravel-lane, about three hundred yards from my house, near Hillyer's-court - she was coming towards my house: I told her she had been robbing our house of a trunk - she said,</p>

               <p>"Good God! how could you suspect me?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I have more reasons than one for suspecting you - I have pretty good proof of it, and shall give you in charge;" the watchman was within hail. She said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't do that, nor make a noise in the street, and I will tell you about it:" she then led me towards Hillyer's-court, away from the watchman, and when we had got a little distance from the watchman she refused to tell me, saying she knew nothing of it: I said I would not be baffled in that way, and gave her in charge. The watchman was bringing her towards my house, and at the corner of Brewhouse-lane, within sight of my house, she called after me, and said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake take me away from this man - I want to speak to you." I asked the watchman to retire: we went up Brewhouse-lane together; she said she would shew me where the trunk was, but when we got nearly out of the watchman's sight she said she wondered how I could suspect her, what a bad thing it was for her, and she was an innocent woman. I brought her to the watchman, partly by force; they took her to my house, and then to the office. When she came to my bar the trunk was behind her, within two yards. I remained in the bar with Mr. Hays, and cannot say if any one else came in, or when she went out. I thought she was gone into the tap-room, which joins the bar; there might be twelve or fifteen people in the taproom: the trunk could not be seen from there. Hillyer's-court is three hundred yards from my house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my stand is near the Dundee Arms, about fifty yards from it. On the night of the 28th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw a young woman pass by on the opposite side, with a trunk, covered over - she turned up Brewer's-lane, which leads to Hillyer's-court; I thought it was a servant going to her place, and in about ten minutes I heard an alarm of a trunk having been stolen. I met Harding, the officer, and told him which way she was gone - he followed, and in about ten minutes returned with the box. I have been ten years on that beat, but did not know the prisoner. I believe her to be the person who had the trunk, for I saw her afterwards. I cannot swear to her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would he not account for it by an entry in your book? A. That is the way he should account for it; the books were in the counting-house then, but since the 18th I have had them at Brixton, in consequence of a discovery. They came to the warehouse every morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How ought he to have accounted for this money? A. He should have entered it in the cash-book, which I have examined, and there is no such entry - he never said anything about it. Mr. William Lewis resides in the country.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD SIMPSON. I occasionally attend the business in town. The prisoner never accounted to me for this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a general account, in which he might account for it? A. There was a running petty cash account, out of which he paid small sums - I think it possible that this sum might have been paid in that account, though not brought into the books: I think it possible that if he made up his petty cash-book it might appear. We had great confidence in him.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Who pays the attorney on the other side? A. I do not know; it was his duty to account to Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. The petty cash-book which the prisoner has, is merely for the weekly disbursements of stamps, wages, &amp; c. I repeatedly asked him for the account, and before the books were taken to Brixton - he always had an excuse to make. Money received should not be entered in that book. The last entry in the books is on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no doubt but the entry was made in the day-book on the 8th of December: if I received the money I have forgotten to enter it - but a petty cash-book account has been running from the 10th of February: I repeatedly requested Mr. Lewis to settle it, but he always put it off. Ever since the books have been removed I have had no opportunity of seeing whether my accounts are correct or not - I am therefore unable to meet the charge, as I otherwise should.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. LEWIS. Q. Was he authorised to use money which he received, by making petty disbursements? A. He generally received a cheque for that; he was always desired to pay over all the money he received, but he has at times been allowed to use money which he has received for petty disbursements; it is possible that he might use this so, but not probable; we have not blamed him in that case.</p>

            . I carried this paper home - Mr. Hooper paid me a sovereign and eighteen shillings in silver, which I gave to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Where did you receive it? A. At Mr. Elliot's - I have delivered paper there three times,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130054"/>but the rest amounted to different sums; I gave him the same money as I received. I generally put my master's money into a separate pocket from my own. The prisoner met me as I was going into the warehouse, and took the money - he has met me in that way once or twice; I do not know what he did with it. I was asked about this about Christmas.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You delivered Harper the bill and receipt which you had from the prisoner? A. Yes. That is the only time I received money there.</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. This receipt is in the prisoner's writing: he has never accounted in any way for the money, nor told me that he had received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The same course of petty cash payment was going on then? A. Yes. There is no entry in the journal of this money, nor in the cash-book which is here; he receives weekly cheques for petty cash: his duty was to gave me all money which he receives, and to enter it in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>MR. SIMPSON. He has never paid this money to me, nor accounted to me for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was he in the habit of paying small sums for you? A. For the general account he was. I cannot say that he has not laid out this money for us. His salary was 2 l. a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This case resembles the former. I have had a great deal of business to transact, with very little assistance; it is possible for mistakes to occur. I certainly have no recollection of the circumstance; the witness says he did not give me the money in the counting-house - I was very likely to forget to enter it. There is an entry to Harper in the day-book,</p>
               <p>(pointing it out.)</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. This is an entry of a ream of cartridge, 1 l. 19 s. to Harper, on the 25th of September, but not of any money being received. Mr. Emmett's sum is 1 l. 18 s. There are two or three entries to Harper, which the prisoner, only can explain. There is no entry of the money; it should be entered in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it unusual to take off 1 s. discount? A. No. I once heard the prisoner say that there was a customer named Harper. Here is the cash-book; most of the entries are in his writing.</p>

I went out, and found the prisoners in one of the private boxes, with the trowsers laying close at their heels.</p>

On the 9th of December, about three o'clock, I left my master's house, and about a quarter to nine I fell in with the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street. She came up and pleaded distress to me, saying she was in want of refreshment. I said it was not in my power to relieve her, but she was welcome to a drop of poster. She took me into a house in London-wall, where we had a pint of beer. I came out, she followed me - I had a bundle containing the articles stated in the indictment, which belonged to John Dixon, my husband. We walked a few yards from the house - she then made a snatch at my bundle, but did not succeed - I got my gown torn in the struggle. I thought she was gone - but when I was not prepared for her she came and made a sudden snatch, and got it, without using violence; she ran off with it. I gave an alarm, and the officer took her on the spot, before she got out of my sight. I am certain she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it to me to hold, and then tell me to run after a man who was your fellow-servant? A. No; it is false.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder, and live on Snow-hill. The male prisoner came to my shop with about 20 lbs. of brass chucks and other articles. Chucks are very valuable in machinery, but useless for any thing else. I suspected something, and told my clerk to put them by - we paid him 6 d. or 8 d. a pound for them - they came to 15 s. or 16 s. He came again two or three days after. It was about the middle of November - all our dealings were within the space of nine days. I desired the property to be put aside, and put one chuck into my pocket; and as I went about, inquired of different people if they belonged to them. A few days after he came again with about 40 lbs. I asked him where he lived - he said in Creed-lane, and that his name was Earle. He came a third time, with about 90 lbs. of most valuable things to the parties they belonged to - they were manufactured for making parts of machinery. It was eleven o'clock. I desired my clerk to say we had no time to weigh them, and if he would call again at two o'clock they should be weighed, and he should be paid for them. I immediately went to different places, and was directed to Mr. Dollond, as the only person likely to belong to them. I produced them there, and they identified them, by their matching the machinery. The foreman came to my house with an officer, and when the prisoner came he was apprehended. He did not say how he got the goods. I am not in the habit of buying things, but bought these to detect the thief.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mr. Roper's, and found John Earle there, and asked how he came by the brass, he said he brought it from No. 2, Creed-lane, from Mrs. Earle - I said we suspected it was stolen, could he tell how she came by it; he said she dealt in old copper, and had bought it - I asked where he lived; he said he was a shoe-maker, and had a stall under her shop, and was in the habit of carrying goods for her, as a porter - I took him to the Compter; he said his name was Earle - I asked if he was related to Mrs. Earle; he said Yes - I asked him what relation, over and over again; he refused to tell; I went to Creed-lane, to Mrs. Earle, she keeps a chandler's shop; there was no appearance of her dealing in metal - I asked her where the man was who worked in the stall below; she said he was gone out, but she expected him very soon - I asked if she knew where he was gone; she said to Cock-lane, Smithfield - I asked if she knew what he was gone for; she hesitated for some time - I said I had a particular reason for asking; she said</p>
               <p>"He is gone to sell some old metal for me" - I asked what kind; she said old brass and copper - I said</p>

               <p>"I suppose I must go after Old Maggs, and be transported." Cock-lane is near Mr. Roper's; one Barnard, a dealer in old metal, lives there.</p>

            . In November last, I was in the employ of Mr. Dollond, optician, of St. Paul's churchyard; my father, who is also in his employ, then lived in St. Martin's-le-grand; when my mother was alive, we dealt at Mrs. Earle's - I have known her five or six years; I went into Mr. Dollond's employ, in October - I went to Mrs. Earle's for a pint of small beer, and she asked where I worked; I said at Mr. Dollond's, with my father; she asked at what part of the business; I said in the brass way: she said if I would take her any, she would give me 3 d. or 4 d. a pound, according to the value of it - I said nothing then - I saw her two or three times after, and she repeated the same words, and at last I took her some chucks - John Earle was then in the shop, and looked at them; she weighed them, and gave me 4 d. a pound for them - I received 3 s. - John Earle took it out of the scale,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130056"/>and observed, that it was not brass, but a mixture of pot met - I took some joints of telescopes soon after; John was present, and saw her buy them; there was a person in the shop, and she beckoned for me not to put them in the scale, while the person was there; when the person was gone I put it into the scale, the son looked at it, and said it was only a mixture of pot metal - I had 2 s. or 3 s. for that, and she told me, never to put any thing into the scale, while any one was there - I went there seven or eight times, within five or six weeks, and always took them with me - I took some stick brass, the third time, (her son was present,) and she told me, there was a person opposite, and not to make a noise with it, for the person opposite was worse than officers, that she had bought some bottles of a boy, who worked at Mr. Ellis, and the person opposite had told Mr. Ellis, who turned the boy away, and took the bottles from her; and, if any body saw me take it, to say. I never took any before, and to be sure I never let any body see me come into her shop; her son was present at this conversation; all the property which I took her, I had stolen from Mr. Dollond. These dealings went on till Mr. Roper went to my master - I received 16 s. or 18 s. in all, from her - some of the brass was rather old; but most of it new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you come from goal now? A. Yes; I spent the money in different things, not in drink - my father did not know a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you give evidence here; is it to save yourself? A. My master asked me if I had stolen it - I said I had: it is not altogether to save myself, but to tell the truth - I do not know whether I am to be prosecuted - I am nineteen years old - I never stole any thing before - I used to go to their shop at breakfast time - I sometimes took it in my apron, and sometimes to my pockets - I had 15 s. a-week - I do not know whether I am to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has Mr. Dolland, your father, or any one told you, that you will not be prosecuted, if the prisoners are convicted? A. Mr. Harmer said, I might get off, if I told the truth, but did not positively say I should. If my father had known it, he would have told my master directly - I should not have thought of it, if Earle had not set me on - the property produced is what I sold her.</p>

On the 5th of January, I received charge of ten puncheons of rum from Hopkins; they were pull into the Charles, which belongs to Lucey, the lighterman; they were to be exported; samples of them were to be drawn, and taken to the Excise office; the puncheons were to go into Limehouse basin, and I went there, after they had arrived, and took charge of them, about a quarter to four o'clock into afternoon; they continued in my charge till six o'clock. I then gave them up to the prisoner - it was all safe then; he was to watch them till six o'clock, next morning. the lighter was lying on the north side of the basin. I went about ten minutes before six next morning to take charge, and then found the lighter on the opposite side - the prisoner was there. I asked why he had moved the craft? he said he did not know - he came out of the craft - I asked if the charge was all safe - he said yes, and went away. Soon after some persons came down - I heard somebody call Johnson - I went and found it was one of the police officers; in consequence of what they said I remained in charge till the puncheon was regauged by Hopkins.</p>

               <p>"Have you got any thing about you;" he told me No. That is a question we commonly ask. I said I wished to examine him before he went out; he said I was welcome; he opened his great coat; I felt him all over till I came down to his legs, where I found a bladder; I asked what that was - he gave no answer - it contained one gallon of ruin. I found a small gimblet in his coat pocket; I told him to stop in the police box and unbutton his trowsers and let me have it out. I asked him afterwards where he got it, he said he picked it up just ahead of a barge which was laying in the basin; there was only one barge laying there; she had discharged her cargo and was going out. I asked where he got the gimblet; he said he picked it up just by the rum. I asked where his charge was - he said</p>
               <p>"There it is, astern of the brig;" I lodged him in the guard-room, and went to examine the craft astern of the brig, on the south side of the basin - I found Johnson, the watchman, close by it.</p>

I asked where he got the gimblet, he said he found it near the rum, but more a shore. Luke stated in his presence, that he had examined the prisoner's charge but could not find any cask that had been plundered; I went on board and found the spill in the puncheon; I went to Mr. Field and we raised the bung, and found it two inches dry; the spill was cut off, but evidently not by a cooper; it was wet and smelt of rum, and was not the same description of wood. I took some rum out of the cask and compared it with that in the bladder - it seemed to be the same.</p>

               <p>NATHANIEL ENTWISTLE. I keep the Crane, public-house, in the parish of St. John, Hackney. The prisoner came to my house several times before the 2d of December - he came about eight o'clock in the morning of that day, and called for a glass of gin, which came to 2 d; I served him, and he gave me a shilling: I gave him change - I then went back towards the light, and found the shilling was a bad one; he was then walking out: he got out - I went after him, and found he was gone. I took care of that shilling - I wrapped it up, and kept it by itself: and have kept it ever since. He came again about eleven o'clock the same forenoon, for a pint of beer, which came to 2 1/2 d.; he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change: this was in the tap-room, which is lighter than the bar, and I saw that it was bad. I went out, and sent a man for Garva, the constable - he came, and we went into the taproom; I showed him the two shillings, and gave charge of the prisoner. Garva marked the two shillings, and gave them back to me; they were never out of my sight. Garva searched him, and found one shilling and a sixpence, in his pocket, some halfpence, and a bit of beef steak.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody on the 2d of December - Entwistle showed me two shillings; these are them, (looking at them;) I put a mark upon them, and gave them to Entwistle. I found 1 s. 6 d. in good money in the prisoner's breeches pocket, and in his waistcoat pocket 4 1/2 d. in copper. I searched him further, and found under his arm a bag, which came round his neck, and hung under his shirt - I told him to pull off his coat; he would not: he made a sad resistance when he found I had got hold of the bag. I pulled it from under his shirt - it contained twenty-three good sixpences and there were five bad shillings wrapped up in a piece of paper, and wrapped up all separate in the paper; they appeared quite fresh. I found 3 s. 5 d. in copper, and a piece of beef steak in his pocket, and some cheese, and four onions, all in his coat pocket. I asked him where he got the money, and he said more misfortune to him.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Treachey, an attorney, in Clement's Inn. Both these registers are signed in the prisoner's hand-writing; Mr. Treachey's daughter is one of the witnesses to this last register. There were some proceedings instituted by Lady Cockburn, to recover some money settled upon her on her separation from Sir James, supposing that Sir James was dead, but when she heard he was living, the proceedings were abated; this was shortly after her marriage to the prisoner - I take this account from what she, herself, said. I have often seen her and the prisoner together. The proceedings were stopped afterwards.</p>

            . I knew the prisoner and his wife nine years and a half ago - they were living together. I heard her say that she had been Lady Cockburn. I saw her about ten days ago; I do not know where she is now, upon my oath - she called at my house, and begged I would attend the examination at Marlborough-street; I do not know where she lodged: I have not been at her house or lodgings this nine years. I do not know where she lived, and have not seen her since Friday week.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE BARTLETT. I married the prisoner at Mary-le-bone church, in February, 1819. I was a widow then. I had the prisoner taken up on a charge of bigamy about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had been trying your hand at a divorce before that? A. No; I do not recollect that I had - I applied to Mr. Green, an attorney, for some redress from the ill-treatment I had received. I know Mr. Metcalf and Mr. Green, I employed them to try to get redress. I sent for the prisoner to give me lessons on the guitar - I was recommended to him - that was not the recommendation of Miss Boswell - I do not know her. He had been giving me lessons about four years before we married.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you not know he was living as a married man with Lady Cockburn, and notwithstanding that you married him? A. I did hear of it, but it was cleared up before we were married - his solicitor cleared away every doubt - I was informed it was a void marriage, and it was not till after that that we were married.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been to his house while Lady Cockborn was living with him? A. Yes, I had; but the matter was left to the care of Mr. Treachey, and I relied on that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Treachey was Mr. Ventura's attorney? A. Yes; and I was given to understand that there was something illegal in his marriage with Lady Cockburn. The prisoner obtained landed property by his marriage with me - it still remains. I have sold one house since I was married and we had jointly the produce of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not have the whole of the money yourself? A. No; so far from it, I had to apply to him for 6 d., and was refused. The estate produced 300 l. per year or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he married you was not be in possession of 400 l. or 500 l. a year, which he gave up? A. Yes, he did; but it was not entirely by my desire; we went to live together in the country - my furniture and effects remain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130060"/>with me, but the plate has been parted with - he sold some, and I did endeavour to have some for myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I married Lady Cockburn she deceived me - I met her in great distress, and gave her a few shillings. I then lent her 20 l. or 30 l.; and then she contrived to drive me to marriage; a day or two afterwards Mrs. Bartlett came to my house to buy an instrument - I was not at home - she and Lady Cockburn were in the parlour some time, trying instruments; and then she came again, and met me at home, and begged me to play and sing. She has often been with Lady Cockburn and her brother to play. I then went to Kensington to give her some lessons, and they gave me some Spanish cake to take home to Lady Cockburn. In about two years I found that Lady Cockburn had been married to Sir James Cockburn; I received information that Sir James Cockburn was in Scotland, and desired her to se- separate from me directly. After a year or two Sir James Cockburn came to London, and I went to him - I told him all the particulars. I parted with Lady Cockburn, and met with Mrs. Bartlett, she knew the whole of these particulars.</p>

            . I am a Baron of Nova Scotia. I have been in the army, and a great deal abroad. I married in 1791 to Miss Frances Green, in Ireland, on the 19th of May, to the best of my recollection. I married her as a single woman. In consequence of certain occurrences we were separated; and proceedings in Chancery were instituted. I understand she is now living, but I have not seen her since 1793, when I embarked on board Lord Hood's fleet.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any other Sir James Cockburn at that time? A. Not that I know of. I cannot tell her age - she might be nineteen or twenty. We were married at Limerick, in Ireland, at the parish church, where she lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked at Marlborough-street of producing the brother of the lady, Mr. Green, who was a Magistrate of the county, and that he would come immediately to attest the matter of the marriage? A. I did not say so - I said I understood he was a Magistrate, and possessed 3000 l. a year. I never corresponded with him in my life, nor have I seen him since 1793 - he was a trustee to a deed which I made.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I have been the solicitor of Lady Cockburn, sixteen years; she is the lady who married the prisoner; she introduced Mr. Ventura as her husband. In 1822, she applied at my house to request I would open a correspondence with the trustee, under the marriage settlement of Sir James - I transacted money business between Sir James and her on one occacasion, in 1822 - Sir James and Lady Cockburn were at my house the same day, but not together, and signed a release - Lady Cockburn came first, and signed an authority to me, which I have in my hand.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES COCKBURN re-examined. I have not seen Lady Cockburn since 1793 - I transacted the business just alluded to - I know this paper is her writing - I am positive it is.</p>

On the 10th of January, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, Connor and Smith came into our shop - Maloney was standing outside the window - Connor asked to see some seals; I showed her five - Smith was by her side, and said they were too dear; they were about 18 s. or a guinea each - Connor then asked me to let her go backwards; she went into the back parlour - I went with her, and left Smith in the shop; my mother was standing by the parlour-door - I asked her to look to the shop, when I going into the parlour - Maloney came into the shop, and said to Smith and Connor,</p>
               <p>"What a time you are, are you not coming?" Connor staid backward, about three minutes - they then said the seals were too dear, and they would go outside and point to some which might suit them - Maloney pointed to a seal in the window; they then went to the further end of the window, and then ran away - I am quite certain they ran off, they did not walk - I had some rings in a glass case on the counter, five minutes before; as soon as the prisoners ran away, my mother came into the shop, and said</p>
               <p>"I think those girls are thieves" - I then saw the door of the glass-case open - I had not opened it, while they were there, and no person could have opened it, but the prisoners - I missed a case from it, containing twelve rings, which cost my father upwards of 20 l. - I ran round the corner, and saw the girls all running together - I ran after them; a gentleman was passing, whom I requested to assist me; we went into Warwick-street, and they were walking very slowly - I said,</p>
               <p>"If we walk slowly, we shall take them" - we came up to them, and I said</p>
               <p>"You have stolen a case of rings" - Connor said</p>
               <p>"I have not" - I saw her endeavouring to secrete something under her stocking; she had seven rings in her hand - they had thrown the case into the road, at the corner of Warwick-street - when I got home, we found two rings in the shop, which were dropped - Connor was searched at Bow-street, and one was found down her clothes; two of them are entirely lost - I am sure the ten which are found, were taken from the glass case - Maloney escaped, but she was taken the next day - I am sure she was one of the three - I described her to five or six officers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I received information of the robbery on Friday, the 31st of December, a little after six o'clock. The prosecutrix appeared to have been knocked down, and was very muddy. The prisoner was brought down on another charge on Friday. the 7th of January - the prosecutrix attended next day and saw him - the description she had given of him exactly corresponded with his person - he had a fustian coatee on - I brought out four prisoners who were locked up, and she immediately pointed him out as the person who struck her - no person had pointed him out to her - it was entirely the result of her own observavation. Wright saw him, and by his dress recognised him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I attended a raffle at this house, and after most of the company had left I went out with the remainder, and about two yards from the door my foot touched something, which on my picking up proved to be a shawl - I enquired whether it belonged to any of the parties present - they did not claim it, but advised me to keep it. I am aware I was reprehensible in so doing.</p>

On Tuesday, she came about eight o'clock, but she did not usually come till about ten. I went to sleep, and did not awake till half-past ten - I then found the chairs in a litter, and the drawers loose - the property stated in the indictment was safe the night before. She did not come again after I saw the house in confusion. I had paid her what was due to her on the night before. She was taken up on the Thursday following.</p>

It is the name I have gone by - I have lived with Mr. Witt as his wife, he is a groom. I did not swear before the Magistrate that I was his wife. I have sent the prisoner to the pawnbroker's several times with clothes of Mr. Witt's - I sent her the night before, with a great coat to pawn, because Mr. Witt was out - I might have sent her three or four times to the pawnbroker's, and I expected her the next morning - she did not give me the duplicate of the articles, but left it on the drawers - I saw it, and went to the pawnbroker's. Upon my oath I did not send her to pawn these articles.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. John Brander - the prisoner was his lamp-lighter. When a lamp was broken it was his duty to bring it in, and have fresh glasses put in their places. On Thursday, the 6th of January, he brought in four lamps only, all the glass had been cut out of them by some instrument. I have seen the glass which the officer has, and it seems to correspond with the sides of the lamps. I cautioned the prisoner and the other men, and told them the glass must not be cut out, and I would inform my employer. Last Monday week I gave the prisoner six broken lamps to replace, he brought me but four, and said the other two were stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to these lamps? A. Yes; I put them in a separate place, to shew them to my employer.</p>

I cannot say when I had seen them all together. Suspecting persons were in the lane, I took a different route. Hearing some voices, I returned, and placed two patrols at the end of the lane. The prisoner and another were together. I secured the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130066"/>prisoner myself, with two of the fowls hanging on his shoulder - they were quite warm. I gave him to the patrol, but he got away from him.</p>

            . I superintend the watch of Kentish-town. On Tuesday, the 14th of December, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the watch-house gate, at Kentish-town, and saw the prisoner carrying a sack across his shoulder - I crossed over to him, and asked what he had in that sack; he said he had got meat - I asked where he brought it from; he said from his father, who lived at Hendon - I asked if his father kept sheep; he said Yes; he said he was taking it to Tower-street, Seven-dials - I asked where the skin was; he said at his father's - I asked why it had been killed; he said it had been had for two or three days - I let him go, went back, locked up the gates, and then met Davis, who followed him with me to Camden-town, in a chaise-cart, overtook him with the sack, and stopped him - took him into the Britania public-house, and had the meat laid on the table; it was a sheep cut up, and quite warm; it was cut into joints, in a mangled state, not cut as a butcher would cut it - I asked Davis (who is a butcher) in the prisoner's presence, if he thought that sheep was killed in good health, or not; he said he thought it was; it was fat; there was two legs, a saddle, and other joints, cut in a mangled way - I found a knife on him, with blood on it, and it has fat on it now - when I first stopped him, I asked if there was any mark on the skin; he said</p>
               <p>"Yes; a P.;" we got a chaise-cart, and took him to Hendon, to the Swan public-house - I enquired after his father, and found he had left there, about two months, but still there was a person in care of the house; a sheep-skin was produced, about half an hour after - part of the breast was left, on the skin, on the side, and tallied with the rest - the head was also left in the skin, and corresponded - I saw the meat fitted to the skin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose you do not understand much about sheep's flesh? A. No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130067"/>there were the two fore and two hind legs found in the sack - the breast was to the skin; there were three parts of the carcase in the sack, part of the breast; the head and neck were left in the skin; they made the whole carcase complete.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Old-street. On the 20th of December, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner brought a ring, and asked me to lend him 3 s. on it. I asked whose property it was; he said it was his own - that he bought it at Port Royal, in Jamaica - that his wife bought it, and he believed gave two dollars for it. I sent for an officer and gave him in charge. It is a brilliant diamond ring, worth from 50 s. to 60 s.</p>

I found the drawer still locked - it must have been opened with a false key. I had worn the ring on Sunday, the 19th.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason, and live in Exeter-place, Chelsea. On the 3d of January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was going by the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner and another against the window - it was quite dark; they were close to a pane of glass which was afterwards broken. Ladbrook was with me; we went to the Swan, public-house, which is about one hundred yards off, to call Snowsell, and as we came out, the prisoner and the other passed by, in a direction from Harris's - we had been gone about four minutes. Snowsell ran after them; the prisoner threw a bundle of candles over an area, and ran off; Snowsell called Stop thief! and I collared him by Exeter-street; the other escaped. Snowsell got the bundle from the area.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor came to me; he appeared sober, and was bleeding at the nose and mouth; he said he had been knocked down by the bell-ringers, and had his pocket picked; he said the party were up the street. There were six bell-ringers: the prisoner was not one of them, but was standing by them, with a bottle in his hand - I found him with them, about sixty yards off - I held my lantern up to his face, and Mann immediately pointed him out - I said,</p>
               <p>"You are given in charge for ill-using this young man;" he said he had done nothing to him. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            , who is coachman to Mrs. Matam of Throgmorton-street. We live in London Wall. On the 3d of December the prisoner came to enquire for an apartment, I said I had only half a bed to let; she said that would do, she wanted a bed for her brother who lodged at the second public-house in London Wall, that her name was Smith - she went up, looked at the bed, and liked it very much, and said her brother had lived three years with a gentleman, who she would refer me to; she then said she was awkwardly situated, that her husband had promised to meet her, but had not, and she had a parcel at the coach-office, with 5 l. odd in it, but they had refused to give it her, because she had not the money to pay for it; that she never was at a pawn-shop in her life, having just come from the country, and if I would have the goodness to lend her 3 s. she would leave her wedding-ring with me, till three o'clock, when she would return for it. I told her to walk in, as my husband would be in shortly; I did not like to do such things and without his leave; she said</p>
               <p>"No, don't tell your husband, on any account, for he knows my husband, and may tell him" - so I let her have the 3 s. I said</p>
               <p>"I hope this ring is gold" - she said</p>
               <p>"Certainly it is, look at the stamp inside; and pray take care of it, for it was my mother's" - I went for her brother's character, but they knew no such person; she said she lived at No. 6, Swan-alley, which I found to be false. I am certain she said it was a gold ring.</p>

On the 19th he came again, and asked if I had got any old Cheshire cheese - I shewed him two; he selected one, which weighed 59 lbs. He then selected two new cheeses, weighing 51 lbs. I shewed him another, which weighed 10 lbs., which he also bought - he asked me to send them to the same place as I had the others, and he would return the money for them; they came to 4 l. 11 s. 6 d. I sent my man with them, and a bill, in about two hours, to No. 13, Fetter-lane, and told him to bring back the goods or the money; he was not to leave them without the money. The man returned with 11 s. in silver, and sixteen paper parcels, which I supposed to be 5 s. papers of copper, but they contained lead; eight having a penny piece at each end, and the other eight a halfpenny; I did not find it out till next day, and then went to Fetter-lane, but could hear nothing of him.

I found the prisoner there, and took the goods in; I saw these parcels laying on the window, and said,</p>

               <p>"You may have either silver or copper, which you please;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I will thank you to let me have silver then." I waited some time, and he said all at once,</p>
               <p>"You must take these coppers." I asked why he had not got his shelves and counters fixed: he said he could not get a carpenter. He gave these sixteen parcels into my hand, four at a time - he lifted them on my head. Nothing more passed. I took them home.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. I did not open the parcels, but paid eight of them away to Mr. Tully, of Leadenhall-market, next day; he sent them back that afternoon - I then opened the rest, and found they contained lead.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 11th of December, and took a lodging; he was alone - he slept in the same room with me; another young man, named William Bicknell, slept with the prisoner. I was awoke on Tuesday the 14th of December by Bicknell, who told me something about the prisoner. I looked at my box, and the lid was open. I had put my clothes in the box the night before, and shut it up. I looked into the box and missed two coats and a pair of blue trowsers, they were worth about 2 l. 10 s. I missed a waistcoat from the box, and lost my hat, a black silk handkerchief, and three other handkerchiefs. I gave notice at a public-house about it, and saw the prisoner again in Mary-le-bone watch-house on Sunday, the 2d of January.</p>

            . I slept in the same bed with the prisoner on Monday, the 13th of December. On Tuesday morning he got up early - when I awoke, he was going out at the door - it was dark, I could not see him - he spoke to me, and said his master was going to York, and he must go to the coach-office. He asked me how he should get out; I told him to draw back the bolt. I heard him go out, and shut the door. I went to sleep again, and awoke about seven o'clock. I then found my things tumbled about, and missed 4 s. 6 d. from my breeches pocket, and a pair of stockings. The prisoner had left his own stockings in the room.</p>

On the 23d of December, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the prisoner Moriarty came to my house for a pint of porter, which I served him with; he took that away, and came again for another pint of beer, which I served him in a quart pot. I asked him for the other pint pot, which he did not bring back. I said</p>
               <p>"Where is that pot, you have taken it away." He said he had not. He then came a third time, for half a pint of beer, and I said</p>
               <p>"You have taken that quart away." He said he had not. I served him with half a pint in another quart pot, he took that into the tap-room - I do not know where he had taken the others. He drank that porter. A person said to me</p>
               <p>"That man has taken the pot away." I have known him for these two years - he has frequented the house occasionally. I went to his house, in Fox-court, immediately, but the house was in darkness, and I did not go in. I came back for a candle to go to his house, but I thought I would go to Henry Worms's shop, which is a marine store shop, about sixty yards from my house, in Fox-court. I went towards the shop, and saw Moriarty standing there, shaking hands with Henry Worms, and heard Worms say to him,</p>
               <p>"I will make it all right." They could not see me. I then went into the shop, and told Moriarty they had got my pot. They said they had not got it. I told Worms I would search the place - and he said I should not do it. Morris Worms was then behind his father, and he took up the pot and ran to another shop, where they melt the mettle. I attempted to run after him, and the father stopped me, and said I should not go. I pushed him aside, and followed the boy, and saw him throw the pot under the grate - I took it up, it had my name and sign on it. I took Henry Worms out of the shop, and gave charge of him and Morris. I then went to search for Moriarty, who had left the shop, and found him sitting in my tap-room. I went for a constable, and gave him in charge. I have not found the other quart pot, or the pint. I then took Mr. Mayo to the house where Worms was in charge, and we went down to his shop - we found a very large fire, three melting pans, and some pewter, which had been very lately melted, in the pans.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many pots were missing? A. Three, in less than two hours. I did not see any of them taken - I did not look in at Worms's window. I looked down a passage leading to his house. I could not see what was passing in the shop, but I saw Moriarty inside - the door was open - there was a light in the shop; I could not see who Moriarty was with, but when I went in I saw old Worms, he had his hat on, but he had not just come in, or I should have seen him - he told me he had just come in, and knew nothing about the matter. It is a private house, the shop lies back - there is a board up, with</p>
               <p>"Dealer in Marine Stores" on it; there is a back-room, which I call the other shop, where they do their business. Worms did not buy his beer of me, nor did any person in his house. The pot was found in the first room. Henry Worms stood before me, and Morris behind him - I saw Morris take it into the back-room, and put it under the grate - I heard him take it up from the counter. I took Morris because he had the pot in his hand, and the father, because I saw him shake hands with Moriarty. The pot was very good, I gave 1 s. 6 d. for it: when I exchange my old pots for new, I am allowed a half in exchange - in the state it was then in it was worth more than 1 s.</p>

            . I am a currier, and was in Mr. Winder's house on the 23d of December. I saw Moriarty there about half-past six o'clock - the gas was alight - he called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130073"/>for a pint of beer - I cannot say whether he drank it or not. I saw him take a quart pot off the table and put it under his blue jacket; he then left the room: I told the pot-boy of it, and Mr. Winder went after him. In four or five minutes Moriarty returned again; he had left the room before - when he returned he was taken. I am certain of his person.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 23d of December, soon after six o'clock, Mr. Winder sent for me. I went into Fox-court, and saw a number of persons at Worms's door. Mr. Winder was there, and gave charge of Worms and his son, for receiving a pot, which he delivered into my hands. He said he had lost three within two hours, and if I went into Worms's premises he was convinced I should find the others. I went into the shop, down the open passage, and at the further end of the shop there was a strong fire, and three melting pans by the side of the fire; one, if not two of them, had pewter in them; which appeared to me to be recently melted, and felt very warm. I took the prisoners into an adjoining house till they were taken before a Magistrate. It is a marine store shop - no one can avoid seeing the name of Winder upon the pot, and the sign of the house. Here is the pot in the state in which I received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who Mr. Winder desired to break some metal which you found there, and which was not pewter:? A. Unquestionably - it is what is called type metal, but I have no hesitation in swearing that the metal in the pans was pewter - it is my firm belief. I heard old Worms say that he knew nothing of the matter - he had but just come in, and if any one was to blame it was not him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WORMS, SEN. Q. Did not a woman in the house tell you I had but just come in? A. I have no recollection of that. I heard you tell the boy to say nothing but the truth, and that repeatedly.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was desired to take charge of Moriarty - I asked him where the pot was - he said he had sold it to a Jew, for 4 d., pointing towards Fox-court; I do not know any other Jew, but the prisoners, keeping a shop there. I found 2 1/2 d. on his person.</p>

I have some persons here with whom I had been in company till half-past five o'clock; I went home, and found Moriarty drunk, in the shop, and making a great noise - I said,</p>
               <p>"Go away, I want to go out, and if there is any thing wrong come in the morning, and I will set it right" - he said he would not go; I said,</p>

               <p>"You must not leave it:" he swore again and said he would hit me on my head; he was going out of the shop and met my father, who had just that moment come in.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's son. I went to my father's house, on the day in question, about ten minutes before six o'clock; my father was not at home. I went to Baldwin's-gardens, and was detained there about five minutes - when I got home to my house, in Cloth-fair, my sister told me what had happened - there was some type-metal in my father's house, but it was not pewter - there was no melted pewter, and when I was there, there was a fire; it is the room in which my father eats, drinks and sleeps. I had called to borrow some money - there were two melting pans, and one ladle there - I did not examine the metal, but I sat so close, I could see that it was not pewter - I believe there was an ingot there - Winder was not there. I had a watch in my pocket, and I looked at it a few minutes afterwards, because I was under the necessity of parting with it, in Baldwin's-gardens; it was then about six o'clock - it is a good watch, and keeps time very correctly - I did not see the constable at my father's house, I cannot swear that there was no pewter there when he was there.</p>

            , in the front parlour, I had secured the house before I went to bed in the usual manner; I went into the room first, but she followed me in two or three minutes, it was then about ten minutes after eleven o'clock - we both went to sleep and were alarmed by the barking of our little dog. On the night before I had left a table-spoon in the kitchen which had been used for gruel, and a shawl; the spoon was silver and was my master's, the shawl was mine. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130074"/>the dog harked I spoke to him, and quieted him for three or four minutes; he came again, and harked very violently, he went as far as the street door; it laid on the mat at the bottom of the stairs, and between the stairs and our bed-room there is a partition of glass, through which I perceived suddenly a light, I think it was about one o'clock - all the persons in the house were in bed; I heard some one catch the dog up very violently and he made an uncommon noise between the first alarm and the second. I opened my door and went to the top of the kitchen stairs. I saw a light and heard a person any</p>
               <p>"hush," it sounded in the kitchen - I went a little backward and called out</p>
               <p>"Who is there?" I then screamed out Murder! several times. I then went into the room, shut the door, and held it firm because there was no lock; my fellow-servant opened the window by my direction and called Watch! I staid at the door: Before the watchman came there were two men who appeared to come down the street from the Strand - I was not at the window, but Rebbecca Thomas was, I heard them say</p>
               <p>"I will send the watchman," but they did not. I afterwards looked out and saw a man standing in the area, with his back towards our window, I suppose he had got up from the kitchen window and then on the coal-house door, and then upon the stonework on which the railing rests; he was on the stone-work when I saw him. A gentleman got in at the window to us, and went and opened the street-door for us, they got a light from the gas, and the watchman went down into the kitchen before me, I went down afterwards, and was very anxious about a little boy who slept in the cupboard in the kitchen, but he was safe and asleep. A gentleman took up the carving-knife which was all over blood, and the little dog was lying weltering in his blood, with his head cut off all but a bit of skin. Newman the watchman came into the kitchen with the spoon and my shawl, he brought them both in together; they had been in the kitchen the night before when I went to bed, the carving-knife I am positive I had put into the knife-box, it was then lying on the dresser, I alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did this happen? A. I think it was about one o'clock, because I looked at the watch after the watchman had come in, and it was then about two. I had fastened the house myself, the persons had come in at the kitchen window, the shutters had been forced, and the window raised. I had fastened the shutters myself and the window was down the night before - there was only one person within the rails. I gave an account of this transaction in this Court before - I did not then know any thing about these prisoners being concerned in the robbery. I believe I heard something about them from Mrs. Abrahams on the Tuesday following the robbery, which was a week before I gave evidence here - Mrs. Abrahams mentioned the name of Lintott, I think, but I do not recollect the name of Durham; she said it was two former servants of Mr. Frasers who had been concerned with her husband in the robbery, she mentioned two names I know, but I do not recollect the name of Durham: I think Durham was the name of the other but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. She said she believed they had been servants of Mr. Fraser's, but had known them but a short time? A. Yes; I am confident I heard some person below say</p>
               <p>"hush," the voice proceeded from the kitchen and not from the area - Mrs. Abrahams said her husband had told her that they had been servants of Mr. Fraser's; and her husband had been led into it by them.</p>
               <p>REBECCA THOMAS. I am fellow-servant with the last witness. On the 28th of November I lived with her at Mr. Fraser's; I went to bed with her about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, the house was then safe and quiet, we were awoke by the dog harking; there is a glass partition in our room, and we saw a light through it, my fellow servant left the room and returned, I got up and opened the window, and saw two young men come by when I was screaming; I think it was the tallest of the two prisoners who spoke to me, that is Durham; I have no recollection of the other person, he did not speak, but I know he was shorter than the one who spoke; the tallest of them held the top of the rails and looked down into the kitchen but gave no assistance - I believe Durham to be the man but I cannot exactly be sure, because my fright was so great; the shortest one only stood by the side of the other but did not offer to give any assistance; the tall one was dressed in black I am pretty sure; I saw Durham before the Magistrates about a week afterwards, or between a week and a fortnight; he was then dressed in black, I had not then any doubt that he was the same person: while he was at the rails he asked what was the matter, I said there was some one in the kitchen, he said he would call the watchman: I begged and prayed of him not to go away and leave us, but they both went away without calling the watchman. I continued to give an alarm, and the watchman came up, Abrahams got up the area to the stonework within the rails, he was taken before he got over - one gentleman came in at the window, and got us a light and we went down stairs, the kitchen was open, it had been shut over night and fastened up, I saw the dog laying dead in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. With respect to the shorter man, (Lintott,) you have no recollection? A. No; the other was in my sight a little longer than you have been speaking to me. There is a gas light on the other side of the way, nearly opposite. The person I spoke to had a hat on, he was standing side-ways, with his face more towards me than the gas, but I was very near to him - the area is narrow, and I was leaning out at the window - they came in a direction from the Strand; if they had been inclined to have gone into the Strand, they need not have come so far as our window. He did not say any thing more to me than what I have mentioned. I said</p>
               <p>"Pray don't go away," several times. I will not swear that Durham is the man - but I have no doubt he is. I am not quite sure that if I had seen him any where else than in custody I should have believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Unless you had seen him there, you would not have thought any thing about him at all? A. No; I had a good view of his face from the gas light - I was so near, I was nearly touching him. I did not see them till he spoke to me - whether they had been from the house, or not I do not know; they came momentarily to me. The area is not more than three feet wide - there is a gas light on our side also, and they both give a good Our house is nearer the Strand than Howard-street.</p>

            . I am a coal-porter, and live in Milford-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130075"/>in the Strand. I was returning home about twelve o'clock at night on the 28th of November; and coming through the court into Arundel-street, which court runs into Howard-street, I saw a man pass me in a dark coat, well dressed; but I cannot swear to the colour of his clothes. He ran round the corner from Norfolk-street - I heard the screams of a woman crying Murder! - they came from Norfolk-street. I saw the prisoner Durham before the Magistrate, and believe him to be the man whom I met - he was then dressed in black - I believe him to be the man; he met me as I was going to Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you meet any other persons in that passage? A. No; only one - he was coming round the corner of Norfolk-street. I know where Mr. Fraser's house is - the passage he was in was nearer the river than Mr. Fraser's house; he went up Arundel-street toward the Strand - he was only in my view while we passed; he had run round the corner, but he did not run as he passed me, but then ran on. We were both near a gas light, my face was towards the gas - I can swear to the man any where. I had been at my relation's, and I had stopped there rather late, and could not get in at my lodgings. I had passed all that time without drinking any spirits. My relation lodges at the top of Ship-yard, Temple-bar, his name is Aldridge, he is a painter. I came home at eleven o'clock to the public-house where I lodge, in Milford-lane. I went back to my relation's, and could not get in - I had walked about till between twelve and one o'clock. I did not swear positively to him before the Justice. I was examined there and said his appearance led me to believe he was the man - but I did not say positively that he was. I went to the Office the next morning, but did not see him there then - I saw Abrahams there with the watchman, but did not see Durham for some time after; I saw Mrs. Abrahams that morning, at the Office, and three or four other times - I never saw her any where else, and never had any conversation with her about swearing positively to a person, in order to serve her husband, or with any body else.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You went the next day and saw Mrs. Abrahams - you went again, and again, and saw her there? A. Yes, but I saw her no where else.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes - Mr. Fraser's house is in that parish. On the night of the 28th of November my attention was called there; I heard a scream from a female - I went there, and saw Rebecca Thomas at the window. I apprehended a person named Abrahams in the area. I afterwards searched the house, and found the dog slaughtered. I found a dark lantern on the kitchen dresser, and the shawl and silver table spoon in the area. I found the stock of a centre bit in the area - the shawl was claimed by the servant, and the spoon by the prosecutor. I had not heard any one call Watch! but I heard the screams of this young woman. I was at the lower part of Norfolk-street, about seven or eight doors from the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes. I was attracted by Newman's rattle; I went to No. 37, Norfolk-street, and found in the area three centre bits, a small iron crow, and an iron stock. I found the door of the dark lantern in the kitchen, separated from the lantern. I applied the iron crow to the marks on the kitchen window shutters, and they appeared to be made by that crow. I am certain they were made by some crow.</p>

             I am a Bow-street patrol. I know the Fox and Goose, public-house, King-street, Seven-dials. - On the 28th of November I staid there, in company with two brother officers, till about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock; I do not know Mr. Fraser's house; it might take up about ten minutes to get to Norfolk-street from there. I saw the two prisoners together there, in company with Abrahams; they were all in company, and drank together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I wish you particularly to recollect the time of night? A. We went there after eleven o'clock at night, and had to meet at twelve, at the top of Drury-lane, to separate: it was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before twelve when I saw these persons - they were there when I went in, and Abrahams showed me a paper of Life in London: he asked me to drink out of his pint of porter. I am not positive that Lintott was there when we went away, but I am sure the others were; it would take about a quarter of an hour to get from there to Norfolk-street.</p>

             - he is a biscuit-baker. On the 28th of November I lodged at Mr. Chappel's, No. 25, Great Earl-street; Abrahams and his wife lodged in the same house at that time. On the 28th of November I dined with them: a person of the name of Shaw dined there too, so did Durham; we dined about a quarter after one o'clock; Durham went away about two: he came back between four and five, and staid to tea, and afterwards Abrahams and Durham went up into Abraham's room; we had dined in Abrahams's room, and drank tea in mine. Mrs. Abrahams asked her husband for a shilling, when they came down, and he gave her 6 d. Durham then asked what she wanted; she said a shilling, and he immediately gave her one: they then went out together - Mrs. Abrahams said,</p>
               <p>"Abrahams, return the shilling to Henry:" they left the house, about half-past 5 o'clock. Abrahams did not return that night. On the following morning Mrs. Abrahams came to me and seemed very much agitated. I was in company with her, and we were going out to see if we could find Mr. Abrahams - as we went out we met Durham at the door - Mrs. Abrahams said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Abrahams;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Hush, go up to your own room;" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, not till I have seen Abrahams:" he took her by the arm, and they went across the road together. Earl-street leads into King-street where the Fox and Goose is - we went down Queen-street, which is the adjoining street; Mrs. Abrahams asked again,</p>
               <p>"Where is Abrahams?" Durham said,</p>
               <p>"He is in St. Clement's watch-house;" she said,</p>
               <p>"What for?" he said,</p>
               <p>"The fact is we broke into a house in Norfolk-street, Strand, and a dog's head was cut of, but Abrahams did not do it - I held the dog, and Linton cut his head off;" we afterwards got to the Fox and Goose, and Mrs. Abrahams fainted away - Mr. Newman's servant fetched a glass of water, and Durham gave her a small glass of brandy - when she got better Durham told her to go to Bow-street, and she would, most likely, meet her husband coming from the watch-house. I went to Bow-street, and Abrahams was there. Mr. Shaw was in the house when we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130076"/>went out to look for Abrahams - he was not at the door when we went out; he was going down the kitchen stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the wife of Mr. Vandevelde? A. Yes; we were married on the 17th of August, 1823, at Mary-le-bone New Church. I never had any other husband; I know a person named John Williams - that is my husband; he is in confinement, under that name, in the House of Correction - he has been there since last April; he was tried here. I cannot be answerable for his conduct - I believe he had been in prison before he was married. I was never in prison; I have been obliged to do as well as I could since he has been there - I have got my living as other unfortunate persons do: I did not get my living so before I was married. I had known Mrs. Abrahams about a month before her husband was taken. Half-past five o'clock on the Sunday afternoon was the last time I saw these persons. I do not know how Abrahams got his living. I did not mention anything to any person about this business till Mr. Moore came to me - he keeps Serle's Coffee-house, in Carey-street; that was after Abrahams had been tried. I had not consulted Mr. Moore on the subject till he came to me, and asked if I knew Mrs. Abrahams - I said I did. I was told at that time, and have been told since, that giving evidence against these young men might be of service to Abrahams; Mrs. Abrahams did not say that I was to say anything more than was true; she did not tell me to be positive in saying that this young man was present at the transaction, as that would do her good, but she desired me to tell Mr. Moore what I knew, as it might be the means of saving Abrahams's life - this was after I had seen Mr. Moore; I then stated to her what I had heard. When Durham crossed the way he said,</p>
               <p>"Hush, go in doors" - she said,</p>
               <p>"No, not till I have seen Abrahams;" she then said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Abrahams?" and he said,</p>
               <p>"In St. Clement's watch-house" - he said,</p>
               <p>"The fact is, we broke into a house in Norfolk-street, and there was a dog's head cut off." I saw Mr. Moore on the Wednesday following the day on which Abrahams was tried - I said nothing about this till after he was tried. Durham staid with us two or three minutes that day; I did not see him again before Abrahams was tried. I never told this story till I saw Mr. Moore. I did not then know that Durham was in custody for something else.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I saw no more of Durham till I saw him in the House of Correction. Mrs. Abrahams lodged in the same house with me. Mr. Moore came to me on the business - Mrs. Abrahams told me to be particular in telling the truth, because it would be an advantage to Abrahams.</p>

Durham went away with Abrahams after tea. Next morning I saw Mrs. Abrahams and Mrs. Vandevelde going down stairs, and Mrs. Abrahams was crying - I saw Durham at the door, but I did not hear him say a word - this was about half-past ten o'clock.

            . I came to town with him, in November; we lived at Mr. Chapples, No. 25, Great Earl-street, on the 28th of November; before that day, I had seen my husband drinking with Durham several times, at the Fox and Goose public-house - on the 28th of November, I dined in my own room - Mr. Shaw, my husband, Mrs. Vandevelde, and the prisoner, were of the party; the prisoner drank tea in Mrs. Vandevelde's room, with the same party, and the landlady - my husband left the house, it might be about half-past seven o'clock; but I am not certain - Durham wore a black coat, a black waistcoat, and black trowsers, which appeared particularly full; his clothes appeared rather worn - Durham and my husband went up stairs together; they came down, and I asked my husband for 1 s.; he gave me 6 d.; he said that was sufficient - Durham gave me 1 s.; they then went away together - I went on that evening to the Fox and Goose, and gave my husband there the latch-key of the door, while the watchman was going half-past ten o'clock; my husband was called out to speak to me; he did not return that night, and in the morning I went out with Mrs. Vandevelde, to go to look for him - Mr. Shaw was then in the house - when I got out, I saw Henry Durham, he appeared very pale - I went, and put my hand on his arm, and asked if he could tell me where Abrahams was; he said</p>
               <p>"Hush, go up stairs" - I told him I should not go in doors any more, till I had seen Abrahams; he said</p>
               <p>"Don't make a noise before people, come round here" - I asked him again where my husband was, and he said in St. Clement's watch-house - I said, on what charge; he said,</p>
               <p>"The fact is, we broke into a house, in Norfolk-street, in the Strand, last night, and he poor fellow has got taken, and I fear it will go hard with him - there was a little dog's head cut off" - I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, Mr. Abrahams never did that to it" - he said</p>
               <p>"No; I held it. while Lintott cut its throat" - he pulled up his sleeve, and showed me some of the stains of blood on his shirt - he said Abrahams was not in the house; he did not say on what part of the premises he was taken - Mrs. Vandevelde was in hearing, but she was rather behind, while he pulled up the cuff of his coat - she heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Look here" - but I do not know that she saw the cuff of his coat pulled up - I went to the Fox and Goose - I there fainted; Durham gave me a little brandy, and said</p>
               <p>"Don't fret - I will do every thing I can for Abrahams, and get Counsel" - he said, if I would go down to Bow-street directly, I should see him brought up from the watch-house, I went, and Mrs. Vendevelde with me - I made enquiries at the Office, and learned that a Jew, named Abrahams, was taken into custody - Durham had told me to come back and tell him how Abrahams got on with his examination, but when I came back, he was gone, and I did not see him again, till he was in custody - I do not when that was; it was after Abrahams was tried - I stated this conversation to Mr. Ford, at Bow-street - I was not in the Office, but outside the door - he was fully committed the first time - I did not say</p>
               <p>"Here is a woman, who will say that she heard a person say my husband was not in the house at all" I was present when my husband was tried here, but I was so agitated, that I could not give any information till now; after he had been in custody at Bow-street I gave this information to Mr. Welford, the solicitor - I had stated this several days before his trial - I went before a Justice, about a week after my husband<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130077"/>was tried; but I had given information before he was tried - I was married on the 23d or 24th of February, at Bath, in my mother's room; there was several persons of Mr. Abrahams persuasion there - I am not a Jewess, but I was married according to his religion.</p>

             re-examined. I know Cousins. I pointed out a room to him, on the 10th of December; Durham had slept there two or three nights; there are three beds in the room; there were some drawers in the room; I never opened those drawers, but Cousins did, with a key which I gave him; the key had been sent to me by a stranger, to get a shirt out of Durham's box; the drawers were opened in my presence - I had not seen Durham, after the day on which I went to Chelsea, till he was in custody; there were two keys in these drawers, which the officer called skeleton keys - I had not been in the habit of seeing them; there was no linen there. Cousins found some linen in a box, which was opened by a key I gave him - there was some shirts and stockings; the marks on the shirts, were</p>
               <p>"H. D." I do not think the stockings were marked at all - I saw Lintott at my house once or twice, while Durham was there Abrahams was at my house the day before he was apprehended - he was there when I went out to Chelsea, but I did not see him in the evening - I went about six o'clock in the evening, and returned about half-past nine - I did not hear of the robbery for two or three days afterwards. I have never said that I heard of it that night; the box which was opened, was Durham's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Durham had slept there for about a week before the 28th of November. A. Yes; Two strangers, who came from the country, of the name of Taylor, had slept in the room, and one man regularly slept there. I never gave Durham leave to put any thing in the drawers - his linen was in his own box.</p>

             re-examined. I went to Newman's house, and in the room I found a box, which I opened with one key out of a bunch of three which Newman gave me. There was a variety of linen shirts and stockings - they were not taken away that day, but the next. I found two keys in the drawer, which are large skeleton keys. On Friday, the 10th of December, I examined the box, and brought away the two keys, and four duplicates which were in the box, in the name of Preston. I afterwards went on Saturday morning to a house kept by Mr. Winwood, Blackhorse-court, Fleet-street, and there found a pair of stockings, and a shirt marked</p>
               <p>"H. D. No. 9." - the stockings are marked with ink</p>
               <p>"H. D." I went there in consequence of information, but I do not know of my own knowledge that they were Lintott's lodgings. Mrs. Winwood was there then. I was on the look-out for both the prisoners, but could not find them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was Abrahams apprehended? A. On Sunday night. He was taken to Bow-street on Monday, and tried on the Monday following. I did not know that the prisoners were in custody till the Wednesday after Abrahams was tried. I had been to Newman's on the Thursday or Friday before to look for them, but could not find them.</p>

               <p>DURHAM'S Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. After the very able manner in which my Counsel has conducted my cause. I can have little to say, and I hope the good feeling and candour of the Jury will excuse any appearance of feeling on my part, on my addressing such an assembly, and being placed in so awful a situation. I am aware I stand charged with a most serious crime, my life is at the issue of your determination. The evidence brought forward to substantiate the charge, I hope you will give your most mature consideration to. I am implicated according to this evidence with an individual now under sentence of death for the same offence, your judgment will dictate in what way this implication should be received; the wife of this unfortunate young man is the principal evidence adduced against me. I allow having met her on the morning after

             was taken into custody, when she informed me of his misfortune. I commiserated with her, and seeing her faint, I gave her the liquor in question, but I most solemnly declare that nothing else ever passed between us, and that I was not aware of the robbery till she herself informed me of it, is it likely if I had been concerned in the robbery that I should have informed women? (strangers to me, only having seen them once before;) would any person of common sense act as they stated I did? if I had been guilty, should I have placed my life in the hands of these women? No, God forbid! Then look, Gentlemen, as to the character of the woman she brings forward to corroborate her evidence, she makes no observation as you will recollect to facts Gentlemen, it is not from malicious motives on my part that I bring forward these facts, I do it most unwillingly, but my own life being at stake, I am in duty bound to lay them before you now, I am confident you cannot nor will not place any reliance upon the evidence of such persons, so utterly devoid of credit; upon this evidence my prosecution is rested, and any other observation from me would be but superfluous, as your judgments<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130078"/>will dictate in what way it should be received. Now Gentlemen, I wish to state that I never before was placed in a similar situation, and that I have an affectionate and respectable parent, (for unfortunately I have but one), waiting with breathless anxiety, the result of your decision. Parents, picture to yourselves the distress you would be in if one of your children was placed in a situation like me, no doubt you see the motives for my being placed here your own discernment will show you it is done by the friends of an individual now under sentence of death, with an intent of saving his life. I now await your decision with calmness, being confident a British Jury will never willingly find an innocent man guilty.</p>
               <p>LINTOTT'S Defence. I just wish to say, that I have been in custody six weeks, and I did not know that it was on this charge, till yesterday morning; therefore I cannot contradict it in the way I should wish.</p>
