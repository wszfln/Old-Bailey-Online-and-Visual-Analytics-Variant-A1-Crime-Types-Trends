                  </hi>. I live at 34, Chiddington Street, Parson's Green, and am a laboratory assistant at the Westminster Hospital—I first made the prisoner's acquaintance early in January, 1901, when he applied at the hospital for work—my chief, Dr. Barlow, gave him some drawings to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140004"/>
               <p>do—he represented himself to be an artist and engraver—he worked at the hospital on and off for several gentlemen at the hospital until May, when he told me that Messrs. Spalding &amp; Hodge had taken up an invention of his in copper plate printing in colours that they had set up twelve presses, or were going to do so that he was to have a salary of £500 a year and 10 per cent, commission on profits and that he was to have an assistant who he was to appoint himself at a salary of £5 a week—he asked me if I would take the post—at that time I was receiving 30s. a week at the hospital—I accepted his offer, and from that time he had various sums from me amounting in all to £14 10s.—the first sum I parted with was on Saturday evening, May 18th, 1901, when he came to my address at Chelsea—he said he had been to Spalding &amp; Hodge's that afternoon, and that Mr. Spalding had left a message for him to go to his private house at Leighton Buzzard and talk over the business, and he asked me for his fare—I let him have 15s.—on June 27th he asked me for some money for some clothes he was shabby at that time—he had £8 3s. 6d. from me for new clothes—I went with him to the clothes shops he said he wanted new clothes because he had to attend a meeting that evening that Spalding &amp; Hodge were about to form, to deal with his invention, and that it was detrimental to him that he should have to attend it without any clothes—on July 8th he asked for some more money I refused to give it to him until he gave me some proof that what he told me was true—he said he must have money—he did not say what he wanted it for—I let him have £2 10s., and he wrote out this document—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, and stated that he had on that day received from Mr. Chopping</hi> £2 10s. <hi rend="italic">as part payment of</hi> £6 6s. 2d. <hi rend="italic">which he had paid to the Lord Chamberlain's office that day in order to have the papers delivered to him (the prisoner) which were necessary for Chopping to enter his position tinder Government contract as a department director at the Small Arms Factory at Enfield, which papers he (the prisoner) promised to hand to Chopping, and to repay the</hi> £2 10s. <hi rend="italic">to-morrow morning, while he gave Chopping full power to verify all his communications</hi>)—he said they were going to establish a branch department at Enfield for his invention under Government—I am still at the hospital—he said that the director<lb/>ship would be a better position than I should get at Spalding &amp; Hodge's, and he would obtain it for me—that was a few days before he wrote the paper the money was not returned to me next day—shortly after that I went to Spalding &amp; Hodge's, and also to the War Office, and made inquiries—I saw the prisoner again, and told him he was a swindler I used rather strong language—I told him to strip off the clothes he was wearing, which were the ones he had bought with my money—he refused to do so at first, but I compelled him to—he did not deny my charge against him he did not say anything about it—I told him I had been to Spalding &amp; Hodge's, and found out that his stories were lies—that happened at the hospital within a few days of this docu<lb/>ment of July 8th—I did not see him again till 12 months afterwards at Putney—I had no more transactions with him—I may have spoken to him, because when I met him he was in the company of another man</p>

Spalding &amp; Hodge did not, at the beginning of 1901, take up an invention for copper plate printing in colours they could not do so as they are wholesale stationers and have nothing to do with printing—they never entertained any application for putting up twelve presses—one of the directors is Mr. Hodge in 1901 he had no country house at Leighton Buzzard.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Hardwick Road. Parson's Green, and am a traveller to George Wright &amp; Co., iron founders. Queen Victoria Street—about August, 1901, the prisoner called at my Queen Victoria Street address and said he wished to sell designs of tiles and other things which he had been getting out—I told him we could not buy any designs, as we were not wanting anything of the sort—he said he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140006"/>
               <p>sorry I could not do business with him, and that ho had not had a substantial meal for three or four days—I offered to take him out to lunch, as I was just going out myself—I took him to lunch and paid for it, and we parted—a few days afterwards he came again, and said he wished me to reconsider the matter of doing business with him, and asked me to see if I could not buy some of the things he wished to sell—I said I could not. but I gave him the names of one or two firms who I thought might be likely purchasers, and he went away again—he called upon me a third time, and said as I could not buy any of his designs perhaps I could help him to got a living he said he could do painting and various other things in the line, and perhaps I could give him something to do, to make an enlargement of a photograph or paint a picture—I said if 'he liked he could have my photograph to enlarge and I would pay him for what he did—I gave him the photograph, but he did not do it—he came a few days after and said he had not sufficient detail, and would I go to his address at Putney so that he could get further details—I went to his lodgings he pretended to make some sketches of me on a piece of paper—when he had finished I asked him to show it to me, but he would not—he left the room, and I turned up the corner of the paper and saw there was nothing upon it—I turned it back again and made no remark when he came in—this was sometime late in the summer—I stayed there for an hour and a half—later in the evening he introduced a Marconi wireless telegraph patent—he said he had been making some experiments and was able to bring out some improvements in connection with the wireless telegraph apparatus, and that he had some idea the Government would take it up, and possibly the Admiralty—he never enlarged the photograph which I gave him—he came to my business address again about a week later, and said he had not been successful in seeing some<lb/>body at the Admiralty, but that they had the matter under consideration; that he was very hard up, and would I let him have a small sum as a loan to help him—I said I could not let him have very much, but I would let him have a few shillings I lent him, I believe, 4s. or 5s.—I knew nothing of him except what he told me—on another day he told me that he had been to the Admiralty and had an interview with Sir John Durston, who I believe is the chief engineer to the Admiralty—he said that Sir John had still got the matter under consideration, and that Mr. Frederick Brown, who is secretary to the Controller of the Navy, was helping him to get it taken up—the prisoner did not say who Mr. Brown was, but he said he was at the Admiralty offices—I gave the prisoner 10s. or 12s. as a loan, and that ended the visit—he paid several visits—with various excuses, and a tale that he was carrying out this patent, and had got the Admiralty to take it up: he told me that in September or October he said the Admiralty had actually taken it up—he said they were going to put up a building for him to carry out the work at Enfield, and were going to give him the title of Colonel—he was to be paid £2,000 a year for his services, out of which he was to recompense me for the various loans he had had from me, and he said he would do so—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140007"/>
               <p>had a few loans after that—I was to have the repayments and a certain amount of interest—T had let him have £7 or £8 in small sums of 5s. or 10s. at a time—he said he had actually got the appointment—this is my note book, in which I have entered the amounts of the loans—I did not put any dates down—there are four items of El, two of 10s., one of £14s., and a number of smaller items—they are initialled by the prisoner—that was done at the end of the transactions—he had a reason for asking for every loan—he had several amounts to go to Enfield and buy his lunch there—another time he was going there with some of the repre<lb/>sentatives of the Admiralty, and he said he had not sufficient money to buy their lunch there and he had loans from me to make up the amount—he mentioned the names of the representatives, but I cannot remember them now—I went to the Admiralty on one occasion—I had my doubts about him the whole time, and I made enquiries—I let him have a small sum of money after that—I was to get £5 or £6 more than I lent him—I never actually knew what I should get he never made any actual statement—he did not go the Admiralty with me when I inquired there, but I went once with him to see Sir John Durston—when we got to the door he said he was allowed to go in, but I was not, so I stayed at the door while he went inside—after he had been inside about 15 minutes he came out and said that Sir John Durston was not there—before I made inquiries he told me he was going to some town in the West of England to test the apparatus on a Sunday afternoon with some members of the Admiralty by special train from Paddington—I did not believe what he told me, so I went to Paddington—when I went to the Admiralty by myself I saw Sir John Durston—I believe the next day I saw the prisoner I told him he was mistaken about whom he was dealing at the Admiralty, as I had seen Sir John Durston, and he knew nothing about him—the prisoner said I must have made &amp; mistake—I have seen Sir John Durston, the witness in this case he is the same person whom I saw at the Admiralty—I do not think I had any more to do with the prisoner after that—I parted with the money more from charitable purposes than anything else in the first place, and then hearing he was getting out a patent I thought it was well to let him have what money he asked for to a certain extent in order to get back what I had let him have at first—I had my doubts about what he told me of the Admiralty, but I thought he had something which would recompense him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 70, Winchester Road, Pimlico—I am at present out of employment—I was manager at the Fratton Hotel, Portsmouth—I made the acquaintance of the prisoner on June 1st. 1904, through talking to him in the public house—at the time my wife was unwell—the prisoner referred to the fact that my wife was not looking very well, and he subsequently told me he was an M.R.C.S.—I said my wife had not been feeling well for some time, and I had contemplated bringing her up to London and consulting a specialist to see if anything was the matter with her I said, "Do you know to what specialist you would recommend me to take Mrs. Badcoe?"—he prescribed for her as though he represented the doctor he had recommended—he mentioned several names, and finally said Dr. Marsham would be the best to see—he was not paid anything—he said while he was an M.R.C.S., according to the agreement entered into, he would not be allowed to take any fee because he was on another case down there he said he was assisting Dr. Cousins at an operation—he supplied her with some medicines, and obtained £1 16s. 3d. for them—this is his card—the prisoner did not do my wife any good or harm—he afterwards mentioned a periscope to me, of which this is a model (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he brought it to the hotel on Sunday, June 5th—the day before he brought it, he produced a letter which purported to come from Captain Bacon, of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Thames</hi>—he did not give it to me, but he showed it to me—I knew Captain Bacon to be the head of the submarine department—I read it it said that owing to some possible infringement of the patent, he could not deal with the matter, but recommended him to apply to the Secretary to the Admiralty—the prisoner explained the model to me, and seemed to be very pleased with the child of his inventive genius—he said it was a periscope for use with submarines, and that the Admiralty had agreed to give it a trial on the submarine boats—he also showed me what purported to be an Admiralty document, notifying the fact that this was an accepted invention—it was exactly like this document which is dated in August, apart from the date and name of the inventor—my name was on the one I saw, 'Badcoe's periscope, adapted by Dr. Markfeldt"—I have no knowledge of such things, but the prisoner said that, being a foreigner, the Government did not care for the invention to bear his name, and that he had been requested to get hold of an Englishman who would part with a certain amount of money to</p>

               <p>finance the thing and whose name could be used as the inventor, the prisoner's name being used as the adaptor—I was to get £250—I said, provided the Admiralty were disposed to take it up, I should be disposed to venture some money on it—after June 6th he called upon me to go with him. into the dockyard, and said he had had an interview with the Admiralty authorities, who had agreed to take the thing up and had decided upon a certain number of trials—in the first instance I was only expected to advance small sums for the purpose of having other and better models being made—the prisoner at Portsmouth mentioned Sir John Durston's name he said that he, in conjunction with Captain Bacon and Mr. Fielder, had to confer upon the thing, and were to deal with it as they thought fit, that they had agreed that it was a very good thing, and a trial should be given to it—he said an agreement would be drawn up by which I should be shown as ostensibly the inventor of the apparatus and he as the adaptor, and that we should be paid in the first instance £250, and much more money if the invention turned out to be of importance and the experiments progressed—I advanced £40 in Portsmouth—I came to London on July 8th—the prisoner told me I should have to give up my situation, because I should have to come to London, and in a very short time I should be sent to Enfield—I gave up my situation at his instigation and on his word of honour that the thing was in proper order and as he represented it to be—I have been out of employment ever since—he said works would be erected at Enfield for the turning out of this apparatus, and I should be employed there at a large salary, in conjunction with himself, to test the apparatus before they were sent out for use in the Navy—I met him in Whitehall, by appointment, on July 9th—he said he could not stay with me long as he had to go away on further trials in connection with the matter—he obtained £1 from me, which was supposed to be for the purpose of defraying his expenses in travelling—between that day and August—4th I paid him other sums amounting in all to another £40. which made £80 altogether—I have no other means—the balance of what I had saved I have parted with in London in order to live—I had my wife and child to keep while I have been looking for other employment—on July 20th the prisoner called at my house and I gave him £10 for further expenses in connection with this matter—he said that while conducting the trials on different ships, he was expected to mess with the officers on the ship, and he was therefore to have some distinctive dress, probably a uniform, because this matter had gone on from the periscope business to wireless telegraphy, and he wanted the money to buy the outfit I never saw him in his uniform—I believed what he said, as he represented himself to be a doctor, and as I found he was staying at Portsmouth at the place where he said he was—I believed these forms were genuine, or I should not have paid him any money—on August 4th I paid him £3, because he said he had to go to Liverpool for further trials, which would probably be the last he also asked me if I had a small bag I said I had not a small one, but if he was back within a few days he could have my Gladstone—he took it, and I have never seen him since—I believe he</p>

Back in his pocket—I served him with the liquor—before he put the coin down he said, "Halloa, where is Sarah this morning?"—I looked at him, and gave the coin to the other barmaid, Sinclair—she tried it in the tester and found it was bad—the prisoner had then turned his back to the counter—I said to him, "What do you call this?"—I had the coin in my hand, I took it from Sinclair—he said, "It is all right, I got it from the market"—I said, "What about Monday did you get that from the market when you came in for a ld. of rum?"—he said, "Well, we are all liable to be deceived at times"—I said, "Did you get the one you</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and am two years older than he is—I am a member of the Tottenham Fire Brigade and live at 10, Bromley Road—my mother and my married sister, Mrs. Copland, live with me—my sister had a child named Joseph Uric Cop<lb/>land—at the time of his death he was about four months old—my sister's husband is a petty officer in the Navy, and is away from time to time—he was away at this time—the prisoner suffers from paralysis on his left side from his head to his foot—he can walk about but he cannot do any hard work—he has power in his right side—he has been like that ever since he was a little boy—until recently he had work for a week or a month now and again, but towards the beginning of October he had been out of work for about nine months—I maintained him and kept the house—when he was in work he did not bring home his wages—he never earned enough to get his food and clothes—on Saturday, October 1st, I was at home with the prisoner—I said, "Why did you leave these books in the garden"—'hey were some old books which some friends had given him to sell for pocket money, and he had left them out in the garden from the Friday after<lb/>noon—he said he 'did not know it was going to rain—I told him he ought to have known better than to have left them out there, as he had had the opportunity to sell them on the Friday afternoon—I told him he did not seem to be trying to help us to look after him, or to help him<lb/>self in any way—I also said we had done everything to get him into a good Cripple's Home, provided he was willing to go, but he always objected—he said, "If I do go you will be glad to get me out of the way"—I-said, "No, we do not want to get you out of the way it is for your own benefit if anything happens to me, and there is nobody</p>

               <p>to keep the home, you will have to go into the Infirmary"—he said, You think you are everybody"—I told him to leave oft, and not to be so cheeky"—the same morning I was talking to my mother as I was having breakfast in the kitchen, and told her what had occurred—the prisoner was in the back room, and heard what I said to my mother—he kept on denying things, and I told him to leave off—I went into the back room, and told him if he was so cheeky he had better clear out at once—as I was going on duty I said, "You had better be out of the house by the time I come off duty in the morning"—I was on night duty that night: I came off on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was to have the benefit of the money derived from the sale of the books—my treatment of him has always been kind—I have provided him with a home when he wanted one—I think he worked for Ware &amp; Company for a few weeks—he left them because of the bankruptcy of the firm—he was at Feltham at work—I am not aware that he has worked at addressing envelopes he may have done so, but I am often not at home—I have heard my mother and sister talk of it—he worked at Dumblestone's for about nine months and on another job at a draper's, whose name I do not know—my brother-in-law had not been home for four months before this—besides being paralysed the prisoner's head lays over on his shoulder—he has had, I think, two operations to try and straighten his leg and his foot—I do not know that he has been suffering for some years from a discharge from his ear—I have always tried to do my best for him, and have always tried to convey that to him—when I said I would turn him out I did not mean it—I had often spoken harply to him before, and I probably should have come home on the Sun<lb/>day morning having forgotten all about it—when he was denying things to me he did not deny things I had not said—he has been reading a great deal of literature lately on hypnotism, and I handed to the police a lot of documents connected with hypnotism and mentalism—the prisoner must have sent to America, for them, because one arrived the day before yester<lb/>day—there is no truth in the suggestion that I was afraid that he was going to dominate the household by means of hypnotism—why I com<lb/>lained to him was because of his wasting his money—I never suggested or feared that I was going to become his prey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and divisional surgeon of police at 639, High Street, Tottenham—on October 2 I was-called to 10, Bromley Road, where I saw this child lying on its right side on the bed—it was comatose and in a dying condition—there were extraordinary marks of violence on the" left 'side of its head—I could feel that there was a depressed fracture of the skull—the case was absolutely hopeless—when I next saw the child, at 10.30 the same morning, it was dead—on October 4 I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was compression of the brain, due to the fracture of the skull—the head of this poker would cause the injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three or four blows—the fractures were very serious—the blows must have been very severe, what would be described as reckless violence—very little force would have killed the child—the skull was very thin—the child was only three months old—the skull of a child of that age would be very easily fractured—I have been in practice about 27 years—I do not know that I have had experience of cases where reckless violence was used—I have had considerable experi<lb/>ence of violence—disease of the ear might indicate some disease of the internal ear, but I do not think it would indicate a tumour on the brain.

About midday on Sunday, October 2nd, I went to 10, Bromley Road, Tottenham, where I saw the body of male child in the front room lying on a pillow—I saw a bruise on its forehead—that was the child that was seen by the doctors who have given evidence—on October 4 I had some information, and in consequence, I went to Kingston police station with another officer, where I found the prisoner detained—I told him who I was, and that he would be charged with the wilful murder of this little boy by striking him on the head with a poker—he said "Yes sir, good sir,"—I took him to the railway station to bring him up to town—while getting into the train he said "My mother, my brother, and brother-in-law have been trying to get rid of me because I am a cripple and have been out of work. I had a row with my brother on Saturday night, and it came to a climax, so on Sunday morning I got a brass poker and struck the child. on the head.—I brought him to London, and at Stoke Newington police station he was charged in the usual way—he said in reply, "Quite right, sir"—next morning, on the way to Tottenham Petty Sessions he said, "I am glad you have caught me, because I was hungry and every time I passed a policeman I thought he was going to get hold of me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the medical officer at his Majesty's prison at Brixton—t have had the prisoner under my observation since October 5th—during that time he has been in calm surroundings. which in many cases is proved to be a very material element, in cases where there is or might be disease of the mind—it is possible that insane persons who are put into an asylum may become apparently sane, but if they are released they may be in the same condition of mind again—that is what happens in certain cases—the prisoner told me he has had a discharge from his ear for two or three years—that is on the same side as the paralysis—he has hold me about the operations he has had—I do not know that he had had no discharge from his ear for about eight weeks before he came to the prison—he complained of a discharge about a fortnight after he came in, and there was one—if a sufficient amount of discharge accumulates it leads to irritation and pain—I heard his mother's description of the change in the prisoner's character at times that is one of the earliest symptoms of mental disturbance—I asked the prisoner about the incident of his having the books for the purpose of making a profit for himself out of them and of his leaving them in the garden he gave me a very plausible reason—he said the books had been given to him so that he might sell them for his own advantage he was told that at the end of the week he would have a further number given 'o him, and to save himself from going for them then he put them together, and that he put them in the garden as there was not much room in the house, and at the time the weather was dry, and that he only put them there for a short time till he procured the others—I do not know how many books there were.—the infantile paralysis which has affected him from his youth is sometimes associated with mental impairment—I have heard the history of his family I heard of his father's attempted suicide, and he said that he under<lb/>stood that his mother's brother had committed suicide through slackness of trade, but he said he was not positive about it—I have heard what his mother, brother, and sister said about his having a happy home, and of their being kind to him—he told me about his reading various books on hypnotism and mesmerism—I have seen them, they may be read by anybody—they are sold in London, and are very silly pamphlets—t con<lb/>sider he has a weak and unstable mind a very little would tilt some weak minds over to insanity some require a good deal—a very little irritation of the brain, or anything that contributed to upset the mental balance, would not tilt all weak minds over the border—I think that homicidal mania coming on in circumstances such as these is extremely rare—it is admitted in many of the books that it can do so—it has been stated that in homicidal mania you may have nothing but the criminal act</p>

               <p>itself to indicate that there was anything wrong with the brain, but I have no experience of it, the premonitory symptoms may have been overlooked—I cannot say that it is impossible that this act was committed by the prisoner when he was suffering from homicidal mania—I notice that the prisoner when he went to the police station said he had killed his brother-in-law's child, but I cannot admit that he had no grudge against his brother-in-law—I said in my report, "He is not at present insane"—I was speaking of this from my knowledge of him at the time—I did not in<lb/>tend to show that I anticipated that he might be insane at any moment—I could not certify him as insane cases frequently occur that a crime is committed and then people wonder why the man was not put away before—I know that the prisoner gave himself up that is not inconsistent with a person who has committed an act of homicidal mania, the impulse to do the act may be dormant for a long time and no one detect it—some people have inclinations which they keep under control—people may have delusions about a person who they had been previously fond of.</p>

Saturday morning brought things to a climax—while he was in prison he acted rationally, as far as I could see he was nervous and depressed—as far as I could form an opinion, he was not on October 2nd insane, and was conscious of the nature and quality of the things he did.</p>

               <p>inconvenience. I am not a money lender, but can doubtless be of service to you, as I have been in many cases, so. I might ask you if at any time you require money at 5 per cent, a year, to write me fully in confidence, or to send me a letter or telegram making an appointment, when I shall be happy to call upon you. E. Francis Rutter"—there was a judgment against me—I answered his letter and he called upon me about a week after—I told him I wanted some money for a syndicate that was started—he took the prospectus and said he would see what he could do—I next received this letter, on June 6th: "Dear Madam, I greatly regret I was under a misapprehension with regard to your busi<lb/>ness, and if I had not been away should have written to say so. If the business is still open, I shall be glad to hear from you. Yours faithfully, E Francis Rutter"—he called on me, and I told him about the money that a Captain Blanford wanted—I did not want any for myself then—I told him that Captain Blanford had £500 a year, that he was stationed at Woolwich, and was a tenant of mine—he said he had a friend who was not a money lender, but who would lend the money—an appointment was made for June 29th, and he called about 6.45 p.m. with his friend, who I believe was. Bower, but I am not quite sure—Captain Blanford was present—Rutter introduced his friend as "Mr. Jackson"—Bower asked me to leave the room,. as he thought the business was better arranged between men, without ladies being present—I did so, but came back in a few minutes—I heard Rutter say his friend would lend the Captain £400 on a bill for £500, and Captain Blanford was to increase his life policy at the Life Associa<lb/>tion of Scotland Office—Butter asked Captain Blanford to meet him at 10 or 10.30, I am not "sure which, at the office in King William Street nest-morning, but the meeting was ultimately fixed for 3—the prisoners left us, but Rutter came back and said "to Captain Blanford "Will you come out, I want to speak to you alone"—he went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Captain in the Royal Artillery stationed at Woolwich—in June I was desirous of raising a loan in con<lb/>junction with Mrs. Fredericks—on hearing from her, I called on her on June 29th—the prisoners came shortly afterwards—they were strangers to me—Mrs. Fredericks introduced the subject of the loan—she knew Rutter—his name was mentioned to me—he introduced Bower to me as "Mr. Jackson "and as being able to lend money—Bower said he objected to lend money to a lady and I was asked would I take it in my name—I may have said &amp; 007c this myself, I cannot say—Bower asked me what security I had—I told them what my income was and that I had a life policy for £300 in the Life Association of Scotland—Bower asked me about my bank and I said Messrs. Cos &amp; Co., Charing Cross—he said he also had a small banking account there—I told him I thought I had between £35 and £40 there and that there was a promissory note of £100 outstanding, which I owed Messrs. Cox—Bower said he was willing to lend £500 provided I increased my life policy to £600 and we were to meet the following day at the Life Association of Scotland Office—he also asked me if I belonged to the Service Clubs—I told him I did to the United Service—Mrs. Fredericks said she wanted £30 urgently—Bower said he was unable to advance the money that night—they left shortly after—Rutter came back ten minutes after and said Mr. Jackson wishes to speak to you outside I think he can arrange to let you have the money this evening, the £30"—I went down into the street—on the way down Rutter said, "If you can let Jackson have a cheque for £50 he can arrange that you can draw another cheque for £30 on your bank for Mrs. Fredericks, the money to be paid in the first thing next morning," meaning the money to meet these cheques of £30 and £50—Isaw Jackson outside, and we talked the matter over again—I said to both prisoners that I could not give them a cheque for £50, as I had not got the amount in the bank—Jackson said, "Oh, it does not matter, I shall not present the cheque till the amount is paid in to your credit to meet it"—he asked me how much I wanted paid in—I think I said £115—that was to be part of the £500 loan—we then went to a public house near by for the purpose of drawing the cheque for £50—Bower obtained a sheet of note paper and I wrote out this cheque in favour of Rutter—while writing it I asked Jackson what his initials were—Rutter interposed and said, "Oh, make out the cheque in my name, as I am carrying through this business for you"—upon that I wrote, out the cheque and gave it to Rutter—we then parted—I gave no one authority to go to my club and get the cheque cashed—it was presented, I understand, the same evening at my club, and next day was paid into my bank—I went the next day at 3 o'clock to the Insurance Company's office and waited for an hour—the prisoners did not come—I then wrote to my bank telling them what had happened as to the £50 and the £30—I had drawn a cheque for £30 and handed it to Mrs. Fredericks—I tried to stop both cheques—I wrote to Rutter, but received no answer—I was induced to part with the cheque thinking that Rutter was known to Mrs. Frederick and that "Jackson" was able</p>

Bower was slightly deaf, and I think more than one of my questions had to be repeated, but I do not think there was the slightest misunderstanding—it is not the fact that Bower said he would have nothing to do with raising the loan—Jackson sug-gested the increase of the life policy I will swear it was not Butter—I would not be certain who suggested the bill for £500 it may have been Rutter—I said there would be great difficulty in my meeting it at maturity, but I did not say I could not do so—Bower did not on that say he could have nothing to do with the affair—I thought Bower was going to advance the money—I made the cheque out to Rutter because he at the time said he was carrying through the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief waiter at the Senior United Service Club, Pall Mall—Captain Blanford is a member—I was there on June. 29th when Rutter brought me a cheque about 10.15 p.m.—he said, "I have paid a bill for Captain Blanford, could you let me have some money on this cheque"—I said I could not cash it, but could let him have £10 and the balance the following day—I knew the Captain's signature—it is the rule of the Club not to give more than £10 at once—I gave him £10 and took the cheque—I then believed he had come from Captain Blanford, and that he had paid a bill for him—the cheque was passed through the Club's bank next morning—it was honored in the ordinary course—in the afternoon of the following day a messenger boy came from Rutter for the balance of the cheque—I said I could not give it to the boy, as I wanted to see the man personally—Rutter came just after, and he received the £40.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreign bookseller of 9, Holborn Viaduct, E.C.—about 3 p.m., on October 10th, the prisoner came into my shop—he had been looking round for about half an hour when I missed a parcel of post cards which I had placed in a special place, as I wanted it at the end of the day—I went to the other end of the shop, and on my returning found that the parcel of cards had gone—I waited another two minutes and the prisoner handed me four cards, for which he wanted to pay—I asked him if he had any other post cards, and he said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure?" and he said, "Yes, certainly"—I caught hold of him and said, "Now give me what you have stolen," and he picked out. this big bundle of post cards (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from under-his coat—whether he took it from under his arm or from his inside pocket I cannot say—I asked him if he had any more, and he pulled these actresses' post cards (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) out of a pocket of his coat—the total value of the post cards is £1 2s. 6d.—I said, "Have you got anything else," and he looked through his pockets, but found nothing more of mine—I sent my boy for a policeman, and on his arrival I gave the prisoner in charge, saying, "This man has robbed me of these post cards, and I want to give him in charge"—the prisoner said, "You <hi rend="italic">mischarge</hi> me," and something else in French.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2. Burn Street, and am foreman at the Salvation Army Shelter in Burn Street—on Saturday, November 5th, about 6 p.m., the prisoner came in—he was disorderly—I cautioned him—he had a disturbance with an old man—I put him out, and ordered that he should not be let in in the future—I went out, and he followed me and said he would put my sight out—he would not go away—I went into Burn Street to see if I could see a policeman—I saw one, and told him there was a man who was using bad language and threatening me—he went into Lisson Street—I went to open the door to see if the policeman was there, and the prisoner tried to get in again—I put him out again—presently. I opened the door again to see if the policeman had come back—the prisoner was there, and he threw some liquid in my face and burned me very much—I saw that the prisoner had a bottle in his hand—the throwing was done two or three times—just after the prisoner had thrown the stuff at me the policeman came up—the prisoner was slightly under the influence of drink, but he knew what he was doing—I have been since then under the care of Mr. Lovell at the Western District Dispensary.</p>

I was called to the Salvation Army Shelter about 6 p.m. on November 5th—it is near Lisson Grove—I saw the prisoner trying to push the door open to get into the shelter—just as I arrived, the door was opened and the prisoner walked away when he saw me—just afterwards the prosecutor came out and said "That man has thrown something over me," and gave him into custody—I went after him and arrested him—me said "I have thrown nothing in his face"—on the way to the station he took this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from his pocket and dropped it as we walked along—it is not quite empty now—I picked it up—at the station he said "I am sorry it did not go in his eyes—he said he had been carrying it about for a constable who had taken him into custody a short time previous for begging—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am house Surgeon at the Western General Dispen<lb/>sary, Marylebone Road—on November 5th about 6.15 p.m. I attended to the prosecutor—he was suffering from burno on his face, which I thought were produced by some corrosive acid—there were brown acid stains on the front of his coat and on his waistcoat, and yellow stains on both hands—when I first saw him I did not think the burns would be permanent, but now there is a considerable amount of fluffing, especially on the upper lip and nose—I think there will be some permanent mark on his nose—I have seen this bottle—it contains strong fuming nitric acid—the burns on the prisoner would be caused by an acid.</p>

I live at 2, Pembroke Street, and am an engine driver on the Great Northern Railway—on October 19th I was driving the 5.53 p.m. passenger train from King's Cross to Enfield—the train runs from Wood Green to Enfield without a stop—there was a thick fog—passing under Compton Road Bridge my engine bumped against something heavy—the milk churn in Court would have produced the noise I heard—it might have derailed the engine, but the engine cut through it—we were going 40 to 45 miles an hour—I examined the engine at Enfield, and found no harm done—I gave information, and a wire was sent to Winchmore Hill.</p>

I am a cook-housekeeper in a situation at Belsize Park—lam a single woman—in March, 1901, I was a out of a situation and saw an advertisement in a German newspaper—I answered it and received this letter, dated March 4th, 1901—I replied to it and received a further letter—they were both signed "A. Luders"—the lust one made an appointment—I kept it and met the prisoner—ho told me his real name was Dumont—that he would like to get acquainted with a German lady and get married and live in his own home, and that he had a large business at Gresham Street, City, which was worth £1,000—he said he was a bachelor—he asked me about my position and asked me if I had saved any money—I said, "Yes, I have been cook-house—keeper for many years, and I have saved so much money, about £159"—I told him that I wanted to give up service and take a boarding, house—he said that would be very nice, and that he was a steady business man—he asked me where my money was, and I said I had £100 in Hamburg and some in the post office in London—he said it was very wrong to have my money in Germany, and advised me to write at once and get it as soon as possible as it was no use looking for a boarding house till I had the money—we went and had some tea, and on the way passed his business place—he pointed out that he had only the name of "Albert" up, as English people do not care to go to foreign names—it was the top floor of the house—I wrote the same evening to Germany for my money—before it arrived he said to me, "I am not able to pay my men, I must have some money, let me have some of your money"—I said, "No, I cannot give you any money. I want it for my boarding-house"—he pressed me several times—on, I think, March 19th, 1901, I drew out of the post office £12, and on the 25th £20, and I gave him £26—he said he wanted me to take a situation for two or three months, and then to be married—when my money arrived from Germany I gave him £50—I think that was on April 16th—he next told me, "Well, I know a customer of mine who comes every day to</p>

I have known stamps for many years, I know the value of them I should not think of buying stamps not knowing the value of them"—he told me he had looked every one through—he said they were very valuable, and worth more than £50, so I agreed to give him the money for them—I truly believed every word he said—an appointment was made—this was in May—I went to the Gresham Street shop about S.30 p.m.—the prisoner was there—he said, "We expect the gentleman with the stamps"—we waited—instead of a gentleman a woman came in—she said, "Good evening you are Mr. Dumont?"—lie said, "Yes"—she said, "My husband cannot come and bring the stamps"—they appeared 'to me to know one another—she produced the stamps and he counted them over in bundles—she said to me. "These stamps are worth much more we should like to take them back when we have got the money to spare"—the prisoner heard her say that—I had given the prisoner the money before the woman came in—he handed it to her—she then went away with the money—I said to the prisoner, "You had better take the stamps home"—he said. "I have not a proper place to put them in keep them for me, put them in your box and lock them up don't show them to anybody"—he did not say why I was not to show them to anybody—these are the stamps—some are. tied up in little packets, with "100" marked on them, written by the prisoner—he had more money from me till I had nothing left—he then advised me to go for six months in a situation, and wanted to marry me in—the spring—I took another situation near Reading, as cook-housekeeper—in September the prisoner called upon me while I was at Reading—I returned from—. there the end of March, 1902—he asked me to meet him at his business place—I did so—he told me that he had lost his business and he was penniless, so that he was not able to marry then, and I was to wait another two years—I did not then know that he had been married in November—when "I saw him in September he did not tell me that he was going to be married in November—I asked him for his address, and he said he only lived in apartments and could not give me his address—I found it out 100, Priory Park Road, Kilburn, and went there, I think, in June. 1902—a woman opened the door—she was the same woman who had brought the stamps into the shop in Gresham Street—I instructed a</p>

Fcnchureh Street, and from others the name has been stamped out they were all bent double—Harold, on reaching the shop of Miles, a marine store dealer, took the sack. in which the metal was contained, from the barrow, took it into the shop. and put it on the weighing machine—he then came out and they both hurriedly went away with the barrow—it seemed to me suspicious, so I went and spoke to the shopkeeper, and from what he told me I and the other officer continued watching the shop—just before 9 a.m.</p>

Jaint in the middle—I said to them, "What noise was that over there and they all said, "We have not heard any noise"—I said, "There is someone knocking over there let us go back and see what is up"—they said, "Why should we go back? we have done nothing"—Jaint said, "I have done nothing there is nothing on me"—I caught hold of Jaint and Joynes, and told Smith to come back with me, saying, "If you have done nothing, what is the harm in coming back."—we went as far as Ross's at 31, Cockspur Street, where I noticed that a portion of the wire covering which protects the window was pulled away, and a hole nine inches in diameter in the window—I said to the prisoners, "What about this?" and they said, "We know nothing about it at all"—I said, "Well, you are the only ones that are here, and someone has got to know something about it," and I took them all into custody—I blew my whistle, and another constable came up and took hold of Smith, whom he took to the station, I taking Jaint and Joynes—on the way I put my hand into Jaint's pocket and found nothing, but on putting my hand into Joynes' pocket I found, a stand and eight pairs of spectacles (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on Smith were found a stand and nine pairs of spectacles—on their being charged Smith and Joynes made no reply, but Jaint said, "I know nothing about it he met me in the road, and asked me to go back I do not know what he is charging me for"—I then went back to Ross's premises, where I found in the window this stone, which evidently had been used for breaking it (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I rang up the caretaker—at the time of the robbery there were no people about except the prisoners.</p>

Pain, commission up to date, £09"—I next saw him at the Rutland Hotel, Hammersmith—only my partner, myself and the prisoner were present—after wishing me "Good morning" the prisoner said he was in trouble—I asked him what he was in trouble about—he saidit was in connection with the money paid for the horses—I said, "You have either got the money or the horses have you got the horses ("—he sand, "No"—I said, Well, where-is the money for them?" and he saidhe had lost it and gambled it—I suggested that the statement which he had made out and given to my partner was a fabrication from beginning to end, which he admitted—I said, "What have you done with the money? you know the statement you have given to Bigglestone is entirely false or something to that effect, and I said, "Well, where is the money for the horses"—he replied that he had lost it and gambled it—I said, "Have not you got anything for it?"—he saidthere was a pony and trap which belonged to us—my partner or I said, Is that all there is for £500?"—he sand.

Keil &amp; Co." for these goods—the hearing was on June 2nd, before the Registrar—when the name A. Keil" was called, Arthur Keil, the son, came forward; I said, "He is not the man, I sued his father"; he sand, "My father is not interested in the business"—the Registrar adjourned the summons for the attendance of-Adam Keil—the. week after, when Adam came, I said Adam was the man I had the transaction with, and he denied it—Arthur and all the other Keils denied it one after the other—the Registrar gave judgment for me—I heard that an application was made for a new trial before the Judge; the next thing was a policeman brought me a summons—when I got to the police court I heard Arthur Keil swear. "On March 3rd my father was in bed, he had been in bed three weeks"—I saw the father on March 3rd in my shop—Arthur swore, "The goods delivered to our shop were for Robert Wilson"—I say they were delivered for and to Adam Keil, and that Adam Keil was present—Arthur swore that Adam had nothing to do with it, and that he paid "7s. 6d. on account of Wilson—I have never sold any goods to Robert Wilson—Arthur swore that I-called and spoke to Wilson several times after these goods were delivered—I paid no visits to Keils place for money for goods supplied to Wilson—I cannot say if I spoke to Wilson, because he or Arthur, or one of the sons, was always in front—I spoke to anybody who was there—Arthur swore: "Selkolsky did not offer to take the money by install<lb/>ments"; I say I did—I was willing to take 1s. a week, or anything—I never called for orders after March 3rd; the Keils wanted to give an order, but I said, "No, I cannot take it"—my practice, when I delivered goods which were not paid for, was to make an entry in this little book</p>

"They were walking up and down in front of my house, I might have seen them two or three times "I meant on one evening—Miss Farmer's shop is open on Sundays, the placards are outside on Sundays—I only saw the prisoners on my side of the road—my public house stands at the corner of Old Church Road, and the next street to that is Grosvenor Street—I know now that Wade lives in Grosvenor Street, but I did not know it then—I did not know that Donovan lived in Old Church Road—I have no idea how many yards it is from the Royal Duchess to the corner of Grosvenor Street.</p>

I live at 5, Apsley Street, Stepney, and am employed by Hubert Raggett, wholesale newsagent, of Turners Road—I have been in the habit of delivering the morning papers at 478, Commercial Road, when Miss Farmer had it—I usually got there at 5 45 a.m.—on October 12 I left Raggetts at 5.30 or 5.35—I had to deliver some papers at a newsvendors named Hart, at the corner of Stepney Causeway, then I went to Miss Farmers—I got there at 5.45—I always delivered the papers to Miss Farmer herself—when I arrived there on October 12 the door was shut—I knocked on the panel—I waited from 5.45 to 5.5G—when Miss Farmer opened the door she had a skirt on and a blouse, and a small square shawl folded into three corners tied round her head, with a knot underneath her chin—I delivered the papers—I did not see anybody else—I then went down Stepney Causeway—there are two doors; one was left open—the papers are delivered flat, tied by a string down the middle, and a set of contents bills on top—this bundle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the exact way they were tied that morning—when I left the shop it was not quite 6.57—the deceased seldom kept me waiting—I can. fix the time because I see the clock opposite.

There was the distance of about a shop between us—they are split doors to Miss Farmers shop, and the prisoners came through the half door away from me—the door was pushed out from inside, by whom I could not see—I was standing like this when I saw them coming out, my head turned, and my body half turned—I could see them as well as if my whole body had. been turned in their direction—I knew that Miss Farmer lived there, but I did not know she lived alone—throe was no particular reason for my turning my head—the fact of these two men coming out struck me, and that is why I watched to see what they did—I did not know their names, but I recognised them as men I had seen before—during the whole of the time that I kept them in sight I had no doubt that they were the men I had seen coming out of the shop, and whom I had previously known by sight.</p>

I am a carman of 19, Old Church Road—on the morning of October 12th, not having been able to sleep the night before, I got up at 6.33 a.m. and walked to the top of Old Church Road where it joins Commercial Road—I there saw Robert Rae, whom I know, standing opposite the Royal Duchess—we had a conversation—I noticed the door of Miss Farmers shop open and Wiggins come out and undid the bolt of the shutter—this happened at 0.57 a.m.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 480. Commercial Road, which is next door to where Miss Farmer lived—I knew her for about eight years, and was on friendly terms with her—she generally was in <hi rend="italic">dishabille</hi> in the morn<lb/>ing; and in the afternoon she would change her dress—in the afternoon and evening by way of ornaments she would wear three rings, a gold chain round her neck, and a gold-ringed <hi rend="italic">pince-nez</hi> with a thin gold chain attached—sometimes on Sunday she would wear a pebble bracelet and a jet bracelet—the only occasion before October 12th that I ever went into her parlour was when she had a fit and I went in to give her assistance—I had a chat with her in the evening of October 11th at her shop door—she was wearing all her ornaments then—the next morning at 7.55 a.m. I saw Mr. Green, and in consequence of what he said I went into Miss Farmers shop—while standing there a policeman came, and accompanied by him I went into the parlour, and then up to Miss Farmers bedroom followed by Wiggins—the door was wide open, and I saw Miss Farmer lying at the foot of the bed with her face downwards, and her hands tied behind her back—I and the constable put the body into a proper position on the bed, and the constable removed a piece of cloth like this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) which was tied round her mouth and chin once, and was fastened at the back—I believed that it covered her mouth—on that being removed, I noticed a small piece of cloth hanging out of her mouth, and the constable removed a piece of cloth like this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from her mouth—she was dressed in her morning style, with no shawl round her head—I undid the front of her clothes at the top, and found she had her stays on, which I undid—I then placed my hand on her heart, which felt as if it were faintly beating—it seemed to last for a minute or two, and then it stopped—I was trembling at the time—beyond this beating of the heart I noticed no other sign of life; there was no sign of breathing or attempting to breathe—the mouth was wide open, and when the cloth was removed from it, I noticed that her tongue was swollen and far back in her mouth—I did not notice any injury to her tongue as I did not look any more—one of the first things the policeman did was to cut the string from her wrists—within a few minutes Dr. Grant arrived, followed after two or three minutes by Dr. Richardson—I then left the room—about an hour later I picked up this half of a steel <hi rend="italic">pince-nez</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), nearly at the top of the staircase, which I gave to the police—I noticed when we first went into the bedroom that it was in great disorder, the drawers of the chest of drawers being on the ground, with their contents strewn all over the room—I saw the top part of apparently a whole set of false teeth on the floor of the shop near the flap of the counter when I first went in—I also saw a high-backed shoe on the floor.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The sign of confusion in the shop was that the papers were not land regularly, as Miss Farmer always had them land, and the sign of confusion in the parlour was that the cigarette boxes were on the floor—I saw nothing of a soda water bottle or a tumbler in either the shop or in the parlour, neither was my attention called to them—I held up the deceaseds hands when the constable cut the string—it was after I put her in an easy position that I put my hand on her heart.</p>

               <p>everything must have been done in a great hurry—nobody seemed to have gone beyond the first floor, as there were signs of dust on the banisters—I had a motive for looking for finger-prints—in the parlour there were a few little tin boxes or canisters which had been turned over—the curtain at the entrance to the shop from the parlour, was practically torn away—I saw Miss Baker pick up a broken piece of <hi rend="italic">pince nez</hi> on the third stair from the top landing to Miss Farmers room, which she handed to me—I found this banister in a corner of the stairs with a little bit broken of (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I did not find a coin of any description, nor any jewellery, nor any metal of any value on the premises—I saw the lady's shoe and the set of artificial teeth immediately on entering the shop lying on the counter close by the flap—Mr. Edgar Farmer found the shoe corresponding to the one I saw on the counter—I. found in a cupboard just by the fireplace some bread, sugar, tea, cheese, and an uncooked egg; no preparations had been made for breakfast—I have consulted the almanac and have found the sun rose on the morning of October 12th at 6.20 a.m.—on October 10th, with Sergeant Wensley, I went to 83. Grosvenor Street, where I saw Wade—I said to him, "I am a police inspector, and I am going to take you into custody on suspicion of being concerned with another man not in custody for the wilful murder of Miss Farmer between 6 and 8 a.m. on the 12th inst. at 478, Commercial Road—he saidsomething and I left him in charge of Wensley—he turned very pale and trembled—at 8.30 a.m. I went with Wensley to 17, Church Row Limehouse, nearly a mile away—on entering the firs! floor back room I saw Donovan in bed with a woman—I said to him "I am a police inspector; get up and dress; I will take you to Arbour Square Police Station"—he was taken there and placed in the library—I said "I have brought you here on suspicion of being concerned with Wade, detained for the wilful murder of Miss Farmer between 6 and 8 a.m. on the 12th inst."—he said"You have done a b——fine thing this time. I will do my utmost to disprove it. This is a nice b——thing ain't it?"—I got the assistance of twelve men as near the description of the prisoners as I could, some a little more respectable than they, some a little less so—I told them to stand in a line in a yard at the police station out of the view of the public—the two prisoners were in two separate rooms in charge of officers nothing to do with the case—the witnesses were placed in charge of uniformed officers, who also had nothing to do with the case, out of view of the prisoners—I had the prisoners brought separately into the yard, and in the presence of the twelve men I said to each of them, "You see those men. You are going to be put up for identification. You can place yourself wherever you like"—they chose their positions and on my asking them if they were satisfied they both replied "Yes"—, then I sent an independent officer for the wit<lb/>nesses, who were brought out separately—I said to each of the witnesses as they came out, "If you see a man or men whom you have come to identify touch him or them.

I examined the body, and found it was dead and slightly stiffened as far as the limbs were concerned, which were partially flexed. and the body itself was partially flexed at the hips; her eyes had lost their trans<lb/>parency and tension; her chest felt colder than one would expect if she were alive and was losing temperature—the body was fully dressed, with the exception of the feet, which had no boots or shoes on—the hands were swollen and marked very distinctly with a ligature, of a red colour turning to blue—I made a cursory examination of the mouth, which was open, and I could see the tongue was bent back; there was blood underneath it, and only the lower denture was in position; the lips were abraded, and also the surface of the chin, which indicated that force had been used to open the mouth—two pieces of cloth and two pieces of string were handed to me by the policemen for me to examine—the face was congested—there was an exudation of the secretion of the nose, which was not very noticeable, forced out, in my opinion, by the efforts to breathe—either of these pieces of string might have caused the ligatures on her hands—(<hi rend="italic">Exhibits B and C Produced</hi>)—I formed the erroneous opinion at the time that she had been dead within half an hour, but on maturer consideration of the facts, and on looking up the authorities, I was reluctantly compelled to alter that opinion; I think she had been dead then over half an hour but I would not like to say how much over—on the same day, at p.m., I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, assisted by Dr. Anderson, and I have my notes here—I found the cause of death to be asphyxia by mechanical obstruction of the air passages, which opinion I arrived at by unmistakable signs—the further sign of injury was a bruise on the external aspect of the left thumb—she also had a rupture on the right side, which has no bearing on this case—I examined the cloth that was tied round her neck, and found nothing on it—on examining the gag I found blood upon it but not in any quantity, and such would have been produced by the tear under the tongue—there was no sign of blood anywhere else on the body—I came to the conclusion that asphyxia was caused by this gag (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and all the external and internal appearances corroborated that—I cannot say decisively how long after the insertion of the gag death ensued, because I do not know whether the gag was effective in obstructing the entire air passage or not; if air passed the gag she would live in direct proportion to the amount of air that passed—I did not see the gag in her mouth—the turning back of the tongue indicates that considerable violence was used, and it also formed an additional obstruction to breathing—it indicated that the gag had caught under the tongue—assuming complete obstruction had taken place I should think that she died in four or five minutes—turning her on her face would undoubtedly accelerate her death—I examined the stomach, and found it empty, as though nothing had been taken in the morning—I do not think she could have been living when Miss Baker and the police-man</p>

               <p>Street—on October 12th I was culled to Miss Farmers; I reached there about two minutes after Dr. Grant—I went upstairs into the bedroom and saw Hooper and Dr. Grant—I agree with the description of injuries upon Miss Farmers body as described by Dr. Grant, who directed my attention to the eyes, which were dim, and there was a loss of trans<lb/>parency about them—I thought the deceased had been dead for a couple of hours, from the cooling of the body and the ligature marks round the wrist, which were very marked, being of a dark blue colour with no surrounding area of redness or inflammation; discolouration of a ligature mark depends upon the circulation of the blood, and when the circulation stops there is an alteration in colour, and this particular alteration I concluded could not have been produced under a couple of hours—I have read in text books that the eyes after asphyxia become very brilliant, but I should be surprised to find it was the truth—taking into consideration the age of the person, and the size of the gag, I do not see how she could have lived more than five minutes after it had been inserted—of course, she might have survived longer if the gag had been less effectually placed—the fact of her being placed upon her face would have accelerated death—she would have been likely to have died in that position.—<hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> rigidity had not set in—I think if twenty people had felt Miss Farmers heart, even when alive, she being a short, fat woman, they could not feel the beating with a great breast covering it, and I am sun; that Miss Baker and the policeman were mistaken in saying that they felt the heart beating—Miss Baker is a neurotic person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hooper may be neurotic for all I know—the deceased's hands were swollen, but there was no sign of inflammation on her wrists—I was asked by the Magistrate, not knowing the facts of the case, how long should I say she had been dead, and I said three hours—I did not form any definite opinion, when I first saw the body, as to how long she had been dead, but I formed the opinion that nobody could say exactly—I thought it was an important matter—it is true that I said before, that it is very difficult to decide the exact moment when death took place, from the appearance of the body—it might happen in many cases that for a few minutes before death the power of exercising the muscles would go, but you do see people with" muscular power right up to the last—I should say, where there had been violence, and exhaust<lb/>tion takes place, there would be very little muscular action, a twitching only—it is a fact that the heart will continue beating after respiration has ceased, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, so it would be impossible to judge the moment—of death by the stopping of the heart or the stopping of the respiration alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I practice at 13, Wimpole Street—I am an F.R.C.S. and I have many other qualifications—I have heard the, evidence in this case so far us part of it is concerned, and I have read the whole of the evidence—I was examined as a witness before the Magistrate—I have formed the opinion that Miss Farmer had been dead over an hour when Dr. Grant arrived—my grounds are, in the first place as to the temperature of the body which was spoken to by Dr. Grant; the front of the chest was cool—the death was clearly from suffocation, which is one of the causes of slow cooling of a body—it was in a room, as I understand from Inspector Divall's evidence at the Police Court, where the windows were closed and had not been opened—that was the room in which the woman, had slept the night, so it would be comparatively warm, which would tend to prevent the cooling of the body—Dr. Grant deposed that the eyeballs had lost their tension—in death from asphixia<lb/>tion the eyeballs as a rule arc prominent and the flaccidity comes on slowly—I do not lay much stress on the transparency, the tension is more important—it takes time for the tension to alter in cases of suffocation—I do not place much stress on the dark blue colour, round the place where the ligatures had been on the wrist—I think that would form very quickly after death—I think death ensued within ten minutes of these injuries being received—I saw the rag which was taken from the deceased's mouth, the greater part of which the constable said was impacted into her throats—there was only a small piece" out of her mouth—the bulk of it would be quite sufficient to completely block the throat, and there was something else placed over the mouth, which, might easily slip off when the body was moved—I understand that the body was found on its face, and the head hanging over the end of the bed—the tongue was doubled back in the mouth, according to the constable and there was a quantity of frothy mucus which was the result of the suffocation, and was also the cause of it—the suffocation would be very complete—those are the leading indications upon which I base my opinion—the deceased's knees may have been drawn up by herself in a dying effort on her part, or it is possible that the body was placed in that position—whoever placed it there would probably not try to get the knees straight, but even if they did. they may not have succeeded—I cannot say one wav or the other—I think</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140108"/>
               <p>that if the deceased, when she was on her stomach with her face on the pillow, had moved her knees forward and got them into that position it would have meant some considerable muscular exertion, as she would have to raise her whole body, and I think it would be more likely if she could have done that, that she would have got on her side, but it is impossible to say—I feel quite certain that Miss Baker and Hooper did not feel the beating of the deceased's heart—I believe Miss Baker said she ceased to feel the beat after about a minute and a half, that being so, it is quite certain the woman was nearly dead—under the circumstances I feel quite certain she would not be able to feel the beat—in the first place she said the body showed no other signs of life, and it would be extremely difficult for a medical man to feel the heart—it does continue to beat, but you cannot feel it—you have to listen to it with a stethoscope, it is so feeble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I form my opinion assuming that the evidence of Dr. Grant and Dr. Anderson is correct—I have not seen the body, and can only form my opinion from the evidence—I do not lay much stress upon the colour surrounding the place where the ligatures were—I consider Taylor an authority; he says that in some cases of asphyxiation a body has been observed to cool as rapidly as in death from other causes, and that is so; there is no fixed rule—the surrounding circumstances would have something to do with the cooling of the body—the evidence refers to the cooling of the front of the chest; that was the only part apparently which was observed—if anything important turns upon the temperature of a body, a themometer would be more accurate, but it is not usually used—it would, of course, give an absolute register—if I had been present at the inquest I should have considered the question of the tension of the eye if it had been present to my mind—I should have had a written note, and should have referred to it—it is extremely difficult to place the time of the death; I should say it had taken place certainly over an hour, perhaps two hours—I cannot say nearer than that—at the time of death the <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> would be prominent; the eyes of a dead person are generally staring; they were in this case—I should say that death had certainly taken place within 10 minutes of the violence; there might be some difference if there had been some little opportunity for air to pass to the lungs, but from the time that cloth was fixed at the back of the throat I am quite sure she would be dead in 10 minutes; I am taking the constable's evidence that one piece was coming out of the mouth, and the rest at the back of the throat—in cases of asphyxia one does have sometimes the fact that after respiration has ceased the heart continues to beat—when death has arisen from shock, and when there is considerable muscular action, there may be an inclination for the muscles to be fixed; where there has been a violent struggle the muscles remain fixed after death in the position in which they last were during life—in life and death there may be the same appearance in a muscle which has been severely exercised just before death—I am not assuming that Miss</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140109"/>
               <p>Baker is unusually neurotic, but I say a woman being brought face to face with such circumstances would be affected automatically—I do not think one could expect anyone to act with great presence of mind in such circumstances—I think that Miss Baker and the constable, on going into the room, and seing Miss Farmer in this condition, might think that she might be dead, I am not in the least saying that they are not absolutely honest in their statement, but they were not skilled observers, and they would naturally be in a state of trepidation; anyone would—I agree, as a general proposition, that I am constantly called upon to give evidence in cases where eminent gentlemen do not agree with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the majority of cases where death is due to suffoca<lb/>tion, the body cools more slowly than it does in ordinary circumstances. There are cases where the temperature rises after death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, of 50, Hassard Street—I have had dealings with Adam Keil. a polisher, of 36, Columbia Road, for two or three months—on March."3rd, I met him in the passage as I was going into my place—he asked me if I had two elliptic stands and dressing chests in stock—I told him yes—he asked the price—I said 16s. 6d. for the two elliptic stands and a box, and with. the dressing chests the bill would come to £2 7s. 6d.—he said he wanted them quickly for a customer, and that was why he asked if I had them in stock—one box was not the right colour; satin walnut is very light—the one in stock was mahogany—when he had gone I set to work to reveneer the mahogany box in the presence of my men—that took me till about 8 p.m.; when Schlesinger and I took them to Adam Keil's place—he was in the shop—I was not paid that evening—I have no clerk, but I keep this book in Hebrew, and if I have an order on credit I put it in, the date, and where the goods are—I have made this entry, "3.3.04—Kil, two chests with boxes £116s., two elliptic stands 6s. 6d.; one box 5s.—£2 7s. 6d.—that book was produced when I was tried here, and when I was examined—I called on Adam Keil on March 5th and asked him</p>

               <p>for the money—he saidhe could not pay that day because he had had a post card from his customer, and he could not deliver them for a week; he sand, "Come next week some time"—I went the following Saturday—he saidhe was hard up and could not pay me—I went again, when he saidhe would pay me in time, but he was hard up at present—I asked, him if he would pay 3s. at a time—finally I saw Arthur Keil, and in consequence of what he said I went to my solicitor—after writing Keil a letter, I took out—a summons at the Shoreditch County Court—when the summons was called—on before the Registrar, Arthur Keil appeared—in consequence of what I said the hearing was adjourned to another day, when Adam Keil appeared and said that he had not bought the things, but that he was ill in bed on March 3rd, and that he had not had them—Arthur Keil and other witnesses were called, and the Registrar gave judgment for me—afterwards there was a motion for a new trial, which was refused—the next thing that happened was that I received a summons for perjury—I attended at Worship Street Police Court, when Adam Keil, his two sons, and the prisoner gave evidence against me—Adam Keil swore that he was ill in bed on March 3rd, and the others swore the same, in consequence of which I was committed for perjury to this Court—about a week before the trial at this Court my solicitor received information, and a gentleman was sent to see Mr. Marsh in Edgware Road, and who was subpœnaed—when the case came on before the Common Serjeant in this building, Adam Keil, his two sons and his wife gave the. Same evidence as they did at the Police Court—Marsh was then called, and directly the jury heard my repetition that what I said was true, they stopped the case, and I was acquitted—the next step was that some of the papers in this case were sent to the Public Prosecutor—when they came back, at my own expense I put the matter into the hands of a solicitor—I am responsible for bringing this charge against the prisoner.</p>

I never tried to find out what sort of people they were so long as they paid me—I told my solicitor my trouble, and he saidthis case might be prosecuted—I do not know what papers were sent to the Public Prosecutor—the papers were left in Court.</p>

               <p>business about 44 years—last February and March I was very queer with rheumatic gout—I was land up in bed for three weeks, but I had been very bad in health all the winter—my wife looked after me; the old lady who was here on Saturday—she is ill this morning—the prisoner has been with me many years—he had the privilege of doing jobs on his own account, and getting what profit he could, when we were not busy—I have dealt with Sekolsky for about three years—I have bought goods from him, and paid him for them—I have left the business entirely to my sons since Christmas—on March 3rd I was in bed all day—some<lb/>times I was up for a few hours in the room, but I was confined to my room—I did not buy goods from Sekolsky on March 3rd or the day before—I was not in his shop on March 3rd—I am not aware of any goods being delivered to my place that day or the next morning, certainly not in my presence—I did not go to Mr. Marsh on March 5th—I was ill upstairs—on March 11th I went to Mr. Marsh—I recollect the County Court summons coming in—I had not conversed with Sekolsky about it—I went to the County Court on the second hearing—I was land up on the first hearing when the matter was before the Registrar—I applied for a new trial—I did not get it—I consulted a solicitor—on his advice I swore an Informa<lb/>tion at Worship Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son Arthur does all the business—I help him when I am able to go out and see the goods delivered, but not indoors—he told me to go to the County Court—I understood afterwards the goods were for Wilson—I did not tell the Registrar that—I was not asked—I told him I did not order them—I did not know at the County Court the goods were for Wilson—I saw Marsh at the trial—I sent a receipt with the goods sold to Marsh on March 5th—I did not go myself—I understand what Marsh has sworn—I had my hand bandaged up when I went to Marsh on March 11th—the things I delivered were not two satin walnut elliptic stands—he often has elliptic stands—I did not sell him two in March—I know nothing about the goods delivered on March 5th or that week.</p>

               <p>time later I called at the Walsingham Hotel and asked for Sims White—I was shown into the drawing room, and had some conversation with Mr. White—he showed me some documents relating to the Siberian Goldfield Development Company, Limited, and made a statement to me about it—he then brought Hooley into the room and introduced me—Hooley made some statement to me with regard to the Siberian Goldfields, and in the result I bought some shares in the company—Hooley said that they belonged to Mr. Ormerod, who wanted money—he did not <hi rend="italic">say</hi> who Mr. Ormerod was; he saida gentleman, a client of his—I bought 5,000 of these shares for £3,000—this is the transfer I got. for them (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit i);</hi> it is dated October 12th—this is. my cheque for £3,000 which I gave for it—on October 16th I bought a further 5,000 shares in the same company and gave this cheque for £3,000 for them (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on November 7th I bought 200 shares in a syndicate connected with the same goldfields for £1,500—tills is my cheque (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 6)—on November 26th I bought 300 of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> same syndicate shares and gave £1,500 for them, and on the same <hi rend="italic">day</hi> Hooley mentioned to me the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited—he saidit was a very fine company, and that it had got a railway from Liverpool Street to Walthamstow, and he showed the plans and said that they were promoting a lot of tramways and had got a lot of orders for running trains in different parts of the country, that it was a very, very fine thing, and that the Bill for running the railway was practically passed—The City and North Eastern Suburban Railway, I think it was called; commonly called the Walthamstow Rail<lb/>way—he stated that the shares would be very, very valuable, and that he would part with them at a sacrifice as he wanted money very, very badly—he saidthey would be paying 16s. in a few days dividend—I asked him about it, and said that was a lot of money for a dividend—he sand: "Yes, they were promoting another company, and that part of the dividend would come out of that"—the British Electric Tramways Street Company, Limited; what is called the Street Company—he saidthat he had got 3,000 shares) in the Electric Tramways Construction, that he would part with them at a sacrifice, as he wanted the money very badly; he offered to sell them to me at 10s. per share—I agreed to that and gave him a cheque for £1,500—I think the transfer was Mr. Ormerod's; this is it (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 5), December 13th is the date now upon it—that was with a view to lodge it; there was no date to it then—<hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the cheque I paid for it (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 9); it purports to be for the consideration of 5s.—Hooley always did that; the same with the Siberians.; he stamped every<lb/>thing, and arranged about the stamps; he saidhe always did that for any client that purchased shares from him—the body of that is filled up in Sims Whites) writing and my own the "paid by Alfred John Paine, 4, Eastern Terrace, Marine Parade, Brighton," is mine: I filled that in: that was when I acknowledged the transfer: they said it was incomplete—I gave the cheque and had the transfer, I should think, two or three days, or three or four days afterwards; I had got a receipt for the money—I must have had it: perhaps it was. a week afterwards—the—words, "In consideration of the sum of five shillings" are in Mr. Sims Whites writing; 10s. stamp it is—"in consideration" is printed, "paid by" is printed, and "Alfred John Pain, of 4, Eastern</p>

Kenneth D. Mackenzie, Bart., Gordon Hunter, and Herbert J.

Hooley"—he had sand that the gentleman who owned very nearly all the shares in the Electric Tramways Construction Company was a friend of his, a man he had done a very large amount of business with, and he was a very rich man—I came up the next morning and saw Hooley at Walsingham House—I pointed out to him that the "see" ought to have been "seen," and I said: "Who do you mean; by the little man?"—he sand, "That is the gentleman I was speaking to you about, who owns nearly all the shares in this Electric Tramways Construction Company"—he sand, "I saw him last night, and he tells me there will be 18s. dividend"; and that his name was "Mr. H.J. Lawson, the big motor man, or cycle man"—he said Lawson had made a very large amount of money out of motors, and he understands the British motor; that he had made a quarter of a million, I think he said, out of it and that he had sold a lot of shares for him, and that they had done business together for years—at that time I had in my possession two guarantees relating to the Siberian shares that I had bought from Hooley; they were Mrs. Hooley's guarantees—they were both handed to Hooley; one he tore up in my presence and threw in the fire—it was a guarantee that if he did not get a sovereign per share for the shares I had paid him 12a for by Christmas he would send me back my 3,000; it was an in<lb/>demnity against loss—I did not understand that it was a guarantee of £1 for 12s.—I understood that if he could not succeed in getting £1 per share for the shares I purchased from him that he would hand me my money back and take the shares back; of course, that is what I understood it to mean—but if he could get £a share for them he was to sell them, and I was to get the benefit of it—that would mature at Christmas time—I spoke to him before November 27th; he had been selling a lot of shares, and I asked, him if he could not sell mine—that would be on the 27th or 26th—the 26th was the day I sold, so it would be the day after—this was not a guarantee for the Construction shares; it was in relation to the Siberian Goldfields Development Company—he saidhe could sell my</p>

I think you call them: important names—he said that it was important that the shares should not be put on the market—Lawson sold that—I think Hooley was present then, but I am not sure, and that ho did not want the shares put on the market because they had some serious negotiations going on, and it would not be the thing to have these shares put the markets and would I put my shares in a, pool—I said, "What do you mean?"—he then explained to me it meant that if the shares were sold I got so much <hi rend="italic">pro rata;</hi> that is to say, if he old 30 shares, I should be entitled to 10, because I held a less number—I said that if Hooley would consent. I had no objection—previous to that Mr. Cox, of Cox &amp; Lafone, called at Walsingham House, and Hooley explained to him that he had arranged with Lawson that the shares should be pooled, and that I should be trustee for Mrs. Hooley's other half, and gave instructions to Mr. Cox, I think Lawson was there at the time, to draw up this pooling agreement—I got a letter (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 15), and the draft pooling agreement—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> letter is signed by Messrs, Cox &amp; Lafone <hi rend="italic">and</hi> headed: "Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company.

He is very wroth, as no mention has been made that he should pool these 3.000 shares until this letter received this morning. Kindly have it put right at once—Yours faithfully, Ernest T. Hooley. P.S.—Of course, you are aware that Mr. Paine is the holder of the other contract referring to one-fourth of the 245,000. I think it is a great mistake to have him annoyed in this manner—E. T. H."—I purchased the second half of Mrs. Hooley's contract with Lawson, subject to the terms of these two documents (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 17;) they are both dated January 24th, 1901—the first reads: "To A. J. Paine, Esq. In consideration of your having paid me the sum of five thousand pounds this day, I hereby assign all my interest in the contract between myself and H. J. Lawson re one quarter of two hundred and forty-five thousand shares in the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited. The original contract now in your possession"—that is signed: "For Annie M. Hooley, Ernest T. Hooley, her agent"—the second is: "In consideration of your purchasing this day all my interest in a contract between Lawson and myself £245,000 Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, shares, and paying me by bill £1,200 at three months and £3,800 at six months, I hereby agree that if called upon within 14 days before the maturity of the saidbills to cancel the contract and meet the two bills; you to retain out of my interest 5,000 shares as a bonus</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140122"/>
               <p>on the transaction"—the same day that Hooley wrote that, letter saying that I was the holder of the other contract I was, in fact, the holder of the whole of it—the first of these bills was a three months bill, and would become payable on April 27th, 1901, if it was three months, after that date: and 14 days before the maturity of the saidbill I had the right to cancel this contract, which I did more than fourteen days before the first of the bills became due—the time stated there is that I was to give notice within 14 days, but before that I said that I would not have it—the latest date on which I could have cancelled the first of the bills was April 13th, and before that date I had cancelled it and in one way and another the bills were mot by me and Hooley partly in Corunna shares and partly in money—before I entered into the contract of January 24th, Hooley told me that Messrs. Baring &amp; Co., the bankers, were taking over the whole concern, and that the shares would be worth, I think it was, £.5 each: that they were the big bankers, and that they were taking ever the whole of the company, railway bill included; that is, the Con<lb/>struction Company, and that if I bought this contract before the bills became due the deal would be done, and it was on that understanding that I took them—he saidif the deal did not come off, he would not ask for the money; and he said: "will put it in writing for you"—and that was the reason of the option given to me here in <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 18—before I exercised my option I inquired whether Messrs. Barings had taken them over: I knew that they had not, because I should have heard of it directly. and then I exercised my option to cancel after the letter which I received on January 25th, 1901, from the secretary of the Construction Company, saying that their solicitors would accept service—I got this certificate (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is for 3.000 ordinary shares in the Construction Company, dated January 26th, 1901. and it is signed by Mr. Parford, the secretary. and by two directors: the same Mr. Parford who had written me the letter—this other letter is signed by me: it was typed at Walsingham House although it I headed "Windsor Castle, Victoria Station—January 30th, 1901, to the secretary of the Construction Company: "Replying to your letter of the 25th inst., I have to inform you that Mr. H. J. Lawson has handed me my certificate for 3,000 shares in your company, and he has also given me information with regard to your company's interest in, and the position of the City and North-East Suburban Electric Railway Com<lb/>pany. I am also pleased to hear of the various arrangements which have been made with local bodies in different pans of the county for The promo<lb/>tion and construction of electric tramways, particularly as my interest both in your company and the British Electric Street Tramways Company (apart from the above 3,000 shares) is very large. Do you wish me to sign a formal receipt for the above certificate?"—I had, in fact, got that certificate from Lawson—about the end of May or the beginning of June an appointment was made to meet Lawson at the Walsingham House Hotel—Hooley arranged it: he saidthat Lawson was very much annoyed that I had got such a large interest in the concern, and that he wished to see me: and I then saw Lawson at Walsingham House—he said I had too large an interest in his company and that he was not going to stand that—it meant. I think, that for every sixpence he earned I would take three half<lb/>pence</p>

I agreed that I would accept the shares—the next day Lawson made an appointment—the next day, or a day or two afterwards: I think it was about June 6th, the beginning of June I know, and he brought up a number of blank transfers to me and we went into the drawing room, he brought out these transfers and wanted a copy of the contract, and I told him that I had given it to Hooley, and Hooley said, "I do not think I had it," and the result of it was he accepted a, copy and we both accepted it as a true copy—that is <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 25, and Hooley put these statements upon it which are now there dated June 5th, 1901—it says: "I hereby swear this is: a true copy of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> contract can<lb/>celled this day as far as I am concerned for Annie M. Hooley. Ernest T. Hooley, her agent": and then I state: "I hereby swear the above to be a true and cancelled paper as for consideration received.—Alfred J. Paine"—Hooley wrote both those memorandums and I signed one—the orders that are mentioned that Lawson said he would transfer to ether companies were provisional orders for rights to run trams in different parts of the country—it. appeared to me from what he told mo that you go to the corporation or the boroughs under the Light Railway Act and got the rights confirmed—I know that Lawson was getting <hi rend="italic">these</hi> provisional orders; he and the company—I had no means, of telling who was doing it—Hooley told me that Lawson's threat could be carried out—I thought he holding so many shares, would be master of the company and could do as he liked, and, as a matter of fact, Hooley told me it was his company—on June 5th I gave up that contract, or the copy of it, which was all I had—I got a number of transfers on that date—the first is 101 for 250 ordinary shares of £10 each in the Blackpool South. Company transferred by Lawson to me, the consideration being stated as £50—the second of I hem is for 2000 debentures in the Construction Company from Lawson to me for a consideration of £50—the third 2.500 debentures in the Black<lb/>pool</p>

Have a little patience"—then I spoke to him again about it. and I found that they had paid Sir Henry White his dividend—then I saw Lawson later on and Hooley together, and they said there had been some bother with the Blackpool South Electric Company and directly that was over they would pay me—I gave Hooley a transfer of 500 shares after the announcement of the dividend, for which he gave me 1,750; instead of giving me the money he gave me 1,750 Paramo shares that he never had—I got that from the company; I went to the particular company—the bargain was that he was to give me £2,000 for them—he saidthey were worth £6 each, and I said: "Well, I snail be very glad to sell some at £4"—he saidhe had got a client who would buy some at £4—I then gave him the transfer, and he and he could not pay me the money then; that he was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> hard up, but he would give me these Paramo shares, and I bought the balance of them and paid £250, and I sold them <hi rend="italic">ex div</hi>—that was after I had heard of Sir Henry White having his dividend—this is the document I got in respect of that transaction (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 37) it is? dated Oct 11th, 1901: "A.

We are instructed that in exchange for the</p>

               <p>handing over of the benefit of this contract to you by Mr. Paine you agree to give him 2,000 ordinary shares and 2,000 debentures in the Electric Tramways Company, 2,500 ordinary shares and 2,500 debentures in the Blackpool Company, 2,500 ordinary shares and 2,000 debentures in the Electric Tramways Trust, and 2,500 ordinary shares in the British Electric Street Tramways, Limited. Transfers of all these shares were executed by Mr. Paine in the June of the present year, and were acknowledged by the secretary of the Construction Company. Notwithstanding the very protracted period which has elapsed since the arrangement was come to between you and Mr. Paine, our client has never been able <hi rend="italic">to</hi> obtain possession of the scrip or share certificates of the various companies which he is entitled to, and so unsatisfactory has the position ultimately become that Mr. Paine became very uneasy and looked into the matter. He now finds that he has been made the victim of what he regards as very gross misrepresentation on your part First of all, there are no debentures in existence of the Electric Tramways Construction, Company, which you must have well known at the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> you entered into the arrangement with him. Secondly, the Electric Tramways Trust, instead of being as you represented to him, a thoroughly good reliable and going concern, is a wretched little company, which as you admit in your letter to Mr. R. W. Kemp, of Sep<lb/>tember 27th last, is only now being formed, and which company, as an inspection of the register at Somerset House shows, was only registered in December of last year with a nominal capital of £100 in 100 £share. The whole history of this transaction appears to us to be open to the gravest suspicion, and our instructions are to demand from you at once the return of the contract which Mr. Paine parted with to you, so that he may stand in the original position he occupied under his agreements of December 3rd, 1900, and January 24th, 1901, with Mrs. Hooley. We beg you to give immediate attention to this demand made by us on behalf of Mr. Paine, for if it is not complied with forthwith our instructions are to advise Mr. Paine as to whether he has not a remedy for what seems to us to be on Mr. Paine, instructions a very serious deception.—Yours obediently, Wontner &amp; Sons"—that is addressed to the office of the Con<lb/>struction Company, 34, Victoria Street, Westminster—the reply to that is <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 143 from Messrs. Beyfus &amp; Beyfus, dated October 8th, 1901: "Dear Sirs,—Paine and Lawson: Mr. H. J. Lawson has brought us your letter to him of yesterdays date and consulted us about the matters to which you refer, and from what he tells us it seems to us that you could not possibly have been in possession of the facts or you would not written us as you have done. It appears that the complaints contained in your letter are unfounded, more particularly as they are based on the supposi<lb/>tion that an arrangement was made between our client and Mr. Paine. This is not the case Our client asserts most strongly that he has never had any dealings with Mr. Paine of any kind, and further that there is absolutely no foundation for the suggestion that misrepresentations were made by him and he also says that the further suggestion that the latter gentleman has been made a victim is quite absurd. We suggest you should go more fully into the matter, when we trust you will find you have been mistaken.—Yours truly, Beyfus &amp; Beyfus"—that is addressed to</p>

That I have never seen nor am I aware of any contracts between your client, Mr. A. J. Paine, and Mrs. Hooley"—that is untrue—you may take the pooling agreement and the settlement when, he took the contract over—the alleged pooling agreement—<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 25, which has the two state<lb/>ments, "I swear this is a true copy," was handed over to him—the state<lb/>ments were made at the bottom for the purpose of verifying it: "All my transactions have been with Mr. E. T. Hooley in the matter"—that is not true; they are not, not with regard to anything over the contract—originally I bought a share of the contract, from Hooley, and shortly after that Lawson came there and knew that I had got the contract, and advised me to buy the other half—<hi rend="italic">Exhibits</hi> 101 and 102 are the transfers 42 to 46 by Lawson to you; they are all signed by him on June 9th: "All my transactions have been with Mr. E. T. Hooley in the matter, and my correspondence with Mr. Paine is in consequence of Mr. and Mrs. Hooley having in some way given to him the benefit of my arrangements with Mr. Hooley. I am entirely ignorant of what the arrangements are between the parties, and my deal is strictly with Mrs. Hooley, and Mr. Hooley as her agent"—that is not true; not as regards those—(2.) The docu<lb/>ment referred to was obtained from me on the entirely false representation that Mr. Hooley would and was in a position to obtain the Stock Exchange quotation and make considerable dealings in the shares. The document was in no way transferable, but was entirely to Mr. Hooley as the agent of Mrs. Hooley, the representations, as I can bring several witnesses to prove, being that he was about to deal largely in the shares, (3.) On June 5th, no dealings having been done in the saidshares, I cancelled the arrangement with Mrs. Hooley and Mr. Hooley on her behalf, and the letters which passed are signed by Annie M. Hooley and myself, and I herewith enclose copies of them. We were the two principals. (4.) The consideration was arranged between myself and Mr. Hooley, and consisted in an arrangement for me to transfer to him various debentures and shares as and when I received the same. Some of them were in companies not then formed, but being formed, and of which I can prove he had full knowledge as he was taking part at the time in the formation of the same. (5.) My usual method of formation of companies is to register a small syndicate of, say, £100, just to protect the name, and then increase the same. There were no debentures existing in the Blackpool Tramways Company nor in the Trust Company, as both companies were in the process of being formed. Tins Mr. Hooley was fully aware of, and it was ex<lb/>plained to him at the time. As a proof of this, the Blackpool Company was at the time nothing, but has since been formed, and the debentures and shares will he handed to Mr. Hooley or Mr. Paine as his nominee, in due course. All the rest of the scrip will bet handed to Mr. Paine, as I have already informed him, in the course, but companies cannot be formed instantly, and it will take a little time to carry the deal through. The capital of the Tramways Trust has since been increased, and debentures and shares will be issued both by the Construction Company and the Trust Company, which are, both of them, very valuable companies in hand at</p>

Wontner &amp; Sons—I saw Hooley first at Walsingham House a few days after <hi rend="italic">the</hi> letter was written—I said that both my solicitor and Wontners had advised me that they ought to be prosecuted; that they had robbed me—he laughed and said it was all nonsense; I was talking nonsense—he saideverything would be all right; he would speak to Lawson and see that it was put right—I said it was a very serious thing—he did not seem to think it was serious, but I did—I did not want to make a row—I was so deeply involved—then I saw Lawson and he saidhe would arrange matters with Hooley—the result was that they gave me 12,000 preference shares—they stated they would give us more shares—a few days after Hooley met Lawson, and Hooley said that he would make an arrangement with him—Lawson was not there then—Hooley told me he had made arrangements, and I think afterwards I saw Lawson and it was corroborated—Hooley told ma that he had made the following arrangement with Lawson: That I was to give up the shares with the exception of the British Electric Street Trams, which I was entitled to under my original 3,000 shares, and to keep the 2,000 of the Construction Company and give up the other in exchange for 12,000 pre<lb/>ference shares in the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, and they promised to pay my dividend as well, and any dividend that accrued on the preference shares—the transfers, <hi rend="italic">Exhibits</hi> 101 and 102—all of those marked 101, A, B, C, D, and E bear the words "Can<lb/>celled by E.

               <p>Marine Parade, Brighton, in the county of Sussex, licensed victualler: the above named Plaintiff make oath and say:—(1) The above named De<lb/>fendant Company was at the commencement of this action and still is justly and truly indebted to me in the sum at £1,183 6s. 8&amp;, the amount of a declared dividend and bonus due from them to me in respect of 10,000 shares held by me in the send Defendant Company; the saiddividend and bonus were declared by the saidcompany on the 20th September, 1901. (2) Particulars of my said claim appear by the endorsement on the Writ in this action. (3) A report of the meeting at which the saiddividend and bonus was declared is now produced and shown to me marked A. This report is printed, published and circulated by the Defendant Company, as appears by the imprint thereon. (4) I verily believe that there is no defence to this action;—that purports to be sworn on June 6th, before a commsisioner for oaths—this is the office copy of the reply sworn by Osborn, the secretary: "I, Charles Osborn, of 34, Victoria Street, in the County of London, make oath and say as follows:—I am <hi rend="italic">the</hi> secretary of the Defendant Company and have acted in that capacity for nearly two years. I have read what purports to be a copy of the Affidavit of Alfred John Payne, sworn June 16th ultimo, and I say that the Defendant Com<lb/>pany is not indebted to the Plaintiff in the sum of £1,183 6s. 8d., the amount of the dividend declared and the bonus, nor in any other sum whatever. No dividend or bonus was declared by the said Company on September 20th, 1900, or at any time since then. The <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> marked A is not a report of a meeting of the Company, but it appears to be a report of some remarks by Sir Kenneth Mackenzie at a dinner which was given to various persons interested in electric engineering. It was net a meeting of the shareholders of the Company. The said Alfred John Payne is well aware that there has been no dividend or bonus declared on his shares, although it was certainly hoped and intended that a dividend and bonus would be declared, but subsequently unforeseen circumstances prevented this being done. I have not seen the <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> A referred to in the Plaintiffs affidavit, and do not understand what is the imprint thereon which Plaintiff alleges, and shows it was printed, published, and circulated by the Defendant Company. The statement of the Plaintiff is inaccurate. I verily believe the Company have a <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> defence to the action"—that is sworn on July 1st, 1902, by Charles Osborn—this is my letter of May 9th, 1902, from my address in Brighton to Mr. Osborn, the secretary or the Construction Company: "Dear Sir,—I shall be obliged if you will forward me at once your company's cheque for the dividend on the shares I hold in the company"—this is the letter I got in reply: "May 16th, 1902. Dear Sir,—In reply to your request for a dividend on your shares, we shall be very pleased to forward it whenever such dividend is officially declared, but at present we have not been able to pay the dividend that we anticipated a few months ago. Had there been one officially declared after the transfer of your shares, we should have sent, it to you with a great deal of pleasure, but this has not been the case. We are still hoping, however, for a good stroke of business to come off successfully. This we are now engaged in.—Yours faithfully, Chas.

               <p>—the writ was issued on March 27th, and the statement of claim delivered on May 8th, 1903—the action is between the Construction Com<lb/>pany, plaintiffs, and myself and Hooley, defendants—the statement of claim reads: "The plaintiff company promoted the British Electric Street Tramways, Limited, under an agreement dated November 1st, 1900, made between the plaintiff company of the one part and the British Electric Street. Tramways, Limited, of the other part, the plaintiff company became entitled to a considerable number of shares in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> capital of the British Electric Street Tramways, Limited. In the months of February and March, 1901, the defendants represented verbally to Henry John Lawson, who was interested in the plaintiff company, that they were in a position to render considerable service to the plaintiff company as follows—namely, that they could procure responsible brokers to obtain an official quotation for and find purchasers of shares in the plaintiff com<lb/>pany and the British Electric Street Tramways, Limited, and they pro<lb/>mised verbally to the said Henry John Lawson on behalf of the plaintiff company to render such services, and that they would procure responsible brokers to obtain official quotations for and find purchasers of shares in the two companies herein mentioned. In reliance on such representations and in consideration of the defendants promises mentioned in paragraph 2 hereof, the plaintiff company by the said Henry John Lawson, acting as their agent, caused to be delivered to the defendants or their nominees 250 fully paid shares of £10 each in the British Electric Street Tramways, Limited, and 27,750 fully paid shares in the plaintiff company, and cer<lb/>tificates for such, shares were duly issued to the defendants and their nominees. The following are particulars of the shares so delivered, the persons to whom, and the dates when they were so delivered—February 18th, 1901, 3,000 ordinary shares in the Construction Company to Mr. Ormerod: those were my first 3,000 shares bought on Novem<lb/>ber 26th, for which I paid £1,500—July 24th, 2,000 shares in the Con<lb/>struction Company delivered to me; those were the 2,000 I got for the compromise or agreement of June 9th—September 25th, 2,000 shares to Sir Henry White; I had nothing to do with that—November 18th, 1,250 shares to J. A. Malcolm; I had nothing to do with that; I do not know the gentleman—January 14th, 1902, 4,000 shares to me; that consisted of 1,000 shares that I purchased during 1901, and 3,000 shares that I got under a contract relating to an action brought by Mr. Holroyd Smith—February 3rd, 2,500 shares to F. Mills; I had to do with 500 of those only; I purchased 500—February 5th, 500 shares to Sims White; I purchased those—April 7th, 500 to Sir Henry White; I had nothing to do with that—February 2nd, 10,000 preference shares of £each to me, and February 3rd, 2,000; those are the 12,000 preference shares I have given up; 27,750 shares altogether in the Construction Company—July 26th, 1901, 250 shares of £10 each in the Street Com<lb/>pany, J. Paine; I was entitled to those shares because I held my 3,000 Construction shares—if you look at the prospectus of the Street Company, it tells you there—that is what I assumed I was entitled to—that was under the terms of the prospectus of the Street Company—my memory is not very clear now, but as far as my memory serves me it is this: The</p>

               <p>Construction Company had so much money and so many shares; it was a bonus out of the Street Company's shares; part of the purchase money, I understood—I think the prospectus provided it should be distributed among the shareholders of the Construction Company—they were deferred shares: or if they did not subscribe, the balance of the shares were to be divided; I know it was one or the other—I claimed that I was entitled to than, and got them in June—paragraph 4 goes on: "The statements mentioned in paragraph 2 hereof were untrue, and the defendants were not in a position to render the services mentioned to the plaintiff company, and they have, in fact, wholly failed to carry cut their promise. They rendered no services to the plaintiff company and have not procured brokers to obtain an official quotation for, or to find purchasers of shares in, the plaintiff company, or the British Electric Street. Tramways, Limited, and the consideration for the transfer and allotment of the shares men<lb/>tioned in paragraph 3 hereof has wholly failed"—we never promised to render any services of the kind described; the whole thing is a fabrication—the statement of claim then goes on to claim on behalf of the plaintiff company to have the shares retransferred and also claims damages and an injunction—it is delivered on May 8th, 1903, by "Ward, Bowie &amp;: Co., of 7, King Street, the company's solicitors—<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 276 is all in Hooley's handwriting, as? it appears to me—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>") Hotel Albemarle, Piccadilly.

I must ask that this matter be attended to without any delay. It seems to me most unbusinesslike that three months should be allowed to elapse and a shareholder get nothing for his money, and unless I receive these at once I shall apply to the Court"—I have never sold any of my Construction shares, or parted with any of them, except those 500 for the Paramos on October 11th, 1901.</p>

Think twenty-five: you are asking me extending over twenty years—I did not have these all at the same time—I did not buy one and then work it up; it did not need any working up; if you have a genuine business you do not need to work it up—I bought it and then resold, after the lapse of a few years in some cases—during the few years I do not think it was worked up—I sold some of the houses and kept some—I have sold them, except the "Windsor Castle," which is the one I have now—I have an interest in two others—except the "Windsor Castle," and the interests in two others, I have sold all the rest—I do not think that I am particularly fond of gambling; like all other men, I like to buy anything and sell it at a profit, if I can—I do not like having a bet at a racecourse, but. They got; me at it—I think it is only fair to me to explain that I never had a bet in my life until I went to Brighton; I used to come to London two or three times a weak, and he got me to go to the race meetings; I had nothing to do, and I went to the race meetings, and naturally, like other Englishmen, I had a bet—"he" is my friends: you know I had a run for my money; my horse ran—I did not win; there are very few people who do—I have my run, but lose my money—I have not had to do with a sporting paper: I lent a man <hi rend="italic">some</hi> money in connection with it—at least,</p>

               <p>he told me he was bringing out a paper; I knew very little about it—that was called the "Sporting Profit"; I never saw a copy of it till it was produced at the Police Court—there were 2,000 or 3,000 questions asked me at the Police Court, and I have never seen my depositions or had an opportunity of refreshing my memory, and also the Treasury have got all my papers; so I have not had am opportunity of being able to see what the name of the paper was in the depositions—I am going to tell the truth now to the best of my recollection, if you will accept that—I never had an interest in a paper called the "Sporting Profit"—I know Mr. Welch; he stole my glasses on the racecourse; he was never a friend of mine; he was a customer—I have met him at race meetings, and we had a system of backing favourites—that turned out very badly indeed—I do not think I lost about £1,200 on it, on something very near it; I think, what you call it in sporting phraseology, I went down twice—we had a pool; we had £500, I think £250 each, and when that was lost there was an end of it, and we could start again if we liked; I think I was fool enough to start a second time, and I lost again—I should think I must have lost £1,000 then; I promptly turned it up afterwards—that was in a fort-night; I followed it up for a fortnight—as far as my memory carries me, I should think it was in 1899—I know a man called Hobson; so does Hooley—Welch put £100 into "Sporting Profit": I do not know what Mr. Hobson put—it is untrue to say I put £100 into the paper—Welch tried to get the money back off me—I cannot tell you what Mr. Hobson did with the £100; I lent him £100, and he saidhe was starting a sporting paper—before I lent this £100 I may have read in the! paper about "Stod<lb/>darts Sporting Luck"—probably in reading the paper I may have done so—I did not know that "Sporting Luck" was a sporting paper which had a coupon competition—I do not know whether I did or not; I do not think I did—I did not know that "Sporting Profit" was to be started in opposition to "Sporting tuck"—"I do not know anything about it; I never saw a number, I believe, and I am told there was only about three numbers—<hi rend="italic">very</hi> likely I swore at the Police Court I had heard of "Sporting Luck"; and very likely at that time I may have heard of it—I think my memory is as good! now as it was at the Police Court—Hobson sand, "I am going to bring out at paper"—I said, "What sort of paper?"—he sand, "A sort of sporting Tit-Bits; I want some money to bring it out. Will you lend me) £100?"—I said, "Yes"—I lent it to him, and he sand, "I will give you a good return"—I was to get a part of the profit—I have lent Mr. Hobson money before—I do not say Baboon put £100 in; he may have said so; I think he told me he put more—I swore at the Police Court, "I put £100 into the paper, Hobson £100, and Welch £100"—Mr. Hobson may have put £200 in—I had nothing to do with the paper, but I understood it was to be published abroad:—Welch! applied to me to repay the £100 when the paper failed; I quite understand that—I did not know the paper was to be published abroad, because there were coupons in it—I did not know it was illegal to publish a paper with coupons in England—I did not know that Stoddart, who was the owner of "Sporting Luck," had been sent to prison for that very thing; I know now that "Sporting Profit" was a coupon paper, because it was shown</p>

               <p>to me at the Police Court—I did not know then, that the whole object of the paper was nothing but to carry on what is called the coupon system—I expected it was a sort of "Sporting Tit-Bits"—I see the paper has, "Sporting Profit Weekly. Only address, Amsterdam, Holland"—very likely the whole object, of it was to carry on a gambling system that would not be allowed in England: if you say so—I should think very likely the whole object of it was to carry on a gambling system that object is to carry on a gambling system that would not be allowed to go on in England"—the same sort of question was put: Did I know about Stoddart's, and so on—what I swore at the Police Court was true; I should not swear any tiling that was untrue if I knew it—I think a good deal of racing business that cannot be carried on in England is carried on in Holland; there are plenty of circular going round—I knew a Mr. Walter Cole, of Brighton; he is a bookmaker—I did not put money into his business—I lent him money to buy some furniture, not to put into his business—I went with him to pick out some furniture for the office he was, to use as a bookmaker at Brighton—I paid for that furniture for the time being—I did a very large business: with some people in the furniture business; I think it was at Finchley—Messrs. Hopkins &amp; Co.—and he wanted some furniture—h said to me, could I get him some furniture at trade price or through the trade?—he went down and picked certain furniture out—he went down, but they would not trust him, and I paid for it—then I had a bet with Mr. Cole and lost a sum of money, and he gave me a cheque for the balance—I had known Mr. Cole for some years as being a publican in, the same business as myself, and in the same neigh<lb/>bourhood—when I was introduced to Hooley he told me he was an un<lb/>discharged bankrupt, and also how badly he had been served by the people whose fortunes he had made—he made no secret of the fact that he was an un<lb/>discharged bankrupt, but told me so when I first saw him: he always made that a rule with everybody—he told me that for that reason the contract for anything he did would have, to be in his wife's name—in the transaction I had, I bought 5,000 Siberian shares, the Gold Mining Com<lb/>panys shares, at 12s.—that is the transaction of October 12th—at the same time that I bought those shares: he gave me his wife's guarantee to take them back from me for 12s. if they had not been sold by December at a sovereign—if I had sold them for 15s. or 16. he would not have had to buy them back at 12s.—I should have been very pleased to have made a profit—there was no obligation on my part to sell them; it was he to sell them for my benefit—if he had said to me, "Now, Paine, I cannot get a pound for them, I have sold them at 16s.," I should have been de<lb/>lighted—what he was doing wax, he was indemnifying me against loss—I understood that he guaranteed they would be sold at £1 a share—I got the guarantee: it was on behalf of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> wife—that was the contract with reference to the transfer of the 5,000 Siberian shares—I do not remember if there was a word about guaranteeing met a profit—I should like to see the document; I should think not—my impression was that I paid £3,000, and that Hooley would sell them for £1 share about Christmas—I do not think there was ever any guarantee in writing from Hooley or his</p>

               <p>wife as to selling them at £1 a share—I do not think he pledged himself to do so, became he said himself it might be 30s.—he was acting on behalf of his wife, and I suppose he could sell these shares for £1 or 30s.—there was the guarantee of the wife—I got that guarantee, and it was put into writing as well; it is dated October 12th—(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there is not one word in it setting out the terms between me and Mrs. Hooley as to selling the shares at £1 or 30s., but Hooley guaranteed me himself; he mentioned as much as 30s.—I did not expect it might fetch that—he told me he had sold some at £4—he personally guaranteed I should be able to sell them at £1 or 30s.—he sand, "I will sell them at £1, and I may get 30s.—that is not what I mean by guaranteeing; only that is what he said—if he took them back at 12s. by December 15th, I had no claim against him, except what he told me—when you have got shares I know it very often happens in this guarantee business that they are taken back—I got a transfer for these shares on; October 12th—I did not know who Mr. Ormerod was at that time—I found out some little time after: they kept it dark for some considerable time—I knew who Mr. Ormerod was about a fortnight after—I did not know that Mr. Sims White was in Hooley's employment until I called up there—Hooley had a client who wanted money, and he wanted to sell some of these shares—I did not understand that client to be Mr. Ormerod at the time; I did after, when I saw the transfer—I did not get the transfer within two minutes—I agreed to buy the shares from him on Octo<lb/>ber 12th because he had a client who wanted to sell them; he saidthat he had a client who wanted to sell some—I brought the cheque in the time it would take me to go to Walsingham House from Victoria Street; but it is four years ago, and I am not going to swear to a thing four years ago—in fact, how should I have known that Mr. Ormerod was on the premises at the time?—I never knew of the existence of the man when I went first; I may have seen him and yet not known him—I suppose I swore at the Police Court: "I said I would take the shares on the terms he offered me; Mr. Hooley went out and brought in a form of transfer, which was already signed by Mr. Ormerod when he brought it to me; Hooley was away two or three minutes; Mr. Ormerod was on the premises"—I may have sand, "I will buy the shares and have gone back and got a cheque—it is correct that Hooley went out and brought in the transfer within two or three minutes—this is the transfer I received (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 47)—these numbers, of course, have been added; they were not in it then—I see here "I, Ernest Berkeley Ormerod"—the names "Ernest Berkeley Ormerod" are in print—I do not know if that is an unusual thing to see on a transfer; I have no experience of them—if you buy railway stock of brokers they do not trouble you with transfers until you are selling—I did not notice the fact.—I see it is so now, and I now know that Mr. Ormerod had two or three thousand shares in his name—I do not remember if Ormerod was present when the transfer was executed—it was not executed that day—the transfer was given to me, and I think I put it in my pocket, and I think the next day I signed it, because they took it—I said, "Well, what about this going to the company?"—and they sand, "We will do all that, pay the stamp and everything"—I notice that Ormerod witnesses my</p>

               <p>signature on the transfer, giving his address at "Walsingham House—I left the transfer with them for it to go to the company—I did not know that Ormerod was in Hooley's employ—he informed me he had very large sums of money invested with Hooley—a considerable time afterwards I knew that Ormerod was acting as nominee for Hooley—it might have been a month or six weeks, because I did not go there very frequently—I should not think it would be before I entered into the contract of November 26th—it was certainly not then, because I remember distinctly, I did not know who Mr. Ormerod was then—I did not know him for two months—I think It was two months; it might have been longer—the Christmas intervened, and they go away for a fortnight at Christmas enjoying them<lb/>selves—it was certainly before Christmas, I should think—I may tell you now I know that Mr. Ormerod was kept away from me for some reason, which, of course, I know now—it would certainly be correct to say that between October, 1900, and January, 1901, I had seen Ormerod on the premises at Walsingham House thirty of forty times—I only had a casual glance of him, and I perhaps should not know him again—there were a lot of people dodging about; they were all in and out; it was like a rabbit warren—I had seen the person who was described as Ormerod by January, 1901—I may have seem him thirty or forty times between October, 1900, and January, 1901—it is impossible to say; there were so many there—I cannot tell you how many times I had seen him—I am not in doubt about his being kept out of my way—at the Police Court I said, "Between October, 1900, and January, 1901, I had seen him"—that is, Ormerod—"on the premises at Walsingham House, I should think, thirty or forty times"—I might have seen him half-a-dozen times in a day—if I said I thought I saw him twenty, or thirty, or forty times, I was under the impression: I had, and I know no reason ten doubt that I may have seen him that number of times, but I only thought so—I say there, "I think I had seen him"; it is difficult to tell—it was my impression at the time I gave my evidence at the Police Court.; otherwise I should not have said it: now I should think it is rather too much; twenty would be nearer—it may have been thirty; I will not bind myself one way or the other—I should not think it was thirty—I did not make any com<lb/>plaint to Hooley that I had been deceived by Mr. Ormerod being repre<lb/>sented to me as a "distressed client"—I had been left with the shares, and everybody, if they are selling anything, makes some sort of excuse, other<lb/>wise they would very seldom sell; they must give a reason for selling which is a little exaggeration, as a rule—I do not say that I do not expect them to tell the truth about it; there may be some germ of truth, in it, and it becomes a very large plant when you want to get anything for the shares you bought—when I discovered that Ormerod was a clerk, or secre<lb/>tary, or whatever he was, or Hooley's, he did not put it very strongly about the "distressed client"; he merely said he had some shares to sell, and that a client wanted some money, and I assumed that if the man was selling shares he wanted the money—I felt perfectly safe—I had bought 10,000 shares, and I had got a guarantee—I had no cause of complaint against Hooley until I found the shares were not worth the paper they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140141"/>
               <p>were written on—I did not make any complaint about it—on Novem<lb/>ber 26th he had sold me 3,000 shares for £1,500—that is, the 3,000 shares for 10s. a shares—I represent now that the Construction shares are worth<lb/>less paper in a paper company; I do not think they are worth the paper they are written on—if they did have any assets at all, which I very much doubt, I do not think that the company would ever get the benefit of them; it is in the wrong Lands—I do not think there is anything to come to me in respect of the shares that I hold; I hope there will be; and no dividend of any kind to come to me on my shares—I do not know where it is to come from—I am a little doubtful that if the company were wound up, there would be nothing to come to me—I think there has been, some nefarious business going on that I know nothing about—I have no grounds for thinking that there would be a substantial dividend to come to me—whether there is sufficient to pay the debts and liabilities is a question for investigation—before I say if I think there would be enough to pay the debts and liabilities, I should like to know what the debts and liabilities are—I do not think my view is the same now as it was at the end of December, 1903; I think it looks a bit more ominous—in December, 1903, I thought that there might be some assets; I had heard rumours; in fact, I had heard of this Nottingam and Derby Tramway—I could hardly hold the view that at the end of 1903 there was sufficient to pay the debts and liabilities of the company, considering they owed me the divi<lb/>dend—I do not remember what it was—I had the documents before me, and I was in consultation with my solicitor, but the petition will tell you what my view was—I think that there would be a substantial dividend to come to the shareholders after paying the debts and liabilities, if it had its rights, because it would have the money of the British Electric Street Trams—on December 22nd, 1903, I only swore to some parts of that petition; the facts that were within my knowledge—the other part is in<lb/>formation obtained from the file—I was the petitioner in the Winding-up Court to get this company wound up on the ground that it had not paid me my money, and that it was a creature of Lawson's—that was not my reason for having the company wound up, so that I should get the money; I am not such a food as that—I presented the petition cm the ground that they owed me my money and many other grounds—I said, in December, "The assets are of considerable value, having in view what I thought they had got, and if prudently realised will be sufficient not only to pay and satisfy the company's debts and liabilities, but to pay a substantial dividend to the shareholders"—but the expenses are so very heavy—counsels fees, and that sort of thing—that was my honest belief at that time—I thought that this Railway Bill might be of some value, and I had heard that they were promoting <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Nottingham and Derby Tramway by that time—I was not on friendly terms with Hooley and Lawson—if a man stole your watch would you be?—they had £24,000 out of me—it was net what they were saying to me at that time that was influencing me, but I had heard it sand, not by them; God bless my heart, they would have told me it owned the whole of London—what I was dealing with was what I had heard from my solicitor, Mr. Joseph Davis, of Liverpool Street; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140142"/>
               <p>represented me in that matter—I went to him specially, because he had had these people through his hands—I was recommended to him—I trusted him—he know a great deal about it—he came to the conclusion that there was sufficient to pay a substantial dividend if prudently realised—in December, 1903, I believed the statement that I have got in my petition—the part I swore to I certainly believed, otherwise I should not have sworn to it; I do not think my solicitor would have allowed me to—a substantial dividend to the shareholders would be, I should think, about 6 or 7 per cent.—if wound up, I should assume they might get 5s. or 6s. in the pound, but there were very few; I was the only one—Sir Henry White and myself and Lawson were the people—it is all subject to the "prudently realised"—I do not know that I should have included Lawson's lot, but <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi> shareholders—I cannot say that it was my view that there would be a return to me of 5s. or 6s. a share; I thought there would be a return of something perhaps—if you come to the conclusion that you have shares in a company that has got nothing, if you get only 2s. it is not bad—Mr. Joseph Davis is acting on the petition now; he is still acting as my solicitor—he represents me in this particular thing, but in nothing else—I was recommended to him—he represented me on one occasion when he came to me and said Laws—on would give me £5,000 to withdraw the petition—in anything connected with this company he would represent me to a limited extent now; one has to be very careful—he represented me in connection with the affair? of the Electric Tramways Construction Company—I should think I now hold about 21,000 shares in the Construction Company—that would include these 12,000 preference, you know; the 6 per cent.—I paid £1,500 for 3,000 shares on Novem<lb/>ber 20th, and £5,450 for the half interest in Hooley's contract of Novem<lb/>ber 26th—I have paid £250 for 500 since, and another £250 for 500, but I have paid more than £7,450—I can tell you of about £1,400 or £1,500 more through the Construction, which is the same thing, because I parted with this money for the second contract—I have not received £250 for 500 shares that I sold, and that is my complaint—I have not received £500 as my share of the profit in the dealings in Construction shares; it is all nonsense—that money was given to me really for the changing of a post-dated cheque, or six post-dated cheques and knowing what I know now I would not change them at the price—I have seen this document; it is signed by me—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Ernest T. Hooley, Esq., Walsingham House, Piccadilly, V., London, December 21st, 1000. Dear Sir,—I have this day received a cheque from you of H. J. Law-sons for one thousand pounds, made payable to Mr. E. B.

I have handed you my cheque for five hundred pounds, and I am to retain the balance—five hundred pounds on account of profits re Electric Construction"—the only part of that that is true substantially is the giving of my cheque for £500—I do not mean that I put my hand to a document that is not true—I mean to say this: that there was no cheque for £1,000—it was made up in this way: Lawson's cheque for £500 and five post-dated cheques, a very long time post-dated—it is there and there is proof of it—as far as I know I knew of no profits nor of any deal</p>

               <p>in Electric Construction—I am doubtful about it—this is my signature, an acknowledgment; it begins, "I have this day received a cheque from you"—but I did not receive a cheque; I received £1,000, but I did not receive a cheque for £1,000—I should think that this statement that I received the cheque from Lawson for £1,000 made payable to Ormerod, and endorsed by Ormerod, dated February 10th, is not true, and I will tell you why; one does not lose a thousand pound cheque—there is no such thing as a thousand pound cheque that you can trace—I know this, that I had a £500 cheque of Lawson's, postdated, and I had five £100 cheques, and they were all post-dated, and they were-all handed back to Hooley in discharge of the £450 which was due on the contract to be paid on December 31st, and Hooley gave me his cheque for £50—there were five post-dated cheques for £100; I cannot say whether they were made payable to me, but I never had them in my possession—and one for £500, I think that was to be presented in February—the £1,000 cheque was not. given on. December 21st, 1900, and post dated to February 10th, 1901—that is what is said in this document—five cheques of £100 each, and one of £500—not cheques given in February, 1901, when in fact, Lawson did not meet, the cheques of £1,000 and had to enter into that arrange<lb/>ment with me by giving me those five £100 cheques and the one of £500—I do not accept that explanation: I could not accept an explanation from you without I had proof of it; I mean Hooley, of course, to me—I do not remember it, and what is more I do not think it is true—I did not receive £500 on account of profits re the Electric Construction, because there were no profits in Electric Construction as far as I know; and my reason for saying that is that I do not know that there was ever any transaction as regards profit of the Electric Construction, except between the two men—I suggest that I do not remember "on account of profits are Electric Construction" being there when I signed the receipt—I will say no more—I do not wish my Lord and the Jury to understand that those words have been added—I say I do not remember them being there when I signed this receipt, and I take that in conjunction with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> fact that I do not remember a cheque for £1,000 or any deal in connection with Electric Construction—I swore at the Police Court that I believed those words had been added since I signed it—I will not say if I still believe that: it would be unfair for me to say that, perhaps, but I do not remember them being there—(<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 75)—this is my counterfoil cheque book—(<hi rend="italic">Producing Exhibit</hi> 96)—it is dated December 21st, 1900 in the counterfoil of my cheque book, and under date December 21st, 1900 there is a cheque drawn for £500 which agrees with what is stated in the document: "I have handed you my cheque for £500 ": there is my return cheque—there is a counterfoil which shows, a cheque in favour of Sims White, and it has words which originally appeared and which have been struck out, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> which I believe are in my clerks writing—the wordy—that are struck out are in my clerk's writing: "Exchange for cheque of £1,000, payable February 10th, 1901, being £500 profit re E.M.C.C.

               <p>remained as it is there, it would be an absolute corroboration of this document under date December 21st, 1900, because there is no £1,000 cheque—if the counterfoil had not been struck out the words that do appear there would be what one would expect to find if this document had in fact been signed and executed on December 21st, 1900—the docu<lb/>ment and the counterfoil say it is a £1,000 cheque, "being £500 profit re Construction Company," and is what I do not agree with—on Decem<lb/>ber 21st, 1900, apparently a, cheque is drawn, according to the counterfoil, for £500 in exchange for the cheque of £1,000, dated February 10th, 1901, retaining the other £500 as profit in the Construction Company; that is what it looks like—<hi rend="italic">"re</hi> E.M.C.C." has been struck out on the counterfoil: it has been struck out in pencil, and by me—I went through the counterfoils of these cheques not necessarily for the Public Prosecutor; I was going through the thing at some previous time; this was not struck through at the end of last year; I think it was done a long time ago—I had a list of my cheques which I have paid to Hooley and these people a long time before that—I said at the Police Court., "Since I was cross-examined as to the words in <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 57, on account of profits re Electric Construction, I have looked at my counterfoil cheques; I went through those counterfoils for the purpose of preparing my statement for this case"—"this case "was this prosecution—I did go through my counter-foils for the purpose of preparing my statement in this prosecution, and I had been through them before; as evidence of my stupidity, I had been through them three or four times, but not without noticing it—I went through my cheques, and I wanted to find out what the amounts were paid for—I came to this, and the very first thing I did was to look in my paying in book to find a cheque for £1,000, and I could not find the cheque for £1,000—it them occurred to me that I owed Hooley at that, time swine money—it was not due, but ho had a happy knack of getting it before it was due, and I knew that on December 31st I had to pay Hooley £450—I then found in my book about this time a cheque for £50—says I to myself, "Why, this is the £450 I have paid Hooley, and he has given me the £50 back ": but that was not so—really what happened was this, and the reason why I was muddled was this; that I had the five £100 cheques; I had never had them in my possession, other<lb/>wise they would have been in my paying in book, and I could not make out that payment, but it really was that Hooley took the five £100 cheques <hi rend="italic">red</hi> hot as they were, and at the last he sand, "There is £50 for you"—that was on my £450. That is the answer, because a £1,000 cheque does not disappear, and I could not understand what that meant, "by profit on Electric Construction," because I knew I had no deal in them—my clerks name is Charles Watford: this counterfoil is in his handwriting—the Treasury have got a cheque which corresponds with that for £500—looking at that counterfoil the words, "on account of profits in the Construction Company" may have been in this document on December 21st, 1900, when I signed it—looking at this counterfoil would not make me think so but very probably they were—I do net remember them; that is all I can say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140145"/>
               <p>—this is very likely what would have happened—the counterfoil is in my clerks writing—I would say to my clerk, "Give me a blank cheques" and he would say, "What for?"—I would say, "It is going to be drawn for J. Sims White: I am going to change a £1,000 cheque re Electric Con<lb/>struction"—I might have said that to him, because Hooley would have said the night before, "I shall want to see you, Paine"—he frequently did so, especially when he wanted any money—"Bring up a cheque with you; I want you to cash me a cheque for £1,000"—if you produce the deal in the Electric Construction and produce the £1,000 cheque I will give you an answer at once, but you know there is none in existence"—as I understood my explanation is that I would have given my clerk the instructions which would have caused him to make that note on the coun<lb/>terfoil, thinking that I was going to have the £1,000 cheque, but I did not have it—I do not say I did not get £500; I do not say that at all—what I complain of is that, it is "Profits re Electric"—I am £23,500 our, instead of £24,000—I do not know that it-matters particularly, but I do not remember it—if I got the £500, I do not remember in what deal it was, and I do not remember any deal in the Construction—the words, "Profit re Construction Company" may have emanated from Hooley the night before to me, and I told my clerk—that agrees with this document, but I do not remember those words, and I defy you to produce the £1,000 cheque or show me any deal in it.</p>

               <p>that the Street Company's shares would be very valuable, and the Con<lb/>struction Company would reap the profit—with honest men in the ordinary course, if nobody diverted the profit which should come to the Construction Company, it would be then a valuable thing for the Construction Com<lb/>pany—I know now that there were other schemes on paper—I should think about that time they had got nothing ready but the plans—as a matter of fact, I do not believe they got the deposit—I understood there was a deposit to be put up—I know they stated that a great deal was done subsequently to this company, and I believe later on, two or three years afterwards, they did have something in the House, but it fell through—the scheme was partly an electric tube railway scheme, and partly an open line—I believe some miles of it were open—I saw the plans at Walsingham House in turning them over—they were merely plans of the different neigh<lb/>bourhoods they were going through, as they would have to do, of course, for the purpose of getting their Orders and for the purpose of promoting their Bill in Parliament—at that time they were also about to promote the British Electric Street Tramways—I think Hooley showed me a pros<lb/>pectus of that with a lot of tremendously tall writing—that was a scheme going to be promoted, only it was thought there was going to be a profit which in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> ordinary course would go to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Construction Company—the prospectus reads: "That the company was formed to construct and work lines of electric railway and tramway licensed by special Act of Par<lb/>liament or by municipal or other authorities, and to extend the service of tram vehicles in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> town, and to construct electric tramways upon them overhead, overhead wire and trolley system, formed to take over and equip electric tramways," and so forth. Substantially, it was to be formed for constructing and working tramways and to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> Acts of Parliament for them and to equip old tramways into electrical tramways; to do every<lb/>thing I should think in connection with that sort of thing, and did nothing—part of the scheme was of issuing the Street Company so that there was a Founders Syndicate to be formed also for founders shares—I do not know that the subscribers are the subscribers to the founders shares—the prospectus does not seem to be very clear; it does not say so—I take it it means in connection with this company—it 19 the names that attracted me with respect to both the Street Company and the Founders Company—it begins with Sir Hiram Maxim; then <hi rend="italic">there</hi> are some very old names—in connection with this scheme those who applied for shares in the Street Company had a right to a certain number of shares in the Founders' Company—that appears on the face of the prospectus—I do not know if there is anything unusual about that—there was no mention by Hooley that if the various schemes were successful there would be a dividend of about 16s.—he told me definitely that there would be a dividend—there was no discussion about it, simply a statement that there would be a dividend of 16s. a share—I am very sorry-to say I did believe it—I was fool enough to believe it—I did not go-into the question of whether it had been made—I accepted Hooley's statement—we did not know before this that he was anxious to get my £1,500—I once thought I was a smart business man—I knew nothing about Construction shares until Hooley</p>

               <p>said they were worth about £3—I had had a very short; conversation at that time—I think he said there would be a dividend of 16s.—on Novem<lb/>ber 26th I think Hooley told me that part of the dividend which we were speaking about at this interview would come out of the promotion of the Streets Company—I will not be sure whether he saidit on the-26th on the day after the receipt of the telegram—I came up the next morning and saw him, and I think he may have said that on that date—do not think he saidthat they were promoting another company, and a part of the dividend would" come out of that company—if I said that before I must have thought so then—my remembrance was so closely pressed on" one and another that it was impossible to absolutely be certain about it—I knew they were promoting another company; you twist and turn me about so—that may have taken place on the 27th; it also took place on the 26th and was repeated—he told me about the whole thing very much further the nest day when I was going to enter into the contract with him—the statements that he made were about the value of the concern—I was purchasing the shares, and he told me statements which made me purchase them—he repeated all the statements next day and enlarged upon them—he told me they would be paying 16s. in a few days; I should take that to mean at once—I think he told me that it would really come out of the company and some other things that they had got—he told me there would be the 16s. dividend on the 26th—I do not think I asked him where it was coming from; he told me all I wanted to know without, my asking any questions; that was to get me to buy the share—I cannot remember the exact words a man said four or five years ago—he may hare said at once or in a few days—he told me about the dividend first, and he may have said that the dividend was coming partly out of this other company—I think we discussed it generally, because it was a big dividend; it looked an enormous dividend, but I am under the impression it was "Construction"—it would be a very natural thing for me to ask him—I may have heard where the dividend was coming from—I think he showed me the prospectus of the Streets Company: I understood it was the company they were bringing out—I was to buy 3,000 shares £1 fully paid, at 10s. a share, for £1,500 upon which a dividend was to be paid in a few days of 16s. a share, and he saidthey were worth £3 or £4 each, and it was only at a sacrifice he sold them to me because he had got some accounts due: he had to pay some farming accounts, and there was his life assurance, and buying land and that sort of thing and he wanted money—I should think the dividend would certainly depend upon whether or not this Electric Street Tramway were a part of the scheme—it had not. occurred to me that the 16s. dividend had been earned; I was under the impression it was for managing any tramways and-contracting for tramways—all I have spoken of is with reference to schemes; that is to say, provisional orders, orders to be applied for, orders that they had, and powers that they had to run trams: not one word about owning a and or anything of that kind; I was never told that, it was my impression; bad heard of the thing—that is the view I got myself: they did not tell me that—I do not think they said anything to me at that interview about"</p>

               <p>shares in the Street Company being distributed amongst the Construction Company's shareholders besides the 16s. dividend in cash—I say "they," but I had only seen Hooley at the time; I do not think he said anything about it—all that was to be received or that was spoken of was the 16s. cash dividend—I do not remember if he said anything at all about any dividend in shares beyond the 16s; I have a vague remembrance, but at all events I cannot speak with any certainty, that he did mention some<lb/>thing about that—I do not know if I said at the Police Court anything about Hooley having told me on November 26th, 1900, when I bought the shares, about their being worth £3 or £4—if I was asked I should have said so; I should think I was not—all that was said was said in the presence of Mr. White, and he said he was making a great sacrifice—when I was asked here yesterday or the day before as to what took place on the 26th, I did not say one word of Hooley having said at that interview that the shares were worth £3 or £4; but he said at every interview that I had bought them at a great sacrifice and they were worth very much more, a general statement which I was fool enough to believe: I admit I was a fool—I swear at that interview on November 26th he told me those shares were worth £3 or £4—I was never asked the question before—it was never asked me about every share he sold, but he has told me they were worth four or five times as much—every share he sold—I do not think I have ever been asked that question as to what Hooley said as to the value of the shares—I do not think he has sold a share to anybody that he did not make that statement to—I was there, and Mr. White was there—if I were to mention everything that took place at that interview we should be here for a month, all the tales I was told and all the lies—I cannot give you the details of everything, but I can give you the gist of it; it was a very-short interview—but you may depend he said that, otherwise I was not quite such a fool as to swallow 10s. for 16s. shares—he repre<lb/>sented to me they were worth £3 or £4 at that time or would be worth it, and he quoted his Dunlops and everything at that time and at every time—I was buying shares at that time, as he was pressed for money, for 10s. a share, which were worth between £3 or £4 a share, and upon which a dividend of 16s. a share in cash was to be paid in a few days; that was the tale I was fool enough to believe, I admit—at the interview on the 26th he said to me that he was going to see the man who had a lot of these Construction shares, the bulk of them—I knew before I left there on the 26th that he had told me he was going to see that evening the man who was the owner of the bulk of the shares—he-did not say it was for the purpose of business that he was going to see the owner of the shares; he said he would be seeing the man that night—he did not tell me he was going to see him with reference to the Construction Company—he had already told me that they belonged to a gentleman who held nearly all the shares, but it was previous to my buying the 3,000—he said that he got the 3,000 off this gentleman; that he bought them from him—he never said that he was going to see him about the shares the same night—as a matter of fact, he did not want me to let anybody know—he said, "You must not let anybody know that I have sold these to</p>

               <p>you"—before I left I did not know who was the owner of those shares—lie did not tell me it was Lawson, the little man; he did not use that expression—lie did not explain to me that "the little man" was Lawson—he said that the next day because I asked him what "the little man" meant in the telegram—I got a telegram from him on November 26th, sent off apparently in the evening to Brighton and received at 9; it begins, "Just seen the little man"—I did not know who he was—I said, "Who do you mean by the little man"—he said, "'That is the man I spoke to you about having the largest number of shares"—that was-after I had bought the 3,000 shares—he told me at the interview that Henry Lawson was the man referred to as "Mr. Lawson"—I remember now he said, "Mr. Lawson, the man who made nearly half a million out of the British Motor"—he said he had done a lot of business with him—he said, "Harry J. Lawson, who owned nearly all the shares in the Construction Company"—I do not know that he said "Harry J."; I think it was "Mr. Lawson"—he told me on the 28th that his wife had got a contract with-Lawson with reference to the Construction Company's shares—at the Police Court I said "Hooley said, 'Now, I will tell you what I will do: my wife has got a contract with Mr. Lawson with reference to the Electric Construction and Maintenance shares: I said Yes; I will speak to you to-morrow about it,' and the matter passed off"—that is correct; nothing else took place about the Construction Company—I pledge my oath that Hooley-told me on the 27th that Lawson had made half a million out of British Motors—he may have said so on the day before or the day after, and that was corroborated by Mr. White—the day before yesterday I swore Lawson had made a quarter of a million out of the British Motor; it has not grown from the day before yesterday from a quarter of a million to half a million"—I should think half a million is true—I have given the source of the information—it may have been a quarter of a million; I do not know; he said something about it—I do not know which is true; my source of in<lb/>formation is from my solicitor—no, it was half a million—you are not to understand that when I make an answer about this conversation it is from what my solicitor told me—my solicitor had investigated Lawson's affairs—when I said half a million, I was thinking of what my solicitor said—there was no reason really for my saying that, except, of course, it was all the tales told me; there was no truth in them—I swore that Hooley told me at that interview that Lawson was the gentleman who had made half a million, or a quarter of a million I should say, out of the British Motor—Hooley told me a quarter of a million—when I said half a million I should have said a quarter of a million; that is all; my memory does not play me false—I was thinking of what my solicitor told me—I saw Hooley on November 28th—that is the date I gave as the date upon which the contract was arrived at by which I acquired the half interest in his contract with Lawson—at that interview he produced to me the contract dated November 26th between him and Lawson—when he produced it I observed that it was dated November 26th, 1900—so the contract, which is alleged now to be bogus, was put before me, and I saw that it had been made on the very day on which I had made my contract for the</p>

               <p>3,000 shares: and I knew at the time that Hooley told me that he was going to see that night the owner of the bulk of the Construction Com<lb/>pany's shares—I knew that he had seen him that night by his telegram—I did not know that this contract had been arrived at on the night of November 26th—I should assume by that being the date it would be—I do not remember his showing me the contract on the 27th; he showed it me on the 28th—I do not think I had seen it before—when I gave my cheque on the 28th I saw it—I do not think I saw it on <hi rend="italic">the</hi> 27th—if I swore two days ago that he showed me it on the 27th must have been under the impression I had seen it then,—I am rather confused about those three days; it is four or five years ago—I am rather confused as to whether I had seen that contract or not—I have a pretty fair memory as to what took place as to the statement made by Hooley; I am quite certain of that, otherwise I should not have paid my money—I bought the shares on the statement of Hooley, and I thought I had bought a good thing—I thought they were valuable shares—on this 28th, when he showed me that contract I observed that in that contract there are "fifteen Dublin Distillers' Company, Limited, shares, which he was given according to this contract for the right, whatever it was, that he acquired under this contract with Lawson—I understood that is what he paid as purchase money, subject to a further sum lower down—he did not point it put; I read the contract—he had given the 1,500 shares for this right, and was to get a quarter of the proceeds made out of dealing with 243,000 shares; those are the words from the contract; that would be selling the shares—the words are: "Agree to divide the proceeds made out of dealing with the 243,000 shares"—before Hooley could get any share of those proceeds he had to pay out all his shares of the proceeds, £3,500; I think it says there, that Lawson was to have something—before any proceeds could go to Mrs. Hooley, £3,500 out of her share of the proceeds would be deducted by Lawson: "Three-fourths to Lawson"—this is the division of the profits—"one-fourth to Mrs. Hooley, Mrs. Hooley not to receive any money until she has paid to Mr. Lawson, out of her proceeds, the sum of £3,500"—that means that £14,000 must be realised before any money comes to Hooley—I thought if Mr. Lawson had sold 3,500 shares, which I considered he could sell at £1, then Mrs. Hooley would be entitled to her certificates—I have a very different impression now, of course—I do not admit that it means there would have to be 14,000 realised before Mrs. Hooley would receive anything in respect of her share—what I think is "That if I had been Mrs. Hooley, I should have said: You have sold 3,500 of These shares: now give me my certificate: because I should have con<lb/>sidered Lawson had had the balance: "Now give me the certificates or my share, or the transfer"—I should have wanted them then if they had been paid—my view was that after 3,500 shares had been sold she was entitled to demand her transfers and certificates for these shares, or her title, or something of that sort, notwithstanding their being under the control of Lawson—what I am now swearing is what I swore was my view when this agreement was made of November 28th, because I should have wanted my property, my share—of course, this is a matter as to whether Mrs. Hooley</p>

               <p>would have insisted upon taking the first lot that he sold and saying: Now I have cleared you off; or Lawson saying: I shall sell so many before I come to <hi rend="italic">yours;</hi> sell three-fourths and then come to yours—I cannot quite remember if Hooley told me anything about the Dublin Distillers' shares being quoted on the Stock Exchange; he said they were readily saleable at £5 each—I do not think anything about the Stock Exchange stuck in my mind; I think the Distillers impressed me most—I am prepared to say Hooley said these shares were worth £5 each—I was not at all susp<lb/>icious about it; it was merely casual, of course—since I have heard it is different, but before I trusted him—then I had no suspicion; it is self-evident by the proof of my cheques—he never said that these shares were quoted or dealt with on the Stock Exchange—I do not know if he referred to the Stock Exchange at all; I will not say, I forget for the minute-7 I do not think he said anything about the Stock Exchange in connection with it—I cannot tell; I do not know that he did; my impression is that he said nothing about the Stock Exchange—if my memory serves me right, he said nothing whatever about the Stock Exchange—I know now that these shares were quoted in the Stock Exchange list; I wish I had known then what I know now—I did not look at financial papers in November, 1900—the only paper I should look at would be the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, to see the price of the railway stock; I was rather anxious previous to that time, because I had already lost my money—I do not think I asked him what the shares were, because it was clear I knew about this—I saw then that they were £5 shares fully paid—he did not tell me that under this con<lb/>tract he would be giving £5,000 to Lawson; this document showed me what he was giving—I assumed Lawson got these shares and would get this money; then, I thought he would be entitled to a share—my contract of December 13th was this, summarising the situation; I was to get half of Hooley's interest in that document of November 26th, and for that I was to give up 5,000 Siberians, pay £2,000 and £450 by December 31st—Hooley was to deposit the contract of November 26th with me which he made with Lawson—I was to have the charge and custody of the contract, and he agreed to divide with me equally all the profits that he made in the transaction; meaning thereby, I take it, that anything he made in selling the shares I was to have half of; and I take it if he did not do anything, I was to take half my share—I reckoned, when I bought a fourth of Mrs. Hooley's interest, I was entitled to 30,000 shares so soon as this latter part had been paid, this £3,500—after the £3,500 was paid I should have expected my shares, because Hooley might say, "I refuse to do any transactions"—I notice that under the contract the shares were to be sold from time to time, and that Lawson was to have the arranging of the price at which they were to be sold; if he had carried that out, I should have had no complaint; if he had been able to sell them there would have been no argument about it—I notice it is in the proceeds of the shares that I was to get the profit under the contract of November 26th and that if the shares were sold I was to get the money they fetched—the words are: "I agree to divide with you all the proceeds I make out of dealing with the shares"; the 245,000, and then the proceeds are to be</p>

               <p>divided in certain proportions which are there stated; my contract with Hooley as agent for Mrs. Hooley of December 3rd, 1900 (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 14), cor<lb/>rectly describes the transaction between us—when I got it, I raised no ob<lb/>jection to it—my view was that Hooley sold me half the profit resulting from the sale of the 245,000 shares—that is what I mean after payment of what was due; the £3,500—the £450 under that was to be paid on December 31st—there was no cheque on December 31st—I did not in fact pay it until somewhere about February—I saw Lawson after November 28th and before December 6th; he called up at Hooley's, who spoke about the pooling agreement—I saw Lawson; he gave me some information about the Construction Company—I knew then that he was the principal person in the Construction Company, or I was informed he was—there was not a great deal of discussion—he told the of the company's potentialities and that sort of thing—and that the Railway Bill was going on well—that he thought it was sure to pass—that the—shares would then be very valuable—that I would then be a rich man, and that he should advise me, if I could get a chance, to buy the others—he definitely stated that he should advise me, when Hooley was hard up, to buy from him the other shares—I never knew Hooley but what lie wanted money—I assumed that all that was contingent upon the railway scheme going through and being prosperous; and the other business of the company—the shares would not go up, naturally, without the business was prosperous—as far as my knowledge now goes, what Lawson told me at that time was not true—certainly I must say that a part of his statement is true and some is not—they were not doing a prosperous business—they had done nothing except having a large sum of money—I said at the Police Court, "As to what Lawson told me on the 10th December, 1900,"I made a mistake in the date at that time, "It is true as far as my knowledge now goes that the Construction Com<lb/>pany had orders in various parts of the country and were applying for others, and that they were doing a good business, and that the Railway Bill was going splendidly and was sure to pass"—I believed that in June, 1904, but I have heard something since—I found out that orders I thought they had got they had not got—I had been through my books and counterfoils for the purpose of making out my statement—Lawson may have told me at that interview that he thought there would be big divi<lb/>dends—I do not think that he told me that he thought there would be a dividend shortly; I rather think he said that the expenses were very heavy, and that they had not got as much money as they anticipated. He led me to believe it was very expensive getting these orders, and the Railway Bill, and all that—I suppose that is true if they did the work, but I had no means of knowing whether they did—I was naturally look<lb/>ing for the 18s.—I do not think at my first interview with Lawson that we discussed dividends—there was hardly breathing time for the man—it was only a few days afterwards. You do not expect that I was going to put a pistol to his head and say, "<hi rend="italic">Give</hi> me my dividends. "It was only two or three days—he may have said something about an ulti<lb/>mate dividend; I am not sure about that—he might have said: "You will be a rich man, and these things will pay big dividends," but I should</p>

               <p>not say anything about that particular dividend, because it was only two or three days—it is generally announced by letter when a dividend is going to be paid or at a meeting, or in the newspapers, in an ordinary company—I do not think anything was said by him about that particular dividend being paid, because, you see, the company was on the <hi rend="italic">tapis</hi> then, or really I think it was brought out—I mean the British Electric Street Trams—he did not tell me that they would be getting a dividend, and that the dividend would come really out of the Street Company—now I remember, I think he was a little bit upset—there were some hostile criticisms about the company in the newspapers—he never mentioned the Street Company. If there was a dividend it would come generally—he may have said on December 10th that he expected there would be a divi<lb/>dend shortly, because it would come mainly out of the Street Company—he may have said it—I will admit perhaps he said it. Good gracious! I cannot tell exactly what the man said—I do not know that it might not have been two or three days later—he said—that there would be big divi<lb/>dends, and I took it they would mainly come out of the British Electric Tramways Company—you twist and turn about so, you do not ask me straightforward questions; or you want to make it appear that I do, for your own purposes—I have no desire to say anything unfair—why should If—you pick out little things, and after five days in the Police Court; it is your duty to make me out as bad as they are, and to make me as bad as possible—I know that whatever you are going to make me is founded on answers that I am making on oath in the box to the questions you are putting to me, and nothing else; I have nothing to complain of—he may have told me at that interview that the Construction Company had promoted the Street Company, but I knew it—really, I do not know if he told me—he mentioned a lot of big names, gentlemen whose names appear on the prospectus, first-class men—I understood you to say that the names on the prospectus belonged to the Founders' Syndicate—I said I thought they belonged to the Street Company—I think what you said was correct—you know best which it is, because you have all the papers before you—you have documentary proof of what the real facts are—I was duly impressed with the names—under my contract with Hooley I was to have deposited with me Hooley's contract with Lawson—and that was deposited—on December 21st there was another transaction—I have never seen <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 56 before—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Walsingham House, Picca<lb/>dilly, December 21st, 1900 Received from H.J.

"I observe there is a comma after £500.I suggest a comma can cover up a full stop. What I say is that, in my opinion, the words I have mentioned have been added since"—I think you are incorrect when you say I swore that those words that you have read are added—I swore at that time, and I believed at that time that the words "re profit Elec<lb/>tric Construction "were the only words, but you have read a long state<lb/>ment—"I do not think the receipt was in the words just read to me. If the words and I am to retain the balance, £500, on account of profits re Electric Construction are at the end of the receipt I should say they have been added since"—when I suggested that those words had been added I did not remember anything about the counterfoil; I did not think it referred to this counterfoil—I knew I had struck out of the counterfoil the words "on account-of profits re Construction"—when I was being cross-examined I had only the cheque before me and no counter<lb/>foil<lb/>it never occurred to me during that cross-examination that I had struck out those very words in my own counterfoil cheque book no more than the notes I made when I was going through the thing—I did not strike those words out in that counterfoil cheque book about the profits re Construction when I was preparing my statement for this prosecution, but previous to that, when I was going through the cheques and trying to find out what they were paid for—when I was preparing my stat<lb/>ement for this case I did not go through my cheques; they were already prepared—I said at the Police Court on July 7th: "Since I was cross<lb/>examined as to the words in the Exhibit 57 'on account of profits re Electric Construction, I have looked at all counterfoil cheques; I went through those counterfoils for the purpose of preparing my statement for this case"—that is true—"and I was then not able to trace the credit of £1,000, or identify this cheque; I look at the counterfoil of a cheque dated December 21st, 1900: as it originally stood it was in the hand<lb/>writing of my clerk Matford; produced is the cheque of which this is the counterfoil—the counterfoil as it originally stood written by my clerk before I drew the cheque of 'December 21st, 1900, J. Sims White exchange for cheque of £1,000, payable February 10th, 1901, being £500 profit re Construction Company; having looked at this since I gave my answer as to the words 'on account of profit re Electric Con<lb/>struction,' I think now that very likely those words were there"; those were the words in the receipt—"I still say I have no recollection of the words being there; I have no recollection of any profits being mentioned on the Construction Company in connection with that transaction; there is an addition in ink on this counterfoil, See £450 paid for these shares, November 28th,'made by me when going through my counterfoils for the purpose of my statement"—I went through the counterfoil for the</p>

               <p>purpose of preparing my statement for this case—twelve months previous to that I—went through my cheques for the purpose of tracing the payment of that £450 which was due under the contract made November 28th signed December 3rd, 1900—when I could not trace that cheque for £4-50 I made the alteration in ink which appears as the addition to the counter<lb/>foil of December 21st, 1900—there was no question of a criminal prosecu<lb/>tion then—looking at the counterfoil and at the contract of December 3rd under which I had to pay £450, it would appear from that counterfoil that that £450 was paid in respect of that transaction—that was so, and that, when I wrote it, was my impression—with that impression that was my object in making the entry for-my own information—I went through these cheques before, and then I should naturally go through them when 1 was preparing my statement—I said just now I went through these counterfoils for the purpose of preparing my statement for this case twelve months ago—and twelve months before that I had been through them—I may have added those words of £450 twelve months ago—that was when I found out there was a £50 cheque paid me by Hooley—I thought that was money I lent him, because I constantly lent him small sums—you can-see that from the books; as a matter of fact, I was entirely mistaken, and it was in reference to this receipt of £1,000, and the reason I made the mistake was that I could not find the £1,000 cheque, and I knew nothing of any deal—I cannot tell you how long after that it was that I added the pencil words "to make up the £500"; I cannot pledge myself—it is evident I had left that £500 in abeyance; I did not know what it was until I looked through my paying in books, and I found this cheque, and that is what I thought it was; as a matter of fact, there was a £50 cheque that Hooley gave me later on, and it is easy for you to clear it up by showing me this £1,000 cheque—in February, 1901, there are five post-dated cheques from Lawson of £100 each drawn by H.J. Lawson—the receipt is dated "Walsingham House, Piccadilly, London, February 25th, 1901 Received from Alfred John Paine, Esq."—I did not receive them—it is "Received from me"—"Received from Alfred John Paine, Esq., the sum of four hundred and fifty pounds sterling, as per agreement of December 3rd, 1900, by five post-dated cheques of £100 (one hundred pounds), each drawn by H.J. Lawson, should all or any of such cheques be returned unpaid no liability is to attach to A.J. Paine"—I gave five post-dated cheques of £100 each drawn by Lawson to Hooley, which he accepted in payment of the £450 due under the agreement of December 3rd—it was arranged there like that, but previous to that I' had given £500. This particular £500 was in exchange for a cheque of Lawson's, but it was made payable to Hooley. The question of the £4-50 was mentioned, the £450 that I had to pay at some later date; on December 31st, and not February, and Hooley said: "That will do: these being post-dated cheques, not one of them comes due until a "week after this time."So we put the matter straight. Really, he had hypothecated this money at that time on the 21st for what was payable on December 31st, and we put the matter straight by him giving me £50 out of it, which, by-the-bye, it says nothing "about here; so that you can imagine how incomplete these things are, and that settled, up the</p>

               <p>deal—those five £100 cheques if met, of course, would be £500 for £450 only, they were not owing by me: I do not admit that; it had already been paid, although it was readjusted there, because Hooley had used this £500. It is not as if I had a cheque from Lawson when I gave Hooley one payable to him. I gave the cheque to Hooley on December 21st—I do not think there were five post-dated cheques at this time which were weekly cheques, that is, dated at week's dates from February 10th, 1901.I should ask you to look, because that would mean that one had been paid and I could not have handed it over to Hooley—there was a cheque of £500 which was paid, I think on February 8th or 10th, and that was the cheque that was given—on February 23rd, 1901, there was a payment of £500 by a cheque of Lawson's. That payment would be the cheque that was handed to me on this date, a post-dated cheque—that is another thing altogether; that was a loan to Lawson at the re<lb/>quest of Hooley—the cheque in my paying-in book on February 8th is Lawson's cheque dated February 22nd—this is the counterfoil which appears here; it is in my writing—the counterfoil of the 22nd says: "Re transaction of December 21st one cheque £500 and five £100's; Hooley took these for £450 due under contract Construction Company; gave me £50 cheque for balance"—I wrote that when I found out about this cheque—I got this book from my bank—they have had it all the time, and a lot more—I do not know the month when I made this note in pencil on that paying-in slip—I should think eighteen months ago; it was when I found out this mistake on the counterfoil—you will see lots of notes in pencil. I will show you some more, but they have nothing to do with you: not that I care—there is nothing that I am ashamed of. I say there are other pencil marks there—if you look through the book and draw my attention to it I will tell you what it is—there is nothing in that book now which is connected with this case—I do not mind if you are seeking to find out anything more—I do not know that this pencil entry on this counterfoil of February 22nd, 1901, correctly repre<lb/>sents the transaction; I did not make it for you; it is my own private note—I may have missed two or three words out—if I am asked to answer a question on a document which you read, I am entitled to look at it—notwithstanding it I say that Hooley had his money on December 21st—the ultimate result of the transaction that represented, but notwithstand<lb/>ing that, the man had had his money before it was due, as he usually did—it does and it does not correctly represent the transaction, like a man having a coat—it does fit and it does not; it is all according how he stands—that does not correctly represent it, because it had nothing about the £50 cheque in there—it was such a novelty—I never had the cheque on February 10th, 1901, for £1,000 which is referred to in <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 57—my reason for saying that is that I can find no trace of it—it would have gone in the ordinary course into my bank, but I can find no trace of it—that cheque was not in existence to my knowledge; I could not find any trace of it—I did not think it had any existence; a man does not take a £1,000 cheque and lose it—I do not think I gave notice of dishonour of that—I do not think it ever presented it—I do not think it was presented—I did not bring an action on it—</p>

               <p>Mr. B. Walker Kemp was my solicitor—this is a letter from him to Lawson: "February 11th, 1901, to Mr. H.J. Lawson, 40, Holborn Viaduct Sir—I hereby give you notice that your cheque for £1,000, drawn on the National Bank of Scotland, Limited, Nicholas Lane, E.C., dated Feb<lb/>ruary 10th, 1901, and made in favour of Mr. Ormerod, and endorsed 'by him to Mr. Paine, has this day been presented for payment and returned dishonoured. Unless the £1,000 be paid to Mr. Paine, or to me, as his solicitor, by 12 o'clock to-morrow, I am instructed to proceed against you to recover the same. Yours, etc., B. Walker Kemp"—that is the cheque referred to in <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 57, which says: "I have this day received a cheque from you of H.J. Lawson's for one thousand pounds, made payable to Mr. E.B. Oemerod, and endorsed by that gentleman, dated February 10th I have handed you my cheque for £500, and I am to retain the balance, £500 on account of profits re Electric Construction"—I now see that letter for the first time; but what happened was that as a matter of fact these cheques were given in exchange—I said it never existed; I did not know of its existence; it is the same as I thought it was; the £450 for the other—I mean I had forgotten all about it—to tell you the truth I have had to see Lawson on several other cheques, and I got confused—the £1,000 cheque dated February, 1901, when it became due was dis<lb/>honoured, and in lieu of that I received a cheque for £500 from Lawson and five post-dated cheques of £100 each—there is no doubt about it, but I should like to see the returned cheque—my solicitor or I to my know<lb/>ledge have not had it, and there can be no personal object in my solicitor keeping it—I asked Lawson himself about the £1,000, and he did not know anything about it, and he will tell you so, no doubt—there was a writ issued on February 16th, 1901, by me against H.J. Lawson and E. Berkeley Ormerod—you will find some Writs' about with the same name, "Berkeley Ormerod"; that confused me; I had forgotten all about it absolutely—the endorsement of the writ is: "The plaintiff's"(that is me) "claim is for £1,000 and 5s. due on a cheque drawn by the defendant, H.J. Lawson, and endorsed by the defendant E. Berkeley Ormerod; and interest as hereinafter specified.

The plaintiff claims interest at 5 per. <hi rend="italic">cent</hi>, on the said sum of £1,000 from date hereof or until judgment"—this is the notice of dishonour—I do not know if I told my solicitor on February 26th, 1901, that this action had been compromised; he would know it, because he would have the costs—I had other actions against him; it might have been in reference to that; if you will show me the letter I shall know—I may or may not have told my solicitor, Mr. Kemp, that a settlement had been arranged of this matter, and that cheques had been given to me settling this debt for £1,000, because the others were post-dated, and it would not have been settled, I take it, if these cheques had come back—that would be my opinion of it—I do not know if instead of the £1,000 cheque on which I was bringing, an action I took a cheque</p>

Lawson, Esq., dated February 26th, "Sir,—Paine <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Yourself—I understand from my client that you have arranged a settlement in this matter and that you have paid cheque settling the debt, £1,000, leaving the costs to be paid. I am willing to agree these at five guineas. Please send me cheque by bearer or during the day. You will, of course, understand I' must proceed to judgment for the costs if not paid—Yours truly, B. Walker Kemp"—I do not know that I had instructed Mr. Kemp to that effect; I am not responsible for that—I suppose-1 told him it was settled, and he wanted his costs as—he was entitled to—he had to get substituted service I suppose—I do-not know whether I told him so; it does not impress me in any way—I took the £1,000 and Mr. Kemp wanted his costs and he was entitled to them—I should think this is Mr. Kemp's receipt for the five guineas costs closing the matter;—it looks like his writing; it is dated March 5th; a long time past the day I notice—the five post-dated cheques which were received as part of this settlement by me were handed over to Hooley according to the receipts; that is when I got them; on that date; that gave Hooley cheques for £500, and as I only had to pay £450, he gave me a cheque for £50 balance, having had the previous £500—he had the £1,000, and gave me £50 back, and £450 settled that was owing on the other—as to the receipt of February 25th, there is no doubt I have made a very serious mistake there; I admit it: I had forgotten all about it, and I have made a mistake, and I am very sorry for it; there is no doubt when I gave that evidence I was under that impression—I denied the existence of the £1,000 cheque; honestly I did deny it; until you produced that letter I did not know of its existence—if you had not produced those letters I should have continued to deny it, because instead of £1,000, it was in six cheques instead of one—that is all; it is practically the same thing, although I am sorry I made the mis<lb/>take—I said in reference to the letter of December 21st, 1900, about the account of profits, Electric Construction: "The only part of that that is true substantially is the giving of my cheque for £1,000"; and I believed it then—as to the £1,000 cheque, I must have gone to the bank, having kept it in the safe till it was due, and taken up a slip of paper there, and asked them to put it through quick—I had forgotten all about this £1,000 cheque when I made the entry in the counterfoil on Decem<lb/>ber 21st—whatever object should I have in making an entry of this sort—I had forgotten it right up to the date when you told me—I have got my paying in book for February, 1901—I keep three banking accounts; one a collecting account, what we pay in (that applies to changes and that sort of thing) and two others—I have been looking for the counterfoil of the paying in slip for the £1,000 cheque—it is impossible for me to tell if I paid it in, because I cannot trace it—you shall have the other paying in books for February, 1901; I did not bring them this morning—I think I have looked through them: they are numbered there: they are all in one account, from May 1st, 1900, until October 13th.1902: "they relate to</p>

               <p>only one account—the counterfoil of the paying in book is what you have in your hand—I do not think that there are a number which are not dated at all; there is the stamp on them; there is no other date; there is no object in having two dates on—I should think the probabilities are that I did not present the £1,000 cheque myself—if it was not an open cheque I should not present it; I could, but it would be no use, being a crossed cheque—the chances are this would happen: Sometimes one might pay it into the bank at once; what could ordinarily happen would be this: It would lie in the safe until it was due to pay it, the day before perhaps, and what I think did happen in this particular case is that I took the cheque out of my safe and went over to the bank, which is quite adjacent to my place, and paid it in—being a post-dated cheque I wanted to get it in quick, and I should not enter it in this book—I should get an ordinary slip from the bank—it would go through then, and they would let me know in the afternoon—I should certainly consult my solicitor at once, because I was assumed to have £500 profit, and at that time I was £500 out—in connection with the Construction Company I becaue acquainted with Mr. Holroyd Smith in December, 1900, I think was the date; I saw him a good many times thereafter—in reference to lodging my transfers I saw him for the 3,000 shares that I purchased on Novem<lb/>ber 26th—that is the name up—the offices of the company were opposite to me: "Mr. Holroyd Smith"—but the real offices of the company were in Mr. Holroyd Smith's place—they had not changed; they were not in the same building; they were on the opposite side of the street—he told me that he was the father of electric traction; he said that he had sold some patents; I do not know that he said of value; he may have told me that he had sold a lot of valuable patents to the Construction Company—I have no doubt he did, because all patentees would call their patents valuable—I do not know anything about motor matters; I did not hear him speak about those—I did not hear about a motor wheel—I never knew this company had anything to do with motors—I do not know that Mr. Hol<lb/>royd Smith had sold these patents to the Construction Company for 55,000 £1 fully paid shares—I understood he was buying some shares, but I really cannot tell you the number—he did not tell me that 40,000 of those shares were in respect of those on which he had given an option to Lawson—I knew only of one of 15,000—I knew he had given him an option for £15,000—not at that time; I knew ultimately, of courser—I knew by the winter of 1901—I knew by the autumn of 1901, if you like; and I knew he was going to get something from Hooley and could not get it—in the beginning of September, 1901, I purchased from him over 15,000 shares—I gave him £100 for the right to purchase that 15,000 for £2,000—I think, if I remember rightly, the £100 was to be deducted off—that was the option; I was to give him £100 to acquire the 15,000 shares for £2,000, and if I did acquire them I was not to pay the £500; it was to he reckoned off the price; I should only have to buy another 1,900 shares—I do not recollect if that would be for the purchase of shares at 2s. 8d. per share—it is only a question of arithmetic; £2,000 for 15,000—during the time I knew Mr. Holroyd Smith I do not think I had a number of conversations with him about the Construction Company; I had more with</p>

               <p>Lawson, I think—on December 13th, 1000, there was the transfer of the 3,000 to me from Mr. Berkeley Ormerod—we had a long conversation, but generally he was mostly talking about himself and what he had done, thinking I was more interested in it, I suppose; not with reference to the Construction Company; with reference to the Blackpool Company, the real Blackpool—that comes later: the promotion or scheme or re<lb/>construction of that was referred to as the Blackpool (South)—the Black<lb/>pool had been already constructed by Mr. Holroyd Smith—from Septem<lb/>ber, 1900, until September, 1901, when I made this contract for the option, I did not see him fairly frequently—I saw him in the twelve months occa<lb/>sionally—lie was away in Vienna for months, and I did not see very much of him: I might have seen him a dozen or twenty times altogether—when I said Hooley had said anything about Barings in January, 1901, I may have been making a mistake and confusing it with what happened in the summer of 1901 when something was said about it—very likely it might have been—there was the I to Syndicate they mentioned, and several other things—it was not in the latter six months of the year; I think it was before that—I think Hooley mentioned that these people were going to take it over, and that caused me to buy the second, I think—Hooley did say something to me about Barings taking over the Construction Company before January 24th, 1902, or if it was not Barings it was somebody else; it might have been the Ito Syndicate—I am rather inclined to think he mentioned the Barings then and not later: he men<lb/>tioned it later on: it was a general discussion in the place what a fine thing it would be—my impression is it was mentioned—that is all; I will not swear, but my impression is it was—the effect of the transaction of January 24th, 1901, was that I got the right to all the interest in the contract of November 26th between Lawson and Hooley subject to my right to cancel this deal by giving notice fourteen days before the maturity of the bill; I had the option of taking the balance—it amounted to this: that I had the option from January 24th, 1901, at any rate for at least three months, to determine whether or not I would take the half which he still had of the interest in the contract of November 26th—what had hap<lb/>pened was, he had got his interest, with Lawson, I had got half of it under the contract of December 3rd, and under this contract I was to have the op-tion to acquire the remaining half which was in Hooley—for that I was to pay him by a bill of £1,200 at three months and another bill for £3,800 ar six months—I elected not to go on with it before the first bill became due, then the contract was to be cancelled, and Hooley was to meet the bills: really he wanted the money—he said it would be a great accommodation to him, and he would make the sacrifice: he always called it a sacrifice—if I elected to cancel, as I had the right to do, then I was to retain out of Hooley's interest in the half 5,000 shares as my bonus for the transaction: but I never had them—if I had not elected to cancel, as I did in April, 1901. the result would be that Hooley had to meet the bill and I had not to pay anything: but I got landed with £800 and £750—under the contract Hooley had to meet the bills—supposing he had met the bills and the thing had all been carried out as if was there, I should have got a bonus of 5,000 shares in the Construction Company for having lent my name to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140163"/>
               <p>these two bills—my share that I was to get for that was another 31,000 shares, making (51,000—the whole of Mrs. Hooley's interest—I had an interest under December.3rd agreement for.30,000 to.31,000, and the other half was in Mrs. Hooley—according to my story, at this time Hooley had told me that Barings were taking over these shares, and that they would be worth £5 or £6 each—if that is right, taking it at the lower computation, that would make these shares worth about £150,000—I believed what was told me, but it was all subject to realisation—I thought I was in clover, there is no doubt about that: I admit that; there is no doubt I thought I was going to get rich very quickly—I was not getting the right to £130,000 for accommodating Hooley in respect of two bills for £5,000, altogether for three and six months; I was getting £30,000 for £5,000; accommodating, I was paying the bills—if the thing was carried out without my cancelling the option, the effect would be that I should have paid £5,000 in three and sir months for what I—was told, and believed at that time, was worth £150,000, and what I had paid was more than the whole company put together had coat—that was a very remark<lb/>able transaction—I was delighted—like the Siberian Goldfields were to he £20 each; they are 2s. Old., with a 2s. call—on the other hand, I came to the conclusion that I would not go on with the deal; that is to say that I should have time to find out whether Barings were going to take it over or not—I could then elect not to go on, but I had no means of finding out whether Barings had taken it over—I did not find out: I was told so—I cancelled the contract: that is to say, exercised my option not to buy the half interest, because I found out that Barings were not going on with it; that it is self-evident—they did not come to the front and take it over—that is why I am under the impression that the Baring deal was mentioned then, because it was on that that I thought I had got such a good thing, and as the time went by and these bills were maturing, they were supposed to have taken it over—I found three months went by and I heard nothing, and I thought to myself, "I have got enough shares in this thing: I am not having this second contract,"and I was a little bit doubtful about'it—I only ascertained that Barings had not taken it over in the way that they had not taken it over, but I did not go to them—if I am right about the date, Hooley was giving me an option, to purchase for £5,000 what was worth £150,000 to £180,000, arid I was to have time to find out whether it was true; I could elect by the date of maturity of the bill not to go on, and got a bonus for 5,000 Construction shares, hut I was liable till the bills were met; my name was on the bills—that was the position—that I was haying this magnificent offer—all I can say is that I am under the impression that it was Barings—it may have been the Ito, and he mentioned Barings during the running of the pool, but I am under the impression that he mentioned Barings to me, and not the Ito Syndicate at that time—I signed a pooling agreement on October 14th, 1901: still the Barings wore about—I think really what took place was that Barings were supposed to be negotiating for the offer in January, they did not take it over by this time—I saw no evidence of. it, and I did not like it, but another syndicate came in, and I believe Mr. Alfred Beyfus aeted for Lawson for another syndicate—whether it was the Barings</p>

               <p>with them or not I do not know, but the negotiations still ran on, and then when I was asked to sign that memorandum I understood they were very nearly liquidating—I think Hooley and Lawson said to me when I was being asked about signing the pooling agreement in October, 1901, that there was a syndicate connected with the Barings who were taking the whole thing over, it was coining to a head then—I do not think I put my shares into the pool at 4 1/4; I did not know they were going in at 4 1/4—no doubt I signed—in <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 19;"), I see October 11th, 1901, and my signa<lb/>ture in the middle, 5,000 shares at 4 1/4—I signed that, but not when this was here; it does not matter—I will admit I should have been delighted to have 4 1/4—when I signed that this writing was not there, but it is quite possible that they might have asked me and I agreed to it, and therefore they would have put it down afterwards, and what leads me to think so is that Sir Henry White agreed at the same time—I do not know whose writing it is, but Hooley's, I should think—I agree that is what I was willing to sell them at; some of them, of course—I do not call this a pool: I call it an undertaking; but by the document, 5,000 were to be sold at 4 1/4—the document itself calls it pooling, but it is not like that first one; calling it a pool does not seem to be explicit enough: "Hereby I agree to pool," it says, but as I understand that other document, it is a different thing altogether; it allows you to have your shares out at a certain time—I understood it is an undertaking not to part with my shares except at a certain price—what it really is is to allow somebody else to sell our shares for us not under a certain price, and whatever shares are sold, the proceeds were to be distributed <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> amongst us; that is the object of it, I suppose—I should have wanted to know something more, because Lawson was a very large shareholder, and we should have got about half a share when he sold one hundred—I mentioned in connection with the railway that there was an American firm also connected with it, and I referred to Mr. Pierpont Morgan in connection with the railway—I know now that in fact Messrs. J.S. Morgan &amp; Co. came into the scheme of the City and North East Suburban Bill—I was told that Sir Clinton Dawkins, a member of the firm of J.S. Morgan &amp; Co., went into the box to give evidence before the Joint Committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons on this Bill—I am told so, and I believe it is true, and that Sir Clinton Dawkins, for Messrs. Morgan &amp; Co., undertook before the com<lb/>mittee to finance the railway to the extent of two-thirds; I have been told so; I do not know whether it is true—there was a joint committee sitting for the purpose of considering this question—I remember there was a great Joint Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons that sat to consider the various tube schemes; I remember reading that in the papers, what was described in the papers sometimes as the battle of the tubes—two opposite parties, Mr. Morgan and his company being one and Mr. Yerkes and associates being the other—I believe there was a scheme put forward bv Messrs. Morgan &amp; Co., Messrs. Siemens &amp; Co., the electrical engineers, and Mr. Hill, of the Thames Ironworks Company, to build a tube from Hammersmith to the City, and then on to Walthamstow; I do not know that, but if you say so I accept it—the City and North East Suburban Railway Bill was also before the same committee—for short,</p>

               <p>we have called it the Walthamstow Railway—I do not know that these two schemes were to go from the City to Walthamstow, and that the difficulty was that there would be two lines running from the City to Walthamstow, or that it was in consequence of that Messrs. Morgan having lost this part of the City to Walthamstow that they came in and took up the Construction Company's scheme of the City and North East Suburban Railway Bill; but if you say so I will accept it—if the Bills were passed and the scheme of the City and North East Suburban Railway Bill was allowed, and they take on the other scheme from Hammersmith to London, that would give them a complete scheme from Hammersmith to the City, and from the City on to Walthamstow—I have heard that there is a good deal of expense in promoting a Parliamentary Bill; I am told it is very expensive—I am doubtful if the Construction Company promoted this Bill of the City of London and North Eastern, because at a meeting when they wound up the British Electric Street Trams, said they had spent £20,000 on that—the Construction Company or the Street Company had promoted that Bill, which to some extent would be the same thing if the Construction Company properly applied its assets—I know about it being the same thing; I said if it properly applied its assets—I said that for the purpose—I have no evidence except the plan that they had commenced working up this scheme in the autumn of 1900—they had got the plans referencing the route to be covered—they looked to me like copies of an ordnance plan—I do not know that f) per cent, upon the proposed capital would have to be deposited before the Bill could go to Committee—I have heard there was a deposit; I did not know it was 5 per cent.; I knew they had to deposit some money—I think now that the promoters would have to deposit a large sum of money before being allowed to promote that Bill before Parliament—I was told there was a difficulty with regard to this scheme, which we call the Walthamstow Railway—the amalgamated schemes of Morgan's and the City and North East got to a difficulty owing to the dispute that arose between Messrs. Morgan &amp; Company and Mr. Yerkes—that is what I understood, and I further understood that the financial part of the Bill was not passed—I should have thought either of them would have been good enough—I think the Street Company was registered on October 18th, 1900, or about that date—I do not know if the Street Company was to get a half share in the promotion of the City and North East Suburban Railway Company—I heard that the Street Company also promoted a Bill of the Exeter Tramways—I do not know if that was to run tramways in Exeter—I heard they had something to do with Exeter—I do not know if that Bill succeeded before the House of Lords Committee, and was passed—Lawson at the meeting said the thing was worth about £800—that was the first I heard of it at the liquidation.</p>

               <p>entered into this contract for the purchase of the Construction-shares—I had the proposed prospectus, undated—I was told the Streets Company was being promoted; I did not know what issuing meant then with refer<lb/>ence to a company—they did bring it out—that was shortly after my purchase of my first lot of Construction shares—I knew that when, it was brought out there was a considerable amount of money subscribed by the public, and that between £49,000 and £50,000 was subscribed, in addi<lb/>ttion, I take it, to what was subscribed by the founders: £60,000 altogether, I think—I Lave admitted I have made a mistake—the £300 profit was for discounting the cheque, I understood, for £1,000—the document is <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 56, page 29, and that is the document from Walsingham House, Piccadilly, dated December 21st, 1900, and signed by Ormerod: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) Document received from H. J. Lawson, Esq., transfer and certificates for 1,300 shares Dublin Distillers' and £1,000 cheque dated February 10th, 1900, in full payment for bill in the hands of Beyfus re Ormerod and Lawson and Mundy, for £2,000 '"—I never saw that In my life before—I do not see that it says that I treated the Distillers' shores as £1,000—it is taking the Distillers' shares at £1,000—if they had been treated when they were transferred to me from Lawson as worth £1 each it would have made for the 1,500 Distillers' £1,500, if the parties had completed that matter—if Hooley got those back within a few days or within a month at £1,000, there was a profit of £500 upon the transaction, a profit of £6,000 to Hooley for half of his share—I do not know anything about this profit—you say it was £2,000, but there is a profit here as of £1,000 for the Distillers' shares, I understand, on that £1,000 cheque—where is the profit of £500 when you get a £2,000 bill for it, and that helps me very much—as a matter of fact, I believe they were 10s., my solicitors tell me at that time—they had means that I had not of ascer-taining what the shares were worth at that time—I had many conversa<lb/>tions with Hooley: it was all conversation—I had never seen this document before it was handed to me at the Police Court—I never remember anything about a bill of Lawson and Mundy's—I do not remem<lb/>ber having a conversation with Hooley before I signed this receipt of December 21st, 1900 as regards profits of electric tramway concerns—I do not recollect any except the ordinary conversation when a man is part<lb/>ing with his money—I do not remember him telling me that the Distillers' shares were coming back to him, that he had got them back from Lawson—that is an absolute fabrication; also that he had taken the Distillers' shares at £1,000, and therefore there was £500 profit, that the transaction had been done with me upon, the statement by him to me on the basis of £1,500 and £3,500 deductable under the contract of November 26th—it would have occurred to me if anything like over £1,500 that he had £6,000 or £7,000 for it—there were no profits in the Electric Construction deal—Lawson himself told me that he had handed these Distillers' shares back to him eighteen months ago, and I did not believe him—Lawson told me that he had handed to Hooley the Distillers' back, and that he got nothing for the contract—I am quite clear no discussion at all took place about this: there was nothing at all like it—I do not remember the words in this receipt, "£500 on account of profits re Electric Construction"—you</p>

               <p>surprised me, because I had been buying shares at about 4s. that were supposed to be worth £4 each—notwithstanding that on Decem<lb/>ber 21st, 1900, one of the inducements that was made to me by Hooley was that Lawson was a very rich man, and that he had got a lot of money ed up in different companies, in different things that he was in—there was no necessity to say that—if I was to tell you all that Hooley has told me with the hundreds or thousands of shares I have got I would never be done—I did not tell everything at the Police Court—I mean that the statement "profit re Electric Construction" should have been, according to my understanding, discount for the cheque; they paid more money than that—that is what I thought it was, and why I discounted the cheque for Hooley for a few days, and he has paid me £30 for it—I was in the habit of attending Hooley's office pretty regularly from December, 1900, to March, 1902—after I had done my work I would go round there two or three times a week when I was in town—I could not always pop in—I suppose you may take it I was there three times a week, Mondays, Wed<lb/>nesdays, and Fridays, as a rule—I wrote letters from there and had my own note-paper headed Windsor Castle brought to Walsingham House to write letters from there; Hooley told me if I wanted to write a letter at any time I could have the use of his typewriter, and Mr. White also said so—I did use his typewriter a few times, and kept a copy letter book there—my letters may have been-copied. Mr. White had them copied very likely—they were in connection with these company things, sending on the transfers and these sort of things—for instance, the letter that was written to the company, and one or two other letters, were dictated by me—that state of things continued throughout the whole of 1901, and to March, 1902, but I was getting very suspicious—the latter part I may not have been at the office three times a week, but I thought it was very important I should be on the scene—I was looking after it to try and find out what was being done—I believe the latter part of the time one or two people did come in, and I told them not to do any business with Hooley—after October, 1901, I had transactions with Hooley in some Corunna shares, and I think three or four or five transactions down on to February, 1902, the last two letters of Electric Construction shares—the letter of January 24th, 1901, to the Construction Company, was dictated by Hooley; I wrote it before I signed it, and rather objected to it, but he said he did not want Lawson to know about it—he said, "I do not want Lawson to know what I get for those shares; it does not matter to you, because I can pay for the registration"—they always paid the stamps and that sort of thing—in this particular case I took the transfer myself—I foolishly allowed myself to sign that letter, but I trusted him then—I believe Hooley dictated it to his typewriter and brought it in to me; I showed him the letter I had—I was not in the habit of signing things which Hooley dictated or wrote, only you have got this particular in<lb/>cident—that "I purchased the 3,000 in your company, transfer of which you have had a considerable time, from a friend of mine for shares in another company, which, can be proved at any time,"was not true—that is Hooley: as a matter of fact, if they had come to me and asked, I should have told them all about it—that letter was meant to mislead Lawson, no</p>

               <p>doubt; it was not to let Lawson know that we had sold these shares for £1,500—the letter was intended by Hooley through me to mislead Lawson as to the price he was giving for the shares—the words "which can be proved at any time," was a distinct lie, I think—I do not know what was in his minl; he wrote it—there was very little in my mind about it at, the time; I did it to oblige Hooley; it did not get me any<lb/>thing—I did not think about it at all, except as obliging him—I was signing a document that, he dictated to me and brought to me; no doubt "it is false, but it was done to oblige Hooley; remember I trusted him then; he hypnotised me, he had a magnetic power over me which was extra<lb/>ordinary; not now though—I continued on friendly terms with him for a considerable period after this, and he has said so—I am not going to admit I was terribly shocked—it was an improper thing to do, of course—it was doing a friend of mine, whom I trusted at the time, I thought a favour—my first letter to him was asking for my certificate, for "which I waited two months, not an unreasonable thing to want your certificate, I should think—the latter part: "I know nothing of any pool, and am not a party to any,"is perfectly true, and "and unless I receive my certificate during the next seven days I shall immediately place the matter in the hands of my solicitors"—Lumley &amp; Lumley were the solicitors—the real object of this letter was to prevent Lawson knowing he had had £1,500 from me—Hooley wrote that letter trying to force Lawson to register my transfer for the 3,000 shares, with the reply of the company before him; I had given the reply of the company to him—I had brought the letter round to him, and asked him the meaning of it—Hooley is dictating this letter in answer to a letter from the company of January 22nd—the object of the letter was to protect himself—lie and Lawson in affidavits are swearing each other to be the biggest scoundrels, and going to luncheon together—I have supplied the affidavits to the Treasury—there is nothing in that—the letter of January 30th, 1901, was my own letter, I think; it contained what I thought to be the truth, but it is different to the circumstances of that last letter—the words "my interest, both in your company and the British Electric Street Tramways Company" mean that if I had had what I was entitled to, I was entitled to a large number of shares under the contract—that letter contains what I thought Lawson had given me information about—I never asked to qualify the other letter—I have been perfectly open about it: I say that it was wrong to do as he asked me to do—I am stating here what I was told—I had seen Lawson several times—that letter is typed, I think, by the same machine—I must say the suggestion of taking the note book round to Hooley emanated from Mr. White, who was a friend of mine: he was the man who suggested my buying the shares—if anything cropped up I used to use Hooley's type<lb/>writer—it was Mr. Sims White who introduced me—the statement that Messrs. Barings were taking over the shares of the Construction Company, or taking over the concern at £5 or £6 a share was mentioned before October, 1901, I think—I think it varied according to the time running a little, but it was some time before that; it was made in October, 1901, I think about the time we suggested that undertaking about the shares: that is the time they told me the shares were going to be taken over at £6,</p>

By that date I had been fifteen or sixteen times to Walsingham House, and Mr. Hooley and I had constantly been talking of the Construction Company before that date, and its prospects. Before that time I had met Mr. Holroyd Smith several times. He had told me he was engineer to the company, and that he was the father of electric traction, and had laid down the Blackpool tramway.

(<hi rend="italic">Tim was dated if May</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1904, <hi rend="italic">and was a notice of a meeting at the Cannon Street Hotel, next day</hi>):—"To express sympathy with Mr. Lawson in his present difficulties, and con<lb/>fidence in his innocence of the charge brought against him, as well as to gain confirm his actions in carrying on the business of the company"—the last notice I had had from the company to attend a meeting was some 18 months or two years before—something about converting some pre-ference shares, or making some debentures, or something—I did not go it, and it is a long time ago—there have been no annual meetings if the company—at the time of my petition for the winding up of the construction Company I had no means of investigating the affairs of the Company; my solicitor saw the file at Somerset House; I had never</p>

               <p>received from the company which I took shares in in 1900 any balance-sheet or any accounts of any kind, and I had no knowledge of what, the capita of the company was, or whether they had any capital, or what had been done with any moneys they had received—the nominal capital is on the prospectus—at the time of my petition to the Court of Chancery I had no knowledge whatever of what had really taken place about the Distillery Company's shares—the first time I heard of the Distillery shares was when a gentleman got up during the Treasury prosecution at the Police Court and Mr. Muir was questioning him as to what was transferred; Hooley prepared the typewritten document headed "Walsingham House, Piccadilly, W., London, 21st December, 1900"—I never had it or any counterpart of it—there was never any conversation between Hooley and Lawson and me about any profits in the Electric Construction—this was about three weeks after the agreement of December 31—under that agreement until Lawson had got £3,500 there were no profits—it has never been suggested or put in any account furnished to me that Lawson ever got that £3,500, or that my time for profits had ever commenced: I made many claims subsequently against Hooley and Lawson, trying to get my money—no document but this produced suggests that I got any money as profits from the Electric Construction, unless it says something about it in the Writ—I do not think it says anything there; there was an action pending about the Electric Tramways Construction where they claim all the shares back—I gave this cheque for £500 the same day that the receipt bears date—it is in Sims White's writing at Walsingham House, and is signed by me—the counterfoil is in my clerk's writing—I always carry a blank cheque in my pocket, loose—I think my clerk came to Walsingham House twice; somebody called for me, and he came round to fetch me; he is now in the mounted police police in Canada—I produced that counterfoil at the Police Court—I have given it to the Treasury—that was after my mistake about the receipt, and for the purpose of correcting it—I was unable to trace the £1,000 in my banking account, as stated in the—depositions, and up to the present day I have never been able to trace it in my banking account or paying-in slips, so I made the alterations upon the counterfoil, not with the intention to deceive, but a long time before this case—I had been through them shortly after 1902—the original writing is merely scratched out in pencil—there is nothing to prevent anybody seeing what was originally there—I have never received more than the £1,000 on the foot of that cheque—I have received £500 and five post-dated cheques—the £500 I received paid back the £500 advanced on December 31st—£450 of the £500 post-dated cheques went in payment of Construction shares—he gave me back £50—any "profit I got was really the shares that that money represented, the Con<lb/>struction shares—five £100 post-dated cheques went in payment of the £400 that was due on the contract and £50 Hooley gave me change—of course I never had the £500—I hare been through my books, and could not trace anything; I thought that that £500 was a loan to Hooley, I have frequently lent him £50, because I could find no other explanation for it; I saw there was a £50 cheque in my book, and I thought that was it, but I had asked Lawson, find singularly enough I had telephoned to my solicitor to know whether</p>

               <p>he knew anything about the £1,000 cheque, and he did not know although in his own possession he must have had that writ; I asked Lawson himself, and he could tell me nothing about it—I never saw any-prospectus of the Construction Company—I think the objects of the Streets Com<lb/>pany and the Construction Company were much the same—I do not know—no reason was ever given to me by Lawson or Hooley as to why the Streets Company was formed—I thought I was getting shares, after, the payment of the £3,500—Cox and Lafone, I think, were acting for Lawson—I received this letter: "Herewith we send you, as promised, one copy of the proposed pooling agreement between yourself and Mr. Lawson. We have sent duplicates to Mr. Hooley and Mr. Lawson. "We have also sent Mr. Hooley a short acknowledgment to be Signed by you as to the shares which you will hold on behalf of Mrs. Hooley,"and the agreements referred to—it was never suggested I had not an interest in the shares up to this trial—Hooley suggested the shares were to be sold at 4 1/4—I do not remember the 38 opposite Lawson's name—being there; I do not say it was not there—it is not opposite the signature—there is no doubt I did pay cash—I put in shares at Hooley's suggestion—Hooley had undertaken to lodge the transfer for me, but he did not do it, and I went myself to the office—it was the letter from Hooley's office by Sims White, in which he says: "I shall be glad to see you and put you in the way of making some money quickly"—that first brought me to his office—I believed his statement—on November 26th I got the telegram in which Hooley says: "Just seen the little man, says will be 18s. per share divided at once, Hooley"—I went up post haste the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, living at Deepdene, Grove Park Gardens, Chiswick—in 1900 I had the authority of some relative to invest capital—I wrote to Hooley, and after<lb/>wards had an interview with him—that same month I entered his service on the terms of the agreement produced, dated May 29th, at £500 per year and a commission on all business done, to be arranged at the time the business was closed, settlement to take place each month—Mr. Hooley did not tell me when he engaged me what my duties were to be—I attended Walsingham House daily from Mondays till Friday to sign transfers and give exchange cheques through my banking account with the National, Piccadilly—I gave cheques to Hooley, and afterwards I received cheques from him and paid them into my banking account, and drew cheques from my account to give him in exchange—the-first amount of capital was invested at one time in Siberians—I have looked at the letter dated September 12th, signed by Hooley, and after that date I did not hold any Siberians on my own or any account except for Hooley, and I also executed transfers of these on behalf of him in my name—I executed a transfer dated October 12th to Alfred J. Paine of 5,000 shares in the Siberian Goldfields Development Company, Limited—my name appears printed at the top—the shares did not belong to me—the name of the transferee was not always-put in when I executed the transfers—the cheque for £3,000 drawn by Alfred J. Paine to E.B. Ormerod bears</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140182"/>
               <p>my endorsement, but I do not remember the time when it was done, as I had no personal interest in it—usually when I endorsed a cheque made payable to me I handed it back to Hooley, and, as far as I can remember, that is what I did on that occasion; it was not paid into my bank—I did not have much to do with bills, but simply endorsed them—I had no knowledge of bills of exchange or in what capacity I signed them—I did not keep any record of the bills I signed, but the transfers I did in a small note-book that I kept for three or four months, when Hooley asked me to show it to Mr. Redfern's solicitors, and that was the last I saw of it—I asked Hooley to return the book, as it was the only record I had of what I had signed, and he told me he had left it with Redfern, and so I am unable to give any information of the transfers I signed—I have no acquaintance with Lawson, although I have occasionally seen him at Walsingham House—I had a room of my own for a short time, but was generally in Hooley's flat, which consisted of a drawing-room, a dining-room, and an office—I was generally in the drawing or dining-room, hut not in the office, for I did no clerical work—I know nothing of the transaction referred to in my letter to H.J. Lawson of November 20th—I received no transfer of the 3,000 shares in the Electric Company—I had no interest in any bill in the hands of Beyfus and Beyfus—I know no more than that I generally signed documents for Hooley—this is his copy letter-book—the words "Not to be put on the market for three months," are in Hooley's writing—Hooley arranged everything, and would say,"This matter was arranged,"and the letter would be sent—I read the letters I sent, but did not understand them—the body of the letters is type-written by Hewitt—I did not pay £1,000 to Lawson—I have no recollection of executing this or any transfers in the Construction Company—I had no interest in Construction shares—I first heard of that company in 1901—I do not remember this transfer of 1900—I think I signed transfers in 1900. Things were done in such a hurry sometimes that we would not have time to go through the transfers—I do not know Lawson's writing—this cheque of November 28th, 1901, for £2,000, is endorsed "J. Sims White,"and appears to have been paid into the National Pro<lb/>vincial Bank of England, St. James's Branch, where I kept my account, but it might not go through that account—I find by my pass-book that on November 29th £2,020 was credited to me—in the analysis of my banking account I have one item of £2,000 and two of £10 each, but no record of what the £2,000 cheque was for—it was not my own money—about that date I drew cheques for like sums—Hooley would give me the cheque—W.R. Burton was his secretary—his cheque is crossed Foster's Bank, Cambridge—I made it out at the time that Hooley gave me the cheque for the £2,000, and I gave him these four in exchange for it, post dated some of them, to enable the cheque for £2,000 to he cleared at my bank—they were all drawn on the 23th—Hooley told me who were the payees of the cheques—Robotham was Hooky's colleague—another cheque was payable to J.A. Bradshaw—I cannot give any reason for the four cheques being drawn in different names—Hooley gave me none, nor any reason why the original cheque for £2,000-should not be paid through his own bank—Foster's bank was Mrs. Hooley's bank—I</p>

               <p>believe Hooley had no account in his own name; he never told me about—looking at this document, I never received the transfer and certificates or 1,500 shares in the Dublin Distiller's Company—I had no interest in hat company—I never saw the certificates, and do not remember seeing he transfer—Hooley used my banking account in this way for about even months to the end of 1900—our relations came to an end actively bout the end of October or the beginning of November, 1901, and during hat year it was a hanging fire sort of business—I refused to sign one document—he wanted to know my reason why—I persisted in my refusal—he said if I did not sign it I should not receive the £16,000—back which had put in, and ultimately he lost his temper altogether, and said we would kick me out of the flat, and a hundred and one threats, and said we would force me to, that he would break me in a fortnight, and that sort of thing—I did not do it—I never went back to the office.</p>

I think, after I resigned—Mr. Parford was the secretary of the Construction Company—he was a servant of Lawson—I did not know Mr. King; I just knew Mr. Dove; I thought he was Ramskill's clerk—the Construction Company's banking account was kept at the London and Westminster, Victoria Street, I think—I signed cheques, I believe, for things due from the Company, but Lawson was the largest shareholder, and we had confidence in him to control the whole of the business—I was in control of the company's affairs, but I did not know what was going on—Lawson's judgment was believed in—we gave our permission to purchase Provisional Orders when we signed them—I first knew Chad-well, the engineer, as a contractor—we had no appointed manager; we all managed—as a rule, we were there, and Lawson did what there was to do—Parford drew up the agenda—he used to see Lawson—I cannot say I was present at any of these meetings of the Construction Company in January, 1902—I remember a contract to buy up the assets of the company, but who negotiated that contract I do not know—I believe there was a deposit—Osborne was formerly Lawson's secretary—Kirby was a director of one of the companies—"I know nothing about the agreement of February 3rd, 1902, with reference to the £25,000—a resolution was passed, but I cannot tell you what happened—the secretary told me something about it—I was instructed by Osborne—I never asked to see the books, because the secretary knew more about them than I did—he would be in a position to know more than I from his years of experience in the Construction Company's work, and from the lots of companies that he had been in before this—I was a director of both companies—I do not know what the agreement for £50,000 was for; I might have heard something about it at the time—I believe I spoke to Lawson with regard to my responsibility for transfers, and he indentified me from any responsibility—the effect of what he said was, "I shall indemnify you from any payment or from any responsibility"—my position was to be his director, and he used his judgment—I was a nominee, but the other directors nominated me a director—I was Lawson's nominee—I was to do what he suggested to me so far as I thought them right.</p>

Morris, Crisp &amp; Co. are the solicitors to the com<lb/>pany who took it over—the shares are £1,000 each—I know the Leeds and Wakefield line was constructed, and it would go to allotment necessarily—the Ito Syndicate in one way or another paid the whole of the purchase money, £30,000—you created that line—you paid Fell, Pritchard, Green. nnd myself—I know Harrison, Beaumont, and Smith—you have given cheques on your own bank to the men whose names have been mentioned of £100, £200, and probably more—sometimes there would be over £1,000 in cheques payable to those who were interested in the profit of it or ii promotion—sometimes you financed the company—I know Accrington and the towns in that district—they are thickly populated—one single svstem of electric traction there would be most valuable, I think—I see the signatures of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, Fell, and Kershaw on the con<lb/>tracts produced—the directors are named as individual promoters—I see Chadwell's signature to the agreement of March 14th, 1902—he has been many times in our office—I paid him thousands of pounds—he has been our engineer in a great many tramways—I remember many railways that he constructed; one through a part of Lancashire to Accrington, also one to Blackpool; and he constructed one at Portsmouth, I think, and Bath, but other witnesses know more about them than I do—I know nothing about deeds of trust: I trusted, as all directors do, those to the Solicitors—the secretary was an able and experienced man—I relied on Gordon Hunter, Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, the secretary, and the solicitor—I expected I was quite safe in taking their advice—Holroyd's system is the conduit system, and goes over the ground: the other system goes over</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Molland House. Wrenstead Road, Sutton—I have known Lawson many years—I was in his service thirteen years ago as a clerk for a short-time—I was employed at 40, Holborn Viaduct, as a salesman for the British Motor Company, and assistant secretary—Lawson was in and out very frequently—I went to Blackpool in the summer of 1901—I remained there a year in the employment of the Construction Company, as an assistant secretary or manager—about June, 1902, I came to London—I became a director of the Construction Company shortly afterwards, in October or November—I attended the office at 34, Victoria Street—this letter dated November 28th, 1902, is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140195"/>
               <p>addressed by me to Lawson "Dear Mr. Lawson, In consideration of your having introduced me to certain directorships, I agree to draw only £156 per annum in respect of fees as director on any companies; and that if any further fees come to me I will hand the said surplus to you."—the understanding was that my qualification should not cost me anything, but that I should receive that in addition to fees—I accepted that low fee in consideration of my being provided with the qualification—the shares were to belong to me without payment—I had a number of them—they are still in my name—I am a director still—I was already in a traction company—I had joined, I think, the National Electric Traction Company—I attended a meeting of that company on July 25th—I am still a director of that company—I am also a director of the Street Company, and some minor companies that we registered for the sake of securing the name—three or four minor registrations were not carried out, they were not put before the public they were syndicates—some of them dropped out—the Scottish Colonial was one—some are in existence now—I at<lb/>tended the meetings of the Construction Company—Mr. Harlick was there as a director—I believe Lawson attended sometimes, I have an impression that I remember seeing him there once at the Construction Company's meeting—he discussed with the secretary the business he brought into the company—as the principal shareholder he worked on his own account, and introduced the business to us—it was to some extent done that way—. I may have consulted him, but not as a regular thing—we looked into everything very carefully before we took Lawson's advice—his sugges<lb/>tions were profitable to us, and they were acted upon I think invariably—Mr. Parford was secretary to one or two companies—he acted for Lawson in some of his private business—he got his directions from the chairman—I think he got some directions from me as to the agenda paper—I do not recollect any instance, but it is very possible that, besides sitting and voting at the Board meetings, I did take part in managing the company's affairs—I signed cheques and agreements—possibly I "negotiated business—the Board and the secretary were managing and dealing with the projects submitted by Lawson and other people—the secretary was a very able man—both Osborne and Parford carried on the company's formal business, and Lawson was its competent engineer—he did the outside business very largely, and brought his schemes to us for passing—I have seen Hooley at the offices of the Construction Company but very rarely—I understood he came to see Lawson—I do not think I spoke to him there—on 1-february 27th, 1903, the Trust Company paid large sums to the Construction Company, recognising these minutes as apparently correct, but I do not remember it personally—I think I remember issuing the debenture produced to the Trust Company, under the agreement of November 6th, 1901—I cannot tax my memory with the number of preference shares issued under that agreement, it is pro<lb/>bable I knew at the time of going into the matter at the Board meetings, and took steps to see what was done under the agreement, and that I ascertained from the minutes and from the register that 25,000 pre<lb/>ference shares were issued to the Trust in February, 1902, and from the Trust to Lawson.</p>

I went to Blackpool on behalf of the Construction Company to look after the Blackpool South Tramways Com<lb/>pany in floating the shares, and obtaining what I might call the sinews—if war—the registered office of the new Company was at Blackpool—I saw that a great deal of material had been collected for reconstructing the line—a gas motor tram line was already in existence—the Order obtained was to convert that line into one of electric traction—the line had to be doubled, and even-thing renewed—I think! I had not seen Hooley before June 1902, at any rate, to know him—that is what I swore at the Police Court—Hooley had no connection with the Construction Company's affairs as far as I know.</p>

I have known you register a name at Somerset House to secure it for a company, and afterwards leave it there without going on with the company, after paying the registration fee—I have been in London eleven or twelve years—I have been connected with companies fourteen years—I have known you thirty years—we worked together at the safety bicycle soon after our acquaintance began—I was enthusiastic on engineering, and we had a shop with tools and machinery, and I served time in an engineer's shop, and we brought the safety bicycle to a state of perfection—I possessed twenty-five or thirty houses in Brighton—I put money into our bicycle experiment—you have paid me all back with good interest—I went to Coventry once or twice—I do not know of one failure in any of the Coventry companies with which you were connected—I stayed with you a month when you were manager of the Rudge Cycle Company—you brought it out to the public—it paid 15 per cent, dividend—on the prospectus you were managing-director—you promoted the Humber Cycle Company, and assisted in the promotion of others—I have seen your testimonial from the shareholders at Preston's Distillery Company and this gold watch (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from the Rudge Com<lb/>pany—many syndicates in the City would gladly pay you 25 per cent, for guarantees of £200,000—I here known cent percent, given on many occasions for putting up capital—you have put up large sums, £17,500 to one solicitor, Mr. Webb—100 per cent, is not a disgraceful thing con<lb/>sidering the risk—the Epstein patent is going on—I 'believe you bought every share in the Trust Company—I know of no creditors of the Electric Tramways Construction Company—the Trust Company is not to-day a creditor of the Construction Company, there has been an agreement settling all debts—I was a director at the time of the minute of that agreement—our hope was to obtain a Bill for a main line to Leeds and Wakefield, and work it with subsidiary lines at a profit—the obtaining of Bills in Parliament, and payment of other patent and other fees, would be a consideration for the issue of the 25,000 shares.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LAWSON</hi>. I was down at Blackpool for some months and to a large extent am familiar with the methods and system that you adopted in forming the Blackpool Electric Tram (South)—you had obtained a guarantee signed by very rich men for £150,000 in debentures, and £50,000 in shares—I know the names of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140197"/>
               <p>those men—they were undoubtedly very rich men—one at least is reputed to be a millionaire—one of them is an official of the Bank of England—I have heard so in conversation; I do not know of my own knowledge—the guarantee signed by those men would be as good as cash—as a matter of fact they paid off any little difference—probably some £8,000 or £10,000—that was to be subscribed—they went and saw the Blackpool bankers, and paid into the bank at Blackpool the applications and subscriptions and guarantee, and produced it to the manager and left it at the bank at Blackpool—the applications for £150,000 of debentures with their cheques appended for the amount that was due, and which was afterwards paid as it fell due, were all paid into the London City and Midland Bank, Blackpool branch—that would be six weeks-before the dinner—every application for shares that the Construction Company received had—on the face of it the amount in pencil that the applicant would have "to puy up—if a man applied for £1,000 worth of debentures, and he was a good man, and it was under that guarantee of the £150,000, it was practically cash and was certain to be paid—the total amount of the debentures was £150,000—the exact amount subscribed was £150,000—the whole of it was subscribed; the whole of it was guaranteed, and there was a little balance made up by the guarantors, who signed applications for the whole lot of the £150,000—I went to the bank at Blackpool, and saw the manager with you, and signed for the whole of the £150,000—I am sure that was prior to the dinner—I cannot say offhand what the total amount of the subscriptions for preference and ordinary shares was, in addition to the amount of debentures—it was very large I know—I cannot say how much the total capital of the company was; I have not had occa<lb/>sion to. remind myself of it—I know that the total amount was-nearly approaching £250,000—it went into more than £200,000; it was more than £200,000, I know; I believe including the debentures it was some<lb/>thing like £243,000—it was largely above £200,000—that was agreed to be paid up, and, as far as I know, was paid up—there were some arrears as, usual; a few shareholders for some reason or other, poverty, or a change in circumstances, could not pay in the proper time when due—you were in Manchester and Preston and all those towns buying up the shares of the old company—that occupied months—there were hundreds of sharer<lb/>holders—it would not have been necessary for you to have written up and have entered in the books in London every detail and every transaction that you were doing with all those people—it would have been very inconvenient and have involved a lot of labour—it is not likely we should have expected you to do so—sometimes very large cheques would come in for hundreds of pounds in one day and several would come in on the "lie day paying up in full—those cheques would go to the London office, 34, Victoria Street—you would wait for a day or two until a fair number had accumulated, and then send them up to the Blackpool office, where I was—I should take them down to the bank and pay them in—it would be three or four days before the bank would give us credit for those cheques being country cheques—that was a country branch—if a cheque comes from Wales, it takes a day or two to get it there; then it has to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140198"/>
               <p>paid, then it has to go a regular routine before it gets credited into the Blackpool branch of the bank—that is what my experience was over numbers of cheques; not only with that company, but in others; we sometimes had a cheque for a week before it appeared in the pass book—the full amount of money that we really did hare on the night of the dinner would not be credited in the bank books until probably a week afterwards—it would be impossible—I believe a clerk was placed to take and receive all fares from the passengers; they were banked, and when there were any repairs and that sort of thing they had to refer to you in London, because you were the real owners; but that did not come under my immediate notice; I did not have charge of that—I often rode on the trams, and saw them collecting money, and so on—I knew that and important question had to be settled by you in London; I was credibly informed so; I am not certain of that—I met you at Blackpool many times—when you were going down to the Board meetings of the old com<lb/>pany; you and Mr. Osborne were directors of the old com<lb/>pany, and main<lb/>tained trams—you have only been going three years in active work—from what I have seen of the enormous delay and labour and time occupied in obtaining Bills and surveys going through Parliament, and getting them thrown out, and then going back there again, it is not fair to come to any decision as to what this company's prospects are from the present three years' work; it is only fair to think that from what it has done it would certainly have a decided chance of doing well; it would be fair to decide that it would have a chance of doing well—you obtained estimates from road men and engineers and Westinghouse and numbers of electricians and manufacturers as to what the cost would be of laying down the new line; that did not come through me because that was done in London, but I know that was so—I saw Mr. Nevins on several occasions; he was an American millionaire, and had built many lines of tramways; a famous man rather—he told us he had built thousands of miles in America—he had enormous estates in Ireland—he entered into a contract with us for the converting of the line for £70,000—that—would have left a very large profit—there was a reason why the Blackpool Tramways should be capitalised: I suppose there is no other town in England that would compare with the crowds, the hundreds of thousands of visitors that crowd into the town and choke the streets—I have lived there for some time—as to the Fleetwood branch., it is a fact that the shares of that company were freely dealt in at £30 each—that justified you in capitalizing our company at a very large capital—there are practically no villages between Blackpool and Fleetwood, which is 10 miles away, but on our road there is a village or a town every two miles, St. Ann's and Fairhaven—that is a very important town—we got hold of an extremely good thing when we got hold of that—you were universally congratulated; I know dozens of company promoters down there would very gladly get it away—that is something the Construction Company did—you put it before the Board, who adopted your scheme or project—in buying up the shares and other things you paid out of your own pocket many thousands of pounds—you did not consult the directors at all; you simply went and did the job, and when it was done said, "Here you are"—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140199"/>
               <p>should say you have a perfect right to charge them for doing that work; and if they did not pay you, you could sue the company if they adopted your project—if they adopted your proposal, and granted you a release from all liability on certain terms, they had the power and the perfect "right to do it; the power to come to any bargain they liked—the names of the contractors who really built the Blackpool tramline have escaped me now—I cannot say from memory who the engineer of the new company was—Nevins fell off his horse and was killed—after Nevins there were several people tendering to receive the contract—there were two or three engineers whose names are in my head, but I cannot for the moment remember—it was our own engineer who took the contract; his contract was drawn between the two parties—I know Mr. Chadwell—I have seen him dozens of times, and paid him moneys—you have paid him thousands of pounds through your office for years—I remember now that he built it; I had confused him with some others—I recognise the street and the cars in these photographs of Blackpool; they represent exactly the place and the trams—that will be the new undertaking—I do not think that I knew that the Blackpool Corporation made a very large offer for the old company if you could sell—I do not think I knew that the Blackpool Corporation sent out for estimates for recon<lb/>struction to Westinghouse and other people, and that they them<lb/>selves suggested a quarter of a million—I should not call the Construction Company a paper company—in the other Court I used the word "paper "company; that was with reference to some small registrations—it gives a wrong impression to call them companies at all, I think; they were simply registrations; they necessarily had certain shareholders holding £leach, signatories; clerks in some solicitor's office; their names were on paper in the articles of association; that constitutes them the company, so I called them paper companies, because they were registered as signatories to secure a name for one particular purpose—all companies have to commence in the same way—it does not matter how genuine and honest they are, they have to begin as paper companies until they have taken over their properties—the Construction Company has never been brought out to the public to my knowledge—right through we have been preparing to get it into a condition which would be fit, and honest, and fair to float and put to the public—that is our object—from what I know of syndicates and paper companies, all companies are done in this way in the City until they are brought out and floated; they are absolutely private companies, run by one or two men, with the nominal seven shareholders—I think it would be a more proper name for our company if it was called "The Electric Tramways Construction and Main<lb/>tenance Syndicate"—we did not register it: we took it over—if Nevins had not met with that fatal accident we should have paid a very large dividend—we should have earned at least £50,000 or £60,000 profit in the year; I always said so: I was not a director, but I know that is the fact—at his death we were obliged to come to some other arrangement—we could not get a contractor like Westinghouse or any of the big English contractors to build a line as cheaply as the American contractor—I do not see any prospectus sent out by any City promoter in which all</p>

               <p>the contracts we were buying, as well as what we were going-to get and charge, were all set out in full; it is generally summarised in a few line—that is a feature in your companies that your prospectuses have that—I have heard it called in the City a "Lawsonian "prospectus—it is a term in the City known today—one of the features is that you put on the sheet what you charge for the profit and also what you gain—nobody could be much cheated in that, way—it is like a jeweller putting in his window how much the things have cost him when he was going to mark them, so that people could see how much they were going to pay and how much the profit would be; it is your custom to disclose the profit—in any company prospectus you disclose your full profit—I believe that is a thing that Hooley has done on one or two occasions, but I do not know—in the second column of the prospectus of the Blackpool (South) there is a copy of an agreement for the construction—it commences by naming the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company; then: "the con<lb/>tractors (hereinafter called the contractors)" I notice that—as a matter of fact, the contractor is a contractor for the construction of the line—the Construction Company contract is to construct the line; that is our Construction Company that is now being talked of, and which entered into a contract to construct the new Blackpool line—that does not convey to my mind that the directors would have to go and dig up the road, and so forth—you would either supply workmen or else responsible contractors; it would be as contractors as far as I understand—this was the contract given to Nevins and Chadwell—upon this contract the line has been built—the last clause of this contract reads: "The prospectus intended to be issued to the public as respects the debenture stock and share capital of the new company would be solely at the risk and on the responsibility of and by and on account of the contractors"—the contractors were the Construction Company—"' to whom by virtue of this contract such capital in fact belongs ": that was the understanding—therefore the whole of this capital was our property, and all that we had to do under this contract was to give them a line fully equipped and pocket the difference, which will be a very large sum of money—after you had done all this we got the money paid in, and then there was a dispute, but I do not know the names—Mr. Rutherford and his friends, the other guarantors, came down and received a very large sum of money for commission; he suddenly came down and demanded the whole amount of his commission, £30,000, before we had taken one sovereign out of the bank for our sale of shares—we were advised by many solicitors that you had a perfect right to the whole of the money, and that all we had to do was to give a new line: I do not know whether Mr. Rutherford got a signature, but he obtained an Injunction with the other guarantors; late one night he went to Manchester and got an interim Injunction from the Judge in his private room or at his residence to prevent their taking the material away—he did that in the name of the company, without consulting the directors—we were very indignant, and took action at once; finally, after much trouble and weeks of litigation the whole thing was amicably settled, but not so much to your advantage as it would have been had we carried out the terms of the contract: they were powerful</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140201"/>
               <p>men, and they made a great agitation and secured some money to them<lb/>selves—I believe part of the terms of the compromise was that the com<lb/>pany should take over all our contracts for the line—that reduced our profits very much—still, we thought it was worth while to get free of the whole thing—the date of the compromise was June 24th—so far as the company is concerned and yourself, I consider it was an honourable deal throughout—this took place during the next twelve months after the dinner; the dinner was in 1901, and the trouble, I think, began in August—at the time of the dinner we were all on friendly terms; I am speaking of the agitation there was at the first flotation of the company, then everything was settled up immediately, and then there was trouble after<lb/>wards—I never heard there was trouble over the share capital; we had paid all we had to pay—then we said: If we give you a new company and a new contractor we have done all we agreed to do; if we give you that you have got all you want, and the rest of it belongs to us—it was never seriously suggested that we had no right to the share capital—I always understood the trouble was confined to the debentures—there was £81,000 odd at the bank at the date of the dinner—at the time of the dinner everything was going on amicably—Mr. Rutherford, even while he served the first Injunction, resided with me at the same hotel, the Metropole, Blackpool—all the time of the dispute we were on the most friendly terms—they argued it out every night; a very clear understand<lb/>ing was come to before sending out the allotment letters; the trouble was all cleared up before it went to the public; the trouble I am referring to occurred before the flotation of the company; when exactly the trouble occurred I do not know, because I was in London—we had a perfect right to draw on the capital—under the contract we were advised to—Ward Bowie acted for us—I knew the facts as well as anybody, because I was on the terms that I had most of the money passing through my hands; it would becoming from the bank, and I should know of it—£80,000 was the amount that was left of the debenture moneys out of which to pay preliminary expenses and so on—Paine received two for one—we should have all done remarkably well, there is no disguising that fact—£80,000 would have been the profit out of the debenture money, which would have belonged to the Construction Company, out of which they would have to pay for the company; but you had to pay, and the company itself even borrowed money from Hooley to help us pay out the two-thirds on the three-fourths of the old company's shareholders' £10,000—the £80,000 would have been profit, quite outside what we were getting from other sources—about £90,000 was coming in from shares—the real dispute winch arose after the dinner, which has been talked so much of, was that we were supposed to draw of the debenture money—I do not think I attended a meeting that was called at the Hotel Cecil to try and settle the matter of the debenture holders of Blackpool (South) in January, 1902, but I have heard of it, when Mr. Rutherford and all his people came up to London, and we had finally a meeting and threshed it all out—at the time of the dinner we considered we had made £100,000 profit—I know Mr. Rutherford has stated that we made on the basis of this contract £60,000 in cash profit—we had £243,000 subscribed; we had nearly</p>

               <p>£200,000 of it guaranteed and as good as cash, that is in debentures and shares; we had close upon £100,000 in hand at the bank, and apart from the £70,000 that we should have to pay for constructing the line, the whole of that would be available for just what you liked, to pay the ex<lb/>penses and profit, therefore every penny we had would be available for the construction of the line—it would take £6.000 to pay 12 per cent. on the Construction Company's capital, so that we had it dozens of times "over—it was a great success, and is a great success, and is of great public utility and advantage—it would be quite impossible, so far as the London books are concerned, and it would not be necessary for me or you doing all this work down in Lancashire, to have all that recorded in detail in the books in London—we should not think it was reasonable that you should have to write up the whole of the detail in the books of the London office, the whole of the details—I think the summary is already there—I never heard it Colonel Harris was writing to the company for his shares, or making any claim of any sort or kind to the shares—I should have heard if he had complained or written—I never heard of his writing to the solicitors that I held shares of his after he left—all this work that is done for the Construction Company is done on this line; you are an independent shareholder in the company, and go and get the work done and then make the best terms, you could, and then go to the Board and they take it up—I remember the difficulty you had to get the Blackpool district—I believe there was an interview with Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, and that we were being persuaded to let the Construction Company take it up; I was not present, but I believe that was the fact—I think I was in the outer office—that would be about the time we were buying up the shares: it was in the spring of 1891, I think—I believed that you were an independent shareholder, and brought business to the Construction Company and got the company to take it up—I have a strong impression that you spent thousands of pounds at Manchester while you were at that work, and that you had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> difficulty in getting the Construction Company to take up the Blackpool Company—I looked into everything when it came forward and examined it, and if it turned out to be wrong I should not have sanctioned it, but at the same time I relied largely on the advice of the solicitors—I formed my opinion with the assistance of their advice and also your explanations; I relied largely on your explanations sometimes—when this company started in active operation four year ago or three and a half years ago it had absolutely nothing—it was four and a-half years before you started to work at it, and it was then really a paper company: but prior to the date of Holroyd Smith's con<lb/>tract, when he gives his patents to the company, it was really a paper company, a registration company—and for many years it had been so—Holroyd Smith probably kept it up in the hopes that somebody would come along and take it up and buy it, but, I do not know—while I was at Blackpool I saw the old conduit mains lying in the road, and they are there now, I believe that Holroyd Smith and Parker and other eminent engineers laid many years ago—they were laid claim to be the first conduit tramway in the history of the world—the conduit system is prac<lb/>tically the same system which is now being carried out by the London</p>

               <p>County Council—of course, the original patents have elapsed'; it is only improvements that we can claim—I know you put some thousands of pounds in it in cash £4,000 or £5,000, I think, it was—that would be £100 or £200 at a time, as it was wanted to put it on its legs—I re<lb/>member your going to America about it very well; about twice, I think—I believe that was before you took it to Hooley—I do not know exactly when you took it to Hooley, but I never heard of hint in that connection until some time after that; not until you had come back from America I had never heard of Paine at that time—this would be the end of 1900—I do not think I saw him until in connection with this case or a little before—I think he called at the office at Victoria Street several times a little before; I think some twelve months ago, perhaps; I do not remember seeing him before then; I may have seen him and not recognised him and not known that it was he—he never said to anybody in our office that he had any objection to the company or objection to you—he has never alleged that you conspired with Hooley to defraud him in any way to my knowledge—I have seen him at the office during the last few months; I may be wrong about the time, but some little time ago, some months—I cannot swear to having seen him more than two or three times; I should probably have heard from Mr. Parford, the typewriters, or the commissionaire, and other people if he had called—he has called—I have never heard him allege anything against you; I never heard that he did—we were all thoroughly astounded when this prosecution was begun; well, I speak for myself—I do not know that I had anything to do with a letter that you addressed to the Treasury; I do not remember seeing it—I do not think it ever came before me when we were pressed for money, law expenses, and all that sort of thing, and must have money in the office but had not got it—I remember you coming up or Hooley coming up to the office—I had the impression that he was lending, or was putting up money to help us in our schemes—there was never any complaint about him in our office—I did not understand your relations with Hooley very intimately, but I had the general impression that they were strictly business rela<lb/>tions—I never heard of you travelling about with him, or holiday-making, or being a friend in any way; I have known you visit him; I cannot say anything about the extent of the friendship at all; it was rather out<lb/>side my knowledge when you visited him: I thought it was for the purpose of borrowing money, or something of that sort—I have seen the Articles in our company—to my knowledge Mr. Paine would not have power to call a meeting of our company; he has never written—and asked for a meeting; I should be likely to see the letter if he had, but not as a certainty; it might not have come to me—he has not done so since I have been a director, or ever hinted that anything was wrong—I have heard of his action that he brought; the petition to wind up the company—that was brought nearly a year ago—I do not know any of the facts if it, but I know that while the petition was on, and since it has been going on, Mr. Paine and you have met many times; I have heard so, hut I do not know that I have seen you and him together—nobody else besides you could buy these schemes and bring business to our Con<lb/>struction</p>

               <p>Company—the company has never made any claim against me, I being a director—prior to my being a director the Board was more dominant, I think; they exercised more restriction, perhaps; I might say self-assertion—I was not on the Board at the date of the dinner: I came on in the autumn of 1902: the dinner was in September, 1901, therefore it is only recently, so to speak, that I have been a director, two years, but I have been familiar with the facts, being on the staff in the office, sometimes by absolute hearsay and sometimes by observation—walking. through the Board room dozens of times a day, and sometimes by per<lb/>sonal observation, I was bound to see what was going on; I could not help it—at a meeting of shareholders under the articles I know that Mr. Paine has, by his holding, the same number of votes as you—there is an article that says that no man in the Construction Company shall have more than 5,000 votes, therefore Paine could vote just as much as you could—if he did not like anything he could come to the meeting and just do what he liked—you would be on equal terms, although you put the money into it—he has never put a shilling in; that is a fact, I believe; not since I have known anything about it, at any rate—with regard to the law part of it, that these companies have, as a corporate body, a separate existence legally, they have what they call an entity but no soul—although practically they may be one-man companies, still that one man is different from his company, and his acts must be ratified and vouched by the company formally—I know there was a deed of release in January, 190.'i—I am one of the signatories—the deed of release for the consideration of the public wheel patents, as far as I remem<lb/>ber the terms of the agreement, gave you an absolute release as Mr. as that corporate body is concerned; an absolutely legal release from every liability in connection with you and the Construction Company up to that date—the company does not make a claim against you of any sort at the present time—to make a technical act, with full knowledge that it is only a technical act, we called a meeting of the shareholders of tins company two or three weeks ago, and we sent Mr. Paine and Colonel Harris and everybody else notice to attend—there was something more than a quorum there; not very many: there are not many shareholders; eight or nine; only three or four, to speak of, in addition to the signa<lb/>tories—at that meeting we legally and technically passed resolutions—Mr. Paine was represented by his solicitor, Mr. Davis; he is a pretty dif<lb/>ficult man as a rule: very difficult—he had signed a prosy at that meet<lb/>ing—we authorised and passed a resolution, that is, merely legally and technically passed a resolution, that solicitors should be instructed in the prosecution to retain counsel to hold a watching brief on the com<lb/>pany's behalf in the above case, with instructions that this company makes no charge or complaint whatever against Lawson, but, on the contrary, that the company disapproves of the proceedings of the prosecution in this matter, and sincerely sympathises with Lawson; that was carried without dissent—Mr. Davis said that he would vote neither one way nor the other, but he spoke very strongly in favour of it: he said that Mr. Paine's sentiments were with the resolution, but that he was instructed to vote neither for nor against it; it was a question in some other action</p>

               <p>—I assisted in posting the notice of this resolution to the shareholders: "Notice is hereby given that an extraordinary general meeting of the members of the above-named company will be held at the Cannon Street Hotel, London, E.C., on Monday, the 7th November, at four o'clock in the afternoon, for the purpose of considering (1) the general position of the company; (2) the actions at law now pending: (3) the passing of such resolution, if any, in connection with the above as may be deemed advisable"—I do not think I could swear to Hooley's writing; I have seen the papers about the actions we brought against Paine, but I could not speak to them from memory; I have looked into them occasionally; I leave those matters to the solicitor, and rely on his advice largely—Mr. Ramskill has rarely acted for you in the purchase of some property or other; in that case he may have represented you personally, but he is the company's solicitor—I have known you employ sundry solicitors for occasional work; Ward, Bowie &amp; Co., they do an your work practically; I do not remember any others lately—on difficult occasions, such as the row with the Blackpool Company, they would be consulted; I saw Mr. Ward at Blackpool on several occasions on the subject—Mr. Ramskill is merely a solicitor who is employed; he is convenient and handy; we pay him a retaining fee to attend Board meetings and carry out the instruct<lb/>tions of the Board in such things as he may be directed, and to advise the directors—any big action would be given to another firm—during the whole of the time that I have been connected with this company there is nothing in the whole of the transactions that to my mind is of a suspicious character—there are no creditors of the Construction Com<lb/>pany—the Trust Company does not owe the Construction Company any<lb/>thing to my knowledge; I believe the Construction Company does not owe any money to the Trust Company—I did not have anything to do with the 25,000 shares that were issued fully paid to the Trust Company years ago—as far as I am aware there are no complaints from anybody.</p>

T. Hooley, Esq.": "Dear sir,—I am directed to inform you that at a meeting of the directors of this com<lb/>pany, held on the 9th inst., the following resolution was passed: 'That the agreed consideration not having—been received by the company for the shares transferred to Messrs Hooley and Paine, and no money what<lb/>ever having been paid for the same, the secretary be instructed to apply to them for the surrender of the said shares, and at the same time to call their attention to the fact that they have failed to render the services which they agree to render to the company in exchange for the shares '"—I cannot say from memory what was the "agreed consideration"—I cannot say if it was the same allegation as in the Statement of Claim, that Hooley and Paine were to have made a market—I cannot tell you where that resolution is to be found—there were minute books—I cannot say if there was ever such a resolution—I cannot give you any assistance as to where I can find it in our books—I am still at the office and still a director—I take it there was such a resolution; I do not remember it—our company issued another Writ on December 24th, 1903, leaving out Hooley as a defendant, and they say: "In the months of February and March, 1901, the defendant" (that is Paine) "together with one Ernest Terah Hooley approached the plaintiff, Henry John Lawson, who was interested in the plaintiff company, and represented that they were in a</p>

J. Lawson,"and, I think, "W. P. "or "EL P."is under it; it looks to me as though it is signed by Mr. Lawson's secretary on behalf of Mr. Lawson. It looks like a "P "at the end—I suggest it may be Parford: he has several styles of handwriting, but I think this is his handwriting—this is not his usual handwriting; I think this is one of his unusual handwritings—while I was a director, the company did not try to get a quotation on the Stock Exchange—I have no recollection of any<lb/>thing of the kind—I am very familiar with some phases of the Black<lb/>pool (South) flotation—remember I was at 'Blackpool, and a great deal of the work was done in London—I have given some evidence about it, and some of the things I know only by hearsay—I cannot from memory refer to any minute of the Board of the taking, over by the Construction Company from Lawson of the Blackpool matter—there was Mr. Chad<lb/>well's advice as engineer—he was an important engineer whose advice was taken, and there were the solicitors—that is all I remember now—I was under the impression that there was a difficulty in getting the company to take up the Blackpool but I was not on the Board—Mackenzie and Hunter were with difficulty persuaded there were the plans on the floor, I do not know that Mackenzie was not a director at all in 1901—I am not certain of the names of the directors, I was speaking of Board meet<lb/>ings, when I could not say who was a director—I knew something about it, and I knew that certain directors there were difficult to deal with, but as to which gentlemen they were I could not tell you; when I said Mackenzie and Hunter were there, and were with difficulty persuaded, I take it then I was careless in accepting those, two names—I accepted the statement from Lawson that the directors would come to any bargain they liked with him—I cannot tell you what bargain they did come to with him—I was not a director; even if I were I should not remember at this date without reference to the minutes, probably—the Construction Company were the means of the construction of the line—they</p>

               <p>were not the working contractors—I cannot swear from memory whether they employed the working contractors, or whether they arranged with the new company to employ them—I will not say they had to be got rid of before one single bit of work was done, but I remember the terms of the compromise were signed, I think, on September 24th, 1902, which got rid of the Construction Company altogether—before I went down from Blackpool a great quantity of materials had been collected, but the road had not been touched then—I believe Nevins made a start; I never knew anyone but Nevins—I will swear that there was material collected there except the old road—I can say I saw material collected there that was represented to me to be the material—I did not see it carried there—my work was at the office—I occasionally went to their depot and this was pointed out to me as being a ready to start—when I spoke about material yesterday I was not representing that the Construction Company had in some way supplied that material, but their contractors—I came South at the end of June—I do not know the date of Nevins' death, I have always considered that their taking over this Blackpool business from Lawson was of benefit to the Construction Company—I cannot tell off<lb/>hand what the Construction Company made by it—I do not think they lost; I never entered into it to my memory—I may have gone into it—I cannot, say what they made or what they lost, I do not know, per<lb/>sonally, if Lawson made anything by it—I do not know what the Con<lb/>struction Company gave him—it was before my time as a director—I do not know if he was paid before my time—he is the chief shareholder—I do not think there have ever been any dividends paid by the Black<lb/>pool South—I am not certain—I do not know when it opened, a year ago perhaps—it is a very new thing—I think I have heard of it that the capital had to be reduced—the agreement was made between the Construction Company and the Blackpool South on June 26th, 1901—under the terms of that the Blackpool South were to issue to the Construction Company 150,000 debenture stock, 100,000 5 per cent, preference stock, 150,000 ordinary shares, all fully paid except 30.000 of the shares—I believe the Construction Company were for getting that capital to buy up and pay the shares, debentures and liabilities of the old company—they were also to convert the line to electricity, and <hi rend="italic">have</hi> the new company £5.000 cash for working capital—the proceeds of the 150,000 debenture stock, without deduction were to be placed in the names of trustees, and so much as the engineers certified as necessary was to be retained to be used for the completion of the line—it may be that the underwriters Rutherford and Company claimed to be paid £30.000 as their agreed commission—I am not sure of the date—it may be August 3rd, 1901—I was there the Saturday before the Bank Holiday—I do not know that Lawson or the Construction Company was unable to pay that £30,000—I was not the secretary—the secretary was there also—I am not certain that it was in consequence of their not being paid, that the parties brought a writ for an Injunction to stop Lawson or the company drawing out any part of the moneys that had been paid on the issue of the shares—I can suggest no other reason—I do not know that on December 14th, 1901, Mr. Rutherford and his friends</p>

               <p>meeting the final prospectus which was to be issued was approved and initialled by the directors—at the same meeting 415 shares were allotted to the Construction Company and their clients upon these terms: that the company undertook to accept the return of the application money if the Board were unable to secure a satisfactory number of responsible applications for shares—at that meeting I was appointed one of the committee for the purpose of passing resolutions for alloting further shares—this looks like a copy of the prospectus—it states: "The public subscription list will open on Wednesday, the 25th day of November, 1900, at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, and close at 4 o'clock on the Saturday following"—that has the dates filled in so that shares were being offered to the public—it states, after the words "Electric Underground Rail<lb/>ways: London Electric Tramways": "This company will be in a posi<lb/>tion to tender for the electric work in connection with underground electric railways, London electric tramways, and other important con<lb/>tracts"; the heading is in large letters the name of the company: "The British Electric Street Tramways, Limited, Construction and Main<lb/>tenance Company (Parent)"—I should say that meant it was promoted by the Construction and Maintenance Company "To acquire electric running powers in populous districts where none now exist; to construction underground electric railways; to take over and equip old tramways with modern electric systems, and sell the same to new companies; to connect by electric tramways leading suburbs with large towns: to purchase modern improvements, licences, patents, inventions connected with mechanical traffic of all kinds: to buy and sell municipal grants and rights of construction: to obtain permissions and concessions for the construction and maintenance of new tramways"; those were the main objects—"Nominal capital £300,000, divided into 30,000 shares of £10 each, of which one-third is for working capital ": that is £100,000; "every 10 shares subscribed carries the right to apply for one £10 share in 'The Founders' Syndicate, Limited' issue of 30,000 shares "(that is the whole 300,000)" at par, payable £1 on application, £4 on allotment, and the balance in two equal monthly instalments after allot<lb/>ment. In connection with this company a syndicate is being formed, called the Founders' Syndicate, Limited (capital 6,000 shares of £10 each) "(that is £60,000)." This syndicate is to form new companies and promote Bills in Parliament for new railway and tramway under<lb/>takings, which this company will have the first option of building and constructing": the original intention may have been that the Street Company was to be an engineering and constructing company and the Founders' Company a promoting company—I authorised this prospectus with others—"A syndicate share of £10 will thus become entitled to the promotion profits (debentures, cash, or shares) which it is expected the syndicate will derive from the formation of these railway and tramway undertakings, which are now wanted in many towns. The above arrange<lb/>ment meets the frequently expressed wish of shareholders to participate in the substantial profits made by pioneer syndicates (such as the Electrical Pioneer Syndicate, Limited, which has just divided over £375 "per cent, amongst its shareholders). In view of the high prices ruling in</p>

               <p>Electric Tractions and increasing traffics, these Founders' Syndicate shares should Rave a prospective value in excess of anything that can he foreseen "to-day, as the syndicate may reasonably be expected to make large profits in respect of its various promotions"; then there is the heading "Premium on Founders' Syndicate shares ": "the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, West<lb/>minster, London, S.W., has agreed, if required, to buy these Founders! Syndicate shares at a premium, on the terms mentioned in the contract for sale to this company, a copy of which is set forth on the back of the application form, enclosed herewith"—the idea was that the Construc<lb/>tion Company would buy every £10 share for £15—I think the object would naturally be from the prospectus that if you can sell these Founders' shares at a premium promptly it would be a good turnover—<hi rend="italic">r</hi>—to form an attraction for the shares—every 10 shares of the Street Company that were subscribed you would have a right to apply for and get a syndicate share, which syndicate share you could dispose of to the Street Company for £15—I cannot recollect exactly now, but 1 should imagine the object would be an inducement naturally to—every<lb/>body to purchase, and some people did avail themselves of it—there is set out the present price of a number of successful Electric Companies, Thomas Parker £17, and so on; amongst the first subscribers a number of names are given—I subscribed, according to the best of my recollection; I think for 150 or 200, something like that—it was ray own money; I invested it; I remember I was one of the first—I believe we had the consent of all those people who put their names on the prospectus; you must not forget that this prospectus was very carefully revised for the Board; they took the very best legal advice they could to see that it was right: it was in the hands of Messrs. Lumleys, solicitors, and it was very, very carefully done—I do not-recollect that any of the people com<lb/>plained that their names had been put on the prospectus without their consent—evidently Canon Robert Bruce wrote about it, because I say to him in this letter of November 7th, 1902: "I am quite at a loss how you could have formed such an opinion as to the shares in your name at the time the company was formed"—I have no recollection of this—I do not recollect the name—I see there the name of Lockyer; was that Norman Lockyer's son? because I remember afterwards there was a little trouble with Mr. Lockyer on behalf of his father—then I see Sir William Preece's name and Mr. Cardew's; there was some trouble about the name of Lockyer, I know; it was a long time afterwards, too—the pro<lb/>spectus says: "This company is formed to construct and work lines of electric railways and tramways licensed by special Act of Parliament, by municipal or other authorities, and to extend the service of trac<lb/>tion vehicles in large towns, and to construct me said electric tramways upon the overhead wire and trolley system. It is also formed to take over and equip old tramways with modern electric systems, and sell the—same to new companies: to connect leading suburbs with large towns by electric tramways: to purchase modern improvements, licences, patents, inventions connected with the mechanical traffic of all kinds; to buy and sell municipal grants and rights of construction: to obtain permis<lb/>sions</p>

               <p>and concessions for the construct ion and maintenance of new electric tramways. This company will commence operations at once, sufficient working a capital having already been guaranteed"—it must have been the Construction Company who guaranteed the working capital, as far as I can remember now, on promises of support—I do not know now or whether I knew then, that the Construction Company at this time had any working money at all—Messrs. Lumleys inquired before we issued this statement to the public as to what the value of the guarantee was—I was a director—every one of these statements was gone into—the working capital is stated to be a third of £'500,000, that is to say £100,000, and it says: "Tin's company will commence operations at once, sufficient working capital having already been guaranteed"; that must have been so, or else we should not have passed it—the guarantee. I should say, must have been through the Construction Company—"How difficult electric tram shares are to obtain just now is well known to all would-be buyers upon die market Shares which but a short time ago could be bought at small premiums now find buyers at high prices. Sub<lb/>scribers who had sufficient foresight to apply in the early days of such com<lb/>panies can now make very handsome profits. Indeed, there are few things like traction and tramway shares with such a safe future Street tramways worked by electricity are now becoming so profitable that they almost present the desirable features of an old-established business"; then: This company will tender for and buy up horse-drawn tramways, equip them with its electrical systems, and resell the same to new companies at a profit ": that was the object of the company—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. A vary stated that there was no allegation in the Indictment of any misrepresentations as to the Street Company. Mr. Justice Lawrence said he very much doubted under this Indictment whether the question of what was stated in the Streets Company prospectus had any relevancy. The Solicitor General said he would not press the analysing of the pro<lb/>spectus</hi>)—on November 15th, from the minutes, I attended a meeting of the Streets Company—80 shares were allotted to the Construction Com<lb/>pany on the same terms as before, that was that if there was not a sufficient subscription the money was to be returned, "Eighty shares be and are hereby allotted to the Electric Tramway Construction Company and their clients as per list"—"On the same terms as before, "I think, means that the subscriptions coming from the public came in through the Con<lb/>struction Company and their clients—the terms are that the money is to be returned if a sufficient subscription does not follow, but these are public subscriptions allotted to the Construction Company and their clients on the same terms—on November 21st there was a further 102 shares on the same terms—all those were before the prospectus was actu<lb/>ally issued, on November 28th—upon November 28th the first public sub<lb/>scriptions came in—some of these subscriptions on November 15th and 21st are probably those prior subscriptions named in the prospectus and before the issued of the prospectus—these subscriptions were allotted from time to time a-s the applications came in from the public—£31,730 was by the public—on November.'50th I see a minute referring to a letter received from Lumley and Lumley with reference to a statement in the "Financial</p>

               <p>Times "of November 20th as to modification of the capital of the com<lb/>pany, and also a letter received from the Construction Company under<lb/>taking to indemnify the company in respect of allotments pending an official statement as to modified terms referred to in the "Financial Times"; what that is is shown by the minute of December 3rd, 1900, at which I was present—on that day a letter was authorised to be sent to the "financial Times" stating—that their announcement in their issue of November 29th was not quite correct, but that the vendor company, that is, the Construction Company, had agreed to defer such shares as may be payable under the purchase agreement as regards dividend until the company had paid a first dividend of 5 per cent, on the first capital, subscribed by the public; the effect of that was to defer all these shares which they got by way of purchase money so far as dividend was con<lb/>cerned until this company had paid a dividend of 5 per cent. 'to the "public—on December 10th there was a letter from the Construction Company to nominate Lawson as a director of the Street Company, and the matter was deferred until a general meeting—on December 21st Mr. Thomas Parker, who was one of the directors, resigned; I was not present; I see, at that meeting, but a letter was received from Mr. Thomas. Parker resigning subject to the agreement produced being confirmed—at the next meeting" at which I was present, on January 3rd, I was appointed chairman: there is a proposition by Mr. Huth and Mr. Gordon Hunter; and Lawson was appointed a director—by the next resolution I and Mr. Huth, another director, were appointed a committee to execute the docu<lb/>ments with the Construction Company—"It was proposed by Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, and seconded by Mr. Henry Huth, and carried unanimously, that Mr. Henry John Lawson be and is hereby elected a director of the company, in accordance with a resolution received from the Electric Construction and Maintenance Company, dated December 10th"—the solicitors reported the completion of the purchase of the business from the Construction Company had been arranged to take place; the docu<lb/>ments were an assignment to the company of Holroyd Smith's patents; an agreement between the vendor company and this company modifying the terms of the original contract, and the conveyance and assignment to the company of freehold land and works of the Car Company (that is Purker's company); an acknowledgment about a conveyance and a deed between this company and the Founders' Syndicate securing to this com<lb/>pany (that is the Streets Company) the first option of constructing' any electric railways and tramways to be promoted by the syndicate. The agreement is one of November 1st, 1900, between the Construction Com<lb/>pany and the Streets Company, whereby it is agreed that the "Con<lb/>struction Company shall sell, and the Streets Company "buy, all the interest and full benefit of the vendor company in the contracts, copies whereof are <hi rend="italic">set forth</hi> in the first schedule, and the inventions and patent rights in the second schedule, and some models in the said schedule, and be sole benefit in London and Middlesex, and half the benefits elsewhere of all negotiations, concessions, and contracts entered into, obtained" or to do obtained, by the vendor company in regard to the said patents, me iii consideration of the sale the purchaser company'(that is the</p>

Burt and Co. and the Con<lb/>struction Company, relating to the Exeter Tramways, and to pay the Construction Company quarter net profits that may be derived by com<lb/>pany In "connection with matter"—the Street Company never derived any profits from the Exeter Tramways to my recollection—a second resolution at that meeting is to acquire an interest in the Walthamstow Railway for £2,50O—on January 21st there is a resolution by our com<lb/>pany to apply to the Founders' Syndicate for a loan of £8,500; it is a letter dated January 14th from Walter Webb it Co.; we got it the same day; there is a resolution to accept Mr. Chirping Brown's offer to take over the works at Wolverhampton, pay all outgoings, and pay also a rent of £10 for 28 days—those were Parker's works—I do not think our company had given £20,000 for Parker's works fourteen or thirteen days before: at any rate, I remember the disposal of the works or giving them up was done on a question of profit for the company; we were supposed to have made a profit over transferring the works back to Parker; this resolution says: "Resolved to dispose of the Wolverhampton Works" (that is Parker's works) "machinery, land, it, except land adjoining Patterson and Gear factory, for £2,500": March 18th, 1902: "Resolved to sell the land at Wednesfield for £1,800 ": our company had not given £200,000 in cash and shares for those works and land—there are other things set forth in the prospectus; Holroyd Smith's patents and models and Parker's works: apart from the patents, I do not think that is all the company gnve £200,000 for—my recollection is that the works and land</p>

As it is necessary by the articles of association of both com<lb/>panies to give <hi rend="italic">not less</hi> than one month's clear notice of resignation, I cannot resign before April 1st now, so I will hand in to the secretary my resignation for both companies on Friday next at our next Board.

I hope you will not forget me in connection with the big tramway undertaking you have in hand in the north, and about which you spoke yesterday, for if I can be of any use and there is money in it I am game for what is to be done. I would like you to write me a private note as to this, as it will put the matter in proper order. I have really got such a lot to do now that I cannot devote the time I ought</p>

But I would like to work with you in any other business that may come along if it be to bur mutual advantage."—I became a director and chairman of the Construction Company in, I think, September, 190, at Lawson's request—there was a dinner going to be given, and he asked me to preside—I do not remem<lb/>ber anything particular beyond his asking "le to act as a director—I had no shares in the Construction Company at that time; I asked him whether he would give me some, and we arranged for 0,000 shares—he was to give them to me: I was to keep them altogether—nothing was said about a dividend; I understood it but there was nothing said about it; the conversation was only a few days before September 20th—I wrote Exhibit 69 on September 17th to the secretary of the Construction Com<lb/>pany: "Dear sir,—I shall have much pleasure in accepting a seat upon the Board of your company, and also act as chairman of the same should they be pleased to elect me. Very faithfully yours, Kenneth Mackenzie of Tar bat, Bt."—that is just before the dinner—it must have been a few days before that that I arranged with Lawson to take the chair: I cannot recollect exactly—I do not think I knew anything at all about the state of affairs of the Construction Company before September 20th; I do nor think I knew any details—J got the materials for my speech at the dinner from Lawson: in the form of a draft, I think, probably the day before I made the speech, either at his office or it may have been sent to me; I cannot remember: I think it was manuscript: I probably discussed it with Lawson, and very likely with the secretary—I do not remember what I said about it to Lawson, beyond asking him whether everything was right, and everything of that nature, and whether the money was there: that I had to satisfy myself about—I spoke about the dividend to Lawson: I do not remember what I said about it—I took steps to verify the statements in the draft; I asked the secretary for authority, or what was his authority, or what authority could he give me for making the statement that there was so much money in hand to pay this' dividend—he gave me. If I recollect rightly, two bank slips, two notices from the bank; my recollection was that they amounted to close on £100,000 to the credit of the Construction Company; there was no other statement in the draft of sufficient importance to require verifica<lb/>tion; they were general statements—I made my speech on September 20th: in it I said: "I have the pleasing duty to perform of announcing a dividend of 6 per cent, and a bonus of 1s. 2d. per share, or about another fi per cent., making together a dividend for the shareholders at the rate of about 12 per cent. I know that a larger distribution has been urged, and would have been popular with those people who always look at the cash balance as a guide as to how much dividend is to be paid"—it is hard to remember now who had urged the larger distribution: I was told that was the case by Lawson: that is probably exactly what was written; I made no alteration—I saw a good many copies of the speech at the offices of the company: I probably had a copy myself, and probably I have now—Lawson was not present at the dinner: I do not think I knew that he was not going to be there, but I think, as a matter of fact, he was not there": his name is not mentioned among the guests at all;</p>

               <p>I did not know exactly who were going to be there, except some engineers and professional people—I see in the report "American capital declined"; I do not recollect what the meaning of that was unless it had something to do with Mr. Nevins, who was an American, I think—I do not know that at" this time the Construction Company was negotiating for a loan of £30,000 from Mr. Lot Craven, at 100 per cent, per annum, paying £15,000 in six months for a loan of £30,000—I do not know if I was present at a Board meeting of the Construction Company on October 1st when the loan was actually made—I do not know a loan was made on October 1st—I was a director and chairman, of course, at. That time of the Construction Company, but it was a very few days afterwards; I was not told of the loan—I do not think I have ever seen Mr. Lot Craven—in Exhibit 71 I wrote: "Dear sir,—I have your note of yesterday, but 1 am now off to Cowes for the purpose of laying up my yacht for the winter, and shall not be home till Tuesday night. What is the meeting on Monday about? I am sorry I cannot see 'Mr. Lawson that day, but my arrangements have been made some days ago, and I must do what has to be done. You can write or wire me to the Royal London Yacht Club, Cowes, if necessary. Am glad the dinner went off so well last night, and hope the results will be satisfactory"—when I wrote "I hope the results will be satisfactory "I meant that everything gave a fillip to the business; that everything went off properly—I did not know at that time the moneys in the bank at Blackpool had been arrested there by means of au agreement of August 7th until £30,000 had been paid to the guarantors; I thought the money was available—I did not know that on September 4th the company had been unable to pay a loan made by Hooley or (Mrs. Hooley to the company of £3,000; I never heard of it—I did not know that the Construction Company on July 17th had about £3,000 from Mrs. Hooley; how should I know it? I had nothing to do with the company until tie 17th—I did not know that on September 4th that loan was repaid by means of post-dated cheques—I did not know that Lawson had guaranteed the repayment of that loan, or that Hooley had received a cheque for £100 in consideration of accepting post-dated cheques; I knew nothing about Hooley on September 4th—I remained a director until, I think, June, 1902—on June 18th, 1902, I wrote to the secretary of the Construction Company: "Dear sir,—As you mentioned this afternoon that you would not have much to do this week in con<lb/>sequence of the City and Surrey Electric Railway Company not coming out at once, I suggested to Mr. Gordon Hunter that we should have a Hoard of the E.T.C. and M. Company called for Saturday morning next, and this be agreed to immediately. So will you kindly call one for 11 o'clock on Saturday, the 21st? Both Mr. Hunter and I wish to have a Board meeting of the company for the simple reason that we have got entirely out of touch with what it has been doing for a long while back; and I must say for myself that I have not the least idea what engagements or liabilities the company has entered into, or, in fact, anything that has been done since I consented, to be the chairman. This may seem a most extraordinary statement to make on my part, but when it is con<lb/>sidered how the company is conducted, and how it is managed entirely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140218"/>
               <p>as a private concern, it is not to be wondered at. As, however, the directors are responsible before the law for the conduct of the company, and us I, as chairman, am the one who is held mostly so, I must be put in possession of the actual position of affairs, or otherwise I cannot con<lb/>tinue in that position. I wish to raise no objections or occasion any difficulties, but is only right to myself that I know how we stand, and so I wish for a Board to ascertain exactly everything concerning the com<lb/>pany's financial state. Kindly, therefore, arrange as directed.—the meeting was not arranged—I resigned my directorship, and the chairman<lb/>ship of the company—I gave instructions to my bankers to return the 5000 shares to Lawson, or to the secretary of the company, and they did so; they executed the transfers and sent them to the bank—I see the minute book of the Construction Company, on November 15th, 1901—(<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 185)—I and Mr. Thomas appear to have been the two directors present—"The following letter, which had been received from Mr. H. J. Lawson was read, and after due consideration it was resolved that the terms of the said letter be and is hereby agreed to: 'The directors, the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited. Dear sirs,—I should be glad if you would come to some definite arrangement as to settling up the matters between us, as there is a considerable sum of money payable by the company to me. I propose to accept the sum of £20,000 in full settlement and payable within twelve months from this date, provided a cheque for £5,500 is paid on account, and the company executes a Deed of Mutual Release. Yours faithfully, H.J. Lawson.'—the Deed of Release referred to in the above letter was produced and ordered to be sealed and signed,—which was accordingly done. A cheque value £5,500 on account in favour of Mr. H. J. Lawson was drawn. The meeting was adjourned until after the extraordinary general meeting."—I have a very faint recollection of that transaction—I do recollect some<lb/>thing about this letter from Lawson—I think the state of accounts between Lawson and the company was to have been rendered, or the account was to have been sent in—I do not recollect now if any account was sent in—I attended very few Board meetings of this company after I became chairman; in fact, there is not one minute signed by me at all—everything is done by Mr. Hunter, who was the one who took the greatest amount of work in connection with the company—I was chair<lb/>man, but it was a private concern, and Mr. Hunter had been connected with it for a much longer time than I had and he really attended to it—it was not a public company—I do not recollect ever seeing the account that was to have been rendered—I see Mr. Hunter seems to have signed all the meetings as chairman—"Gordon Hunter, chairman"—to all intents and purposes I was the chairman of the company for the dinner and the dinner only—a cheque was to be drawn for £5,500 after <hi rend="italic">vre</hi> had sent the account—I should say I did not see the account—this is a copy of the Deed—it is an agreement made November 15th, between the Con<lb/>struction Company and Lawson, and it recites: "Whereas the said Elec<lb/>tric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company. Limited, are owners of various Tramway Orders known as the Lancashire Electric</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140219"/>
               <p>Tramways. And whereas the said Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, have advanced to the said Harry John Lawson various sums of money in the furtherance of business being carried on by or through the said Harry John Lawson for or on behalf of (directly or indirectly) the said Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, in connection with the said Lancashire Electric Tramways and otherwise amounting to £25,343 or thereabouts And whereas the said Harry John Lawson has from time to carried on by or through the said Harry John Lawson has from time to time advanced to or on behalf of the said Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, sundry sums of money, and has under various agreements become entitled to be paid various sums of money by the said Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, for services rendered by him to the said company under letters of agreement or verbal agreements large sums of money in excess of the said £25,343."I do not recollect that I saw a list of agree<lb/>ments; "And whereas the said Harry John Lawson has it in his power to introduce to the said Electric Tramways Construction and Mainten<lb/>ance Company, Limited, a company which are taking steps to obtain a project known as the Nottingham, Derby and Ilkeston Tramways, and will use his influence to induce the said company to sell and transfer to the said Electric Tramways Construction and 'Maintenance Company, Limited, the said project with all Orders, etc., when obtained. Now this agreement witnesseth that in consideration of the payment on or before the signing of t-his agreement of the sum of £5,000 by the said Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, the pay<lb/>ment whereof the said Harry John Lawson hereby acknowledges, and in further consideration of the sum of Fifteen thousand pounds to be paid to the said Harry John Lawson within twelve months from the date here-of by the said Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, they, the Electric Tramways Construction and Maintenance Company Limited, and the said Harry John Lawson, do hereby agree to release and discharge each the other of them from all and every charge, claim or liability or liabilities of every description or kind that may be upon them or him towards the other of them up to the date of this agreement. And further to execute a further deed of discharge or other document that may be deemed necessary."—I have no recollection of asking for any verification of the statements made in the document, but if can remember something about this deed was done or executed then—I have a recollection of that—Lawson acknowledges he has received the £25,000, and he says he has paid more—my recollection is that a proper account was to be made up; the account had been made out, and Lawson being in this Construction Company, and being in the other company too, and the whole work being done together, it would be done naturally by the same clerk and handed in—I did not investigate it prior to this—I did not know on November 15th that Lawson was indebted to the company to the extent of £39,000 in cash and shares, or that he was credited in the books of the company on the same day under the terms of the agreement with £59,000 and upwards—I do not recollect</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140220"/>
               <p>anything about it—I understood that Lawson was practically the only shareholder; that is why I asked him for 5,000 shares casually; the number of shares issued was. I think, a quarter of a million—I was pre<lb/>sent at a meeting on October 29th, 1901—I find an agreement was executed on that date with the Tramway Trust, and on November 7th a further agreement was executed, according to the minutes—I knew nothing about the agreement between the Trust. Company and the Con<lb/>struction Company: I have no recollection of it—I know from my ex<lb/>perience as an engineer that the things it is proposed the Trust Com<lb/>pany should do would involve the possession of very large capital—I do not know that the Trust Company at that time had a nominal capital of £107: I know nothing about the Trust: I know now that it had an actual capital of £7 at the most, because you have told me so before, but I did not: know it at that time—they might have a capital of sixpence to begin with—the nominal capital was a million—the consideration is: "In consideration of the Tramways Trust agreeing as mentioned in Clauses 1 and 2 hereof, the Construction Company will pay to the Tram<lb/>ways Trust such sums of money as shall be equal to the unissued capital of the Construction Company less the cash proceeds of 70,000 of each issue, namely, debentures, preference and ordinary shares which, amount<lb/>ing to £210,000, shall be reserved to the Construction Company for working capital, or will issue to the said Tramways Trust, or other persons nominated by the said Tramways Trust, the whole of the unissued share and debenture capital of the said Construction Company as afore-said at par, or fully paid, the proceeds of the said sums payable to the Trust, and the balance to be applied by the Construction Company as and for their working capital"—I see the first notice in the minute of the meeting of October 29th is "A cheque value £45,000 was ordered to be drawn in favour of the Blackpool Trams.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. I have had a good deal of practical experience in engineering in the old days, and been associated with electrical work—there are statements in my speech at the dinner which are founded on my own experience: those founded on my own experience are statements which arc true, and which I am able to speak to with regard to my own knowledge, apart from what anybody ever said to me or sent to me and apart altogether from the facts and figures which were sup<lb/>plied to me by Lawson; I gave the company the benefit of my experience to the best of my ability whilst I was a director—Sir Alexander Binnie attended that same dinner—he made a speech, and in it said, "Great enterprises, in which novelty is concerned, I speak from many years of municipal experience, must always be promoted by those who are pre<lb/>pared to take the risk of financial failure, and I think I am not saying too much when I remark that, coupled with that is a desire, and, let us say, looking at the whole private enterprises in this country, a well-founded desire to obtain pecuniary advantage"—there is not now much doubt about cither of the facts stated by him—I believe the statements to be true which were made to me by Lawson, and which were repeated by me at the dinner, and so far as I knew I knew of no reason why everybody</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140221"/>
               <p>else should not believe them to be true—if I had not believed them to be true I should not have made them—so far as I know there was no reason why Lawson should nor believe them to be true—I never knew that Hooley had anything to do with the company; I never heard of him in connection with the affairs of the company; I never heard that he had anything to do with the management or the internal arrange<lb/>ment of the affairs of the company until the prosecution started this theory that Hooley had anything to do with the management or the carrying on of the Construction Company—I never saw him at the office or even knew that Lawson knew him—at the time that I was dealing with the affairs of the Construction Company I believed that there was a good future for the Construction Company—I have, not had any direct experience in companies that have been formed and carried on the business of obtaining Provisional Orders first, and getting Bills in Par<lb/>liament and Acts, and getting them floated into separate companies, though I know the principle—I know that it is carried on to a very large extent in the country—the first thing is to get your Provisional Order, which means a certain amount of expense—that is something in the nature of a concession, only the Board of Trade never looks at it in that light; they are Acts of Parliament really—of course, Provisional Orders are not looked upon in the light of a particular concession: concession is a foreign tiling altogether; the Provisional Order is something of the nature of what in a foreign country would be called a concession—it is a right under certain conditions to do certain things, which you must get from the authority certainly, and which when given confers upon the person who has it an exclusive right to construct anything in that part of the country, or, rather, to carry out the Orders; and if in the par<lb/>ticular place the scheme is a valuable one, to construct, we will say, a tramway, and the right is obtained by this company by virtue of a Provisional Order to carry on that work, it confers upon them the exclusive right, but it requires financing to carry out—I have carried out a Colonial one myself in the same way—that is the business of the company when the parent company has got the Provisional Order and then floats a sub<lb/>sidiary company which is to carry out, equip, and maintain that particular tramway or a number of them as the case may be: you may either have one Order or a number of Provisional Orders; that is done every day—it the capital of that company is invited for the purpose of being used with regard to the Provisional Order or Orders which it is intended to float, then the ordinary practice is that the parent company gets a profit mi the sale of the Provisional Order; the parent company then floats it, and it makes provision for the sale of the Provisional Orders for the flow company, and it gets something pecuniary from the new company under the contract for the expenses incurred in the promotion, and for the profit, and for everything in connection with the original Order, which has to be floated or used by the new company; that is the general way rf doing it.</p>

               <p>similar work myself—that is why I was interested in the Street Company and the Construction Company—it is very profitable work, and very risky sometimes: it is work that could only be done by very few people indeed; it wants a lot of energy and knowledge—there are very few successful tramway constructors and engineers in England to-day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I do not know why three companies should be used, but two companies undoubtedly, because the objects of the first company may be solely that of promoters, not as constructors—in many ways there is more money to be made out of a second company; they are the first company simply acting as the promoting company; it has acquired and spent so much money on obtaining a certain right; then it has power to sell that right for the most it can et, and may perhaps make a large sum out of it, whereas if they had acted simply as the constructor the engineer could only make those trade profits a-s a contractor—in one case there is only the trading profit; there is the trading profit in making and building a line, whereas the financial profit comes in in financing the whole business—a man might obtain an Act or an Order, say, from a foreign Government which cost him £1,000, and he may be able to sell it for £10,000; these are, of course, empirical figures; a thing is worth what it will fetch, that is all—the third company can only come in in the case of the construction: you must not, of course, confuse it with this com<lb/>pany; I mean a constructing company; it may be the Finance Company and the Constructing Company—I think the Westinghouse Company do a great deal of work like that, as they have got a Promoting and a Construction Company; the legitimate purpose is to make money, I sup<lb/>pose; I do not know that there is any other purpose—I think it is the regular routine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By Lawson.</hi> There are many little private syndicates of gentlemen in the City who are willing to put in money for running a Bill in Par<lb/>liament for obtaining a Light Railway Concession or Order, men who will put up some £4,000 or £5,000 for a Light Railway Order, or put £1,000 a-piece up to £20,000 for the expenditure in obtaining a Light Railway Order—that is entirely different work, and a different class of investor to a man who would put up money for such things as constructing trams, and building tramways and engineering them; they are two totally different things, one a syndicate which runs the Bill and reckons it is going to make 300 or 400 per cent, or, perhaps, lose its money, and the other which is only done by a little millionaire company which has got plenty of money to carry on the construction—there is a totally different kind of syndicate to these, which simply bring it out as a company and get their profit out of the commission on the flotation—the little syndicate that put up fhe £5,000 or £10,000 to get the concession, obtain the Bill or the Act, would next go to the common company promoter to raise the capital for the carrying out of the Bill—having got the capital, or got it to a certain extent, they go to the constructors, who go to men like Westinghouse or Dick Kerrs, or any great engineer, or a small man like Chadwell, who goes and sublets his contract and does the constructing—the construction is a totally different kind of company; it does the building, the digging up of the road, and all the rest of it, and it builds</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140223"/>
               <p>the line right through—very often when a line is constructed and built like that it is re-sold again to a traffic company; that is to say, it is re-floated to people who really want to make their profit out of the fares of the public; that is a regular routine done to-day; there is no law against it, and if they are done legitimately surely they are legitimate; it might be elaborated still more than that—sometimes it pays very well; it is risky, of course—if it happens to be a good paying business it pays—the man who invests his money in the traffic company is the man who will generally be satisfied with five or six per cent.; it might be a trust concern—he wants debentures or to have a good security for his money—he has a line that is a going concern, that is taking money regularly from the public, but that is not the kind of man who will put up £100 hoping to get £400 or £500 for it at the first preliminary stage—the Parliamentary work is only the work of lawyers and counsel and engineers—those professional men, such as Sherwoods, the Parliamentary agents, would be no use at all in a traffic company; it is not in their line—the directors of one of those companies would be no use at all, as a rule, on the other company—I should be no good on a traffic company; it is a dif<lb/>ferent line; but I have had experience on the Parliamentary company in the preliminary proceedings—that is a legitimate reason why the com<lb/>panies must be divided—the first one would be only a small one, and if it was left with that there would not be enough capital to run it—each of those four departments, if they were successful, would make a sub<lb/>stantial profit—I do not know of any one company that does it; they have sub-companies even themselves to do it, even with big companies—it is more profitable and more easy, and customary to have one syndicate and one company for each Bill—I should say very seldom there are several Bills promoted by one; it has generally each one separately by itself—any of these Orders that I have been speaking-of at the dinner, any one of those schemes, would have a capital of £400,000, and some of them £500,000—the Leeds and Wakefield is a very big one—at Blackpool the cost of building would possibly be over £200,000; I do not remember the mileage now—I was introduced to you in 1900 by Mr. Kirby; I think Mr. Kirby brought me to Holborn Viaduct; I remember it was the day after the C.I.V.'s went through; he met me at the Caledonian Club; I remember he telephoned down to me; it would be the autumn of 1900, after the return of the troops—the first transaction I did with you was the purchase of 1,000 Construction shares; that was the very first meet<lb/>ing. I think, when you told me about the company—it was not in the sense of a cash sale—I did not pay you £1,000—I do not know if you ever sold your Construction shares to anybody for cash; I have no recollection of it—I never knew you ask anybody to put money into the Construction Company—the Street Company had certain men as engineers—I was chairman, and there were certain eminent engineers who joined us in the formation of the Street Company, Sir Frederick Bramwell, Sir William Preece, and Major Cardew—Major Cardew used to be electrical engineer to the Board of Trade; he was with Sir William Preece; he had been for many years advising electrician to the Board of Trade—you could not possibly get the co-operation of a greater or more reliable man—Sir</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140224"/>
               <p>W. Preece was the Government electrical engineer; he was the head of the Post Office, the technical part of it, for many years; you could not possibly have obtained the co-operation of a better man, not one known better—you and I met him many, many times—Thomas Parker is of Wolverhampton and London; he is probably one of the most eminent engineers in the construction of railways and tramways; he acts for the Metropolitan District, I believe, or the Metropolitan Railway Company—at the time we formed this company there was a very large project which we hoped to be engaged in through Thomas Parker and Mr. Macrae, the electrification of the Metropolitan Railway—I remember going to break<lb/>fast many times at Mr. Maerae's—Mr. Parker was acting for the Metro<lb/>politan Railway—I do not remember that Mr. Parker was selected as the arbiter in the dispute between the Metropolitan District and the Metro<lb/>politan; I know he had a great deal to do with it—I do not think that men of that sort would all join together with us for a mere device, to put money into your pocket—Mr. Macrae at that time when we were form<lb/>ing this Street Company was himself in daily consultation as far as we knew with the Metropolitan Railway for a great scheme in connection with this electrification—I have not seen you since the last Police Court proceedings—if Mr. Macrae and Mr. Thomas Parker, Sir W. Preece and Major Cardew had brought about the project that they were then engaged upon, the Street Company ought to have been a very rich com<lb/>pany to-day—I was chairman—the idea was that, instead of the electrifica<lb/>tion being done in America, as it is now being done, it was to be done in London, under Thomas Parker, our engineer; under the Ganz system, which would have brought us lots of money; that was the expensive arbitration that was curried out afterwards between the Metropolitan Railway Company and the District Railway Company, about two years ago, to settle which system was to be adopted, and Mr. Parker lost it; if he had won thousands of men would to-day be employed on this very project—I should have had nothing to do with you if I had had any suspicion that it was a mere device for putting money into your pocket—the solicitors of the Street Company were Messrs. Lumley &amp; Lumley; the directors left to them the drawing up of the papers; Mr. Harper, one of the partners, acted—they took counsel's opinion on everything, and they were very, very particular about it—a very respectable firm of brokers was employed and put on the prospectus, well-known stockbrokers, bur I had "Forgotten that—as chairman I allowed this prospectus to be used, and on it it says that sufficient working capital had already been guaranteed: I "Understood that was the case, and that is why we knew, before the company went to allotment, that it would certainly go to allotment: the working capital was guaranteed—I believe that the profit which we made was all paper, all shares—I think that the inventions of Thomas Parker, electrician and electrical engineer of the Metropolitan Railway, would be likely to prove of value—Thomas Parker, of Wolver<lb/>hampton, is paying large regular dividends, and he has a very prosperous company indeed: the Elwell Parker Company it is called—that was founded by him, and he was engineer to it at this time—I think he was engaged at that time in bringing out an altogether new system of electrical</p>

               <p>traction, which was put in our prospectus—I gather that I went down to Wolverhampton; I have been to the Wolverharnpton works several times, but whether I went down on that occasion I do not remember—knowing him to be what he was, and knowing that his works in Wolverhampton and his business paid so uncommonly well (it states on the front page of the prospectus what the dividend was), we were perfectly justified in believing that we had got a good thing—I do not remember if the Mid<lb/>land Syndicate was one of Thomas Parker's syndicates—we made all our paper, or most of it, our shares that we had to take for profit in the flotation of this Street Company, all deferred scrip—that was the sugges<lb/>tion of Mr. Macrae, who was the proprietor of the "Financial Times"; lie subscribed, or underwrote, £10,000 in the company—he came out on morning with an article in which he put this scheme at full length in the "Financial Times," the ordinary shares being made deferred shares, so as to give subscribers an advantage over our paper that we had to take as our paper profit—the Construction Company had to take this paper profit, and we willingly stood behind and let the public come in first if there was any dividend—there is nothing very fraudulent in that—the company had a half share in the Walthamstow Railway: that was the arrangement made—I was chairman of the promoters of the Walthamstow Railway, therefore I knew every single thing about it—we started this work of running this Bill in Parliament, and with the money we got from the Street Company the Construction-Company began to run this Bill—the Walthamstow Railway was the most beneficent scheme and project that could possibly be suggested for Bethnal Green and East London, owing to the overcrowded condition of the population there; it was part of our idea that we should have halfpenny electric fares for the poor people, to take them right out into the country, where they could get cheap dwellings; of the various Bills that were being promoted at the rime it was well known that the City and North East Suburban Railway was the pick of them all—I, with the other gentlemen whose names were in the Bill, signed a small trust deed by which the Bill was the property of the Construction Company, and the Construction Company agreed with the Street Company that half of it belonged to them: that is my recol<lb/>lection—Mr. Walter Webb drew it—the original, if I remember, was with Messrs. Walter Webb &amp; Company, and it would be a copy with the Con<lb/>struction Company—the Street Company put in £2,700 towards the pro<lb/>motion of the Bill—our expenses would not come to £5,000 in January, 1901—nobody else had any interest in it but us until a long time after<lb/>wards—Mr. Wack put £1,000 in; that must have been in 1902; I cannot recollect if by that time our two companies had paid Mr. Webb alone about £17,500; I know there was a great deal of money paid over to him—my recollection is that we had paid for costs in this Bill at the time 1'ierpoint Morgan came in, two years afterwards, well over £20.000—I believe up to the time that Morgans came in others had found<lb/>funds for The promotion, other than the Construction Company, the Street Company, and the Founders' Syndicate—I recollect this American, Mr. Wack—two or three others came in; Mr. Webb brought in several people to help—I think there was somebody else who put money in; I cannot recollect</p>

               <p>who it was; those other persons did not put so much money in as Mr. Week: I remember Mr. Webb said he had found somebody to put some more money in—my recollection is that the Construction Company and the Street Company practically owned this Bill proportionately between them; that is also with the Street Company including the Founders' Syndicate: they were part owners too—this is a copy of the bill: it say: The Company incorporated; Sir James Kenneth Douglas Mackenzie, Bart., of Tar bat, Henry William Tigwell, Nathaniel Fortesque, Edward Thomas Heed, and Gerald Ward Martin: those were the original pro<lb/>moters of the Bill—a trust deed was signed saving that you were the owners of the Bill; whether all signed it or not I do not know, but at any rate the necessary quorum signed it: I recollect the deed quite well—the proposed capitalization was over three millions—I do not recollect what Sir Douglas Fox swore before the House of Lords what the profit would be; it is a big sum of money; 10 per cent., I think, would be allowable on a matter of that nature; it would be a most moderate profit—10 per cent, on the cost of construction in this case would have been at any rate £'500,000—I think it was, 3 1/2 millions for building the line—if there is an excessive profit the Bill is thrown out; it is one of the objections to it—in this case we should have had over £'500,000 profit", probably—I think Sir Clinton Dawkins stood up in that Committee and gave evidence that he would find over two millions of the money—he represented J.S.

In connection with some of the Nottingham Bills, but there were no circulars sent round except the dinner invitation; no appli<lb/>cation to the public that I know of—it never has been offered to the pubic; it has never been floated or brought out in the ordinary way—relieve has never been any public money subscribed to my knowledge in the Construction Company for shares: I have always believed the Con<lb/>struction Company was a private concern altogether—when I first saw you the subscribed working capital of the Construction Company had been sup<lb/>plied solely by you: Colonel Harris put £2.10 in, but you have done all the work of the Construction Company—my name was never used publicly and there are no public in it—I never knew you to be in a fiduciary rela<lb/>tion to the Board, acting under the instructions of the Board and acting as a paid manager you were never a servant nor a paid manager—you worked these schemes up and brought them to the Construction Com<lb/>pany, and made proposals and propositions to take them over—I know that you are a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, and would be fairly entitled to charge the Construction Company and send in an account for any work you did, although it is like charging yourself, in one way; still, for the purpose of formal, regular order and book keeping, there ought to be some record—I do not know of any creditors of the Construction Company—as a professional engineer you are entitled to send in a bill in the ordinary way—if I brought you a proposition, with £100,000 capital, it would be perfectly lawful that you should have a share for the introduction of the business—I suppose almost half the City make their livelihood out of commissions for the introduction of business—I should charge as much as I could get from you for commission, but I should say at any rate 10 per cent.; that would be 10 per cent, on £100,000—I consider, as a civil engineer, that a man is lawfully entitled, and has a lawful right, to charge a syndicate or a company £10,000 for introducing a £100,000 project or scheme, if it is a good business; of course it is not an engineer's fees, an engineer does not make 10 per cent.: but it is commonly paid, and if they agree to it that is sufficient; it may not be payable in cash, if it is a success it would be—if the com<lb/>pany take it over it is a common practice to say: "If you adopt my scheme I shall want so much down in cash and the balance when it goes through, "otherwise you would be tying it up, and would get nothing for it and perhaps lose the scheme for nothing—you had a right to do the same thing with the Construction Company—usually, with a £100,000 scheme, company promoters would make about 25 per cent, profit; you would not get anybody in the City to take it up unless it shows about 25 per cent, profit—we should expect the man who brought it to us was honestly entitled to at least £10,000 out of it, especially If he had devoted time and given work to it: a mere commission agent would not get that—if you had sent an account at that time on to the Electric Tramways Company, properly made out on the rate I have said, you</p>

               <p>would have been entitled to have received a very-large sum of money, much larger than anything they have ever paid you—the Blackpool shares were selling at that time at a good price, and the company had made over £100,000—that is my recollection—therefore you were entitled to a good share of that profit—if you had not held 50,000 shares you would have wanted to have been paid, and if they had not paid you, and you had sued them in the ordinary way, you would have got it—I suppose you introduced Thomas Parker to the company; nobody else, to my knowledge introduced the Street Car Company of Wolverhampton—you would do entitled to charge for many interviews and negotiations in going down to Wolverhampton, paying the railway fare out of your own pocket, staying in the hotel, and seeing all the different people in the Car Com<lb/>pany, and for introducing buyers of shares of the Street Company—if you sold 20,000 shares you would be entitled to charge a commission—you would be entitled to charge for introducing the Exeter Tramways, and for interviews, hotel and travelling expenses to Exeter, and living there for a week, introducing and negotiating the formation of the new Exeter Tramways, and attending town councillors' meetings in Exeter—I saw the town clerk and the council men—you would be entitled to charge for arranging with local authorities, selecting the route, surveying, meeting landowners, engineers, Parliamentary agents, solicitors, commis<lb/>sions paid, all those sort of things—I cannot answer yes or no as to 10 per cent, on the introduction of the scheme or project: that would naturally depend upon their amount—whatever the out-of-pocket expenses came to you would be entitled to charge a fair price for—the Electric Tramway Construction Company was not sham two years ago—it is not true to say that it never had a penny, that it has not a penny, that it never could have a penny, and that I never will have a penny—I know Mr. Cotterel, the engineer; his valuation as to what this Blackpool recon<lb/>struction was to cost was greatly in excess of what Mr. Nevins estimated—I met Mr. Nevins; he was an Irishman and a very jolly fellow; he had a great experience of tramway building; he was a well-known man in New York, and had a large business there—we were not obliged to be bound by Cotterell's estimate—if we could build it any cheaper so much the better for us, and all the profit over the actual cost of building the tramway, and the £5,000 working capital, and the obtaining of the old company would belong to the Construction Company, if that were the terms of the arrangement—I do not know if at the time of the dinner no balance-sheet had been got out; I never saw one—when I was discussing as to what the announcement, was I was going to make at the dinner I wasn't basing my estimate upon any figures in a balance-sheet—you told me that you were going to declare a dividend of 12 per cent., and that you would be glad if I would do it for you; you were responsible if it was based upon only an estimate that we had heaps of money—I suppose Hunter and the other directors who talked of the matter were estimating that we had plenty of money—to pay 12 per cent, would cost about £6,000 on the capital—when I stood up at that-dinner I said there was close upon £1 Of),000 capital, and the vouchers for that sum I had seen, or approximately that sum—they were shown to me—I have a recollection</p>

               <p>balance which came to us, and the thing was amicably arranged—the shareholders in the Blackpool Company did finally get their tramway, I believe; I do not know; I have never been to Blackpool since, so I cannot say very positively about it—seeing that we raised the capital to form the company, and got the tramway built, that is in my mind sufficient for our company to do, except to please the shareholders by paying a dividend—I do not know when it was completed—as a rule, tramways run for nine months to twelve before they pay dividends—if it never pays a dividend I should say we have robbed nobody if we have carried out our business in a legal and proper man from all that I know of the business it has been done properly—on the night of the dinner the company was going on most: buoyantly and prosperous—about £150,000 profit would have come to the Street Company—I think, if I remember the speech I made then, I said that I went on the Board of that Railway Company for the benefit of the Street Company; that was one of my main objects in joining Walter Webb, so as to have a control over the Walthamstow Rail<lb/>way Bill—at that time, when the dinner was on, the Street Company had every prospect of pulling off the big <hi rend="italic">coup</hi>—in September, 1901, there was no reason for our wrong down the shares of the Street Company as being of small value, to my knowledge; I do not know what the financial posi<lb/>tion of the Street Company was at that moment—I knew of the railway; we had that asset—with that asset in the coffers there was no reason why we should say that we had lost the money or that the shareholders had lost the money, or that we should write down these things as money lost—I cannot express any opinion as to the value of the Street Company shares in September, 1901—the railway was certainly strong at that time—I do not remember now what was the reason of my resignation, except it was after my letter to the secretary; after that interview with Mr. Hunter we decided that we should and ought to have a meeting called; no meeting was called, and I think shortly after I sent in my resignation; I do not remember any further meetings or discussions about it—I did Not send it in because I thought something suspicious was going on with the Construction Company, but being in the position of a director, and knowing nothing about it, I thought I had better be relieved of that responsibility, whatever it amounted to, and that is why I left; I do not know if Mr. Hunter left about the same time; I think so—there was no row; there never had been any row or any reflection on the company that I know of, except that we thought we ought to have some informa<lb/>tion, being in a responsible position—I do not know if the Blackpool Company-was on at the time of the dinner—I cannot tell you where you were at that time; it is possible you were in the North of England—I do not remember that the Company involved an enormous amount of trouble, running about, and all that sort of thing—I remember what the secretary had to do, Mr. Osborne: there was a great deal to do—if we had available cash, and had seen the bankers' slips, and all that sort of thing was in my knowledge, it would seem very strange and would cause a great deal of suspicion that we should be unable to pay £2,000 or £3,000 to Hooley if we owed it—there are many syndicates, with heaps of money who are quite willing to renew on terms, as well as private people: the only thing star<lb/>ling</p>

Norton, Rose and Norton—there are more here than I had—there were about sixteen or seventeen altogether—there are twenty-seven here—it was a-list, like this that I took of our Construction Tram<lb/>ways to Messrs. Norton, Rose and Norton—I saw Mr. Turton Norton, the senior partner, and told him about the connection with you, and that I had got from you an option of these tramways, and asked him whether he could finance them, knowing he acts for big firms and for very big people in the City—he told me that he thought he could—I gave him a list, and he instructed Mr. Farish, one of his partners, to go thoroughly into the whole thing on their behalf, and Mr. Farish, I think, came down to your office once or twice aid went into these matters and made a report to Messrs. Norton, Rose and Norton—I understood everything was in perfect order, and that they were ready to carry it through, but Mr. Norton wrote to me and asked me to get the matter held over for a little, owing to the illness of his client—after waiting, I think, for a fort night, my recollection is that you would not give me any longer time and I lost the deal with Mr. Norton—that was, I should think, early in 1002—Mr. Norton took a good deal of trouble with it—I had a dozen meetings I should think—he went into it very thoroughly, and flint satis<lb/>fied me at the time that those properties were in hand, but it was a £300,000 syndicate ho was gainer to find, and you, if I remember, wanted £300,000 cash for it—they seriously entertained it and thought it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am the secretary of the Dublin Dis<lb/>tillers' Company—they have their offices at Thomas Street, Dublin—that company—was incorporated in 1889 with a capital of about £1,100,000—as regards the ordinary shares of that company they are £5 shares fully paid; no dividend has been paid on them since September 30th, 1893: the preference shares have not paid any dividend since June 30th, 1900; they paid 3 per cent, for the six months—I have got here the register of transfers of the company in November, 1900: Mrs. Hooley had as registered owner in the company 1,200 shares; on November 20th she had 1,200 ordinary shares standing to her credit; she afterwards acquired others—there were no transfers in the office in November; we did not receive a transfer until December 17th; I think that was the date; as a matter of fact, on November 24th there was a transfer for 300 shares sent from Mr. James Arnold Bradshaw, and it was received by me on the 26th—the date on the transfer was No<lb/>vember 14th—there were shares subsequently registered in her name, which brought the total up to 2,320—I have not made out what is the con<lb/>sideration in the transfers for that number: she bought them at various prices: the amount she received for them would be £1,026; she sold them at various dates; she commenced selling about October, 1900, and she cleared them off by selling to a Mr. Francis Kedfern, on March 12th 1903—I do not find that any of her shares were transferred into the name of Lawson or Ormerod: the transfer is registered with us on Decem<lb/>ber 17th from Ross and others to Mrs. Hooley, the consideration for that was £225 for 300 ordinary shares: that would be 13s. apiece—there is another, on November 20th to McCormack of Donegal; those were 50 ordinary shares for £37 10s.—there is another of the same date: Henry Richard Glynn, of Kilrush, to Mrs. Hooley, 100 shares for £75.</p>

I am a solicitor, practising at 14, Great Marl<lb/>borough Street—I have known Hooley eight or ten years; in September, 1900, I advanced him £2,000 by way of loan—this is the cheque for 1950; I do not quite recollect how the odd £50 was made up—it is dated September 13th, 1900, pay to J.A. Bradshaw or order £1, 950, and it is endorsed by J.A. Bradshaw and paid into the National Provincial Bank of England, Limited, Piccadilly Branch; that is Mr. Ormerod's account—in September, 1901, that sum of £2,000 was still owing to me—the prospectus and the report of the speeches produced were shown to me by Hooley: I cannot say when—I was pressing him to repay the £2,000 which he owed, and he brought to my notice this Construction Company, which he thought was a very good tiling, and said if I would take 2,000, he thought he could get them for me; he then produced some plans and a list of the concessions of the company—I read in Sir Kenneth Mackenzie's speech the statements about the dividend and bonus, and the balance of £100,000 at the bank—I believed those state<lb/>ments—the first lot of shares I bought was a lot of £2,000—this is the transfer of 2,000 shares, September 24, 1901—I accepted these shares in satisfaction of the debt—this transfer dated September 11, 1901, from H.J. Lawson to Mr. Bradshaw is a transfer of all those shares identified by the same numbers—on the transfer to Bradshaw the consideration is stated to be 5s.—on my transfer the consideration is £2,000.</p>

Coutts, which I very rarely used; I do not think there were 20 cheques drawn in the last four or five years—I found the two cheques for £500, and both marked "For Electric Trams"—the first one is payable to C.

Sims White, and has passed through Foster's Bank, Cambridge—I have given the Treasury all the letters I have—the meaning of my writing that I would "bring the matter before the Court "was I was very dissatisfied because I could not get my transfers registered and get a certificate—I meant to take proceedings in the Chancery Court against the transferor: that is why I asked at the end of the letter for a full description of my transferor; I have put "transferee "in the letter, but that is a mistake—my shares in the Construction Company Hooley took off my hands for the price I gave for them, because I was very dissatisfied with the Company, and I told him that I did not like the way things were being done, and that they did not seem to be doing anything, and lie said if I was dissatisfied he would take the shares from me for what I gave for them: he offered to do that himself, I never asked him to—he told me he had not got the money at the moment, but if I liked to accept a small estate in Cambridge shire which he had belonging to his wife as payment, he would take the shares as payment for it—I agreed to that—I cannot tell you the actual date of the agreement; I can give you the date of the conveyance of the estate to myself, but there was no written agreement to accept the estate; it was carried out almost immediately afterwards—the date of the conveyance is April 29th, 1903, and the probabilities are that the agreement, which was only verbal, was some time before that: I should have to investigate the title of the estate to see if Mrs. Hooley was entitled to convey it to me—that agreement was probably a month or two before the conveyance—I gave him the certifi<lb/>cates, and I signed a blank transfer—I remember Hooley producing this document to me in my office, and he asked me if I had any objection to refuse to sell my shares for six months under a certain price, and I said I had no objection at all—when I signed this document it never struck me that it was a pooling agreement at all;' I simply agreed not to sell for six months; I did not mind that; I was very busy, and I do not suppose I read it all through; it is a pooling agreement, and when I said in my letter to the Construction Company that I had no recollection of a pooling agreement, I had no recollection of this paper at all, and did not it was a pooling agreement: I see on looking at it it amounts to a pooling agreement—if I had had that in my mind I would not have put in my letter of December 26th, "your letter of the 2th inst. is the first. I have heard of any pool": all I remembered was that I had knarred not to sell for six months.</p>

Is above my own, and I would almost swear it was there: I have followed exactly his phrase<lb/>ology in signing it—I got 3,000 shares, for which I released a debt due mini Hooley of £2000, and I had paid £1,000 for 1,000 shares—I have no copies of the letters at-all—I did not treat it as a matter of business: it was a private matter—a general distrust of the undertaking seemed to be growing in my mind, and I told Hooley that I was dissatisfied with it—I thought the shares were not turning out as valuable as expected, and Hooley volunteered to take them back at the price given for them—he suggested it; I was complaining that I thought the thing was a failure and he said he still believed in ft, and if I was dissatisfied he would take them off my hands—it was a verbal agreement between us—I satisfied myself as to the title, and he executed the conveyance in pursuance of his word, cam-ing out the bargain in April, 1903, thirteen months before this prosecution, which was in May, 1904—I have not made any charge against Hooley in connection with the Construction Company's matters, or his sale of shares in it to me; I thought he behaved very well to me: he took them back and gave me what I gave for them—I have not sug<lb/>gested that he has defrauded me—I do not suggest it now—I am perfectly satisfied with the way in which he carried out this transaction: the estate was well worth what I gave for it: I had it valued: there was no sus<lb/>picion as to over-valuing, because it was valued for mortgage purposes—I never made any suggestion against him at all.</p>

I think that is a wrong expression, because I do not think I did purchase the shares on the faith of that: I may have done—I wrote "The whole matter is so unsatisfactory that I have decided to bring the whole state of the case before the Courts, as it seems to me the whole action of the company from its very commencement requires investigation."—That depended on whether I could get a satisfactory answer from the secretary—that was my impression at the time; that was my intention—I cannot say what was floating in my mind then—I am a solicitor—I was writing a solicitor's letter to the company putting forward my case—I was dissatisfied, and I simply wrote to the secretary to that effect—I have given you all the answers—I got my certificates after that, and I had great difficulty in getting those—I cannot say what the date was: that was the beginning of the trouble, and then I did not get answers to my letters—at the Police Court I considered to the best of my ability, and refreshed my memory as far as I could, and told the facts as far as I knew them—I had plenty of time—I got an intimation on June 22nd, 1904—I was not examined until September 20th—I do not remember my attention being called to the letter; it may have been—the addition to my statement I take to be the letter of the 18th, which I do not see; this may be correct for aught I know—if you show me the letter of the 15th and the enclosure I may be able to tell you that, but you put these written documents into my hands—I my have never seen it, or I may have seen it: I do not remem<lb/>ber, I do not, say I did not—I did not bring the matter before the Court—I suppose I was satisfied—I do not know why—Hooley did not take my shares off my hands as far as I recollect until the beginning of the</p>

               <p>next year; this was in December—I was evidently satisfied somehow or another—you have tin cheque before you which drives you the date of the dividend, and you have tin-date when I purchased the other shares; I do not remember the dates—J never made a surjection that I had been defrauded. I am perfectly clear of that: I never mentioned such a thing all I said was it was at his suggestion that I bought, and that he had put me into a bad thing—that is all: I never suggested fraud of any sort, and certainly it was never any suggestion of fraud on my part that induced Hooley to buy the shares.</p>

                  </hi>. I was appointed by the directors a director of the Electric Construction Company in September, 1900; I cannot-call to mind the names of the directors at the time—I was a director two years and two months; I left in November 1902—this is my signature to this cheque to Sir Henry White as a dividend on his shares—as a director we had announced that we were in a position to pay a dividend of 12 per cent.; I cannot go any further than that—it was announced at the dinner that we were in a position to pay that: it was spoken of generally at the Board meetings—we resolved at our meetings that we were in a position to pay a dividend if necessary—I was never present at any resolution that a dividend should be declared: I was told at Bow Street that a dividend had been declared—my authority for paying £226 of the company's money on that cheque was that the recipient of it was the only man who had ever put any of his own money into the company, and he was deserving of a certain amount of interest—Mr. Paine had not put in any, that I am aware of—Sir Henry White had purchased shares for cash in the company—the company did not get it—I paid Sir Henry White money of the company because Sir Henry White was holding shares in our company, I presume—Mr. Paine held shares; is one of the syndicate that was running the company—Mr. Paine's shares were pooled, I always understood, with Lawson's, and stood with Lawson's shares—this cheque is the 8th October, 1901—I presume the best thing would be to refer to the minute book: I cannot tell you now whether there was a meeting held in that date or not—(<hi rend="italic">Read from the secretary's affidavit</hi>): "No dividend or bonus was declared by the said company on the 20th September, 1901, or at any time since then"—I presume lie would not swear an affidavit to that effect unless it was true: I have even' reason to suppose that what lie swore at the time would be true—I have never seen Hooley in our office: if I have never seen him how do I know he went there: he has never been in the office to my knowledge—my name is on this transfer of 500 shares from Lawson to Sir Henry White as passing the transfer in the ordinary formal manner, I suppose a director's duties—there is another signed the same day which does not seem to have any<lb/>thing of the kind on it—I do not find any others—with a similar signature—I do not know how my name came to be there, I am sure—I received my qualification: 200 shares I think the amount was: they were handed to me by Lawson in part consideration of directors' fees and in part con<lb/>sideration of money I had invested in another company with him—in the</p>

               <p>Construction Company I received my directors" fees in due course—I got the shares in lieu of the fees; I received the shares in part consideration—I did not get my fees as well in full—there would be a certain amount that was not paid, and it would be written off that; I presume it would go back into the company, so far as I know, in payment for the silages—it is absolutely impossible for me to remember matters of routine three or four years ago—when I left the company, on November 28th, 1902, I did not sell them—I suppose they are still standing to my name in the company's books—I have not been a director since then—I did not get any dividend on the Construction shares; they would be in the pool with the rest of the shares—the reason I did not sell them was because I did not wish to sell them—I had no thought one way or the other whether or not they had any market value at the time—I said in the Police Court, "When I left the company I did not sell them; they had no market value"—possibly they had no market, value—I am quite willing to stand by anything I have sworn—we never applied for a quotation—Lawson's position was the main and only shareholder at that, time, I believe—he would do any work, and for what he did he was in a position to demand what payment was reasonable—I should say there was no arrangement with him; he was a perfectly free agent, I should say—he would be present now and then at the board meetings—he could or could not bring a scheme to the company, just as he Irked, I always understood—the secretary and the clerks carried out the instructions by the Board—the business of the company was'the general promotion of tramway schemes, and things of that sort—Lawson would luring a scheme before the Board and would submit it, and the Board would pass it, and say what was to be done with the thing—when Lawson rough the thing to the company it would be in a cut and dried state—I looked upon him more or less as a shareholder who was following his own money, and was managing his own money—I swore in my deposi<lb/>tion, "I always looked upon him also as managing director"; that is quite correct—those were words which were, more or less, put-into my mouth at the time; they are capable of a certain amount of explanation; it is hardly fair to put it into a case of this sort, a criminal trial, that I absolutely looked upon that man as a managing director—I did leave it to Lawson to manage the affairs" of the company, in so far as his own interest was concerned, as he one man who had any hard cash involved in it—I did not say the words were sprung upon me; I adopted them, more or less; a good deal more. I should think, from my experience of it—you have "the minutes, and you know Lawson was never appointed managing director, and Lawson as not managing director—he managed his own money—when I gave the statement I explained particularly to the detectives that I was very un-certain about it, and it was promised that I should have a look through it before the depositions were taken at the Police Court, and then when the police Court proceedings were on I was cross-examined on that without having a chance of looking at it and correcting it—I told them I was uncertain about the facts I was stating there, that the matter was two wars old—I said 'I thought he was a director of the company"—I thought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140246"/>
               <p>so at the time, probably—as to advancing money by the company to Lawson, I cannot say anything about that now; I have no recollection of any transaction of that sort—I presume the letter of February 20th, 1900, from Lawson to "The Directors Electric Construction and Main<lb/>tenance Company Limited "was brought before me—it apparently mean hat the proposal was that fur moneys which the company advanced he was to give either cash or shares as bonus out of his profits from the pro<lb/>posed companies—he was to take the profits of the proposed companies only so far as that letter is concerned: what that letter says of course I cannot go behind—Lawson would have money as he expended it—I really do not know about any particular agreement: we had two or three dozen agreements every week—we borrowed a la rue amount of money from Mr. Lot Craven: I believe £30,000—he got 50 per cent, for the loan: I did not say 50 per cent, per annum: 50 per cent, bonus—in the letter of July 17th we agreed to 100 per cent—he would get his bonus for introducing the loan. I suppose £30,000 or 50 per cent on that, one way or the other—I presume whatever the arrangement was it was perfectly right at the time, and everything was satisfactory—I can only go so far as you have cut the facts in black and white before you—the transaction would not strike me as a director particularly—we were dealing with thousands and thousands daily—it would be a matter of ordinary routine—we night have sent Sir Henry Whites £226 in the morning, and received the loan in the afternoon you know—we were in a position to pay a dividend if we were going to ret £30,000, and pay £15,000 for having it, and make another £20,000 ourselves—paying Lawson £30,000 was nothing to us at that time with my knowledge of the Company—I am serious—we had the finest assets that any Company could have—ran you yet £30,000 on a specula<lb/>tive scheme—those assets were speculative schemes, which, if worked properly, will become worth thousands and thousands of pounds—that is the way I looked upon the thing at the time—there may be something else, you know more of them than I do—we were not payintr £45,000 for £30,000—we were paying £15,000 for £30,000 to—the £30,000 to Lawson I think was all lumped in with the various things that the Company owed Lawson—the books will show you better than I can speak from memory—I do not think that Lawson had a tithe of what the Com<lb/>pany legally owed him—there may have been also on that 1ti a com<lb/>mission, of £5,000 paid to Mr. Holdsworth, I really cannot say or there may not have been—Mr. Lot Craven was to lend £30,000 on October 1st, and it was to be repaid in seven months with £15,000—Houldsworth was to get £5,000, Lawson was to get 100 per cent, com<lb/>mission, which is £30,00 and Houldsworth was promised a further pay<lb/>ment of £10,000 as part of his commission, when payable, as and when the Company received their profits from the Wakefield, Leeds, and Dewsbury Company, does not that show the speculative nature of the loan—you are bound to pay those terms for speculations of that sort—suppose that £100 now would be worth £300 to you in a month's time, you would be willing to pay £400 for it now, if you could do a deal which you could not do without an extra £100—this was October 1st, a few days</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">examination continued</hi>). Lawson's agreement of. I think, July 18th, was that he was to have a commission on all business he introduced to the company—100 per cent, were the original terms, I believe—on a deal of the magnitude of the Blackpool Tramway Company, £100,000. he would alter the terms, as we did eventually—on £100,000 he would have to get £100,000, according to the agreement—if Lawson brought in such a deal as would produce £10(1,000 profit lie would be en<lb/>titled to half the profit that the company made—that would be 100 per<lb/>cent—that is the best way you can work such an agreement out: it is always open to a little alteration as time goes on—the directors would de<lb/>termine the alteration, with Lawson's consent, I presume—possibly he would take the whole of the profit, I do not see why lie should not in his own company—the Construction Company was his property pure and simple, and that of the Syndicate, they were running it to<lb/>gether—there was no public money—Paine and Hooley were going to turn it into a public company—Hooley was interested with Mrs. Hooley—Lawson put the company into Hooley's hands with the eventual idea of promoting, it at such time as we did good business—the company was floated as a public company when shares were issued to the public—Lawson. I believe, put a large block of shares into Hooley's hands, and Paine joined Hooley with the idea that the three of us should be interested in the eventual promotion of the company as a company when it was in a fit state—the agreement of November 26th, 1000, is what I have in my mind—probably I knew all about it at the time, but it is impossible to say four years afterwards—you have the minutes, you can answer that question better than I—the £30,000 introduced applied to various schemes—I do not think the company ever got that sum for the schemes—Lawson's letter of November 15th shows that the company was in such a condition that Lawson took whatever he thought advisable—I think the books show about £20,000 advanced to Lawson at or before that time—I do not remember the deed of release, but the figures—would most certainly be put on the table at the time—the deed of release would not be signed without we knew about the terms and went into the matter—you have the minute there and it purports, I presume, to be correct—I am not saying it is not correct—the "services rendered" refer to the fact that Mr. Lawson was finding and buying Tramway Orders and things of that sort—"could always reckon that he was entitled to a fair remuneration for the work he did, independently of his engineer's fees, and his commission for introducing business on the terms of his agreement—he never pushed the point of his 100 per cent.—he dealt fairly and honestly with us—I believe there was an agreement to share the profits when the company would eventually float the Tramway Orders—I cannot say if the agree<lb/>ment was reduced to writing—we had so many agreements with one party and another, it seems unreasonable to expect me to remember it</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. The Construction Company in the way spook of as having been promoted, Hooley cannot have had anything to do with: it was to be promoted: it was a company in existence from 1SS.6; it was taken over in is Sir by Lawson under an agreement with Holroyd Smith—the first Hooley had to do with Construction shares was about October or November, 1900—Lawson, Hooley, and Paine were the only three men I knew to be interested in the balance of the Electric Construction Company's shares, 35,000—I believe I was present on November 22nd, and apparently the idea was that, after allowing for the seven signatories' shares and the 53,000 shares which had gone to Holroyd Smith that there was left a balance of 194,493, and the balance which made up the total of the 230,000 shares it was proposed to issue to Lawson for the purchase of patents, and the rights of the Motor Wheel—it was brought before the company, and approved, that Lawson was to get the right to deal with the 194,1-93 shares—at that time the Street Company's shares were about to be issued—that company, it was always understood, should be a great success—if so. It would mean the acquisition of a con<lb/>siderable profit to the Construction Company—I saw Hooley for the first time to my knowledge at Bow Street Police Court in these proceedings—I do not know that he was concerned in the management of the affairs of the Construction Company—I heard that suggestion made to me at Scot<lb/>land Yard—I was asked whether I knew, or had seen Hooley, or whether lie had anything to do with the business, so I replied, "No," and that only on one occasion when Hooley and Lawson were going somewhere together Hooley called at the office for him—Hooley had nothing to do with the Street-Company—I know nothing about the Trust, Company—the loan from Mrs. Hooley of £3,000 to the Construction Company was the most reasonable loan that we obtained during the course of our business—a bonus was to be paid in the £2,000 preference shares of the Blackpool South—there was nothing in a loan of £'5,000 at 3 per cent., nor in agree<lb/>ing to give for the use of that money £2.000 in shares out of the shares which the Construction Company was going to get as its profit for carry<lb/>ing out the Blackpool South—I saw nothing reprehensible or objectionable in that transaction—that bonus of £2.100 is the £'2,000 of Blackpool 5 1/2. per cent, preference, and the £100 given for accepting the post-dated cheques for £2,000 and the interest £38). 9s. 9d., the cash paid was £2,138 leaving a balance of £3,000. which represented the liability to Mrs. Hooley</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190411140249"/>
               <p>as evidenced by the post dated cheques of October 16th and Novem<lb/>ber 16th—the £250, I presume, was Mr. Oliver's bonus—the company did not pay cash when it could pay in shares—according to the balance sheet produced the tens of Cardinal Kebob, Oliver, and Mrs. Hooley were very dues—I presume they were about the best terms obtainable—the Founders' Syndicate borrowed £5,000, the bonus payable in shares and cash, and the promotion of the Blackpool was £10,000—Mrs. Hooley was lending upon substantially the same terms on which everybody else outside and unconnected with the Construction Company was lending money to that company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Lawson.</hi> The promotion of this Construction Com<lb/>pany was abandoned—it has never been carried out to this date—the knowledge that the directors obtained from you was very useful to the business that was being discussed daily—several of the directors fre<lb/>quently met at the office to discuss the business of the Company—I was on an average with the Company at their offices three times a week, and matters were often discussed with the secretary, Mr. Osborne, who was a very able man, and I always endeavoured to do as much as I thought right in the interests of the company—my father's business was in the boot trade: I managed it for him, and I also had some interest in a Trac<lb/>tion business—I have met a good many kinds of directors in the course of my business, and I should think that I knew as much about my business as they did theirs—Mr. Paine's shares were not bought, because he never paid for them, and I had not anticipated that he would ever pay a farthing for his shares—as far as I know he was friendly with everybody—I had hoped all along that the Company would get hold of something very good to float, and I always thought that was the Company's intention—in 1901 and after the dinner in 1902 the Company fell into your hands, and therefore became a private company absolutely—there were a dozen shareholders, but, as far as I know, not one of them paid a single sovereign in the Company—I remember a minute somewhere about October 8th, 1901, at a meeting at which I was present, when it was resolved "That 1.450 ordinary shares of £1 each, numbered 55,508 to 59,957, be and they are hereby allotted to Mr. H. J. Lawson, for which he has paid the Com<lb/>pany the sum of £4,450"—I should think that a vote given by you would result in whichever way you wished it to—I understood Paine was interested in the future flotation of the Company—he came to tin? office several times to see how things were going on, thinking he was going to make a lot of money like the rest of us, who I think will do so even yet—I think I first knew Paine about the end of December, 1900—the general idea I thought then was that we were going to float the Com<lb/>pany as a public Company, and it was common talk in the office that Hooley had floated other companies very successfully in which you had an interest—as far as I knew, you had never asked anything unreasonable or exorbitant in connection with the Company—we always thought that it paid the Company when we lent you any sum like £3,000, for when at the end of 1960 you first took up the Company, to the best of my belief it never had a shilling piece, but to-day it has several large schemes-and projects which have cost the Company over £20,000 in out of pockets,</p>

               <p>and when I resigned in October or November, 1902, the assets were in a very rosy state—I should think roughly the greater amount the company advanced you was £5,000, but I do nor remember signing any cheque for that amount—I believe the work you did in connection with the Blackpool company involved a considerable amount of cash, and to my knowledge you had to £m about, and meet several shareholders to make. deals with them for cash, and that would amount in tens of thousands—I should think if the Wakefield, Nottingham, or the Blackburn project were going to be done properly, they would amount to over £5,000—as to the law expenses if has been publicly stated by Sir Douglas Fox in the House of Looks that £20,000 was a considerable sum for the costs of a great railway bill—the Leeds and Wakefield, to the best of my belief, has been a very satisfactory business to the Company—Lot Craven first of all, I believe, nor security for his £30,000 by taking over the Leeds and Wakefield Order—you introduced 30,000 sovereigns into the Com<lb/>pany—if Lot Craven's deal ends in his ettinir £10,000 cash and shares in the Leeds and Wakefield Tramway the Company would make £20,000 profit, out of which we should have to pay Houldsworth his commission, and the Company could still afford to Pay you whatever the directors thought was a fair and reasonable sum—that was an excellent deal of the Company I think, and I would do it every day if I could—I should not have remained a director for two wars if my opinion had been that the Company was a sham—I see no fraud anywhere—out of the 60,000 shares issued, 55,000 were in Holroyd Smith's agreement—4,450 you paid cash for and the qualifications would make 7.0 more—practi<lb/>cally the lot belonged to you, because there was some agreement as to Holroyd Smith's shares—I believe that 15,000 out of the 55,000 shares Were in the name of Holroyd Smith—afterwards you were them up—Smith's option was never acted on, and I believe practically the whole of the shares belonged to you, and you had a perfect right to control the Company, I thought, and think so now—you were working <hi rend="italic">very</hi> hard to get subscriptions for the Leeds and Wakefield Order, to get it taken up—each preference share is a £1,000 share—I believe it is perfectly legal to have a "One Man Company"—if I wanted to register a "Thomas Limited "1 should try to do it in the cheapest possible way as you did—in the case of <hi rend="italic">Eye r. Solomon</hi>, the man had his wife and daughter for directors, and vet the House of Lords supported it—I know as a director that a profit was made in the Leeds and Wakefield to the Com<lb/>pany between the purchase price and what Lot Craven eventually settled for—we should not have taken the Order unless we got a profit on it—I believe you are still interested—I attended scores of the City and North East Suburban Railway meetings which went though the east of London to Walthamstow. Bethnal Green. Hackney Downs, and many other stations—I thought it was likely to be one of the finest railway schemes that was ever thought of in connection with London, it would have taken the poor people out of these crowded neighborhoods into the country, and landed thorn near me—probably it would have taken them into cheap dwellings where they would have to pay less rent, and the Company would probably have made a very lame profit £300,000 or in per cent, on</p>

               <p>the undertaking—I heard that Morgans agreed to finance it, or back it to the extent of £2,000,000—a success of that magnitude would justify everything you have done the last two or three years—I am not ashamed of anything we, as directors, have done—I only regret Paine's allegations is to the price of his shares—Paine brought or threatened an action against the Street Company—writs were served—I expect he had a cheque or something to settle it—he put articles in newspapers, and issued letters in every shareholder asking 2s. a share—in one or two papers I think I saw somethinglof it—I think he got about £937 to leave us alone, or 7s. Gd. each for 2,500 shares we had given him—on the pooling agree<lb/>ment lie signed for.",000 shares, 3,000 of which he had exchanged with Hooley for something else, as we know from his letter, and his transfer, which was of no consideration—somebody interfered with Holroyd Smith, an a created an unpleasantness between him and the Company—he had £200 in cash and 3,000 shares to settle it—this £200 cheque to A.J. Paine has your signature and Paine's endorsement—as a director of Com<lb/>panies I know that hundreds of dividends are paid between annual mee<lb/>tings on the estimate of directors only, and the shareholders read of it for the first time in their morning papers—the balance sheet is made on the directors' ideas of things—the Articles of Association gave us power to do every thing that we used to do—we could pay 12 per cent. Or any<lb/>thing we liked, and were in a position to pay—the balance sheet was pre<lb/>pared some time after the dinner. I think—we felt we could afford £6,000 in dividend—I heard the speech at the dinner—you had other work—Paine was invited—I have not heard of any person who has written to the office and complained of Sir Kenneth's statements—I saw—the "' proof "not the "manuscript "before the bulk of the circulars were printed—Hunter and myself revised it—Hunter was one of the committee—the circular was practically the same as a grocer's handbills, I had no idea it was going to be used for asking people to subscribe for debentures or shares—this is correct: "It was printed with the sole object of being put before the local authorities or engineers, who did not know what we were doing, or had been doing"—that circular shows that Mr. Ward, of Ward, Bowie and Company, was present at the meeting—the idea put in it was not a bogus one—in it the debentures appear as at the nominal value of £250,000—circulars were sent as a matter of courtesy to sub<lb/>scribers to correct their speeches—when we were not in a position to pay the dividend, and there was probable litigation the documents were locked "p—six out of a dozen shareholders were present at the meeting—I never knew Henry Times to attend a meeting after that date, his resignation appears in the minute dated September 8th.1399—Hunter was then a director, and Rawlings was a director of the Blackpool—I believe we had some shares in this Company—Mr. Edge was a shareholder—Chad well was our engineer, but not a genuine shareholder, as he never paid any money for the shares, you bought them for £400—everything that-you have done for the Company has proved advantageous to it. I know of nothing that he did to involve the Company in a big loss—the Company tad nothing, "in a way, at the start—I know nothing of the work they are doing now—I recognise the Blackburn. Whalley, and Burnley, as being</p>

               <p>one of the old contracts about the time I left the Company—I never went down to any meetings of the Light Railway Commissioners, Lytham I recognise those schemes as being those they had in the Office at the time I was there, they have cost us tens of thousands of pounds—Tramway Orders, and Railway Bills are always a great speculation—I should not think, we would take up another under £200,000—the Orders costing £5,000 or £10,000 would show a large profit to the Construction Company—we worked upon the same measure at Blackpool.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Watson Rutherford. &amp; Co., solicitors, Liverpool—I first met Lawson in the spring of 1901—he was introduced to me as a gentleman who was purchasing shares from shareholders in—the Blackpool (St. Ann's and Lytham) Tramways Com<lb/>pany—I had no knowledge whatever of the Electric Traction and Main<lb/>tenance Company—he informed me that he had purchased or agreed to purchase a considerable number of shares in the Blackpool (St. Ann's and Lytham) Tramways Company, Limited, and had acquired a controlling in toast in liar Company, that there was a scheme to convert if into elec<lb/>tric traction, and that an Act of Parliament had been obtained for the purpose—at that time this particular tramway was being run with gas engine tramcars—he said he was forming a new company, or had formed a new company for the purpose of acquiring the whole of the shares and other interest of the old company, and to canny the scheme out—the Blackpool Electric Tramways (South) was the name of this new Company—I negotiated with a view to finding capital for the Company, and it was then that I became aware of the agreement between it and the Construc<lb/>tion Company of June 26th.1001—I knew the name, but I did not know any details about the Construction Company—that agreement recites an agreement of March 10th, by which the Construction Company had acquired the right to purchase majority of the shares of the Blackpool (St. Ann's and Lytham) Company, and it also recites that the Construction</p>

Limited. In accordance with the Companies "Acts, 1900, we certify that all our requirements as auditors have been complied with, and we report to the shareholders that we have verified the cash balances and seen the certificates for the securities held by the Company. In the case of the Blackpool Electric Tramways South, Limited, the value of its shares depends upon the acquisition by the Com<lb/>pany of the remaining shares and debentures of the Blackpool. St. Annes, and Lytham Company, Limited, and upon the conversion of the line into electric traction, and we have no means of ascertaining whether the esti<lb/>mated liability shown in the balance sheet for the construction and equip<lb/>ment of the line and for acquiring the remaining shares and debentures will prove sufficient for the purpose. With regard to these assets appear<lb/>ing in the balance sheet, they consist principally of securities which are we believe, at present, unmarketable. We are unable to state their present or actual value, and they have therefore been taken at face value. We cannot certify the balance standing to the credit of the profit and loss account as realised profit, or that the same is at present available for dis<lb/>tribution among the shareholders as dividend. We wish also to draw attention to the side services to the amount of £64,170 5s., which repre<lb/>sents sums paid to Mr. H.J. Lawson by virtue of an agreement between himself and the Company dated November lath, 1901. This agreement has been produced to us and no particulars are disclosed as to the services rendered, or as the mode in which such remuneration is arrived at. Sub<lb/>ject to the foregoing observations we are of opinion that the balance sheet is properly drawn up, so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the Com<lb/>pany's affairs, as shown by the books of the Company on September 29th 1901"—it was altered considerably, but that is correct, except there may lie some verbal alterations—<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 112 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the agreement referred to in my report—I saw it at the Police Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RUFUS ISAACS</hi>. I have had the opportunity of' examining all these various hooks and an: familiar with them—the balance sheet of the Construction Company's hooks (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 139) is a correct account-of the affairs of the Company as disclosed in their books and correctly discloses the transactions which were-taking place by the Company—tackier that balance sheet up to September 29th 1901 the position of the Construct Ton Company I shown and the profit and loss account is to show, treating the shares as cash, a profit of £63,823—I have checked on the balance sheet the assets of the Company a disclosed in the books—as liabilities there appear a certain number of loans referred cill to, which appear in the hook of the Company and in the balance sheet as liabilities both for the repayment of the money and for <hi rend="italic">laic</hi> bonuses con<lb/>raeted to be paid for the loans—there is one which tirades in the balance sheet under the name of Loosley—that is a loan upon pretty well; as low terms as the Company ever jot—it is almost the same as the terms on which people like Cardinal and Crow were lending money to the Com<lb/>pany—there seems to have been numerous transactions with them—I do not know that they were independent or not—I have got here various transactions apart from the loan—I am not prepared to say Cardinal and Kebow were not independent persons contracting with the company—the loans made by Cardinal and Kebow and the bonuses to do paid by them are about the same as Mrs. looley was—retain for her loans.—there is Mr. Oliver who also lent a sum of money on terms of roiling a bonus—Mrs. Hcoley's loan of to,000 was on. July 17th.1!) I upon the terms that the Company was to repay by August;51st, with interest at the rate of 5 per<lb/>cent, and a bonus of 2,001) Five and a half preference shares—and the payments made with reference to that are correctly recorded in the books—that loan appears to lee a mere ordinary loan which might be made by any other people to the Company—there is no suppression of facts or of any details of information with regard to it—there were certain bill transactions, full particulars of which do not appear in the books. I cannot say that with rearward to all, but generally speaking the transac<lb/>tions are fully disclosed in the books—it is manifest on the face of the balance sheet that these various shares are taken into account in the assets for the purpose of putting them in the balance sheet at their face value—it is apparent to anyone who sees that balance sheet that the shares which are taken in as assets are included at their nominal par value—these entries of £"!),900 for the Streets Tramways and Founder' 'Syndicate shares which are taken in as assets, and the Blackpool Electric £8,050 are really only nominal value—this appears to qualify that: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Sundry shares and debentures of unascertainable value in Com<lb/>panies formed by this Company at face value"—that would be the proper way in which to deal with that statement—it would not do to take them without it because you might lead people to believe it is the market or the intrinsic value—the only way is either to take the shares at market value or you may take them at cost price: if you state it at cost price or you take them at face value you state you take them at face value—any one of the three would be right always presupposing you state the way in which you are doing it—the profit in the profit and loss account is calculated upon</p>

               <p>the basis of taking shares as stated at face value, eliminating the shares me dealing only with the cash and by that means arriving at what has been shown due to the cash loss of £32,676—there is a cash loss brought down of £"52,676 based upon the bringing in as a cash debit, £116,613 in time item—in the profit and loss account on the debit-side, the last item but one. there is: "Estimated cost of acquiring remaining shares and debentures and equipment of line in accordance with agreement.": that is carried in as a cash item—the whole of my calculation with regard to the cash by which I arrive at this adverse balance of £32,676 (is partly depending upon an item of £110,033 being properly debited in that cash account.—if you eliminate that debit of £116,633 you could not show a loss of £"i!),676—but if this £116,633 was on the face of it a share liability of the Company which it could discharge in shares then it would not be right to take it as a cash liability of £116,633—I cannot very well leave out "on the face of it"—dealing with it on the face there is nothing to show that there is a liability either in cash or shares—I do not find anything limiting it to shares: I treat it as merely a cash liability—it would be a liability for acquiring certain shares that had been in the Blackpool, St. Anne's and Litany Tramways Company and equipment of the line—the gross value is £166,633 of which £30,000 consists of shares but in preparing the profit and loss account the accountant debited £30,000 because it did not give credit on the other side and that 50,000 shares had been forfeited because—they do not appear on one side or. the other—I can show you that it is a share liability—that amount which is stated cash and loans and receipts under liabilities is for the estimated cost of acquiring some debentures and shares in the Blackpool, St. Anne's and Lythany Tramway Company and equipment of the tramways in accordance with the Blackpool (South) prospectus—the prospectus of September 29th, 1901, shows a large portion of that £116,000 liability was discharged by the payment of shares treating it as cash—in the course of acquiring the debentures and shares in the Blackpool, St. Aime's and Lytham contract or what they did in a number of cases was to give shares instead of cash and confirmed it afterwards—their contract was to pay cash—but as was shown in a number of transactions up to September 29th what they had to do was to complete contracts by which they were paying shares instead of cash—that was continued from September 29th, 1901 "lid taking into account that method of arriving at the liability and if you were to take the liability as a liability to the extent of £116,633 or a great part of it, in shares the result of it would be that you would make your balance sheet or your analysis of the cash so much better for the Company regards the particular item—there is £-50,334 shares and £16,144 cash acquisition, so if you apply the same proportion of shares to cash to 'be £116,000 it would make a very material difference to a cash balance.</p>

The Board having perused this agreement, con<lb/>firmed the same"'—it was not carried through, but the contract was signed—the £1,000 was paid, but the purchase-money was not paid by that date—I say the Street Company's agreement of October 16th, 1900, for the purchase of the Street Car Company is the only business done—part of the consideration was shares in a company to be formed in the Streets Company; therefore it formed part of the transaction between the Construction Company and the Streets Company, to which I have already referred; that is what I meant by no business being done until that date—if the contract was not carried out I cannot see how any profit could be derived from it—the Streets Company might have issued 2,000 shares, and regarding the application for shares by the public in the Streets Company there might have been a large paper profit—the next minute is a copy of the agreement between the Company and Mr. Thomas Parker—I understand he was the principal proprietor of the Street Car Manufacturing Company at Wolverhampton—I do not know that lie is the electrical engineer of the Metropolitan Railway—there is a resolution appointing him to a seat on the Board of the Company, and then there is his remuneration—on November 1st, 1900, you contracted to dispose of 25,000 shares to the Construction Company, everything; you had from Mr. Holroyd Smith; I mean to say you made the contract on November 1st to sell the Holroyd Smith's patents to the Construction—at that time you either owned the patents or you had the right to shares and cash from the Streets Company—you could not have the patents and the consideration for the Streets Company as well—on Novem<lb/>ber 26th you had the patents of Holroyd Smith in France and England, subject to a contract of sale of November 1st, by which you were to receive £200,000 in cash or shares, of which the amount in cash had not been determined—on November 1st you had made a contract to sell to the Street Company with other assets for £200,000 in cash or shares—on November 26th, when you entered into that contract with Mrs. Hooley, you had assets or rights, the same thing as assets, perhaps—there was the contract for the purchase of the Wolverhampton business, and you had paid away thousands for it—in your account No.2 the balance brought down is £23,970 5s; of that, £11,500 is shares, separating rhe £1,000 from the £12,500 on the other side, and the total cash you lit from the Company for expenses and out of pocket and everything else on September 29th"190i, is £20,685—on page 117 there is: "Lawson, services account, shares, £15,500, cash £48,670 5s"—it does not mean you received it; it means, according to the accounts, that amount had been received or was due to you; that is, lost to the Company—it means partly paid and partly due—on 15th August the auditor gave you credit,</p>

               <p>I think, for £59,000, and that credit had to be debited to profit and loss; I said myself it should be paid to you: that is with the £"5,000 paid to you in December: if you had that credit of £59,000 added to the £5,000 which you received fur services rendered. you find the two amounts. agree with the two amounts in this profit and loss account, which is £63,000—the actual loss paid to you up to September 11th for out if pocket, cans payments for orders, and everything else is £20,685i—I do not put "Cash received by Lawson "£48. 70: it is "received and to be received"—I am preparing an account as to a ivied date, namely, September 29th, 1901, and I have to take into consideration the state of affairs at that time, not what happened subsequently; if you ask me to prepare an account based upon what happened subsequently I shall only extinguish the cash balance. To H.J. Lawson, services account, 15,500 shares" means the Company had paid to Lawsuit dernier the period covered by the profit and loss account £15,500 in shares—they debit Lawson either in cash or shares with that £15,500—they debit him with the actual amount he has received, which is Lawson, the £48,670 5s. by the amount which is owner to Lawson at this date—I have put "due in cash" £48,670: there is nothing to show me that he is bound to receive shares, and therefore I treated it as a cash liability—that £48,570 meant that the Company have paid or owe Lawson that amount in cash—I have seen the rest of Lawson's accounts made up of shares and bill and cash—one or two of them were paid, but most of them were cancelled, and that is why I have excluded them from the accounts; that is why I have not put all these items in this account; I thought it would be introducing unnecessary detail—if they accept a bill drawn by Lawson for £1,000 he would be debited with £1,000; subsequently that bill would be cancelled; that works out at £1,000, and I should leave both these items out of the account—they were the Company's acceptances—the first in the account is May If—itlt.

               <p>was owing to certain disputes going on between Mr. Rutherford and the Cunipanv—I believe Rutherford wanted to get the business into his own hands and the Company wanted to keep it and carry the work on for themselves—if the Construction Company had carried out their contracts 1 think the Company would have been a great success—it was part of their original intention to carry the tramway from Lytham to Preston—they applied for that extension at two separate Sessions—I acted as engineer for the Parliamentary work for the Construction Company—I believe it was also part of the Company's original scheme to obtain run<lb/>ning powers all over the Corporation tramways of Blackpool; as a matter of fact the Blackpool South are applying now to the Corporation, for such powers—I believe they have a Bulodged in Parliament to attain that object—the Lytham and Preston line was tlirown out owing to the opposi<lb/>tion of the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and London and North-Western Railway Companies—I do not know what was in the minds of the Con<lb/>struction Company but having been beaten twice it is obvious they would want to get their money back—you gave evidence before the Light Rail way Commissioners in Preston Town Hall—I remember you putting in the pass book—I do not know about producing the money for carrying out the work—at the first application the London and North-Western Hailway raised a questi'on as to the financial position of the promoters-to carry out the scheme, and it was tlirown out owing to the fact that the London and North-Western Railway said that there had been so much money paid for raising the debentures that they did not think it was fair that the promotion should go on; with the result that the scheme was thrown out on the question of finance—at the next application the Com<lb/>pany were satisfied that the finance was all right—the obviously. proper. course then was for us to immediately apply to Parliament—that is the usual course of tramway work—if we lose it before the Light Railway Commissioners we go to Parliament—of course this was rather an excep<lb/>tional case—the Lytham and Preston line was a competing line with the joint lines of the London and North-Western Railway and—the Lancashire and orkshire—so by your being weak in tlie finance on the first occasion it gave the Commissioners a right to objecting to the line because there is a clause in the Act which prevents the Light Railway Commissioners granting a line where there is the slightest element of competition—that can be got over by applying to Parliament—the second application was in November, 1902—there was a hearing at Preston last June but by different promoters—it was Preston to Blackburn and Preston to Lytham—there "were two applications—I acted as engineer to both—'the question was that the money was not put up locally—there was sufficient money found, but it was given in evidence that you had-some connection with it—as a matter of fact you had not—for that it was tlirown out—if the original intentions had been carried out in the prospectus I think the Construction Company would have had a grand scheme in the Black-pool Company, and I think the Blackpool Company would have been la veiy great success—I think the Blackpool Company will be a success if they £it the running powers over tlie town of Blackpool—I take.

               <p>contract to construct the line, which would have been completed had not Mr. Nevins died and these disputes arisen—judging from the evidence you gave to the Light Railway Connnissioners I think the Construction Company was in a position to cany out these contracts—I took over the contracts at practically the same price as Mr. Nevins, which was £70,000 in cash and £30,000 in shares—I took these over owing to pressure by Mr. Rutherford of Liverpool, who came to me and asked whether I would take tin's contract—he had had twelve or eighteen months' dispute with Liwson and he had been nominated Lord Mayor of Liverpool and he dare not take this contract unless these disputes were settled—when I took the contract from him he said: "There is so much cash and so many shares and if it does not see you through I will sec you through."—I take it the Construction Company was in a position to earn out its contract with my assistance—I would have taken the job from the Company pro<lb/>vided they had made the same arrangement as Mr. Rutherford and carried it out—Mr. Rutherford called on me about the beginning of September, 1902—he asked me if I would take the contract over—I have taken it over and have carried it out and the line is loaded and running now—I have been retained by the Construction Company on a number of other tramway works besides Blackpool including Exeter—I did the sur<lb/>veying there and at Accrington and Burnley—I should say that £20,000 would be well within the mark for the probable cost to you or the Con<lb/>struction Company of all that work, the promoting expenses and the Parliamentary payments—I know that the Construction Company had on hand a large number of such projects—it is obvious witli the liabilities <hi rend="italic">ard</hi> resposibilities that they take that there should be a large margin of profit upon the outlay to the promoters and it is common knowledge in general that large profits are made on such undertakings—the risk taken is very great—it depends upon who the promoters are and how the case is worked up whether the applications go through: but even with the best promoters and the best Parliamentary agents only a percentage go through—it is difficult to get people to put their money up—I do not know of my own knowledge that if people put up £1,000 they expect to et £2,000 back for it in the event of success—the Construction Com<lb/>pany is at present engaged upon a large tramway undertaking in the North of England—if they get their proposed extensions it will involve a capital of something considerably over a million of money—it would take years of hard work for you at each Session to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a little bit more and a little bit more of the extensions—the undertaking will give the Construc<lb/>tion Company a very large profit if properly handled—it is entirely a speculation.</p>

               <p>syndicate or company would be used lor that purpose—there are many small syndicates with about £30,000 capital—I had nothing to do with the Nottingham and Derby—the usual course is if you have a concession in West Africa to employ first of all by means of a syndicate an en<lb/>gineer, or someone who would go and prospect the country, or prospect what<lb/>ever there was, and you would get the report back, and if you found there was a lot of copper you would form a Copper Company, and the syndi<lb/>cate, which would be called the parent syndicate, would get the advan<lb/>tage of the profit made in selling the copper part of it; another company might be for coal, and they would sell that again and make a profit out of the coal deal—if it is a £30,000 syndicate the man might bring it to my office and we find people to put up £5,000 or £10,000 to begin with; there is nothing remarkable in that—it is remarkable, but it is the usual thing to give people £2,000 who had put up £1,000—I have known them to have a great deal more and a great deal less; it depends on the circumstances; a concession or a promotion of a Bill are both speculations—I have never put my money on it yet—I do not think I should if I was offered 3 to 1—so far as the finance is concerned, very often it is immaterial who the directors are, but if you aregoing to put forward the company that is promoting the Bill; when I was on the Council we used to scrupulously look into who the parties were, and their funds, and everything connected with them; bat if you are speaking of finance, if the money is found, it does not matter twopence who the promoters are unless you are going to use the company for the purpose of promoting the Bill, and then it is quite a different affair.</p>

That invention afterwards filled Coventry with works, buildings and houses for workmen to such an extent that the casual ward of the workhouse had to be hired for workmen to sleep in—in 1896 there was no room for works or for workmen—all that sprang from the development of the safety bicycle of which you were the origi<lb/>nator in 1879—you started the motor industry, or patent, with the same company on September 27th 1880—that was the first application of an engine applied to cycles or motors—your invention in motors was the first petrol driven motor for traction purposes in this country'—at that time there were syndicates to bring out the company—I do not know anything about the percentage—I went down with a number of gentlemen and members of Parliament to take part in the opening of the first motor works in Coventry"; the works are going on now—the company which you formed has continued to the present time—thousands of British workmen are employed upon the industry which was started by companies and syndicates—I am the author of this pamphlet (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and every statement in it is proved in black and white, references to patents and other data, to be true—the first Stanley Show was held in March at the Athenaeum, Camden Town, in 1872—in this photo<lb/>graph there is the first modern lady's bicycle patented in 1884—the drawing of that shows in the patent the impossibility of bicycles of that period as compared with the present time—the bicycle of 1876 was also adapted for ladies—there were some so-called ladies' bicycles, but they were impracticable—the Aeriel-Vincent could be ridden in ordinary clothes by lady riders, but it was both dangerous, and a great deal too high for a practical bicycle at all—you took part in the Lord Mayor's Show in 1896; this is a photo<lb/>graph of it; it is taken outside the Old Bailey—you were the instigator of the first great demonstration to Brighton on November 14th, 1896, which celebrated the freeing of the motor-car—you ran a Bill in Parlia<lb/>ment in conjunction with other gentlemen to free the motor-car from the Locomotives Act; that came into operation on November 14th. 1896.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by the</hi> Solicitor General. I have now gone through, these receipts with a view to ascertaining how they stand as regards the Electric Construction Company—the first is dated September 29th, 1901: "Received from the Construction Company £1,000 on account of printing, &amp;c, in connection with the Blackpool Tramway prospectus, £1,000," from Robinson's—I do not find in the books a direct payment from the Construction Company to the Robinson Printing Company, but on September 24th, 1901, there is a cheque of Lawson's of £1,000, and on September 29th the cheque is charged"to liawson's account—on this day he receives credit for £1,331 and Robin<lb/>son's Printing Company is debited with this sum in respect of cheques paid—I have credited Lawson with that amount in my summary—it seems to be a receipt in respect of the same payment that is already in the account—the next receipt is January 23rd, 1902:"Received from Lawson, Esq., the sum of £200, being payment on account of fees in the matter of the Llanelly Trams, &amp;c—Bramwell &amp; Harris"—I find that was paid to the Company, and charged to the proper account in the ledger—the next is February 6th, 1902: "Received from the Electric</p>

               <p>Construction Company the sum of one hundred guineas, being a payment on account in respect of our foe of 1,000 guineas in the matter of the Nottingham and Derby Light Railway Companies and the Company"—the next is dated Aug.8th, 1902: "£1,000 received from the Electric Con<lb/>struction Company by Robinson on account of printing City and Surrey Prospectus"—I find that was paid by Lawson, according to his bank pass book, but I do not find that there was any obligation on the part of the Construction Company to pay anything in connection with the flotation of the City and Surrey Railway—my impression is that the National Electric Traction Company was to pay the expenses of the City and Surrey Railway—I find that Lawson received four cheques of £5,000 each from the Tramway Trust, which on the same day had been paid to the Trust by the National Electric Traction Company—that appears by the National Electric Traction Company's cash book, which is the only book I have—the next one is dated Sept-ember 18th, 1902: "Received from H.J. Lawson the sum of £31, being cost of preparing plans for the proposed North Lancashire Tramways, including the cost of lithography, also including the services rendered in connection 'ith the tramway extension to the Borough of Qssett"—I find that was paid by Lawson, but I do not find that the Construction Company had anything to do with the"North Lancashire scheme—there is no account in their books of the North Lancashiretrains—the next is dated October 12th: "The sum of £25 for services rendered in connection with the negotiations for the reduction of the charges of the professional men for their work on the Wakefield and District and the Mansfield and District Light Railway Orders"—I found that that was from Lawson—I do not find any trace of it in the books of the Construction Company—I find an account, but not this amount in the account—this document (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is apparently a bill of costs. Harrison. Beaumont &amp; Smith, and at the end of it is. "November (5th, 1902.

Beaumont &amp; Smith,"' and underneath, "Approved for the Electric Traction Co., H.J. Lawson"—I have not been able to trace these two cheques for £250—I have looked at Lawson's pass book for that date—I do not find any cheques that would appear to show that he had made the payment—there is a receipt of February 9th for £50 to William Webb &amp; Co., akefield and District Tramway."Received of the Electric Tramways Trust, Limited, the sum of £50, on account of out of pocket disburse<lb/>ments, payable under agreement of December 17, 1902"—I have no means of tracing the payment at all, because the Construction Company's books end at December, 1902, and I have not Lawson's pass book for that date.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Detectice-Sergeant</hi>). In consequence of infor<lb/>mation, I went to the George on Saturday, October 29th, about 9 p.m.—in the public bar I saw the male prisoner and the female prisoner behind the bar, serving—I stood behind the male prisoner who was standing between the hot water urn and a pillar—he put H-d. on the counter, and said to the female prisoner, "Mild and Burton, Miss, please"—in a few seconds she served him—she took the Hd. to the till, put her hand in the bowl, came back to the male prisoner and said, "your change, Sir"—he opened his hand—I looked over his shoulder—I saw 6d. In silver and—1d. In bronze—a few minutes later I asked for a drink, and could not get one—I said to Bailey in the hearing of the prisoner, "We will go somewhere else"—the male prisoner said, "Blind me. I have been waiting a long time, and cannot get served myself"—a few minutes later the manager walked very slowly to the other end of the bar, and returned—the male prisoner looked at him and while he was away, said to the female prisoner, "It is all right, he is down at the</p>

               <p>bottom now"—she served other customers, then went to the till, took out a handful of something, came to the male prisoner, and said, "Your change, Sir"—he opened his hand, and as he received it I caught it—he said, "You cannot have my change"—I said, "Yes, and you too: we are police, and shall take you to the police station"—two other <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> rushed out of the bar—the prisoner became violent, but we eventually got him out into the lobby—just outside the station he said, "It is no use, I can see you have got me properly, I am very sorry"—He was conveyed to the police station—on being searched, sixpence and threepence was found in his right hand trousers pocket; in his left hand pocket is. 9d., all in bronze—I made an examination of his trousers, and I find that there is a cut in them so that you can inssrt your hand into the pocket and drop anything down the trouser leg—he was detained at the station, and I went back to the house and told the female prisoner about her father, and that I was going to arrest her—she said, "It is quite right, I gave the money to my father, he has been out of work for months; our family is starving, or I should not have done, it"—I accompanied her to get her dress; she threw her arms round my neck and said, "I am sorry, do not lock me up"—when charged, she made no reply—later I made an examination of the chests of drawers of each of the barmaids, and turned out some wearing apparel—one skirt in the prisoner's drawer had a slit in front, under where the apron comes, so that she could put her hand, under the pretence of getting a handkerchief, into the pocket of this pouch <hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) where anything could be dropped in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first got to the public house at 9-15 p.m.—they were very busy there—a good many people were standing at the bar—they could not all see what the male prisoner was doing—he was between a pillar and the urn on the counter—he did no!; put sixpence on the counter—the second time he called for a mild and Burton and did not put anything down—he did not put down a shilling the third time—he did not call for cigarettes—he did not put down a shilling for Woodbines—an old gentleman next to the prisoner did not call for three halves of whisk)' hot, and put. bwn a two shilling piece—the male prisoner dii not say, "No, that won't do"—the other people in the bar appeared to be looking after themselves—no money was put on <hi rend="italic">the</hi> counter, except one three half-pence, from beginning to end—some few coppers fell on the ground, and I had some <hi rend="italic">red hot</hi> in his hand—he did not say, 'I have not passed bad money,"nor, "It is all right, and you need'not look at it'—the female prisoner only said, "That is your change, Sir"—the following morning I asked her if she wanted to send to her friends, or wished me to make enquiries—I did not tell her that it would be better to make a clean breast of it, and that that was the best thing for her to do—she did not say, "I won't do any<lb/>thing of the kind; I have nothing to be ashamed of"—an officer would not be allowed to advise a prisoner.</p>

               <p>house with Scrimshaw—I saw the female prisoner behind the bar—I stood in the public bar close to the male prisoner—I was in plain clothes—he wts leaning on the counter almost opposite the hot water apparatus—he called for beer, was served by Clara and put Hd. down in payment—Clara went away a second, came back, said, "Your change, Sir,"and dropped sixpence and some bronze into the male prisoner's hand—he put it into his right hip pocket—Buckingham walked to the other end of the bar, and when Clara came up to the male prisoner, he said, "He Is at the other end of the bar"—Clara went away a few seconds, then came back and said, "Your change, Sir,"and dropped something in Ralph's hand—he had not called for a drink that time—Scrimshaw seized Ralph's hand, while I seized the other arm: we struggled—Ralph sad, "You cannot have my change,"—I said, "We will have your change and you as well"—some coppers fell on to the floor—we got him out of the house after a struggle and took him to the station—on the way he said, "It is no good, you have got me fair."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made no note—Ralph did not call for cigarettes—I called for a cigar—nobody called for cigarettes—I do not remember anybody putting down two shillings on the bar for whiskies—Ralph did not say when we took him out of the house, "The shilling was a good shilling"—he did not complain on the road to the station that he was wrongly arrested for passing bad money—he did not say to his daughter, "It is all right, you need not look at it, it is good, though it is thin"—I did not hear that the house was very full—I saw him pass no more money than the lid.—I was eight or ten inches from the hot water apparatus, and he was standing between the column and the urn—Scrimshaw was on his right—I was between the two—other people were round—some of them I knew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Dannatt, and live at 75, Vanbrug Park, Blackheath—on October 17th I was in Church Passage, Greenwich, between 11.45 and 12 a.m., collecting for the Provident Club, which I always do on a Monday—I was carrying. this small handbag, which contained 8s. 8d., as I have it now on my left arm—I went to No.1, Church Passage, to collect—I had called and received nothing for the club, and was crossing over when I saw a man who was drunk, and crossed the passage to pass him—I was going to Church Street through Roan Street, and was within forty yards of Church Street—I saw a man running towards me from the direction of Church Street—I moved to the right to let him pass—as he came near me he half swerved round me and struck me in the face with his fist—I fell backwards to the ground—I do not remember any more except that I screamed—I must have become insensible, because I do not remember the action of falling—I got a good view of Brown, because I moved to let him pas", me—he is the furthest prisoner from me in the dock—after I had recovered from my dazed state, which was momentary., he was still running towards the Recreation Gates, and away from me—I could not get up, I got up a little way, and then some people came, from the cottages and helped me up—nothing was missing—I was injured from the blow in my face and from the fall, and the shock, my arms were grazed, and my left arm was cut a little—when I got to a cottage there were finger-marks on my arm.</p>
