                  </hi>. I am a miner, and have been living at Oldham, Lancashire—on 15th July I was passing through Finchley on the highway coming to London—from 10.30 to 10.40 in the evening I went into the Cricketers beerhouse, North Finchley, where I saw the prisoner and a man whose name I do not know—the prisoner was making a big noise and drinking—nothing passed between him and me—I left near on 11 o'clock, before the prisoner—I was perfectly sober—I had about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my possession—the prisoner followed close after me—I turned towards London, where I was going—when I got out and had come to the highway the prisoner caught hold of my arm—the public-house stands little off the highway—I said to him "You go about your business and I will go about mine, I don't want to have anything to do with you"—he kept following me along, and I said "Go on," and he left me for a bit; and when I got a little distance away as I was passing a road going to the left he tried to pull me down there—there was a ditch down there—he said "You must go down this road"—I said "I know my way is on the high road"—he tried to throw me in the ditch—we had a scuffle—I got away from him and told him to go away—I went on my proper road and never thought of his following me, and when I got about 50 yards on the road I was caught by the neck suddenly and got two or three kicks or knocks and I was knocked down and then I got up again—I told him to leave me alone and go on, and then I got some more severe knocks, and my legs went from under me and I fainted away—I don't knew how I was knocked down—I had got up partially and was kicked in the legs and knocked down again—I could not say how many times I was kicked—the next morning you could see places on my shins and back—I cried "Police" and "Murder"—policeman came to my assistance afterwards—the prisoner had gone</p>

On 15th July last I was haymaking, and about half-past 10 or a quarter to 11 o'clock in the evening I was in the Cricketers at Finchley, where I saw the prisoner and prosecutor—they were very civil in the house—I left at 11 o'clock, turning-out time—the prisoner and prosecutor went out, and I followed close on them all the way—they turned down on the left-hand and a struggle took place between the two—I did not see the prisoner do or say anything, nor the</p>

                  </hi>. I was in business as a contractor in Australia; I had been there 15 years—in returning from Australia in June last I made the acquaintance of Ward; he came over in the same ship—on leaving the ship he gave me his address and told me to call at his hotel in Edinburgh—I went there; I found that he kept a Temperance hotel there—I stopped with him about 10 days—I went up to the North of Scotland, and came back to Edinburgh, and then I was introduced to Richards by Ward—Ward wrote for me to come down, as there was important business for me at Edinburgh, that he was going down to the Manchester Races—I have not the letter here—Richards then bore the name of Richard Stanley—Ward said he was a thorough sporting man, well acquainted with all the racing men in England, Ireland, and Scotland, and France as well, and that he knew all the trainers as well, that he was intimate both with Lord Rosebery in Scotland and Rothschild in England—Ward had got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me on my first visit to Edinburgh, and on the second visit, before I was introduced to Richards, 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those sums were for backing various horses—I never received any money in consideration of these bets afterwards—I did not advance any more money in Edinburgh</p>

               <p>I left Edinburgh about 15th September to go to Manchester Races with Ward and Richards—they said they could do better at the post than stopping at Edinburgh, and they asked me to go with them—we went to Leeds first, and stopped there one night, and then went on to the Manchester Races—when we were on the course at Manchester Ward left me, he said he was going into the betting—ring—he returned shortly and said he must back a horse for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wanted the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me—he told Richards as well, who was along with me in the Grand stand—he said if it was for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would bet for him as well—I did not give him the money then; I had only a patent purse, and I could not get the money out quick enough—Richards said it was all right I could give him the money; passing a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Ward—I did not examine it, I believed it to be one—Richards had a lot of money on him at the time—they were on his own bets; they were passed before mine were—Ward then went away towards the ring—I gave Richards 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and told him I would give him the other 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. said, "All right"—after the race was run Ward said we had lost—when I gave the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Richards I did not know what horses I was supposed to back Ward did not tell me—I made a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bet besides that; I did not advance the money I was to pay him in London; I had money in London—Ward made that bet, that was in the presence of Richards; he said we had lost that—he told me the names of the horses were strictly private; I did not know the names—Ward said he had lost a lot of money on the Manchester Races he did no state what amount—I came to London on 20th September—I stopped at the same hotel with Ward, Williams's Hotel, Bow Lane, Ward I saw Richards and Don there—I Was introduced to Don by Ward—he told me that he was a thorough gentleman, he had known him 20 years, and had had many transactions with him and always found him a straightforward man; he also said he was a great sporting man in England and France, and we knew all the racing men and trainers but he did not associate with the jockeys, they were a low class of people—I saw the prisoners nearly every day between the 22nd and 29th Sep<lb/>tember—on Sunday, 28th September, Ward said there was very important business to attend the following day at 10 o'clock, and according to that arrangement I went to the Inns of Court at 10 o'clock with—Don and Richards were there when we got there—we went into a room there—Ward said he was going to back Sir Reuben; that was the name of a horse that was going to run in the Cesarewitch—he said he was gong to put on 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he was not certain which—I was to put on 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I consented to do so—I had not the the money with me at the time; I told Ward so—he said it did not matter because I could the time; I told Ward so—the other two prisoners were both present then—he said, he said he was going to provide the money in the mean-time—before Ward started he got the money from Don and Richards—I saw what I brought notes pass between them from Richards and Don and Ward pulled out some notes and said, "Here is two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes," and he said, "That will do for you"—I did not see whether they were 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he then put all the notes in his purse, and said he was going away to put them on Sir Reuben—I and Don walked out towards the Holborn Restaurant—before Ward left he said I owed him altogether 163<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bet at Manchester, and the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for com<lb/>mission</p>

               <p>—about half an hour or three-quarters of an hour after that Ward met me and Don at the Holborn Restaurant—he said he had bee to Tattersall's and done very good business—he also told me that he had met a friend who told him that he had to go to Paris, and he asked me to come along with him—I told him I would not go—I was going to the bank to get the money to give him before he started—Don was going to Paris too—we all three then went back to the Inns of Court Hotel, where we met Richards again, and while there the police took the three prisoners into custody and detained me—I went to the police-station, and there made a charge against the three prisoners, and signed the charge-sheet—I have parted with 288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether to the prisoners—when I saw these notes at different times I thought they were genuine—I always believed what was told me about the bets on my behalf; I thought they were genuine, and I believed these were thorough gentle<lb/>men and straightforward men.</p>

I live at 91, Findon Road, South Ken<lb/>sington—on 6th August I was chief cashier at the Hanover Square branch of the London and County Bank—I knew the prisoner as secretary to the Langham Hotel Company—this cheque was presented to me by the prisoner on 6th August across the counter—he pointed out to me that he had altered the cheque from "order" to "bearer," and initialled it, and asked whether it could be cashed—upon that I cashed it for him.</p>

               <p>been able to get payment for—that is in 1882, and this is one in 1884 for samples—the goods were sent by our firm right to the Stores by his direction, I believe, and were entered in his name—I cannot say if the Civil Service goods are entered in our books in the prisoner's name—I do not know if he went about with invoices headed "Bought of J. Henderson and Co."—I suppose I have seen the cheques that came from the Civil Service Stores—I cannot say if they were made payable to J. Henderson and Co.—they were handed over to him and endorsed by him, and made payable to J.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We had no open account with the prisoner except occa<lb/>sionally small parcels of snuff for himself—we had no account in our book with him as an agent—I believe this account is for samples he left at the Stores in hjs own name—if he left samples out, we should charge them to him; we charge travellers with samples—this is an account for samples which I charged the prisoner with, and which he paid—he refused the offer of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum and 8 per cent, commission; that was some time this year—Newmann had been travelling three weeks for us on com<lb/>mission, and in February he said it was very hard lines for him; he could not meet his expenses, and did not know what to do; that in two months he was going to have an engagement with a German company, which would put him on his legs, and if he could only go on till then, everything would be settled amicably and he would leave us friendly, and so on, and have something to live upon—we consulted together and said, "We will put you back, Mr. Newmann, on 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, 5 per cent. on all over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and give you 1 1/4 percent, on all cash you receive;" and since then that has been carried out—before February he had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and 5 per cent, on all he did over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, then through February he was put on 5 per cent only, as we had told him we could not keep him on because he did so little; Mr. Alfred Goode was present at that inter<lb/>view—I do not think there was any other account on the same footing as that of the Civil Service Stores; that was a special account, and the reason for it was that years ago we supplied the Stores when they first started, and then they left us—when the prisoner came he had a small connection with, them, and he said they would not deal with us in our name, but they would if it was in his name.</p>

               <p>ran into the van; his off wheel caught the off wheel of the van—the lady and baby were thrown out, and the baby fell under her—the near side shaft of the prisoner's cart broke—a policeman picked the lady and the baby up, and the baby was carried to a doctor's—I noticed the prisoner after the accident; I should say he was intoxicated from his strange behaviour; he never attended to his horse after the accident, he let the bystanders do so, and tied up the shaft, and he wanted to get up into the cart and drive away with the shaft in that broken state—he was walking unsteadily; I noticed that particularly; I did not speak to him—he was not thrown out of the cart—the cause of the lady falling was the shaft breaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> As I was coming along I pulled on one side to let a tramcar pass me, and then I pulled behind on the same metals for nine or ten yards before I could get the wheels away; that was how the shaft broke, and when they got out the cart scudded along and caught the near hind wheel of the van with my near hind wheel. I pulled up within two yards of the collision, and if I had been driving at a furious rate I could not have pulled up in fifty yards. The cob does not require any driving. I was very much upset about the lady and child falling out; that was what seemed to be intoxication.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, of 23, Palmerston Road, Finsbury—on the morning of 8th October I was in the Seven Sisters Road—I heard a trap coming behind me; I looked round and saw a lady, the prisoner, and a little girl in the trap—it was coming at a very fast pace, I believe about 12 miles an hour—it passed me—I saw a van coming In the opposite direction towards me on its proper side, two or three feet from the kerb—the prisoner seemed to pull his off rein, I could not say that he did, but he seemed to go right across and catch the near hind-wheel of the van; it might have been, the off wheel, I mean his near wheel—the lady fell out, and the baby underneath her—I noticed the prisoner after he got out of the trap; he seemed to me to be drunk, because he could not stand, he seemed to fall from one side to the other.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Charter, baker and con<lb/>fectioner, of Barnsbury—on this morning I was driving a horse and four-wheeled van along Seven Sisters Road towards Finsbury Park, on my proper side, about four feet from the kerb—I was going five or six miles an hour—I first saw the prisoner in the cart about 30 yards off—he</p>

               <p>seemed to be coming about 12 miles an hour as near as I could guess, and he was on the wrong side of the road, the off side—he was driving towards ray trap, and when he was two or three yards near me I tried to pull off nearer to the pavement, and the wheel of his trap caught the band round the tree-box of my van—I was not thrown out—I pulled up at once, and saw the lady and baby lying in the road—the prisoner drew up on the other side of the road and stopped there for some time—there were no other carts just at this part of the road, the road was quite clear—it is a very wide road; there was nothing to prevent his going right along on his own side, he had a clear road before him—I saw him afterwards; he appeared to me to be drunk; I did not speak to him—he resisted the policeman when he was being taken in charge, he did not seem to care to go—there was nothing more that made me think he was the worse for drink—he resisted the policeman, and did not seem to stand straight.</p>

I have been in the force over 19 years—I was at the police-station about 11 o'clock when the prisoner was brought there—I noticed that he was drunk, from his flushed face, his thick articulation, and his unsteady gait—he also smelt of drink, but I did not pay much attention to that, for a very small quantity of drink will make a man smell—it appeared to be rum—the charge was made against him of being drunk and causing injury to the child—the carman was explaining to me how the collision occurred, and the prisoner said, "Be careful what you say, it was your fault"—nothing more passed—the prisoner was detained in custody; he was too drunk to appear before the Magistrate that day, I did not take him for that reason.</p>

I am a "packing-case maker, at 24, Glitter Lane—about 8.15 p.m. on 30th October I was at Aldersgate St. Station smoking a cigar; I got up from a seat and went towards a train to get in—I had a gold watch and chain, and as I was going up to the train the prisoner struck me a violent blow just under my nose, which produced a flow of blood; I put up my left hand and grasped him by the throat; he was about to deal me another blow, and I seized his wrist—my watch-chain was hanging down—I shouted out "Police," and said I had been robbed, and asked them to close the station door, not to allow any persons to pass out—two railway officials came up and secured the prisoner—I felt in my pocket and missed my watch—the prisoner was taken to the station and searched—after he was stripped to his drawers and shirt he said "Now have I got it?"—I noticed that his left foot moved about, and said "What has he got under his foot?"—the constable moved him on one side, and said "Your watch," and it was found there—for three or four days my lip was very swollen; the sinews inside were cut; I bit them away and got all right—about 3 or 4 o'clock next morning my nose began bleeding, which it had not done for years—I felt the effects for three or four days—my watch was worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, of 110, High Street, Shore<lb/>ditch—on Friday, 16th October, about 2 o'clock, Jones came in and offered in pledge about 3 1/2 yards of cloth; I refused to take it; he went out, and I followed him and informed the police—about an hour afterwards Humphreys came in with the same piece, 3 1/2 yards—I detained her and took her down to the station—I had said to the man "How much do you want?"—he said "Eight shillings"—I said I did not take in shoddy stuff just to get rid of him—I told the woman I had had information from the police, and asked her if she would walk down to the station and give a satisfactory account of it to the inspector—I had had information at 10 in the morning—this is the piece of cloth—there are two pieces, 3 1/2 yards in each.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to George Palmer, a tailor, of 119, Cheapside—this cloth is his—we missed on 16th October about 30 yards, worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the whole—the prisoners were not in our employ, and had no right to take it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are two pieces of stuff; they are of a pattern made specially for us—I swear they originally constituted one piece—I said before the Magistrate that the cloth was my property; it is mine on behalf of my master—I act on his behalf—the value of this piece is about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I think I said 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the Magistrate—the whole is worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I swear it is our engaged pattern; another tailor might not have that; it is confined to ourselves—the prisoners could not have come by it properly; they could not have bought it</p>

Defence Society, with 170 branches. Answers given in legal objections, advices on partnership, &amp;c."—he said my duties would bo very light, and that there must be a deposit of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three months—I was to commence my duties on July 14th. (<hi rend="italic">A receipt for the</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">appeared at the bottom of the agreement, signed Morley Jervis.</hi>) I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated July</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th, postponing the witness's attendance for a fortnight, in consequence of Mr. Jervis having a little dispute with the committee, and requesting him to call</hi>)—I called at the office, but did not see Jervis—I saw Garland, who told me there was a little dispute with the committee, and they could not take me on for a day or two, there were two or three politicians in it, and they wanted to buy them out, and I should hear from him again in a day or two—Dean was there, but I saw Garland in the inner room—on 26th July I received this letter: "Dear Sir,—I will not trouble you to come on Monday, but</p>

               <p>please give me a call on Thursday, at 2 o'clock."—I called, and saw Garland—he said that he would return the money, as they did not want me, and he had a cheque made out, but it wanted two or three of the committee to sign it—I had received this letter from Garland to say that they would dispense with my services, as he could not arrange with the committee—I Know his writing, and his initials are there—I spoke to him about it, and he said that the cheque was made out, and only wanted two or three of the committee to sign it—I said I would waive the salary if he would return the money—I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">th August:</hi> "Dear Sir,—I have explained our interview, and a cheque shall be despatched to you as early next week as possible. P.P.

July</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th, request<lb/>ing the witness to call between</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">o'clock</hi>)—I called, and saw Jervis—he told me that the committee had not signed the cheque, but he would send it to me as soon as it was signed—I said that I did not know anything about a committee, he took the money, and to him I looked for it; that I did not like the look of the thing, it was looking rather crooked, but I would wait till Friday, this being Thursday, and if the money was not then forthcoming, he would be sorry for it—he promised that the cheque should be sent on Friday—I saw Kent once, when I called and asked him where Jervis was—he said he was at Worship Street Police-court, and he thought I was very fortunate in getting the situation, as there were 3,000 applicants—I said "That is 2,999 too many"—I never got my money.</p>

Jarvis told me three or four times that the cheque was made out, but it had to be countersigned by two members of the committee—I do not recollect his saying that if the committee had not signed it by Friday he would pay it out of his own pocket—to the best of my belief he did not—I do not recollect that I said so at the police-court—I signed my deposition—I do not suggest that the Clerk of the Court imagined it. (<hi rend="italic">The statement appeared in the deposition.</hi>) Jarvis gave me this card at the same time I gave him the money; it had nothing to do with making me part with the money—I did not know anything about the 157 branches till I received the card, and that did not induce me to part with my money—I am a prosecutor; I decline to say how much I have paid towards the expenses of the prosecution; I decline to say whether they are being advanced by Mr. Hare—I swore information in this case, and it was true; I suppose the prisoners were taken in custody upon the strength of it—I have sworn that the 157 branches had nothing to do with my paying the money, but in swearing the information it had—Jervis may have drawn my attention to the back of the card, and said "That is the kind of business we do"—I looked upon myself as contracting with Jervis alone, but after<lb/>wards Garland came into it; he was the first one that put me off—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was first mentioned in the advertisement—it afterwards turned out that the money was found in the safe, labelled as mine—when Gar<lb/>land told me that my money was there ready for me I said it was too late, because the warrant was out—I did not refuse to receive it, because it was never offered me—the warrant was out on the Saturday, I believe Mr. Hare applied for it—I made no inquiries about the committee of the</p>

               <p>society—there may have been a committee for aught I can say—I have inquired about the branch offices, not before the agreement, but only when I saw there was something wrong, and I inquired from different men who were done as well as myself—I received this letter: "20th August. Sir,—I have received cheque for your deposit; am I to pay it to you or to Mr. Hare, your solicitor? If to you, please call to-morrow at 2 o'clock"—that is in Garland's writing; I got it on Monday morn<lb/>ing, but I had communicated with Mr. Hare more than a week before—if I had received my money on the Friday I should have referred it to Mr. Hare—I don't remember swearing in my information that Jervis represented to me that there was a committee—on 1st September I went to the office with two policemen armed with a warrant; it was nearly 10 o'clock—I had seen Mr. Hare between 9.30 and 10 at his office, and then went to Old Street to meet the policemen—Garland and Kent were apprehended on that occasion; I pointed them out—I did not say to kent "Now I have got you"—it was then that Garland said that my 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ready for me—I went to Fleet Street with the constable, and there apprehended Jervis, and I and the detective went in a cab to Old Street station—I did not say to Jervis on the road "I will crush you, by God"—this is the first time I have heard of it—I went to the office to look on, and saw them putting some books together—I saw the police take possession of some of the things; they did not turn the clerk out; they locked up the place—Jervis did not say "You had better think again; all this will ruin us"—he said in the cab that my money was at the office—I did not say "Money be d—"or" Give it to me now," or "My solicitor will get me my money; this is a good job for him."</p>

I did not see Garland when I first entered into the agreement or for some time afterwards—it was not in consequence of anything he said that I parted with my money—it may have been as late as July 28th that I saw him first—he sat at a desk writing, or pretending to write; he had the appearance of a clerk employed in the place—you are right in suggesting that I included him in the charge because he put me off; he promised to see that I had it—he told me that he was acting as secretary the first time I saw him—the clerk Dean was always in the outside office; I did not see him keep a call-book, but I saw him speak through a tube—when I got the first letter I asked Gar<lb/>land what he was doing signing Jervis's name, and he said that "P.P.

(<hi rend="italic">Signed by Jervis, and enclosing a copy of an agreement, asking the witness to fix a day to sign it</hi>)—I replied, and fixed the 28th, but on July 24th I got this letter: "Yours to hand; kindly return the copy of the agreement, and state what time you will call. M. Jervis." I called at the office on Monday and saw Kent; he said that Mr. Jervis was not in, he was at Worship Street—I said "I will call again," which I did in the afternoon, and saw Kent, and told him I should like to feel a little more satisfied before I paid my money—he said that he had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. At stake in the society, and if I lost mine he should lose his, and I then paid him the money and signed the agreement, and Kent signed as a witness.

                  </hi>. I live at Exeter now—in the early part of the year I was residing in London—I entered into the service of the Defence Society in June last—I saw an advertisement in the paper, and wrote and received a reply; I have not the letter here—I after<lb/>wards called at the office and saw Jervis, and asked him about the place and when I should commence duties—I think this was about the 10th of June—he told me my duties would be light—I called again and saw Jervis; Dean was in the office—an agreement was drawn up then; I signed one part, and the other part was given to me; I have the agreement with me—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—I parted with my money because I thought it was a genuine affair—I commenced on 30th June; when I went to the office Mr. Jervis and Mr. Dean were there—I remained at the office about two months—Garland and Kent were there during that time; Garland was assistant-secretary or something like that, and Kent was a kind of clerk—I was paid every week—I kept a report book—I did not see any one else there besides Garland, Jervis, Kent, and Dean—there was no branch office that I know of; there was going to be one, because I was sent on that duty—I saw some printed circulars at the office; I never distributed any; they were different colours—I have seen this one (<hi rend="italic">yellow) (produced</hi>), and I have seen the white one; I think I have not seen this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it says they had formed 178 branches—it is not true that I embezzled 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. while I was there—it is not true that I was dismissed on account of irregularities in my accounts, nor that I was re-engaged; I saw an advertisement, and I applied to Mr. Jervis about it, and he said he would recommend me—I was not under notice to quit and then re-employed by the committee—I never</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My duties were making inquiries concerning cases—I was sent to this Court once to search the Calendar to ascertain if Mr. Greenaway had been convicted here—I was sent to Mr. Goode, the printer, concerning the printing of these circulars—I was sent to Mr. Caswall by Mr. Kent; that was about Mr. Kent's private matters—I recollect the Society doing some business for a Mrs. Pigeley—I heard her complain at the Worship Street Police-court that the Society had got her money and had not carried out her business—I know a Mr. Brook<lb/>man; the Society took charge of a case of his; I did not hear him complain that I know of—the writing in this letter-book looks like Jervis's writing, I cannot swear to it—the signature is "Morley Jervis"—I cannot say whose writing this is on this document—I have never taken any notice of Garland's writing—I have seen the clerks using letter-books in the office—there was a copying press used by the clerk Dean—I have been to see Jervis in the gaol while this case has been proceeding—in the matters in which I have been engaged Jervis did not conduct the cases, Solicitor and Counsel always conducted them—Mr. Fulcher was the solicitor—I was sometimes sent to Mr. Lynch's chambers—I was with Jervis—I cannot say whether Jervis ever put his own name on papers that were sent to Counsel, I don't know whether he did or no—the briefs, I think, were prepared in the office—I believe Mr. Fulcher used to come and sign the outside sheet himself—I could not say what he did, he has generally gone inside with Jervis.</p>

I am a surveyor, of 30, Finsbury Circus—I know Jervis—I gave no authority for my name to. appear as one of the manag<lb/>ing committee of the Defence Society—I had seen a prospectus with my name in it in the early part of the present year, in a white circular which I have with me—I appear here with W.

               <p>was foreman at our factory at Lewisham—lie had been so about 18 months, and his wife was employed as forewoman—he left in November, 1882, and she left shortly afterwards—we gave him notice to leave, and then made a verbal arrangement with him as our town traveller at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he had had a small round previously, but only one day in the week—we agreed to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5 per cent, commission on all he did over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he was to work all the week, and was not allowed to represent any one but our firm—in February this year we told him that his business was so small we could not go on in the same way, and we withdrew his salary, and put him on 5 per cent.—that went on for three weeks—he then applied to us that he was so low in funds he could not get on at all; that he expected an arrangement to be made with some German Association that was starting in two months, and he hoped we would allow him to remain till then and leave us amicably—we con<lb/>sidered it, and said we would give him the same terms as before with an an addition of 1 1/4 percent, commission on all he collected, and 5 per cent, com<lb/>mission on all orders—the cash sheets were on a desk for the use of travellers when they came in the morning and brought in their notes and pocket books—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are cash sheets signed by the prisoner—he was supposed to come every morning, but he did not—if he missed a morning he ought to fill up a cash sheet next day if he had cash to pay in—these sheets extend from June 26th to September—Mr. Balls's 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is not entered, nor is Mr. Carter's 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor Mr. Bennett's 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor Mr. Langley's 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we gave the prisoner notice at the beginning of September, and he was paid his weekly salary up to October 4th—up to that time we had no idea that he had embezzled money—he has not paid over these six sums; we put the matter in Mr. Bowker, the solicitor's hands, early in October.</p>

Henderson and Co., but I only know it from hearsay—the firm knew that he supplied goods to the Civil Service Stores in that name, but I did not know—I think there were two parcels sent in that name since I have been a partner, but I can't tell without looking at the books—there were a good many dealings between our firm and the Civil Service Stores through the prisoner, he being our traveller—the Stores ceased to deal with us some time ago because we would not advertise in their list, and we got them to take our goods under cover of Henderson's firm—we were not paid for quite all the goods supplied to them, and we delivered to the prisoner this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the goods which the Stores had not paid for—the cigars supplied to the Stores were the prisoner's own brand; they were called "<hi rend="italic">El Trebla</hi>"—we bought that brand of him, and paid him for it—the accounts with the Civil Service Stores were paid to the prisoner in the ordinary way, by cheque, I think—I can't say whether the cheques were payable to J.

Henderson and Co. have no place of business to my knowledge; the name was never used to my knowledge except with regard to the Civil Service Stores, and at that time the prisoner had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the Stores wanted us to advertise in their book ten or fifteen years ago, and that would have damaged us with our customers—that was before my time—the total amount to the Stores between March and September was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was since we resumed the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the business at the factory had been conducted by the prisoner's wife as forewoman, but it was our factory—I do not know that the prisoner and his wife traded as Henderson and Co.—we bought several brands shortly after the circular—from the time I came into the business Mrs. Newman had nothing to do with it so far as I am concerned—on 5th October, 1882, the prisoner wrote "Compensate me for the wrongful dismissal of my wife"—there had been no claim for money in the interval as compensation for his wife, nor had he complained of the goods being deteriorated—we did not debit him with any goods—if we lost customers it was not his loss—we had no knowledge of his having private customers, but he may have called our customers his, as other travellers do—this is our circular of September, 1884 (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they were going to dispense with travellers, stating terms for cash, and enclosing price list</hi>)—we only addressed that to persons who had dealings with us—I did not know of any existing place of business or books of account of Henderson and Co. after the circular of 1881—his commission was paid weekly with his salary—he claims 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his statement—he had made no claim for that while I was a partner, he being paid week by week—we got his letter a day or two after he left, and we took it to Mr. Bowker—there is no cash sheet filled up by him between 28th June and 8th July—July 8 being the first time he accounts for money received, he omits Bell's 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Carter's 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he often said that his expenses were heavy—he never give us notice to quit—he made no claim to pocket money to pay his expenses—he had five per cent only for three weeks—if he had reported these payments he would have had 1 1/4 on them—during the six months previous to leaving the service 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Was all the business done in Newman's name—it is entered as "Newman, sundries," and there are names in that account—he was paid 1 1/4. for collection upon those sums; lots of names are down, but the only place where the goods were sent was the Civil Service Stores—I swear that the customers had invoices direct from us.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in this business nearly thirty years—from July, 1881, the prisoner and his wife were interested in a firm of Hender<lb/>son—I paid for their brands and labels while he was in my service—we thought it better to continue the brands as his customers had been having the cigars under his name—he was foreman in the factory and wished to go on with his old customers, and keep up his old connection, and we made arrangements to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, 5 per cent, on orders, and allow him to go out once a week—we did not reduce his salary at the factory for that—while at the factory he gave the whole of his time except that day to our service—we dismissed him from the factory in November, 1882, when we had a change in our establishment—from March to February, 1882 and 1883, he had no salary at all; he ceased to be foreman of the factory in November, 1882; we wanted to do what we could for him, and having a traveller's round vacant, we offered it to him and he accepted it—he had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary and 5 per cent, commission on all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170075"/>
               <p>trade done over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the whole of that time he was settled with weekly; we had reason to complain of the amount of business he brought, and mere was a disruption of the agreement—he remained without salary four weeks, hut as he represented that he could not go on, and we were satisfied that it could not pay him, we went back to the former arrangement and gave him a greater advantage—for two months he accepted these terms, and they continued down to the time of his finally leaving—he was settled with weekly—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his cash sheets; he has signed each—there is no cash sheet between 28th June and 28th July—on 3rd September he accounts for six sums amounting to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there is no entry of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Bennett, or of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 12th September, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Higgins—on 20th September he accounts for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In one sum—I have got his cash sheet of 25th September, there is no account of Langley 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never claimed compensation for the wrongful dismissal of his wife before October, 1884, when his notice terminated and he left our service, or any claim for money spent upon licensed victuallers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know the connection the prisoner had through his wife, and that he went away one day in the week to look after his custo<lb/>mers with our consent, and this circular was eventually issued by me and him—the whole of his time was to be given to us except that one day, and he then went out in our service—we engaged him as foreman of the factory, and to do everything required of him—not to sweep out the place; that would be ridiculous—I engaged him about May, 1881—when my cousin came into the firm we altered that engagement—when we took him on as traveller I and my partner both saw him; we told him we would start him as town traveller aft 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary and 5 per cent, commission on all over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as the trade he was doing while at the factory was not sufficient, we would hand over another traveller's custo<lb/>mers to him—then, after alterations, he went on on the same terms, with an additional 1 1/4 per cent, for cash up to the end of October—we did not renew the agreement, it went on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No alteration was made in the agreement up to the time he left—he ceased being foreman at the factory when Mr. Goode became my partner, and was in no other capacity after that but town traveller—he would have to do anything but what was degrading.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an admitted solicitor, and am acting as managing clerk to Mr. Bowker, 1, Gray's Inn Square, who is solicitor to Messrs. Goode—on 9th or 10th October the prisoner came to my office in consequence of my sending a letter—Mr. Bowker was present—I carried on the conversation principally—the prisoner was very much agitated, and almost crying—I told him that Messrs. Goode had reason to believe that he had received moneys for which he had not accounted—I think he said yes, he would go round to the customers with Messrs. Goode, and let them know what sums he had received—he said he could make up his deficiencies in six months, as certain moneys or businesses ware coming to him from abroad, and he asked us to advise him what to do—we told him we could not do that, and he said should he write to us or to Messrs. Goode, offering to go round to the customers, and make up his deficiency in that way—we told him he must act entirely on his own judgment, but that any letter he might write might probably be used in evidence against him—he understood that there was a complaint of his embezzlement at that time; no amount was mentioned, I think—at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170076"/>
               <p>interview he said something about his having a claim for the wrongful dismissal of his wife some time back, and he generally complained that he had been badly treated and had claims—I think I said we had no instructions as to that, and that that did not affect the present question, and the matter, I think, was not further discussed—we certainly did not withdraw the complaint of embezzlement—he set up no claim of being able to use their moneys for his expenses and not enter them in his cash-sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the letter I wrote him on 8th October, before saying we charged him with embezzlement. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they had found he had failed to acquaint them with amounts received on their behalf, and that unless he communicated with them by to-morrow, they would take immediate steps against him for embezzlement; that if he repeated the statements in his letter, they should proceed against him for libel, and that the claim he made for compensation was absurd.</hi>) I drafted the letter—I had received instructions that the claim for compensation was absurd—he called twice—on the second occasion, the 11th October, his manner was very different; he said that if he went round to the customers he should require to be paid, and that his travelling expenses must also be paid, and that he must have compensation for the various claims which he had mentioned previously—subsequently I received this letter from him, dated the same day. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker at Cold Harbour Lane, Brix<lb/>ton, and other places—on 29th July, 1883, my father and I engaged the prisoner Herbert as assistant, and he remained with us up to September 2nd—I know his writing—these addresses are written by him—we were dissatisfied with him—some watches were missing while he was in our service, one watch particularly; the assistants all knew that, and they had a regular hunt for it on the Saturday before Herbert left on the Sunday morning—I had given him a month's notice the previous day, August 29th; that was the day his month was up; we engaged him by the month—a day or two after he left I went to his fathers place, 9, Streuan Square, and told him that his son had left on Sunday morning and had not returned, and I had come to know the reason; that a watch had been missed on Saturday night, and I wished to know if he could throw any light on it—he said that his son had been discharged by the foreman—I said that must have been a lie, for they all stopped up on Saturday night till 1 o'clock waiting his return, and he was due at 11.30—he said that his son had gone out to post a letter, and he would go with me to find him; we could not find him, and I left—Herbert called upon me the next day and said that he knew nothing about the watch, and he was not going to be watched as he was there—I said "It is a very strange coincidence that you should leave in that way, and the watch should be missing on the Saturday night"—he said "I don't know anything about the watch"—I said "You need not apply to me for any character; I shall not give you one"—he said "Oh, I can get a character from a dozen persons; I am independent of you"—next day I received this billhead; the body of it is in Henry Base's writing and the signature is John Base's: "5-9-83. Will you be so good as to let me know by the first post the charge against my son. It is quite clear he was discharged from the Sunday morning, so that sitting up for him till 1 o'clock is all <hi rend="italic">rot.</hi> I wish to know what you have against him, that I may write to his former employers, and throw to the winds the charge of absconding. John Base." He never applied to me for a character—the watch has not been found—it was a pledge—it was kept in the safe—Herbert had not the key, but it was frequently left open in business hours, and he was in the habit of going there.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father, a pawnbroker in High Street, Camden Town—in October, 1883, we advertised for a warehouse boy; the prisoner Herbert answered it, and we saw him—he said he had lived with Mr. Burgess, of Long Acre, six months, who had gone away, and since then he had lived with his father, John Base, a poulterer—I asked him if he had had a situation with a pawnbroker, and he said that he had not—that is the usual form of question—I went and saw his father, and told him that his son said that he had lived with Mr. Burgess, who had gone away since when he had lived with him—the father said that was so, and that he had lived nowhere else—I then engaged him, believing the statement that both gave—he was engaged in October, and was dis<lb/>charged at the beginning of December because he could not do his work properly, and there were other reasons—I had no application for a character afterwards from either of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker of 81, Whitechapel Road—in April, 1884, I advertised for an assistant, and Herbert Base replied on this printed heading from Struan Square with the words "Own handwriting" on it—he afterwards came and told me he had been living three years with Mr. Burgess, of Long Acre, and had left him nine or twelve months, since when he had been assisting his father in the poultry business—I asked him for a reference—he said that Mr. Burgess had gone away—I knew that there had been an upset there, and I said I would take the foreman's reference—he said "The foreman has also run away"—I rather liked him, and said I would take him for a month on trial, and he came next day—before the month was up I received some information and kept a watch upon him, and on Sunday morning, May 11th, when he was leaving the shop to go home, between 8 and 9 o'clock, with a black bag, I made an excuse to send him for some tobacco and newspapers, so that the bag should be brought upstairs to me—when he came back I asked him where the key of the bag was—he said "In my pocket"—I said "Open it, if you please"—he did so readily, and he had some tobacco there and one of my pledges done up in paper, two lady's night-dresses—I asked him what he had done with the ticket—he said he had torn it up and thrown it in the fireplace upstairs—it should have been attached to the wrapper—I told him to get out of the place, as he would hear from the Pawnbrokers' Protection Society next week for obtaining a situation by false pretences—I afterwards received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Dated 13th May, asking for forgiveness for his ingratitude, and stating that he had never taken a single article off the premises</hi>)—I took no notice of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant at 4, Eaton Road, Haverstock Hill—on Sunday night, November 9th, I was taking a walk with a young man named Robinson near Primrose Hill; he left me alone for a short time about a quarter to 9 o'clock; the prisoner then came up to me, took hold of my arm, and said "Do you know you have no business here?"—I said "I am not aware of it"—he said "Let me see where my governor is; we will have you locked up"—he appeared to look for some one, and said "I do not see him; don't make a noise; have you any money?"—I said "I have none"—he said "Tell me no lies; you have money, give it to me"—I was afraid, and took out my purse and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was all I had—I did not give him the purse—he said "Is this all you have?"—I said "Yes"—he gave me a push and said "Go along; don't make a noise in case you meet the governor"—it was not an enclosed place—Robinson came up a few minutes afterwards, and from what I said he called a constable, and the prisoner was given in charge—he had then got over a fence—I did not walk with him after he took my money—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

Powell, care of Mr. Witkoski, 1, Charlotte Street, London"—that is his house—he afterwards called twice before I was down and saw my husband—my sister can write; she has a husband; he can write—we are on friendly terms—I have a half-brother—I told the prisoner I was not in a hurry for the money—after this matter when he was in custody his mother came down and suggested that the money should be either paid in one sum or by instalments; he was remanded from time to time on another matter.</p>

I have been four years and a half in the police—on Saturday night, about 11.30, I was on duty, in plain clothes, in York Street, Westminster, and was chatting with Mrs. Smith, the wife of a carman, living at 50, York Street, when I saw about fourteen or fifteen people coming along the street, pushing each other, and as I thought they looked disorderly I stepped aside towards the houses, with my back towards them, to let them pass—I was suddenly flung to the ground by some one from behind—it was so sudden I could recognise no one—I was then kicked from all directions—I then pulled myself up by Barnes's clothing and got on my knee—he punched my face with both his fists—while he was doing so I managed to get on my feet and got out my life preserver, which we are allowed to carry when on private duty for our protection—I struck several of them in self-defence, Barnes in particular—I don't say I struck Hickson—then I was over-powered and thrown a second time, and then they continued kicking me about the body and legs, and also my head—I saw Hickson after I was thrown the second time—I cannot say if he actually did anything to me—I did not see Kevill—Francis I saw, I am quite certain he was there—I cannot say what he did—I did not see Fitzgerald—there was great con<lb/>fusion—the skin was knocked off my kneecap—one eye was closed, and my body bruised—Sergeant Ashwell and a gentleman came up—they found I was bleeding—I was cut just over the eighth rib, I believe—it had cut through my clothes and stabbed me—I can't say who did it, nor when it was done—I was taken to the hospital—Dr. Waller attended me—pleurisy came on afterwards, the doctor told me—I am on the sick list now—my clothes were saturated with blood—I had seen Barnes repeatedly before in that neighbourhood—I cannot say I had seen any of the others before.</p>

About 11.30 on Saturday night, 1st November, I was on duty in plain clothes going through York Street—I saw Kitch surrounded by a number of men stagger across the road and fall down—I immediately ran up to him; about ten or twelve people were round him kicking him—I pulled Barnes off—he was kicking Kitch about the body; I saw him kick him twice—when I had hold of Barnes he struck me on the mouth with his fist—I had a walking-stick with me, and I struck out right and left to drive them away—Kitch got up and then Barnes ran up to close with him again—I was attacked myself by the crowd—I saw Hickson there; I knew him by sight before; I saw him strike Kitch with his fist—Kitch fell down again and Hickson kicked him—I saw Kevill in the crowd, and saw him strike Kitch with his fist—I had seen him before in the street and know him by sight—I cannot say if Francis was there, and do not speak to Fitzgerald—there was great disorder—I was attacked; a stone was thrown at me—I succeeded in beating them off, and found Kitch was bleeding freely—Mr. O'Brien assisted me, and we got him to the Westminster Hospital in a cab and left him in charge of the surgeon there—I then went back to York Street; they were all gone then and the houses closed—I did not take anybody in custody that night—on Sunday night, the 2nd, about 10 o'clock, I went to the Adam and Eve public-house, where I saw Kevill—I said "I want you for being concerned in assaulting the constable last night"—he said "You have made a mistake, governor; you have got the wrong one"—I did not take the others—I knew Barnes, Kevill, and Hickson by sight before; I knew where Barnes lived, not the others—I am sure I saw Kevil engaged in it—others joined in the attack; there had been a friendly lead at the Black Horse, close by Mr. Smith's—I don't know who stabbed Kitch—after I came back from the hospital I saw Mr. Wyatt, who gave me his name and address; I had seen him before I went to the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Miles Lane, London Bridge, and am a commercial traveller—on 1st November, about 25 minutes to 12, I was walking down York Street, Westminster, and heard a number of young men making a noise—I stopped to speak to a tradesman there, and directly after, hearing a number of people making a noise, I saw Kitch in private clothes, without a hat and with his coat open, being hustled about by a number of them from one side of the road to the other, and then I saw him deliberately knocked down and kicked—he seemed to give no provocation to those people, but to be endeavouring to get away—when he got up he walked backwards a few steps and was sur<lb/>rounded again; the crowd appeared greatly augmented; one of them closed with him and appeared to be striking him with his fist; to the best of my belief that was Hickson—Sergeant Ashwell got him away then—just before he had. closed with him, after Kitch was knocked down the first time, he drew his life preserver—after Ashwell had come up I went up and spoke to these men, and then found they were police constables—Kitch seemed very much exhausted, and complained of a pain in his side; I removed his coat and saw a slit in his waistcoat; Ashwell tore his waistcoat open and there was a great deal of blood—I said "I think you are stabbed"—Ashwell took him to the hospital in a cab, which I found—the constables both behaved in a most forbearing manner in my opinion—I gave my name and address—I was not called to the police-court as I was away on my rounds travelling—I can only identify Hickson; I saw Barnes there, but I did not see him strike any blow—I should not like to say as to any of the others.</p>

               <p>be thrown in every direction, and came bang, bang against the shop-shutters—I recognise Hickson, Barnes, and Kevill—two men walked up the middle of the road, stones began to fly, and directly they got their feet on the pavement Barnes ran behind the policeman, and pulled him down from the back, with his head in the gutter; that was after what I first saw—then ten or twelve all set on him, knocking him about—I ran to his assistance, and got hold of a man and threw him on one side, and said "I never saw a more dirty, cowardly action in my life;" some<lb/>thing like that—Kitch then got up with the other man's assistance, and the men ran towards James Street—I saw Kitch had his life-preserver after he got up, and I saw him make a hit twice, I think at Barnes—then I saw Hickson holding the life-preserver and trying to twist it out of Kitch's hands—directly the two men ran away a number of others fol<lb/>lowed for a short distance, about four doors from my place, and another constable came up—I should think it was necessary for Kitch to use his life-preserver, when he did so in self-defence with all these people—to the best of my belief Kevill is the man I pulled off Kitch—I should not like to swear to it—I am sure he was there; directly after the men ran away he was at my side—I know nothing of Francis or Fitzgerald—Barnes lives four doors from me in the same street—I knew Hickson before by sight; he lives in Caxton Street, close by—I knew Kevill by sight, and that he lived in York Street somewhere—my wife is outside—Ashwell was the second man I saw.</p>

               <p>knocked the constable over the head—they got him down on his back in the middle of the road, and commenced kicking him—I could not say whether they were all together, as it was rather dark, and I was rather frightened—he remained for some time on his back and then tried to raise himself—I said "Try and get up," and then I think he produced his life-preserver and waved it about—he had no chance of doing anything with it—a lot more men then came up; I could not discern who—they were kneeling on his chest, and said "Oh, look what the b——has got!"—I went and fetched my husband, and after a few minutes came out and saw Barnes with a crowd of men confused one with another—I identify nobody else—I said to Barnes "What a shame it was for all these roughs to come and ill-use that man when he was not saying an ill-word to any one"—Barnes came on the pavement and said "Was I one of those roughs?" and made a gesture—he had his fist clenched—I said "I did not say you were"—I picked up this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and gave it to the inspector the same night—it is a sack—I saw nothing inside it—it wag a very hard blow—I am certain something was inside it when he was struck, by the noise—it was not a noise that the canvas could make of itself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chiropodist, and live at 4, Kennington Lane—Jane Angrave, the prosecutrix in this case, makes an article, and I sell it—on 27th February I called on the prisoner at 14, Rathbone Street, Barking Road, Canning Town, to sell him some corn salve on cards, at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sold him one gross on three cards of four dozen each for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here is my book with the entry—I made out this, and he signed it (<hi rend="italic">Bought of J. Angrave, one gross corn salve,</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Terms three months' credit, not on appro. H.

Aley's, one at the top and the other at the bottom, on the invoice, were written by the same hand, by me; some one else said so, not the Magis<lb/>trate—I wrote everything on this notice to the defendant to be at this Court as I was going to prosecute—when I went on 27th February I think a boy was in the shop besides Mr. Aley for a little while—I would not swear he was not there all the time—I don't take out summonses in my name because of the trade list; the goods are part hers and part mine.</p>

I am a coke contractor of 4, Garrett Street, Plum-stead—I have known the two Malins between seven and eight years—they are general dealers, ready to buy anything they can get cheap—the father lives in Beresford Street, the back entrance is in Ropeyard Rails—it is a private house—I don't know where the son lives—on Saturday morning, 20th September, I was in Ropeyard Rails delivering some coke, and saw Pierce come out of a house three or four doors from Malin's place—he came across and asked me if I would buy a horse—I said "How big is it?"—he said "As big as the horse you have got in your van"—he went away, and in about half an hour came back with a grey mare without harness, but with a halter on—Malin and his son came out of their premises at the same time with a pony in a barrow, and the man who had the horse gave it into Malin's hands, and the son ran the horse up, and Pierce took my whip to touch him up, and when the horse was running up a second time I stopped him—Pierce asked if I would give 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said "I do not thick she is worth that," and asked if he would let me try her with a load of coke, and, if she could not pull that I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her—he said that he had bought her cheap, and had no further use for her, and I should have her—he told me to tie her behind my van and work her till night, and if she suited me I was to come down and pay him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her—I tied her behind my van, and then went into a house with a sack of coke, leaving the three prisoners talking together—as I came out I saw the elder Malin and Pierce nearly at the bottom of the street—they had not taken the mare away—they turned in the direction of the London Road—I went across the road to Mr. Malin's son, and he and another man were harnessing the horse in a barrow—I said "This is a clever trick"—he said "It is nothing when you are used to it"—I said "I am not used to it"—the son then got up and drove away in the barrow with the mare—they had taken the pony which was in the barrow into their yard—I saw nothing more of the mare—I had not paid for her.</p>

On 17th October, when Pierce was in custody, I saw Henry Malin outside the station and asked him whether he knew anything of any other horses; he said, "Has he had any more?" I said, "I can't say, why?" he said, "Because I bought the grey mare and harness of him, and a big bay horse and harness; the grey mare I sold to Mr. Comyns, of Church Street, Greenwich; the harness I have at home; the bay horse I sold on the way to Croydon Fair, at a public-house about a mile from the fair"—he did not say when or what he got for it, he said that he sold the harness to John Self, at Rope Yard Rails, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Pierce brought them to the station next day, and on that day I saw Malin, who said Pierce told him his father had been a horse dealer, and he died and left him and his brother 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, that his brother was sending these things down to Woolwich to him to make the most he could of them, and that he believed that statement was true—I have never been able to trace the big horse, but the harness was produced by Henry Malin and the police took charge of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Malin was standing close by George and Alfred Manchester; they pointed out Malin as the man they had bought a pony of—I took him into custody; they said "Don't take hold of him or he shan't go"—people in plain clothes held me—I took him and the two Manchesters too; they were never charged, but discharged from custody—Thomas Malin said his father bought the pony of some man at Woolwich on the 16th—I will not swear he did not say the man lived two doors off—I searched and found some money on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now Master of the Hereford Union Workhouse—for the greater part of 1877 to 1881 I resided in South Street, Leo<lb/>minster—in 1881 I was Relieving Officer and Registrar of Births and Deaths, and Superintendent of the Census returns there—I knew the prisoner Thomas in that year—about the early part of April that year</p>

               <p>he came to my place—I cannot say the date, it was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon; I went to his house and saw him in his garden—I then went into Mr. Whalley's room, a sitting-room, on the ground floor—Rees came in directly after—there was no one in the room, I think, when I first went in, except Mr. Whalley and myself—I can't remember what furniture there was in the room; I remember as table, sofa, chairs, and writing-desk—Mr. Whalley told me in consequence of news he had recently received he had resolved to alter his will, and he wished me to be one of the attesting witnesses—I think Rees came in during the con<lb/>versation—I believe Mr. Whalley made use of somewhat similar words to him, explaining to him why he had sent for him also—he then drew my attention to a document lying on his writing-table, and he sat down and signed his name to it, and made a remark something like "That is not a bad signature for an old man," and he expressed something like "This is my act and deed," or some words to that effect—before I signed my name I was looking down the attestation clause, and he thought, apparently, that I was reading the will, and he said "There is no occa<lb/>sion for you to read the will," so I explained that I was only reading the attestation clause—I then signed my name and my address, "120, South Street, Registrar of Births and Deaths"—I noticed that the date to the attestation clause was the correct date—I think Mr. Whalley died on 7th May, I would not be certain—I saw Thomas that day, he came to my house with a message from Mr. Gunnell, inviting me to the General—he said that Mr. Whalley had left in writing a great deal of matter relative to his wishes, among others the names of the persons he wished to attend his funeral, and among them—I asked him who were likely to attend, his relatives I meant—he explained that there were no relatives, except the young man, the adopted son, and he said "He has left his money to myself and Priestman, his adopted son," or rather, he said, "to my wife and children"—I was present when the funeral left the house where Mr. Whalley had been living—a great number of people were there—the Vicar, Mr. Edwards, Thomas, Priestman, Nash and his wife, and Gunnell—Gunnell said that Mr. Whalley's affairs would astonish Leoninster, that they were like a romance, "as you will hear by-and-by," and he made a motion as though he was putting his hand into his pocket—after the funeral I went back to the house—all the three prisoners were there, Mr. Priestman, and myself, and I think Mr. Gunnell. jun., Captain Gunnell, and Nash—no will was produced while I was there—some time after the funeral, I think it would be during May, I met Gunnell in the street—he asked if I could call on him, because he wanted to talk to me—I called several times, but did not see him—I saw him in the street, and said I had called and not seen him—he appeared to have forgotten the circumstance; he began to ask me what I had had to do with Mr. Whalley—he said "I understand you have signed something for him"—I said "Yes, I signed a will of Mr. Whalley's"—he said "How do you know it was a ill?"—I said "Because he told me so"—he suggested that it was a transfer of stock or something of that kind—I said "No, it was not that, I know what those things are; I know it was a will by the attestation of it"—he said "I may as well tell you that the next-of-kin of Mr. Whalley are making a disturbance about the will so very likely they will as you questions; you had better be careful what you say, you don't know much about it"—I don't exactly recollect</p>

               <p>the words, it was something like that—he said that very likely I should be subpœnaed, and I had better be careful what I said about it, that I did not know much, and I had better not know anything—I said "What<lb/>ever I know any one is welcome to know"—he said "If we subpoena you, mind your fees will be all right"—I don't think any one else was present at this time—I think Mr. Gunnell, jun., walked in and out of the office, but not to stay—I once asked Thomas what date the will was that I had attested—he suggested something about the beginning of March, I said I did not think so, I thought it was in April—he talked to me several times about the affair, about the old gentleman's peculiarities, and things of that sort, nothing very particular; he always seemed anxious to talk to me about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. I knew Mr. Whalley from his appearance in the street; I never had much Conversation with him; I dare say I have said both to Thomas and Gunnell that he was a very eccen<lb/>tric person—no doubt he was an eccentric man—I became acquainted with the fact that the next-of-kin were contesting the will on the ground that he was not in a fit state to make a will—I don't think it was in con<lb/>sequence of that that I expressed an opinion that he was eccentric—I have said more than once that my mode of acquiring the date of my visit was by reference to the census—I don't think the census occupied quite a month; it occupied till about the middle of April, but I don't know accu<lb/>rately—I think I asked Thomas a few days after Mr. Whalley was buried about the date of the will being executed; I did not then remember the day—Mr. Turner has asked me about it, I can't remember when—Mr. Neale was the first person who spoke to me about it—I think it was in the autumn of 1881 that Mr. Turner spoke to me; it was before the trial in London—I don't remember where I saw him because I removed to Hereford soon after—in September, 1881, I saw Mr. Neale about it at Leominster—I think I first saw Mr. Turner at Hereford, I can't say the date—I was at the two trials; I believe Mr. Neale took down my evidence for the first trial; I believe he and Mr. Turner were acting together—I don't think Mr. Turner spoke to me more than once about the date that I attested the will—I had some conversation with Mr. Childs, the station-master at Leominster, before I left; that was some time before September, 1881—I do not remember having any conversation with Mr. Turner and Mr. Childs about July or August, 1882, on the same subject, I won't say I did not; I don't remember seeing them together on 1st August, 1882, I may have done so and I may not—I have always said that it was in April that I attested the will, but I could not tell the day; I said before the Magistrate that I could not pledge myself one way or the other whether it was March or April—I read the attestation clause—the will was written on a large piece of blue paper, a single sheet written on both pages, on both sides of the paper—what I saw was the attestation clause at the end; I knew it was written on the other side because there was no heading at this side; wills generally commence "This is my last will and testament," and generally in large writing; I infer from that that it was written on the other side also—when the old gentleman took up the paper I saw there was writing on the other side—it was larger paper than foolscap. (<hi rend="italic">Several sheets of paper were handed to the witness.</hi>) I think it was larger than the largest of these, it was an unusual size; it was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170115"/>
               <p>square, it was longer than wide—the writing on the side where the attestation clause was, occupied about one-third of the way down—the attestation clause was on one side of it, on the left-hand side of the signature—I saw the signature, and I saw the date in the attestation clause, written in writing—I did not see the date anywhere else, not below the signature—I think my statement for the trials was written down more than once, about twice or three times; it was read over and I signed it before the solicitor at my own house—I think Mr. Neale took one and Mr. Turner another, and I think Mr. Lloyd took another; I believe that was before the first trial, but I would not be certain about Mr. Turner's being before the first trial, I mean before the compromise.</p>

I assumed office as master of the Here-ford Union in October, 1881—Mr. Gunnell gave me a testimonial—I had certain communications with Mr. Turner in reference to this matter; I answered his questions and gave him every information I could—it was before the funeral, in Mr. Whalley's sitting-room, that Mr. Gun<lb/>nell said that Mr. Whalley's affairs would startle Leominster—I believe they did startle Leominster—I think my conversation with Mr. Gunnell was in May; it may have been the middle of May; I don't know to whom I first mentioned it, or when—it was in 1881—I told my wife and many persons about it; I told Mr. Neale and Mr. Turner; that was previous to the action in the Queen's Bench—it was never put in writing though—I don't think it was put in writing by Mr. Turner—I don't remember its being in the deposition—I believe I did not mention it in the Queen's Bench; I was never asked about it—the signature I attested was towards the bottom of the paper, not near the end of the writing; there was plenty of space between—it was very large writing and large initials.</p>

Three letters, dated March</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 8<hi rend="italic">th, and</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1881, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Whalley to Mr. Greig, the manager of the Leeds Bank, were also read. They referred to the investment of capital for the benefit of his adopted son, Henry Whalley Priestman, who was described as a very good writer and a steady young man, who in a few days would be able to take charge of a counting-house.</hi>) On some occasions he addressed me as "Dear Sir," and on others as "My dear Harry"—on Saturday, March 12th, I went to Leominster and remained there till Monday, the 14th—when I arrived I met the prisoner Thomas, and went with him to his house, 128, South Street—I there saw my father—he seemed very ill—he could only just manage to walk about alone, but he said he was a trifle better than he had been—he told me that the Thomases had been kind in nursing him during his illness—I slept in Etnam Street, and had my meals with my father in the daytime—we were quite alone together—the Thomases did not take their meals in the same room—my father told me that he had been looking after a house in the Hereford Road, about 200 yards from where he lived, and said he thought of moving away from the Thomases on account of the noise—the Thomases had children living in the house; that was what he meant—he added that he intended to have me with him, so that I could drive him about and generally attend to him—on one occasion, after dinner, he said to me that he had recently made a will leaving 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to each of his brothers and the remainder to myself—he told me the executors were Thomas and myself; he may have said something about having left money to us; he said his circle of acquaint<lb/>ances was not very large in Leominster, and that Mr. Gunnell, who was a thorough man of the world, was best known to him—on that occasion he showed me a small pocket-book with a black cover (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and</p>

               <p>be gave it to me to look at—it contained an account of all the securities, I believe—I went through the list with him, and when he had finished them he asked what I thought the total would be—I replied, "Perhaps between 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "You might be farther wrong than that"—he also spoke about transferring 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the North British Railway to my name in the Great Western Railway of Canada, and said that I might get good advice if in need of it from Mr. Greig, of Leeds, with whom he had been in communication about the partnership—he also mentioned his stockbrokers, Messrs. Fenn and Crosthwaite—I breakfasted with him on the Monday morning, and left him on friendly terms and went to Derby—he told me to come again as soon as I could, that was on March 14th—on 1st April I wrote to my father, returning a letter in pencil which I could not read. (<hi rend="italic">Asking that Gunnell or Thomas might re-write it for him</hi>)—I received a reply on the following day which I have looked for but cannot find; but I remember that he said he was not at all surprised that I could not make it out, as he himself could not make top nor tail of it—he gave me the purport of it, which was that he had been in communication with Mr. Greig as to a partnership with Messrs. Dixon, and asked me why I had not been to see him, in accordance with his previous letter—he said he had been very ill, almost at the point of death, and wanted to see me very much, and could not understand why I had not been to see him—I wrote back that I had not received any such communication, and that had I received it, I certainly should have been able to have gone over to see him—I received in reply a slip with a few lines from Thomas stating that he had written to me at Mr. Whalley's request asking me to go over, and that if I had not received it he supposed it had got lost through the post—I destroyed the letter from Thomas by using it to stand on in a bathing machine at new Brighton. (<hi rend="italic">Letters were here ready showing the steps which Mr. Whalley took to trace the rumours which had reached him as to the death of his two brothers</hi>)—I went to Leominster on April 15th, Good Friday, and met my father in a field leaning on a stile—he spoke to me about the letter which had been lost through the post, and said it generally happened that important things got lost—he also said he had been vary ill—that afternoon he showed me a house of Mr. Page's in Hereford Road, which he said he intended to take—on Sunday, the 17th, he told me he had been making inquiries about his brothers, and had ascertained they were dead, and he showed me the letters about them—he said that had caused him to alter his will and he had left me the two 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. legacies which he had intended for his brothers—he then went to the cup<lb/>board and took out this ledger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he unlocked it and took out a large piece of blue foolscap paper—he said "That's my will," and he gave it to me to read—one side of the paper was covered, and half the other side, with his own writing—he bequeathed by it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Thomas, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Gunnell, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., towards the restoration of a small private church at Leominster, and the rest to myself—I have not seen the document since—as to the witnesses, I only remember that one of them was a Registrar of Births and Deaths—the executors were Thomas, Gunnell, and myself—I did not notice the date—after I had read it I gave it back, thanked him, and told him I was very grateful—he replaced it in the ledger and put it in the cupboard—he said he kept it, together with his bonds and securities, in the false bottom of a tin box</p>

               <p>in a cupboard in his bedroom—on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning I returned to Derby, and after I got home I had a conversation with my sister about what had taken place, and told her what had passed between me and my father—this letter is in my father's handwriting to my sister: "April 19th, 1881.—J. Whalley to E. Priestman.—As I am not sure your brother will tell you, I have resolved to do so myself, so that you may have it from me, and that there may be no envy between you in after life. I have been very ill, and, in fact, almost dead, and I have therefore just settled my affairs. As my brothers are dead, I have now left Harry everything and you nothing, as I believe you have deceived me, and are not what you represented when you took that oath, which I still have (under lock and Key). You have no one to blame but yourself for it. I do not wish to rake up old sores, nor do I wish to injure or disparage you wrongfully, all I wish is to show you what you are and what you might have been had you taken my advice and been a modest, prudent woman. I would say more, but I am overdone with writing this. J. W."—I first heard of my sister having received that letter, in the spring of 1882—I knew nothing of the oath—I never heard from or of my father again until 7th May, when I received a telegram, which was delivered about 4.15.—I did not get it until 6.30, as I was about the town at the time—it was from Gunnell: "Mr. Whalley died suddenly this morning. Made arrangements for funeral on Tuesday. You need not come before Monday, as I will see to matters"—the last train to Leo<lb/>minster was at 3.40 p.m., and I was therefore too late to reach Leominster that day—I got there on the Sunday evening at 8.30—I met Thomas at the station, and walked with him to the house and into the room occupied by my father—I asked him what had become of the securities and bonds in my father's possession; he said that Gunnell had taken charge of them, and that it would be all right, and that Mr. Gunnell had got the will—I slept at Thomas's that night, and next morning I went with him to Gunnell's house in Church Street—Gunnell told me that he had got the will and securities, and that he would read the will on the day of the funeral, after the funeral—I did not know the contents before it was read—I stayed with Gunnell after the Monday; the funeral was on Tuesday, May 10—when we returned from the funeral to Thomas's, Gunnell said "We will read the will now, but as it does not interest any one but us three we had better be alone"—after some five minutes he read the will, he, Thomas, and I alone being present—after he had finished I did not make any remark—he then read it again, and I said "Astonishing!"—he had taken the will from his breast pocket—Thomas then got up, went to the table, drank a glass of wine, and said, "Well, there it is, and I sup<lb/>pose the money will be mine"—this is the will (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Gunnell then replaced it in his pocket—I never had it in my possession—I saw it next early in April, 1882, at the Probate Office, Hereford—I left Thomas in the house and walked with Gunnell to his house—I told him on the way that the whole thing was a mystery to me, my only being left 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after seeing my father's will at my last visit, in which he had left me the whole of his property, and asked him whether he had seen that will—he said "No," and that the one he had got was the only one he had seen, and if what I had told him was really the case, he was very sorry for me, and felt for me as if I was his own son—I believe I told him that my father a short time before that had left a will</p>

               <p>leaving 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to each of his brothers, and the remainder to me, after some small legacies, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to himself, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Gunnell, and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards the restoration of the private church at Leominster—he said that he would do all that was necessary regarding the will, and I need not trouble to act as executor, because it was not necessary—on 12th May I went to Mr. Lloyd's office to read over the securities—he is Gunnell's solicitor—Gunnell said that I had better not say anything about what I had told him about the will, leaving me all the property, because it would serve no good, and Mr. Lloyd might advertise for the next-of-kin, and thus deprive me of the whole of the property—I agreed, and did not mention it to Mr. Lloyd—the securities were read over at Mr. Lloyd's, and amounted to 55,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 56,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I stayed at Leominster about a week on that occasion—Gunnell said he sympathised with me, and he should get Thomas to let me have the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. duty free, as he thought it was only fair that I should have it clear—I returned to Derby, and a month afterwards received a telegram from Thomas, in consequence of which I went to Leominster, and met Thomas and Gunnell at the station—we walked down to Gunnell's, and on the way they said that a letter from the next-of-kin had got into Gunnell's hands, having been wrongly delivered—Gunnell said that he should not like to show it to me, as it contained something regarding my family that I should not like; something cruel, I think he said—he did not show it to me—he said that the next-of-kin was some great <hi rend="italic">pot</hi> living at some Hall in the North of England, and it would be better for me not to have any<lb/>thing to do with him, because he might do mo out of the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to what he said—he showed me the envelope of the letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. John James Whalley is the next-of-kin (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to S. Green Gunnitt, from John James Whalley, Aldringham Hall, near Ottex, acknowledging a letter from Gunnell, and stating that he was very sorry to hear of his uncle's death, and replying to several questions in Gun<lb/>nell's letter as to the family, and stating that his uncle had some illegitimate children by a woman named Priestman</hi>.) The signatures to these two affidavits are Gunnell's and Thomas's. (<hi rend="italic">The first stated that the will was in the same state as when it was found, and the second that the property did not amount to</hi> 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I communicated with John James Whalley in August, 1881, and I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1881, <hi rend="italic">and stated:</hi> "If you have not been served with a copy of the writ at the instance of the late John Whalley, nephew, you will be in a few days; that being so, write me, or, what is better, wire me at once, so that I may put in an appearance for you; be careful and circumspect as to what you say, &amp;c. E. Gunnell.) A few days afterwards I received this telegram from Gunnell, dated 22nd August: "Meet me at Derby station on Tuesday morning, 10.10 train; have the paper you were served with with you." I met Gunnell at 10.10 on 23rd August—I believe it was about a hundred yards from the station, as the train was late, driving up in a Hansom, and went with him to the Midland Hotel, to the smoking room; we were by ourselves—I asked him whether it was true that he had prevented my father transferring 10,000 into Great Western of Canada into my name—he said that it was, and the reason he did so was he thought I was too young to take care of such an amount of money—I told him I had had an interview with young Mr. Whalley the day before, and his solicitor, Mr. Neale, and I</p>

               <p>felt inclined to go on his side, that is, against the will—he said "Why should you do so?"—I said that Mr. Whalley had promised that I should not lose by it, and from what I had heard I thought the whole thing a swindle—he told me to be careful what I was doing, as I might lose everything, and said "If you are not satisfied with what you have got what will you take? say 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "and then he went to 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and just before he left me in the refreshment room in the station he offered me as much as 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he had got sufficient influence over Thomas to induce him to give me that amount—I had not agreed with the next-of-kin at that time; I told Gunnell I should see them that night, and I would write to him—Gunnell went with me to my house in Bateman Street and saw my sister there; that was before the conversation in the refreshment room and after that in the smoking room—he asked me in her presence whether I had got any proposition to make, and told me to be careful not to jump out of the frying-pan into the fire, and not to accept any promise—my sister said she knew that the money was mine—I think Gunnell asked us to consider the matter over again and let him know—we promised to do so by letter—this is a letter of 28th August, 1881, addressed by me. (<hi rend="italic">This was to Gunnell, and stated that the writer had met Whalley, that he seemed to be a gentleman, and that he (Priestman) upheld his determination to assist him in every way in overthrowing his uncle's will, and hoped that Gunnell would not be offended at the course he was taking.</hi>) Torr and Co. were Rayner and Co.'s agents. (<hi rend="italic">The pleadings were here put in of the action of Whalley against Thomas and Gunnell to have the will set aside and intestacy declared, Gunnell and Thomas in their defence setting up the will of the </hi>21<hi rend="italic">st, March</hi>, 1881.) I was present at the trial of that issue on 10th June, 1882, in the Court of Probate, before Sir James Hannen and a Special Jury—before the case came on terms were agreed upon. (<hi rend="italic">The original terms of the compromise in the Probate Court were here read, by which Thomas was to receive</hi> 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">his costs, and the remainder to be divided between Henry Whalley Priestman and the next-of-kin.</hi>) After that compromise the will was proved; I was present then—Nash went into the witness-box and gave formal evidence as to his making the will, and to his and Rees's signing it in the testa<lb/>tor's presence; that they were all present at the same time—by making, I mean that he wrote the will—after the interview between myself and Gunnell in August, 1881, I next saw Gunnell in the spring of the next year at Leominster; Mr. Turner, my solicitor, was with me—I then asked Gunnell whether he had got the blue will that I told him about, leaving me the whole of the property—he laughed in derision, saying he had not seen anything of it, that the one of 21st March was the only one he had seen—he said, as I had my solicitor with me, it was only fair for him to have one, and he asked us to meet him at Mr. Lloyd's—we went there, but Mr. Lloyd refused to hear anything we had got to say—on the 17th June, 1882, about a week after the compromise, we drove to Leominster; Mr. Turner was there, and Mr. Green Smith, the solicitor for young Mr. Whalley—as we drove past Thomas's house on a brake Thomas held up a piece of blue paper at the window, and waved it about; there was some writing on the paper, but being so far off I could not see what it was—it was half folded; it appeared to be a foolscap sheet folded up—This letter is in Gunnell's handwriting—it was produced in the trial before Justice Manisty—Mr. Patchett</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter was from Gunnell to Patchett, August </hi>26<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1882. <hi rend="italic">This stated that he heard it was Patchett's intention to remove Thomas from the station, that he had known him twelve years, and had always found him a most ready and attentive servant, and that general regret would be felt by a large number of the inhabitants if he was removed, and that also a friend of his, Mr. James Whalley, was staying with Thomas, who had gone to great expense in furnishing suitable apartments.</hi>) This letter is also in Gunnell's handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated </hi>21<hi rend="italic">st September</hi>, 1881, <hi rend="italic">to the Chairman and Guardians of the Leominster Union, and was a statement by Gunnell that, hearing that Edward Rees was candidate for the vacant post of relieving officer, he had pleasure in bearing testimony to his ability for the post, and that for many years he had know him as an honest, sober, and most trustworthy man.</hi>) These documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in my father's handwriting—the first time I saw this envelope was this time last year in the Civil Court before Mr. Justice Manisty. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed:</hi> "This is to be opened only by Edward Gunnell, Esq., wine and spirit mer<lb/>chant," <hi rend="italic">there was some name underneath crossed out, and then</hi> "Particulars as to banking accounts, railway and mining shares, as well as the parti<lb/>culars of foreign and other bonds which I hold, will be found in a small book where this is, as well as in a large ledger in one of my trunks.") That is in my father's handwriting; I scarcely know who produced it at the trial—this is signed by Charles Thomas and Edward Gunnell,. (<hi rend="italic">This was an affidavit of </hi>26<hi rend="italic">th February,</hi> 1884<hi rend="italic">, in the High Court of Justice, probate Division, in the action between Priestman and Thomas and Gunnell, in which Thomas and Gunnell swore that no will of Mr. Whalley, either before or after his death, had come to their or their solicitor's know<lb/>ledge save the will of</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st March.</hi>) (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Mr. Gunnell has said to me he has been executor under other wills—This is my father's James Whalley's signature to this will—I saw the white will on the occasion of the officials I believe—Mr. Turner was with me then—I don't think from the beginning of 1882 In saw it till I saw it at the trial before Mr. Justice Manisty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>). I am 24 years old; I have two sisters and the three brothers, all older than myself—I first became acquainted with the fact that I was Mr. Whalley's son in March, 1881; I cannot tell you exactly what he said; he said that I had been in the habit of calling him uncle, and "I may tell you, I may not perhaps have to live much longer, that I am not so," words something like that—that was in his sitting-room at Leominster—nobody else was present—I think that is all I can remember—it was my habit to write to him "My dear father by adoption," after I had learned that he was in fac my father—he had not told me that I was not to expect anything from him at his death—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170122"/>
               <p>told me I could not expect anything if I did not behave myself properly, but so long as I kept myself right I should no doubt come into something. (<hi rend="italic">A letter dated July 28th</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Whalley, was put in and read cautioning the witness to do his duty, and make himself fit for something better by-and-by, as, if not, he must not depend on him. Another letter, of December 28th</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">referred to the misconduct of the sister of witness</hi>)—I knew that, rightly or wrongly, my father was not on good terms with my sister—I once wrote, I think, to my father stating that I did not like my sister being from home when I returned from work—I knew that he had been angry with her—I did not tell her that I had written to my father about her—I was on terms of great affection with my sister—we lived constantly together—before I saw the pocket-book containing the list of securities I knew that my father was rich—I heard him tell Mr. Carr, the stationmaster at Hereford, six or seven years ago, that he intended transferring 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of stock—it was no surprise to me when I saw the list of securities—immediately after my visit I told my sister about the blue will leaving me the whole of the property—I do not think I told my sister about the conversation with my father wherein he told me that he had left me his property subject to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to each of his brothers—I may have told my sister that she was the daughter of Mr. Whalley; I believe she knew it—at that time I knew that he had a very large sum of money to dispose of—after the death I told my sister that I had only got 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mentioned to her that I had seen a will later in date than the one put forward—in the spring of 1882 my sister first told me that she had received the letter of the 19th of April, 1881, from Mr. Whalley—she and I had talked the matter of the will over, but it was not till the spring of 1882 that I first saw the letter—I think it was first shown me by Mr. Turner, my solicitor, at Derby—my sister had told me that she had something important which she would communicate to Mr. Turner, and I therefore wrote to him in March or April, 1882—I did not ask her what it was—she and I had had several conversations—she said she knew the money was mine, and when I asked her how she knew it she replied that she would tell Mr. Turner—it was two or three weeks after that that I first saw the letter—the letter from Thomas enclosed in one from my father was, as near as I can recollect, in these words: "In accordance with Mr. Whalley's request, I write you to say that I duly posted a letter to you a few days ago asking you to come over and see him, as he was very ill, and I cannot understand why you have not got that letter;" or words to that effect—that letter I lost in a bathing-machine on July 2nd, 1881—I threw it in the sea—at that time I had not been to a solicitor—I first saw Mr. Turner in August or September, through an introduction from Mr. J.J. Whalley, the next-of-kin—after the compromise I knew the importance of Thomas having written a letter stating that he had previously sent one which had not been received—I will swear I told my solicitors the way in which I lost the letter—in my affidavit of 7th June, 1883, I may have sworn "that No. 4 in the schedule was last in my possession in April, 1881, when I destroyed the same, thinking it was not, and never would be, of import<lb/>ance"—I will take it that Thomas's letter is the document there referred to—I don't know that it is; there may have been a confusion with regard to it—I destroyed a document of my father's in April, and the two may have got confused—Mr. J.J.

               <p>to me by Mr. Turner, in August, 1881, and we agreed to upset the will of the 21st of March if we could—we had seen a Mr. Neale at that time—there was a bargain between us that in any event I was not to lose my 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the only bargain—we were each to pay our own costs—there was at no time, nor is there now, any agreement in writing—I knew the defence that was raised for me in December, 1881—I remember answering interrogatories in November, 1881, with the advice of my solicitors, to whom I had told every<lb/>thing—I had mentioned to them that I had seen the blue will and read its contents (<hi rend="italic">Portion of affidavit, dated 24th December, 1881, read to the witness</hi>)—at that time I had not heard of the letter my father wrote to my sister—my statement to my solicitor in August, 1881, was taken down in shorthand—I will swear that I then said I had seen the will—I did not remember the names of the attesting witnesses, but only recollected the fact that one held an office—I mentioned it in my first interview with my solicitor in August, 1881, and told him that one of the witnesses occupied the position of registrar of births and deaths—I said I had seen the will at Leominster—my father did not confine himself to any one particular style in writing his letters—I have seen letters of his written close to the left-hand edge—the letter to my sister was submitted to experts in handwriting at the time of the compromise—the late Mr. Chabot was one of the experts, and he gave an opinion in our favour; Mr. Turner told me so—I went several times with Mr. Turner to Hereford, first about March, 1882—I went once to inspect the will about that same month—in my examination in the Chancery proceedings I paid that no one else was present, except my solicitor, when I first examined the will—I did not mean the officials—I did not notice any one in the room—that was about March, 1882—Mr. Turner also examined the will on that occasion—he did not try to find a grease spot on it on that occasion, I swear that—I only saw the will once to see whether the signature was genuine—I did not find any grease spot—it is possible that this might have been in April, 1882—I saw it only once with Mr. Turner for five or ten minutes—it was given to us by one of the officials, on a desk, as far as I remember—I don't think it was near a window, I think it was two yards away—Mr. Turner did not call my attention to any marks on the will—I have been to Hereford two or three times with him, not to inspect the will—about 10 days after the compromise had taken place I had an interview with Mr. Turner at the Oak Hotel, Leominster, about upsetting the compromise—we were at Leominster for no particular purpose; we drove over—I knew Mr. Childs, but I did not know that he was to make an application to the witnesses of the will—I never gave any authority to Mr. Turner to employ him, nor was I aware that he was being employed for upsetting the compromise—I never spoke to Rees or Nash till some time after the compromise, and only to Rees in October, 1882, after he gave his signed statement—I then saw Rees at the Oak in Leominster—I did not know that Childs had been employed to promise a sum of money to Rees and Nash; my solicitor never told me about any such thing—I authorised Mr. Turner to take means for upsetting the compromise if he could; I gave him instructions to that effect—one of my grounds for doing so was that Thomas had waved a piece of blue paper at the window, which I thought was the will I had seen—that was on 17th June, as we were driving past</p>

               <p>the windows in a brake to Hereford—some time in the following week I gave Mr. Turner instructions to upset the compromise, partly on the ground that I had seen Thomas waving the blue paper, and partly from the fact that Mr. Turner had told me that Nash had made a statement to him at Ludlow—I think that it was Joseph Nash who had spoken to him, but I saw some letters from Thomas Nash to Mr. Turner—Mr. Turner said that Thomas Nash had told him how the will was made, and I at once instructed Mr. Turner to get the will set aside—the brown case, or book, my father kept continually in his inside waistcoat pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. Under the will of the 21st March, Gun<lb/>nell was to take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as executor—under the blue will Gunnell was also appointed executor with a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. legacy—as far as my knowledge goes, Mr. Gunnell's interest was the same under both wills—at the interview on the 13th March Mr. Whalley mentioned the name of Gunnell, who, he said, was a man of the world, and the person best known to him in Leominster, and I might apply to him if I wanted any advice—Mr. Whalley did say that he had left 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to each of his brothers, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each to Thomas and Gunnell, and the remainder to myself—he said that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would amply compensate Thomas for his trouble, and Gunnell for being executors—Mr. Whalley said that he had not a large circle of friends in Leominster, and that Mr. Gunnell, who was a thorough man of the world, was the only respectable man he knew in the town—Mr. Gunnell was a party to the compromise, owing to his position of executor—Mr. Gunnell did not receive any benefit from it, except his 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Legacy—since the compromise I have not offered Mr. Gunnell a sum of money, nor instructed my solicitor to make him any such offer—in January, 1883, I was dissatisfied with the compromise; there was never any offer made by my solicitor to Mr. Gunnell—I had an interview with Captain Gunnell on the Sunday after the funeral—I was at that time staying at Gunnell's house—I do not think I told Captain Gunnell of the existence of the blue will—I told him that my father had made one will, and had destroyed it while at the Isle of Man; that Mr. Whalley on one occasion had been angered with me, and that in my presence he put the will into the fire, saying that I should have none of his money—I was then six years old—Mr. Gunnell never referred to these facts subsequently in my presence—I did not tell him that after all I ought to think myself lucky in getting 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and it was very funny I should be left that amount—nothing of the sort—I cannot say when Mr. Gunnell became acquainted with the facts of the dispute between my father and sister—I had no conversation with him about it when I was staying in his house—I believe Mr. Whalley was very ill in March—I think I explained to Mr. Gunnell the reason I did not go to him then, after the funeral, or it may have been before—my father allowed me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I supported my sister—my salary on the railway varied; 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we supported ourselves on that and what we had saved—I can't tell you the exact amount of that; per<lb/>haps 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. perhaps—I can't say whether Mr. Gunnell knew that my father was allowing me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I first made Mr. Gunnell's acquaintance at the time of my visit in March, 1881—I believe he was a person of position in Leominster—I knew he had been Mayor—he is a wine merchant, and has been for some time; I cannot tell how long—Mr. Whalley did not appear to be on very friendly terms with him because he made a remark to me, when Mr. Gunnell had gone out: "I</p>

               <p>wish these people would not come bothering me so much, I can do with<lb/>out them, "referring to Mr. Gunnell and another lot of visitors, three of them—one was a Mr. Dunkald, and young Mr. Gunnell—his expression was something rather stronger than that—I suggested to Mr. Whalley that Mr. Gunnell should write letters for him, for this reason, that Mr. Gunnell knew Thomas more than they knew Mr. Whalley, and I did not know anybody else in Leominster besides them—that was a sufficient reason why I should refer to them—I heard that in August, 1880, Thomas was at Helsby—I heard a letter read of 26th August from Gun<lb/>nell—Mr. Whalley never told me that he wished Thomas to return—I think he remarked that his associates at the station were rather pleased that he had gone, on account of his appropriating the <hi rend="italic">tips</hi> from passengers—I do not know that numerous requests were made by different persons in the neighbourhood that Thomas should return to Leominster—on 13th March the little black book was shown to me—this is the one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the same book that was afterwards produced at Mr. Lloyd's office—on 16th April I saw the ledger out of which the blue will was taken—that ledger was also produced at Mr. Lloyd's office—on Monday, 8th May, Thomas told me that Gunnell had the care of the packets and the will—I do not know that at that time the will was in Mr. Lloyd's office—it was on Thursday, the 12th, that I went to Mr. Lloyd's office—Mr. Gunnell suggested to me that I should go there in order to look over the securities—the interview at Mr. Lloyd's office was two hours, I should think that time was spent in examining the securities alone; I mean by "alone" that there was nothing else there, the time was occupied in examining the securities—I said yesterday that some time before that Mr. Gunnell told me it would be unnecessary for me to prove—I still adhere to that statement—I could not say whether that remark was made by Mr. Lloyd—Mr. Lloyd did not say "As you reside at Derby, it will be unnecessary for you to prove, because it will save trouble"—Mr. Gunnell told me so—Thomas was present at that interview—I don't know Mr. Cassell, a clerk of Mr. Lloyd's, he did not come in—I have never seen him—the ledger was not checked with the black book; it was done in this way: Mr. Gunnell read out the securities from the bonds, such as were payable to bearer, in the ledger, and they were copied down by Mr. Lloyd, senior, and the valuation made there by one of those slips that are issued giving the current prices of stocks, shares, and so on—I don't think the black book was also compared and checked with the list in the ledger, I have no remembrance of such a thing happening—when I went to Leominster I saw Mr. Gunnell, and the letter from the next-of-kin was referred to, the Green Gullett letter, which Mr. Gunnell said he would not read to me, because it referred to the relations of my mother, Thomas was present, no one else—Capt. Gunnell was not there—I do not think that at that interview I said "What can they do? he did not like his brothers, and would not leave anything to them"—I may have said "What can they do?" but not the rest, or "They cannot do anything, the will is all right and straight, I know"—I did not say any<lb/>thing of that sort—after the interview with Gunnell at the Midland Hotel, Derby, I saw Mr. James Whalley, the same evening—it was in consequence of that interview I wrote the letter of 28th August to Gunnell—I said in that letter, "He seems to be in every respect a perfect gentleman"—it was owing to my interview with Mr. James Whalley that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170126"/>
               <p>I took the side of the next-of-kin—Mr. Whalley said that I should not lose my 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the first time that offer was made me, I am certain of that—there can be no mistake whatever about it—he did not mention any sum at all then, but he said in my second interview with him that I should have the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in any event—I was with him for the first time on 22nd August, that was the day before I saw Gunnell—I did not see Mr. Whalley owing to an interview with Mr. Neale, I saw them both together, they called on me together—I saw Mr. Whalley alone on the 21st, that was not owing to information given by Mr. Neale, I saw him by an appointment made the previous night—Mr. Neale told me that Gunnell had prevented my father transferring 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that more than anything else I think set me against them—I said in the Queen's Bench something about Mr. Whalley promising me that I should be safe, and that I told Mr. Gunnell from what I had heard the will was a swindle—I believe I said so before the Magistrate; if I did not, I suppose I was not asked—at the time of my interview with Mr. Gunnell, on the 23rd, we were not on unfriendly terms—up to that time he was a friend—I believe he was also a friend of Thomas—if the next-of-kin had succeeded, and there had been an intestacy, I should have got nothing, and Thomas would have got nothing—I can't say that I was ever on very friendly terms with Thomas—I was certainly not on sufficiently friendly terms with him to have entered into an arrangement with him such as I did with Mr. Whalley—under the compromise allowed by the Probate Court I dare say I should have received very nearly the same amount as Mr. Gunnell suggested—I never saw or heard of him after that time, the offer was never repeated—he never told me the contents of the will of 21st March before the funeral, I swear that—I went to hear the will read, expecting to receive a large sum of money—the first time it was read I was completely dumbfounded, I could not say a word; that is my explanation—when it was read the second time I said "Astonishing." <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it, if this was the first time you thought you had been deprived of this large sum of money, that you did not get up immediately and say there was another will?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really could not speak at the time—I remained in the room two or three minutes afterwards; I was speech<lb/>less all that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the time I wrote the letter of 28th January, 1879, to my father about my sister, I was about 18 or 19—it was written entirely in a temper, on the spur of the moment—my sister continued to live with me after that, and I to support her, having, in addition to what I made, only the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year that my father sent me—I never saw any of the experts; I left that entirely to my solicitor, and anything I know about it was information I got from him—after the compromise I and Mr. Turner went together to Leominster for a week-end, from Saturday to Monday—that was for pleasure entirely—we drove over in a brake from Hereford; a four-in-hand—we remained in Leominster saw few hours—it was as we were driving back to Hereford that I saw Thomas at the win<lb/>dow waving a blue paper—it was waved in an insulting fashion, I thought; a sort of exulting over us; in a sort of triumph; something like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), close to the window—it struck me as being like the blue will I had seen in April—upon that a conversation took place between myself and Mr. Turner—I first heard of the interview that had taken place between Mr. Turner and Joe Nash, a brother of the prisoner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170127"/>
               <p>on the Saturday to Monday occasion—I think Mr. Turner showed me the letters he received from the prisoner Nash; I believe I saw two—I can't say whether both were from the prisoner or whether there was one from each of the Nash's—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the letters—I did not notice the Christian name on either.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to the last witness, and am some years older than he—my brother and I lived with Mr. Whalley at Shrewsbury and Hereford—when he went to live at Leominster we did not continue to live with him—after my brother returned from his visit to Mr. Whalley in April he told me something—I received the letter produced from Mr. Whalley, dated April 19, 1881. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "April 19th, 1881. J. Whalley to E. Priestman. As I am not sure your brother will tell you, I have resolved to do so myself, so that you may hear it from me, and that there may be no envy between you in future life. I have been very ill, and, in fact, almost dead, and I have just settled my affairs. As I find my brothers are dead, I have now left Harry everything, and you nothing, as I believe you have deceived me, and not acted as you represented when you took the oath, which I still have under 'lock and key. You have no one to blame but yourself. I do not wish to rake up old stories, but all I wish is to show you what you are, and what you might have been, if you had taken my advice, and been a modest, prudent woman. I would say more, but for the burden of writing this. J.W.") I locked it in my desk—I did not show it to my brother or any one—I locked it up because I did not wish any one to see it—I am not aware that any one knew about the oath referred to in the letter except Mr. Whalley—my brother at that time (1867) was only seven and I was 16—in the first week of May, 1882, I first showed the letter to Mr. Turner, my brother's solicitor—I gave it to him, and it remained in his custody until the trial—I destroyed the envelope—I did so from habit; I never keep them—I recollect, in August, 1881, Mr. Gunnell coming to Derby, to the house where my brother and I lived—he came with my brother—almost his first words to my brother were "Have you any proposition to make?"—my brother replied that he had not, but if he should alter his mind he would let Mr. Gunnell know—in talking about the will I said I knew the money was my brother's—Gunnell said "Yes, I know it is"—nothing more of any importance passed—I did take an oath in the pre<lb/>sence of Mr. Whalley at the time mentioned in the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ANDERSON</hi>. In April, 1881, I was living at Bateman Street, Derby, with my brother—with the exception of this letter, I had not received a letter from my father for about four years—this is the only letter of his that I have kept—I kept this one because I thought it was such a singular letter, and I was surprised to receive it—the suggestions in the letter in reference to my conduct were not true—I did not write back to my father because I was angry—I thought he bad no just cause for forming that judgment of me—my brother and I had always lived on terms of friendship, and I suppose he knew that the reflections upon me were untrue—I remember some of the litigation about the will, and my brother spoke to me about it at times—I knew it was excessively important that he should show that his father had made a will in his favour, and that the letter which I had received consequently became very important—in March, 1882, Mr. Turner called to take down my evidence about Mr. Gunnell's visit—my brother was present, and on</p>

I live at 126, South Street, Leominster, next door to Thomas's house—my father is a farmer—I was Sub-Surveyor of High<lb/>ways from November, 1880, to September, 1883—in 1880 I was acquainted with Thomas—I first spoke to him in November, 1880—he was not then in any employment, but at about Christmas that year he became Sub-Inspector of Nuisances—I knew Mr. Whalley, who was living with Thomas, by sight, and passed the time of day to him; nothing more—Thomas came to me on two occasions in 1881—in the early part of April he fetched me from my father-in-law's, and I went to his house, where I saw Mr. Moyle, the then registrar of births, and Mr. Whalley—that was somewhere about five in the evening—Thomas told Mr. Whalley that I had come—Mr. Whalley said he was sorry to trouble us, but he wished Mr. Moyle and myself to witness his will, as he had been making some alterations in consequence of something he had heard—there was a blue paper with some writing upon it lying on a small desk—it was about a foot by nine inches; I don't exactly recollect the size—Mr. Whalley sat down and signed it on the right hand side in our presence, and passed it to Mr. Moyle, who, before he signed it, read it, but Mr. Whalley told him that it was only the attestation clause he was reading—Mr. Moyle then signed it and passed it to me, and I signed it also—in passing it to Mr. Moyle Mr. Whalley said it was not bad handwriting for an old man of his age, that his hand was getting rather shaky—it was a blue paper; neither of us read it—I signed my name and address, and "assistant surveyor"—Mr. Moyle signed it as registrar of births and deaths—we signed under Mr. Whalley's name, opposite the attestation clause, at the side—Mr. Whalley told Moyle to never mind reading it—this was in the front sitting room on the ground floor—Thomas was not present while this was taking place—after we came out Thomas wanted to know what we had been doing, and I told him we had been witnessing a will for Mr. Whalley—Thomas wanted to know the particulars, and what was in it, but I could not tell him—previously, on the 21st March, Thomas left a message for me to go to his house to sit with Mr. Whalley while he had some rest—I went to his house a little after six in the evening—Thomas's mother let me in, and I found Thomas in the house—he asked me if I would stay to mind the door, as his mother was going to sit with Mr. Whalley and he</p>

               <p>wanted to go into the town—I told him that I would do so, and he went down the town, returning twenty minutes afterwards with Nash, whom I had only known by sight and not to speak to—when they came back I was in the kitchen—Thomas asked Nash to sit down, and he did so—that was at the time Thomas's wife was in her confinement—Thomas then went into Mr. Whalley's sitting-room and brought out some papers in his hand, and on one was Mr. Whalley's signature, and as he brought them into the kitchen he said, "I have got it all light"—he put them on the table—among the papers were some with writing on, which he had in his hand, and some with no writing at all—he said to Nash that he wanted him to copy in the writing that was on one of the pieces of paper, the writing above Mr. Whalley's signature—the piece of paper was blank and with Mr. Whalley's signature, containing only the signature and the date underneath—that was a whitish coloured paper, about 10 inches by 6 or 8, I could not say to an inch or two—the signature was not far from the centre of the paper, it may be a little below the centre—Nash then proceeded to copy the paper out—first of all he counted the lines above Mr. Whalley's signature, and then proceeded to copy it out on a blank piece of paper with the same number of lines—there were lines on the paper containing Mr. Whalley's signature—I could not say what sort of lines, I do not know whether they were blue or red—he then copied about the same number of lines on another piece of paper that there was no writing at all on, and then commenced copying from the paper that Thomas had brought, on to the blank piece of paper—there were three pieces of paper, one with Mr. Whalley's signature on it and nothing else, another with writing on, and another with no writing at all—I believe there were two or three papers with no writing at all on—I believe he copied it twice on to blank paper, if not more—then he commenced to fill it in above Mr. Whalley's signature in the paper that contained Mr. Whalley's signature alone—when Nash was engaged in that employment I believe he said something about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Thomas told him to go on, never mind, it would not be more than Mr. Whalley was worth, or something like that—he finished filling it in, and then Thomas asked Nash and myself if we would sign our names to it, adding that if we would do so he would give us 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and we signed our names near the bottom of the paper on the right-hand side, about three parts of the way down, or something near it—so far as I recollect I signed myself "Edward Rees, 176, South Street, Leominster," and Nash signed, "William Nash, dyer, Burgess Street, Leominster," I think—I did not read what was written by Nash—after signing Thomas asked us if we would go up and see Mr. Whalley upstairs in the bedroom, and then we could say we had seen him—we did go up and see him—I did not go into the room, I went on to the landing—Nash was just inside the door, Mr. Whalley's bed being immediately opposite the door—Thomas stood between Nash and myself—Thomas's mother was in Mr. Whalley's bedroom at this time—Nash asked Mr. Whalley how he was—he said, "Very bad"—Nash afterwards asked him if he would like to have a fish—he said "No"—I saw Mr. Whalley in his bed; he was propped up in a sitting position—he seemed to speak with great hardship—we then returned downstairs, and Thomas asked us to sit down a moment, as he expected the doctor—we sat down, and shortly after Dr. Barnett came—he went upstairs to see Mr. Whalley and returned with Thomas—I believe Thomas took him upstairs—when</p>

               <p>they came down Thomas asked Mr. Barnett how Mr. Whalley was—he replied, "Very ill indeed, but slightly better than yesterday"—the doctor then left; I also left—this (<hi rend="italic">The alleged will</hi>) is the document that was prepared by Nash on 21st March—this is my signature at the bottom, and is the one I signed on that occasion—after this transaction I saw Thomas from time to time, and also Mr. Whalley on several occasions, and I spoke to him during the month of April—I remember the day of his death—when I returned home from my journey about half-past 2 Thomas was in his garden, he called and told me of his death—Thomas also said he had made use of that paper which Nash and I had signed—I said I wished he had not done so—Thomas said I should have to stick to it, as Gunnell had taken it away, and that as long as I had put my name to it I should have to stick to it—I don't recollect anything more being said than that I wished he had not done so—I believe I saw Thomas most of that evening, he was about there—Thomas said that when Mr. Whalley died he (<hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>) had just time to take his right will out and put this in its place—he said he had found the will in an envelope in Mr. Whalley's waistcoat pocket, and steamed it open in the steam of a kettle, and substituted the one for the other before Mr. Gunnell came, and that Gunnell had been there and taken it away, and took some securities with it, I believe—I had further conversations with him about this matter on several occasions—Thomas said that the envelope was addressed, "To be opened by Mr. Gunnell or Mr. Priest<lb/>man," and that Gunnell had taken the envelope, crossing out Priestman's name so that he (<hi rend="italic">Gunnell</hi>) should have the sole control over it, and that if any one asked about the difference of the ink Gunnell was going to account for it by saying that Mr. Whalley had done it in Gunnell's office—he did not tell me where it was done—Thomas told me about Gunnell receiving a letter by mistake which should have gone to Mr. Green Smith, a solicitor at Leominster, and that the next-of-kin were going to take proceedings, and that if any of them came to me I was not to have anything to say to them—I asked Thomas, I could not say when, what he had done with the genuine will, and he said he had placed it in a jar in the cellar for safe keeping, and had afterwards broken the jar and burnt the will lest any one should find it—that was some time before the compromise—on one occasion after proceedings had been taken Thomas came and told me to go to Mr. Lloyd's and to make it appear that the first will was made last, to put the wills contrary, and that I had seen Mr. Whalley sign it in our presence; several things of that sort—I went to Mr. Lloyd's and made a communication to him—I and Thomas met frequently on our travels and on other occasions—we lived next door, and had many conversations on the matter—on one occasion Thomas said that he had destroyed the will, so that if any one searched the house it should not be found—he said that such things were of common occurrence, and that Gunnell had told him of one case where a doctor and a lawyer had signed a will with a dead man's hand—I recollect nothing more about that; he' was talking about this case, I suppose—I saw Mr. Lloyd twice I believe; I remember two occa<lb/>sions—I remember going to Hereford with him and Nash to see if it was the paper that Nash and I had signed; we saw it—Nash looked at it, and I recognised my signature—nothing further was done—Thomas said that Nash was going to say that Mr. Whalley had met with him down by</p>

He would give 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—immediately before the compromise Thomas said that if I would only stick to him he would give me 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would not be particular to a few hundreds more if he got the money all right—Thomas said soon after Mr. Whalley's death, before I heard any talk of proceed<lb/>ings, that Gunnell had said there was nothing like getting the transfers done as soon as possible, so that if they got it in Thomas's name it would be nine-tenths of the battle—I remember on 10th June, 1882, the day of the compromise, going from the Strand to Westminster, where the trial took place, with Thomas alone—he asked me how it was to be; I said I did not know, I might tell the truth if put in the witness box—he wanted me to go and have something to drink and I refused—I was in Court when the compromise was arrived at; I was not called as a witness, Nash was, and Thomas and Gunnell were present in Court at the time, I believe—I saw Nash in the box and the will produced—after the com<lb/>promise we all returned to Leominster—nine days or a fortnight after<lb/>wards I saw Thomas—I said both myself and Nash wanted to know what he intended doing with reference to the promise, and he said that I did not deserve any, and that he would only give 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I did not like that I could go without any—I told him no, I should not accept anything of the sort—on one occasion, I don't know if it was the first interview, Nash and I wanted to know what he meant to do about the money he had promised—he said we seemed very fast after our money and he intended giving us 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if we did not like that we could go without any—I told him perhaps he would be sorry for it some day—on the other occasion he told us to go to hell if we liked—he said it was on the letter of Miss Priestman's he had had to compromise the matter, but that he would not have accepted the compromise if I had told him I would have gone into the box for him—Thomas had first said he would not give securities, and then afterwards agreed that he would do so—he asked me on one occasion if I would prepare two forms of securities for him to sign, and he would sign them—I prepared these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and then afterwards he refused to sign them—Thomas came to our house, I produced them, and he said he would not sign them; he had found out that Nash was in communication with Mr. Turner—I believe he mentioned that Nash had communicated with Turner. (<hi rend="italic">The security was written on paper headed "Leominster Highway District" dated July 19, 1882, and was:</hi> "7 days after date pay to my order the sum of £8.<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for value received (signed) C.D.," <hi rend="italic">and across it was written:</hi> "Accepted payable at the Worcester City and County Bank." <hi rend="italic">The other was an authority to the Manager of the County Bank, Leominster, to pay Edward Bees</hi> £8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the amount for which an acceptance, dated</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1882, <hi rend="italic">had hen given him.</hi>)—Thomas banks at the Worcester City and County Bank—some time after Whalley's death I recollect Thomas and I meeting Gun<lb/>nell, and Thomas introduced me to Gunnell—he said "This is Mr. Bees, the man who signed the will of Mr. Whalley's"—Gunnell said he had often seen me, but had never known me before, and that it was a good thing for me that I had done so—I remember a furniture sale at the Corn</p>

               <p>Exchange, Old Leominster; I could not say exactly how long before the compromise, I should say quite a month—I saw Gunnell there; he called me on one side and said he wanted to speak to me, and then he said he wanted me to be particular as to one point, and that was to be particular as to my seeing Mr. Whalley sign his will and Mr. Whalley seeing me sign also—on many occasions he mentioned this signing—he said it was a good thing I had come to Leominster and signed that will, that I could buy a larger house, and should be in better circumstances—just after the compromise I recollect being sent for to Gunnell's on one occasion by Nash or Thomas, I don't know which—I went and met Gunnell just out<lb/>side his office door—Gunnell said "I suppose you are expecting some<lb/>thing out of this case," and asked me if 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do—I said "I don't know so much about that"—he said "You leave it to me, I will see you all right then"—shortly after the compromise I went to Gunnell's office again; he went to his safe and brought out a blank folded cheque on the Worcester Bank, signed by Thomas and Gunnell, and payable to Nash, myself, and Gunnell; he said "You see I provided for you all right before, but now the compromise is arrived at the cheque is useless"—I think that would be within a week, or about a week, after the compro<lb/>mise—a few days after I was sent for by some one, I don't recollect who, and I went again and saw Gunnell—on that occasion Gunnell pro<lb/>duced another cheque, filled in for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Nash and myself, and signed by Thomas—he wanted me to endorse it, and said he would get Nash to do the same, and then he would draw the money from the bank—I refused to endorse it—a few days afterwards I saw Gunnell again at his bar in High Street, where he sells his wine—I told Gunnell on that occasion that I had never seen Mr. Whalley sign the will, and that the thing was a forgery, and that Thomas had promised me 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to swear that which was not true, and that I intended to expose the whole thing—Gunnell cautioned me, saying that it was very dangerous ground I was going upon—Thomas came in, and Gunnell told him what had taken place—he said it was a lie—I said it was not, and then left, and met Matthews, a labourer, going in—Gunnell had said that the first cheque was useless as Priestman was to act as executor under the compromise—in the latter part of July, 1882, Nash told me that Mr. Turner wanted to see me, and had made arrangements for me to meet him to-morrow—Nash said he intended to expose the whole thing so long as Thomas behaved so shabbily; but he would not tell Mr. Turner anything unless I was present—I subsequently saw Mr. Turner at Ludlow twice—afterwards I saw Thomas, who said that if we would have nothing to do with Mr. Turner he would give security for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Worcester Bank, and that Nash had already accepted it; Mr. Bowen, the bank manager, was to have the security—I refused to do so—I knew that Nash had told Mr. Turner particulars of the case, and I intended to follow it on—Thomas said "You can do as you like; don't make a fool of yourself, we are three to one"—he knew I had made a statement to Mr. Lloyd—about 10th or 12th August I asked Tho<lb/>mas what he intended to do with respect to the 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had promised—he was in his garden, which is next door to mine, and we were in the habit of talking over the fence—he said he would do the same with me as he had done with Nash, giving me security from the bank 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I should not accept it, he having acted in the way he had done, and I believe I said I should tell Mr. Turner—he said I might tell him what I liked</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. In September, 1880, I was in respectable employment in Leominster under the Highway Board—I was bound to have a respectable character to get there—I was not particularly intimate with Mr. Thomas up to April, but when he obtained the appointment of museum inspector we became more intimate—we had never spoken till November—on the occasion of the forging of the will I did not know what a will was; to the best of my knowledge I had never seen one—I did not think whether it was an honest or a dishonest trans<lb/>action—I did not ask why I was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for signing my name—I now know it to be a forgery—I have come to the conclusion that Thomas asked me to sign my name thinking I was a stranger just come from the country and knowing nothing of such things.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H GIFFARD</hi>. I saw Mr. Lloyd in August following—I know I told him some lies, statements that I now swear to be lies—I don't recol<lb/>lect whether I told him that Mr. Whalley had the will in his hand; I said that he asked me to sign it, and I gave a particular account of what had taken place in his presence—I went to Mr. Lloyd twice to give parti<lb/>culars—I was in the Probate Court when the will was proved, and heard. Nash swear to it—that according to me was perjury—I told what I now say is the truth because I was sorry for what I had done, and because Nash had told the whole story to Mr. Turner—I cannot say the date that Nash told me to go to Mr. Turner—I had asked Thomas for the securities he had promised, and he said he would give them me another time, and once he told me I might go to the devil—it was after that that I made the statement to Turner—I did not tell Thomas that unless he gave me money I would state something that would upset the will—the com<lb/>promise was on 10th June, and I believe I first communicated with Turner or Child at the latter part of July—neither Pritchard, Child, or any one made me any offer of advantage, money or money's worth, to tell such a story as I have now told—I never san a form of this sort, "I hereby authorise you to pay to Thomas Rees the sum of blank, &amp;c."—on one or two occasions I had a conversation with him—he told me Mr. Turener had understood that Thomas had promised us large sums of money, and if we had any securities he would take them to Thomas and see whether he could not stoop it out of Thomas's 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have a brother-in-law named Dowding; I did not know that he was in communication with Mr. Child, or that he brought any message from Mr. Child—I cannot recol<lb/>lect all that passed, and I have no knowledge of it—I believe Mr. Child mentioned 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me; I cannot say when, but it was between June and October—Child must have said it to me first—I can't say whether I</p>

               <p>told Mr. Child before September 5th that I wanted 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that if I got it I would make a written confession and sign it, I think not—I did not mention 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was telling me what he had heard I was pro<lb/>mised, and asking me if it was so—I cannot say what answer I made—I did say in an affidavit that I made the statement without hope of fee or reward—Mr. Turner told me that they had a very strong case against the will, and that it might be a very serious thing for me if they proceeded without me—I first told Mr. Turner what Nash had told me some time in July when I asked for the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Turner knew from Nash that the letter had been used for the purpose of writing a will over the signature of Mr. Whalley—there was bad feeling between me and Thomas, showing that he did not care about me, and he insulted me in the March following—there was not bad feeling between us particularly till I made the affidavit at the end of October or the beginning of Novem<lb/>ber—I don't remember Child telling me Mr. Turner had been in Scotland, and had some valuable information, as Mr. Whalley had some friends there—I had not several appointments with Mr. Child about the end of September which I failed to keep—I say I had none—I remember an appointment for myself and brother-in-law to meet on 14th October at the London Road, Manchester, at 8.10.</p>

I have not asked Mr. Gunnell for money or securities for money—I know John William Davis, of Leominster, and Mr. Cane, who lives near there, and Mr. Bassett, a miller, and Mr. Robert Hill, of Hyde Ash—I have not spoken to Mr. Bassett or Mr. Hill about the making of the will—I have spoken to the others about the will of March 21st—in speaking to them I adhered to the statement that the will of March 21 was the true will; that was before the compromise—Thomas said if any inquiries were made by the next-of-kin he was going to explain the matter by the difference in the inks—I believe I have heard him say in Mr. Justice Manisty's Court that the handwriting was erased by Mr. Whalley in his office, but except in Court I have not heard Gunnell make that statement—he did not go into the box at the time of the compromise—I have seen Mr. Lloyd several times at his office in reference to the matter, but have not asked him for or to obtain for me money or security for money—he did not say to me on July 10th, 1882, "Get out of my office, if you have no regard for your own honour, have some for mine"—the two interviews I have named with Gunnell in his office were the only ones at which money or security was offered; the first was at the end of July or early in August—he then produced a cheque on the Worcester City and County Bank—I don't know, but I believe that was the bank where the executors opened an account—it was signed by Gunnell and Thomas, it was not crossed—I did not say at that interview to Gunnell "If I cannot get any money off" Thomas I will have it off Turner," or "I want to take a farm and I must have money" I am sure I never said "I do not mind if I get 15 years for it"—nothing of the kind took place—the second interview was, I believe, in the end of July—the cheque was then filled in for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not crossed—I don't know that I wanted money at that time, but I asked for the money Thomas had promised—I refused to endorse the cheque, as Gunnell wanted to draw the money in his hands—I did not ask him to allow me to cash it—I don't know that I was in a hurry, but it is so long since—there was no quarrelling—I did not say to Gunnell "If I can't have the</p>

               <p>that—I met a brother-in-law of Rees at Crewe, along with Mr. Pritchard, and I sent a communication through Pritchard to Thomas Nash; that was after I had been in Leominster with the brake, and after the letter of 5th July—in consequence of that letter of 5th July I met Thomas Nash in Shrewsbury, at the George Hotel—I spoke to him about what his brother had said—I said his brother thought he had some money coming from Thomas, and he said he had, and he said that he was afraid Thomas was going to do him out of this money, not going to pay him, and he said was it true what I had said to his brother Joe, and I said it would depend—I said "You have some thousands to draw from Thomas"—he said "Yes"—I said "Your brother says 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "That is so"—I said "Your brother said he is for doing you out of it"—he said "I think he is; he has been treating me very shabbily in London; I have come to see whether you will stop it me out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that is coming to Thomas under the compromise; my brother said you will do"—under the compromise Priestman Was an executor, and admitted the Probate as well as the others, so that the money could not pass without his being a party to it—Thomas had 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to draw under the compromise, and Nash wanted to know whether I would stop the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he was to have from Thomas out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said that would depend upon the security or authority that he brought me; I said that if Thomas owed him or had promised him 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would bring me sufficient authority from Thomas to say that I might pay him out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would see if I could do so; I said "Have you any security? what hold have you on Thomas for the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" and he said he had not any security, but the money was as much his as Thomas's; I asked him how that was, he was not mentioned in the will; he said "It does not matter," or words to that effect; "the money is as much mine as his, it is a swindle"—I got some paper to reduce the statement into writing—he told me the same statement that he had made in the Probate Court, about the making of the will as if the will had been made in proper style and order, and as if Mr. Whalley had made the will under the ordinary circumstances; he said that on the 21st March he made this will for Mr. Whalley, and that he and Rees witnessed it for Mr. Whalley—I said "But there was no swindle about this, Nash"—I was expecting every minute that he would have told me something—I said "He has no reason to give you 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this"—he said "It is no use; I need not tell you, but I will tell you, and he burst out laughing: "that was the tale I told in the Probate Court; it passed muster there, what do you think of it?"—"Well" I said, "you weren't cross-examined"—I tore up the statement that I had written down, and threw it in the fire—we then went from the hotel for a walk in the Quarry, a little park at Shrewsbury; I there pressed him to tell me what the swindle was; he said "Practice makes perfect, I will tell you when I bring Rees, I won't tell you now"—he said Gunnell and Thomas would secure Rees, and he would tell nothing till he brought Rees, that he had been in the witness-box and sworn it was a genuine will, and he would not detail how it was done till Rees was there—that he would bring Rees in a day or two to meet me, and I was to stay in the neighbourhood—I believe he said Rees could not get off his work that day, or he would have come with him—I think the interview at the George, Shrewsbury, was on 8th July; the letter was on Saturday, 5th, I got it on the Monday, 7th, and this was the day following—I can give you the exact date from the</p>

               <p>hotel bill—I said, "Is the will a forgery?" and he said "Oh, no, it is not a forgery, it was not done in that way"—I don't think anything more of importance passed then, he promised to bring Bees and we were to have another interview—I believe I gave him half a sovereign for his fare or something like that on that occasion, beyond that I did not give him a farthing—Rees did not come to me the next day—I next saw Thomas Nash at Wolferton, I think, a few miles from Ludlow and five or seven from Leominster, at the Solway Arms; I think that was 11th July, I can't say from memory—Child, the Hereford stationmaster, came with Nash—I dare say letters had passed between me and Child between the 7th and 11th—I would not like to say they had not—there had been some communications between Child, Pritchard, and myself; I had seen Mr. Pritchard at Shrewsbury—Child said when he came with Nash, "I have brought Nash and he has resolved to make," I think he said, "a clean split of it, to throw himself unreservedly in your hands, he will tell you all about it"—Mr. Pritchard at that moment, I think, came to the door of the room and joined them; Nash said "Not quite so, in reply to what Child has said I will see Mr. Turner alone," and he asked that Pritchard and Child would leave the room—I asked them to do so, and they accordingly left the room—when Nash and I were left alone in this room at the Solway Arms, Nash said it was a serious case, and he did not want any one to hear our conversation, and he looked under the table, which had a cloth on it, and looked behind the fire screen at the other end of the room to assure himself no one was in the room—when he had assured himself that he was alone with me in the room, he said he had been deceived by Thomas, and he had been in very straightened circumstances, and had a large family, and he had fallen into temptation—I pressed him then as to how it was done—he said that on the 21st of March, the date of the alleged will, Mr. Whalley was very ill in bed, and wanted Mr. Priestman to come and see him, and he told Thomas to write for him; that Thomas accordingly wrote for Mr. Priestman a letter in pencil, and took it to Mr. Whalley, in bed, to sign, and gave him a pen, and Mr. Whalley wrote his name in ink, and seeing that the date was not in, put the date under the signature, March 21st, 1881; Whalley, seeing the letter was in pencil, asked where the pencil was before he signed it; Thomas said "Here is a pen, the point is broken," and the old man took the pen and wrote his name; that Nash and he afterwards took the pencil letter with the ink signature downstairs and rubbed out the pencil writing above the signature—I asked him what he had rubbed it out with, and he pulled out of his pocket a small piece of indiarubber, and said "With this"—I saw that the piece of indiarubber was new, and said "You don't mean to say with that actual piece," and he said "No, of course not, but a piece like this"—he said they got some paper with similar lines and size to this one that had the signature on, and had been the pencil letter, and that he and Thomas began drafting out forms of wills;. that when they had got one that they thought would about fit in above the signature, he (Nash) began filling it in on the top of the paper with the signature on it, and that when he got a few lines down the paper he was spreading it out too much, and he consequently had to cramp it a little in the centre; I think two lines—he said "Have you noticed the two lines a few lines from the top, about the centre?"—he said he was over-running his tether,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170140"/>
               <p>and spreading out the writing, and he asked if I or the solicitor repre<lb/>senting the Whalleys had noticed the cramping, and I said "No"—he said "No; well, we were afraid that you would notice it;" that he was to have for filling it in and attesting it 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Thomas—he said after they filled in this will they got Rees to sign his name as an attesting witness along with Nash, and I asked him what Rees was to have, and he said he was promised 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said would I pay him out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the money was as much his as Thomas's, and if I did so Thomas would not object, but if he did object he never durst inquire into it—I asked him what proof there was that his statement now was true, and he said that if I looked at the will I should see the cramping—I said well, I could not pay him on a statement like that, but that he must get me some authority from Thomas, and that I would see what could be done—I think he said there was some grease on the table that got on the paper at the time, some small slight grease he said there was somewhere about it—I don't think he mentioned particularly when the filling-in was done, but from what he said I understood it was on 21st March or about that time—I believe it was all on the same day—I asked him if it was true, and he said it was—I said it was an extraordinary statement; it had best be put in writing—he said he should not put it in writing without I gave him the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather stopped the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I should like to see Rees, and hear what Rees had to say—he said Rees could confirm his statement, and he said he would bring Rees some day—on another occasion he brought Rees—on this day Nash and I were alone; it was before tea; I think Child went back—I said to Pritchard at the door, when Nash was in the room, "Don't go away; I shall want to see you after I have seen Nash"—Pritchard returned—I think I had tea alone with Nash—I don't think Pritchard was there then—he returned in about an hour after the interview commenced—I think we were about an hour talking it over, and then Pritchard stopped a few minutes I think, and then went away, and then I think Nash and I had tea by ourselves—Priestman returned to Leominster, I think—Nash went back, I think, and I stayed the night at Ludlow—he said if I would pay him the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would make an affidavit of the fact, and then he said Thomas could not dispute it; that would verify it at once—he called "If you will stop the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will make an affidavit of it, and then if Thomas says anything about it you can show it him—the next day I was at Ludlow, I think I saw Nash and Rees; I think that would be 12th July—this was at the Feathers Hotel, where Nash and Rees came together to me—it was a very short interview; I think Nash introduced me to Rees—I don't think I had spoken to Rees only on one occasion before, and we were strangers I might say—I said "Well, Rees, is it true you have 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to come to you out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "Nash said you are going to stop his, will you do mine at the same time; will you stop my 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said "Have you any security or anything to show what was the hold you have on Thomas for the money?"—he said he had no security or authority from Thomas—Nash was present at the time; I said "You had best see Thomas and get a written authority from him, and then I will see what it is when you bring it to me"—I wanted to get a written statement from him—he said "Yes, I will, and I will see you again in a few days"—I think that was the last interview I had with Nash, although I have seen him casually—I saw Rees again at Ludlow</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170141"/>
               <p>and on several occasions—on one occasion I saw him there with Child and Dowding, Rees's brother-in-law—I went for a walk with Rees towards the Castle, that would be July or the beginning of August, I think—Rees's statement to me as to the circumstances of making the will was reduced into an affidavit Rees made—I took the statement down in October, that was the first detailed statement he made that I got in writing—Rees gave me no detailed statement before October; I made one to Rees—I went to Rees's house on 12th August—Rees was not in then—the door was open, I stepped inside and took a seat—Rees came while I sat there; he had to come through the garden—Rees's and Thomas's houses adjoin each other, one standing at right angles to the other—as Bees came through his garden Thomas was in his, and saw Bees coming—Rees said to Thomas "I want to be straightforward," or words to that effect; I cannot give the exact words "What are you going to do?" Thomas said, "Don't be in a hurry, I haven't drawn you," or "Don't be in a big hurry, I haven't taken you"—Rees said "What are you going to do?"—Thomas said "I have got to let you know I have to get the lot; I will give you 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Rees said "I shan't take it; I was to have 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Thomas said "Is not 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. enough for signing your b——name?" I believe he said—Bees said "I shan't act the scamp at that price"—then some few words passed, I think they were saying something about preparation, I didn't quite catch that, and then Rees came into the house—I said "You had better finish your conversation with Thomas"—I had a few words with him—he said to me" You say you won't pay me"—he went out then, and Thomas and Rees got quarrelling, and Rees said to Thomas "I will go and see Turner"—Thomas told him he might go to hell if he liked—I stepped from behind the door and said "You have no need to send him, Mr. Thomas, I have heard it all"—Thomas flew into a temper, and cursed me, and I came away.</p>

I have a diary; I think there will be entries in it of the interviews with Nash and Rees, but I was at Leo<lb/>minster at that time, and it would be entered when I got back—my diary is not here, it would be at Manchester—I don't think I have seen it for months—the statement Nash made to me was put in my proof for Mr. Charles Russell's brief for the Chancery proceedings—that would be pre<lb/>pared perhaps six weeks or a month before the trial in the Chancery Court, in Queen's Bench—I think those two exhaust all the written material of all that Nash told me—I have been a solicitor since 1877—I thought Nash's statement an important one—he would not let me write it down; I wanted to take it down, but he would not let me—it did not occur to me to write it down as soon as I parted from him—Bees first made the statement</p>

               <p>to me as to the mode in which this fraud had been committed, at Ludlow about the end of July, about the 27th—I told Mr. Child of it long before that; I mean Nash's statement—I told him of Rees's statement as soon as I told anybody; I have no doubt of that—I first became acquainted with Mr. Child in the spring of 1882—I had heard of him through Sale and Co.—I first became acquainted with him by going down to Leominster in the spring of 1882—I was passing under my own name; my partner passed under another name for one or two visits; his name is Robert Hyde Bayner, and he passed by his second name of Hyde—I have got an account of my expenses at Leominster; I have it not with me; it would be in the bill; the bill is in preparation—I have my hotel bills here—I have an account of the money I propose to charge my client with for my visits to Leominster; it would be in the bill—I was aware twelve months ago of the importance attached to the amount of money I had spent in Leominster; you asked me about the amount at the last trial—I have an account of it; I can't say what it is; it will appear in the bill; the bill can be here; it will be made out; the materials of it are at Leominster; I can have it here by to<lb/>morrow morning—it will appear in the ledger—I could not say how many visits I paid to Leominster; it was a good many—you may say I was in Leominster most of my time from January or February, 1882, up to the trial, up to the compromise—I was very often there up to 10th June, 1882—I did not go into Leominster after the visit on 17th June for a few weeks I should say, and then I kept more in Ludlow and Shrewsbury; then I went down often after—I did not know anything of Bees only by sight till Nash brought him to Ludlow—I had only seen him on one occasion—I was at Rees's house one evening; that would be before the compromise; I went with Mr. Neale; I cannot fix the date; I should think it would probably be three months before 10th June; I would not pledge myself, about two months probably—I called one forenoon and asked if Bees was at home; Mrs. Bees said "No," and I sat down on the stairs, as I was tired; I then went away—I cannot give the date of that; it would be a few months before the trial—I first heard of the letter to Emma Priestman when we went to demand the will—that would be in April I fancy; not as to the letter, but Priestman said "I think my sister has a letter of my father's, because she told Gunnell she knew the money was mine; how she came to know it I can't say"—Henry Priestman wrote a letter to me on the subject—I telegraphed for that letter yesterday, and we have not found it; we have it not—it did not occur to me "till yesterday as important to have the letters; that I swear—I did not bring up all the papers connected with this case; there are three boxes of them—I brought one box—I don't think I have any entry in my diary of the receipt of the letter from Henry Priestman; I can't say from memory—I first saw that letter the first week in May, 1882,1 think, the 6th—the compromise was on 10th June—we went to Leominster on the 17th, and stayed from Saturday to Monday or Tuesday at the Royal Oak—before leaving, in consequence of what Nash had said I directed Mr. Child to open communication with Bees, to give me, if he could, some information about the will—I don't think it would be as to Bees; I think it would be as to Nash first—after that I did not go to Leominster for a few days; the letter from Joe and Thomas Nash came in the meantime, and I went down after—before leaving Leominster on the Monday or Tuesday I can't</p>

               <p>say whether I had given directions to Mr. Child as to opening communi<lb/>cations with Rees, but I will say as to Nash, and I believe as to Rees—I believe as to both—I said that I had been informed that Rees and Nash had some large sums of money to draw from Thomas, and I said I was inquiring into the matter, and if Mr. Child saw Nash, and I believe I said Rees too, he was to inquire whether this was true, and I believe I told him that if they got security I would see about whether it could not be stopped out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Thomas—I think that would be about all (it was Joseph Nash who told me that these men were to draw large sums of money); that was the only offer I made—on 26th June I received a letter from Mr. Child; I have the original here. (<hi rend="italic">This letter was read; it referred to several persons under the initials P., D., G., N., L., and T., which the witness explained as meaning Pritchard, Dowding, Gunnell, Nash, Lloyd, and himself.</hi>) After hearing that letter read I pledge my oath that what I have described was the only offer I made—my offer was that if they brought me an authority or anything to show that Thomas was paying them, and that they were to have so much out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would stop that money out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had not received the money—the arrangement was not to ascertain whether Mr. Child had received the money, and if he had I was to get a receipt; that could not be the way; it is utterly impossible—they were to get an authority from Thomas, and if they brought that to me I was to see whether I could stop it for them out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was coming through my hands—I expected that it could not go into any one's hands without my knowledge—the Tom referred to in the letter is Thomas Nash. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of 28th June</hi>, 1882, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Child to the witness, was read.</hi>) I can explain what the words "I cannot understand your generosity" mean—when Nash had spoken to me as to these sums of money he said "We are afraid Thomas will do my brother out of the money"—I said "If your brother comes to me in the evening with the authority, he cannot do you out of the money, because I will stop it out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a month or two will not make any difference to us; if they receive the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you get an authority from Thomas, I will pay you out of the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is what I understand the letter refers to.

               <p>of him that he could—Nash had been in Pritchard's employ, and he was certainly friendly with him, and I said "If ever Nash says anything to you, you can see what he knows"—Mr. Pritchard had had one or two in<lb/>terviews with Nash, and I think he had got Nash to say he should come and see me, I could see how Mr. Pritchard was playing his cards—I told Child and Pritchard that they must not bring Nash, because he would get dubious, and suspect that we were trying to get at the object that this 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid for—Thomas had had a row with them the night before, and he was wanting the 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I wanted to convince Dowding that Thomas was intending doing Nash out of the money, and I wanted Mr. Child to point out more bits of odds and ends in that direction—I was under the impression that Gunnels and Thomas were joining in this affair, I thought Gunnels was to have 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. Our firm were first employed by Mr. Priestman in August, 1881—I was assisted in my investigations by Child and Pritchard, but I do not think Dowding had anything much to do with it, except indirectly—I also received information from many other persons—Messrs. Sale and Co., of Manchester, were employed on behalf of the next-of-kin at the Queen's Bench trial—after the compromise I did not instruct Messrs. Sale and Co., in January, 1883, to make an offer of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Gunnell—I could not instruct the opposite side solicitors—I served my articles in Mr. Sale's office—this letter is Mr. Lloyd's writing—I cannot say that I was a party to that offer—Messrs. Sale were con<lb/>templating making an offer to Gunnell and Thomas, in order to avoid the expense of a long trial—they said that Gunnell and Thomas were entitled to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the real will, and it would cost a great deal to try the issue, and sooner than be at the trouble and expense of a long trial they would give them 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and they made the offer strictly without prejudice—I cannot say whether the offer was refused, because they have had several interviews, Mr. Lloyd acting for Thomas and Gunnell—it was suggested that it should be left to Mr. Russell and Sir Henry James and Sir Hardinge Giffard to say whether they should have a farthing or not, and I think it fell through—when I examined the will through the glass I did not see any pencil marks—I saw it twice before the compromise, but did not see the marks—I did not see the pencil marks till I went down purposely to look for them, after being told by</p>

               <p>Nash—Thomas and Guimell watched Nash after they knew he had been to see me, and I saw Gunnell watching Nash—I watched too—they never left him, and they did not leave me very often—I dare say Mr. Child was watched also—I cannot say whether almost every person in Leominster, men and women, took an interest in the case—I have heard the ex<lb/>pression "Gunnellites," but not "Turnerites" before to-day, though I had a lot of friends there—I was examined at Bow Street as to the inter<lb/>view I had with Nash at the George Hotel, Shrewsbury, on July 7th, and said" Thomas said, Nash would not have had a penny but for him, and the money was as much his as Thomas's"—he said Thomas was the scamp in the transaction, in the play—I said to Nash I had been thinking Gunnell was the scamp in the play, and I was mistaken—I said that, and I said "I had the saddle on the wrong horse, I thought Gunnell was the deepest in the transaction"—he Bald that Thomas had some Caledonian Bonds, and Gunnell wanted some of them, and that Gunnell had asked Nash to use his influence with Thomas to let him have them—I saw Nash again at Wolverton on 11th July—I said at the police-court "I asked whose invention it was, and told him it was a cute plan; he said Whalley was a cute man, but Thomas is a cuter, Thomas will be too cute for Gunnell'"—I think "Too many for him" were the words—it might have been in the autumn of 1881 that my partner went down to Leominster under the name of Hyde—he would not go to see Mr. Gun<lb/>nell under that name—after he had been there a time or two he went to see Mr. Gunnell—that was at the commencement of the proceedings—it was before January, I think—he would not see Gunnell in the name of Hyde, because he would give him his card and tell him who he was—I have no recollection of saying to Nash "I can settle matters with you and Thomas, but not with Mr. Gunnell"—I don't think I did—I have no recollection of making such a remark or words to that effect—I could not say if after the compromise any money could have been drawn out from the bank except the cheque received Priestman's signature—Thomas and Gunnell had proved the will—Thomas and Gunnell were executors, and till Priestman had proved he had no <hi rend="italic">locus stands</hi>—after the compromise, and after Priestman had taken probate, it would have been a proper business course, and the ordinary course, for Priestman to sign, and I think they would have then required the signatures of the whole three; I should have done so—I don't think I gave notice to the bank on the compromise, because if I had it would have aroused sus<lb/>picion—I know Gunnell's politics by repute, he is a Conservative, and at the last election acted as Mr. "Rankin's agent; that was in 1880.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I said to Nash "Who is at the bottom of this?" he said "You put it on Gunnell's shoulders," Nash said that Gunnell had a finger in the pie—on the 16th May, 1882, or about then, I received this letter of 19th April from Emma Priestman; I and my partner did not keep that letter, it was sent to the agents and to the other side—subject to its being inspected we kept it and produced it in Court—as soon as we got the written information we sent to Bates and Stewart, Lloyd's London agents, and an information was made of the discovery—I remember this letter to Child of 25th May, 1882, I think my partner wrote it—I saw it at the last trial. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Rayner and Turner to Child</hi>)—I think it was taken by Mr. Rayner to be shown to Child—I never had a written report from Mr. Chabot, I called and gave him a guinea,</p>

               <p>I sent him a tracing I had made from the will that had been proved, and some letters written by Mr. Whalley, amongst others that of the 19th April—the question was whether the signatures to the letters were the same—at that time we were investigating the question whether the sig<lb/>nature "James Whalley" to the will of 21st March was a genuine signature, that was before the compromise, when we were oppossing the will in the first instance—after I heard Nash's story I was sent down to look at the will, and I observed some pencil marks on it—I did not make those pencil marks as seems to be suggested, I found them, I made no pencil marks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">This witness subpoena to produce certain documents and papers and letters was read</hi>). I am stationmaster at Leominster, I knew the late Mr. Whalley, the defendants, and Rees—Thomas was a foreman porter under me till the end of August, 1880, when he was removed to Helsby—he returned to Leominster in about a month—Mr. Whalley, the deceased, was in the habit of coming to the station almost daily to fetch his newspapers, and on those occasions I frequently conversed with him—I should think sometimes Mr. Priestman was mentioned between us—Mr. Whalley sometimes showed me letters from Priestman—I understood that he looked upon him very affectionately—Mr. Whalley never mentioned Thomas except once, when an allusion was made about his wife—he spoke very highly of Mrs. Thomas, and said that Thomas did not behave well to her—shortly before his death Mr. Whalley mentioned to me that he thought of removing from Thomas's—on the morning of May 7th, 1881, the day of Mr. Whalley's death, I saw Gunnell at the station at about 12 o'clock, he came up the drive leading to the station, and I had a conversation with him, he said Whalley was dead—I said no—he said it was true, Mr. Whalley was dead, and he had left Thomas all his money; he had then the will in his pocket, which he was going to take to his solicitor at Hereford—I said" He has never left Thomas all his money"—during the conversation Thomas was coming out of the town—Gunnell saw Thomas, and moved away, asking me not to say anything to Thomas about what we had been speaking about—Gunnell went on the platform—afterwards Thomas came up, and repeated that Whalley was dead—I said I had just heard it from Mr. Gunnell—Thomas made some allusion to the money having being left to him—I said "Never"—Thomas went on the platform—I don't know what became of him—Gunnell went to Hereford by the 12 o'clock train—that afternoon I saw Gunnell again—I think it would be nearly four, no passenger train had come in between his departure and arrival, a goods train had gone through—I attended Mr. Whalley's funeral, walking with Mr. Moyle, and in coming back we had some conversation about a will—about a week after I again saw Thomas at the station; he had some accounts of the funeral which he showed me, and told me he had been settling those accounts himself; if there was anything to remain he thought that he was entitled to it, he must have it—he said Mr. Whalley had left his adopted son a legacy, a legacy to Mr. Gunnell, and the residue to him—I told him I did not believe it—he told me what took place after Mr. Whalley's death, I believe that same day; he said that the first thing Gunnell did when he came into the room was to pick up a letter which contained a cheque for a large amount, and on the table was a watch which he put into his pocket, he then asked for the will, which Thomas said lie had got</p>

               <p>downstairs, and of which he (<hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>) was desirous of having a copy before it went out of the house—they went downstairs, Gunnell con<lb/>sented, and Thomas took a copy—Thomas then asked Gunnell to leave Mr. Whalley's watch, as it was intended for his (<hi rend="italic">Thomas's</hi>) little boy—Gunnell took the watch out of his pocket, put it on the table, and left the house—on a Sunday in August, 1881, Gunnell came and took a ticket to Berrington, and invited me to go with him—he wanted to speak to me about the Whalley property—Gunnell said there was plenty of money in it—I said, "None of mine"—he asked me if I had seen Mr. Lloyd—I said "No"—he asked me if I would see him—I said yes, if Mr. Lloyd asked me himself—the train came up and Mr. Gunnell went on—I saw Mr. Lloyd on the following evening about 7 o'clock—Mr. Lloyd got very angry, and I left—the following day I saw Mr. Lloyd, Nash, and Rees go down to Hereford—three weeks, or probably longer, after the compromise, when Mr. Pritchard was there, Nash came to see me, and wanted me to write to Mr. Turner for him—I refused, but offered him Mr. Turner's address—Nash said he did not quite care about posting a letter to Mr. Turner, as it might come to his brother Joe's ears—I said if he wrote it I would enclose it for him, if that was all—Nasli brought me a letter in the evening, which I posted; it was in an envelope, I believe this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This teas the letter of 25th July from Nash to Turner; the envelope was put in</hi>)—Nash said that Thomas was behaving very shabbily towards him when he said he wanted to write to him—I don't think the envelope was fastened when I got it—he proffered it to me to look at, I did not—I enclosed it in one of my own and fastened—he told me he said in it that Thomas was behaving very shabbily to him, and he wanted to communicate with, Mr. Turner—he said he had stated that in his letter—I got a reply from Mr. Turner, which I read to Nash—I do not remember what was in it—I have not got it; all the letters written to me by Turner were destroyed from time to time as I got them—at that time Nash said Thomas was behaving very shabbily to him, and that he could not get his money—Nash said on one occasion after the letter that he had been promised 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said it was a very large sum—on several occasions I asked him if he had any security or any written promise from Thomas for these sums—I remember being at Wolferton when Nash and Mr. Turner were there—to the best of my belief I said that Nash had come to place himself, I think I used the word unreservedly, in Mr. Turner's hands—Nash said, "No, not exactly that, "I believe that it was not fair, there were three to one—Mr. Turner asked me to go out of the room, and I went straight home, leaving Turner, Pritchard, and Nash there—before that Nash had asked me to make an appointment for him with Mr. Turner—I believe he mentioned two or three places; Shrewsbury was selected—I think he told me then he was going to see Mr. Turner on the subject of the will—I cannot say whether he mentioned the word "swindle" on that particular occasion, but he has mentioned it as a swindle on several occasions—I asked him how it was a swindle—he was guarded in his replies, he did not tell me—after Nash's return from Aberystwyth he said he would not have anything more to do with Mr. Turner—I said "Why?"—he said he had arranged with Mr. Lloyd, or something to that effect—Mr. Gunnell and several members of his family went by train to Aberystwyth—Thomas and Nash went in Thomas's trap; I did not see them start—</p>

               <p>it is about 80 miles from Hereford to Leominster—Nash said he was not going to have anything more to do with Mr. Turner because of seeing Mr. Lloyd; he said Mr. Lloyd was a gentleman, he would be well looked after if he would only stick to him, or something to that effect—in May, before the compromise, I received a letter, I think from Mr. Hyde (<hi rend="italic">Rayner</hi>), which I have destroyed with the others—I believe he said if I was on the platform on the arrival of the 10.35 from Salop the writer would show me a letter—I don't know the date of that—I was on the platform; I am there every day—I saw Mr. Hyde, and he showed me a letter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, to the best of my belief—he asked me if it was Mr. Whalley's writing and his signature.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. I have incurred no expenses in what I have done in this matter—I have been at one or two public-houses from time to time—I have been at the Solway Arms and at the Feathers Hotel; I don't remember being at the Royal Oak—I was will<lb/>ing to do anything I could to help Mr. Turner—I assisted him according to his requests all that I could—I was not ready to do anything discredit<lb/>able for him, nor anything that was not honest and straightforward—I am quite sure that was always my state of mind while I was arranging this business and seeing these people. (<hi rend="italic">The learned Counsel read to the wit<lb/>ness a passage from his letter of 23rd July</hi>, 1882.) I did not think there would be anything discreditable or dishonest in giving Rees money, I thought Mr. Turner might not like to give Rees money, and I would give it to him—I should not have told anybody afterwards—that was if Rees's statement should be in accordance with what I had been led to suppose it was—I was going to give him what Mr. Turner should mention in his letter—I had been told that 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be given to one of these men and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the other—I understood from Mr. Turner that he would have stopped out of Thomas's money as much for Rees as he would have got from Thomas if he gave Turner a statement that showed that Thomas had no right to the money—I offered Rees that if he brought a signed statement from Thomas of what he had promised that I would send it to Mr. Turner, and Mr. Turner said that he would stop it out of Thomas's money—there was nothing very generous in that, in stopping it out of the money going to Thomas (<hi rend="italic">The learned Counsel here read to the witness part of the letter of 28th June containing the expression:</hi> "Mr. Dowding says that your offer is so good that he really cannot understand your generosity.")—I don't know what generosity Dowding saw in it, but I suppose he meant Turner was to stop it without any trouble to Rees—the words in the same letter "If he agrees to accept your money" mean that was for telling Mr. Turner how he came to attest the will; if Rees agreed to accept 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I suppose from Mr. Turner, Mr. Turner said he would stop the money—the offering to accept your money I still say refers to Mr. Turner's generosity in stopping the money that was going to Thomas—I swear that it refers to that—I have no doubt about it—at no time during these negotiations with Rees did I give him to understand that he would get money from Turner without reference to the stoppage of Thomas's</p>

               <p>Thomas, and if he would bring it to him, he would see that they were paid; that is what I meant by Pritchard's assistance—I heard about the security from Mr. Turner; he said if there was any security, and if they would give it up, that was the same offer we were talking of just now that astonished Mr. Dowding by its generosity—I remember receiving from Turner the form which I was to show to Rees and Nash, "I hereby authorise you to pay Thomas Nash," and so on. (<hi rend="italic">This was a letter dated 25th July from Turner to the witness.</hi>) I should be sure to show that to them if Mr. Turner asked me to do so; I don't remember if I did—it reads as if it was to go to Mr. Lloyd; the authority to pay is addressed to Mr. Lloyd—I first heard of pencil marks on the will, it would be a day or two, or perhaps two or three days, after I had been to Wolferton at the Solway Arms—I believe Mr. Pritchard told me first, I would not be positive upon that. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of 5th September from Turner to the witness was read, enclosing another letter for the witness to show Rees, in which was the following sentence:</hi> "They can't quite understand the increase, and don't quite believe he can give such valuable information as he pretends.") Rees had mentioned that he had not seen Mr. Whalley sign the will on 21st March, and that he had seen Mr. Whalley sign a will at a later date with Mr. Moyle, and Rees said that the sum of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had been promised to Nash, he was quite as much entitled to as Nash—I think that was what brought the large sum of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up—at that time I believe that was all I knew that Rees could tell. (<hi rend="italic">The Counsel read the conclusion of Turner's letter of 5th September, and the enclosure to be shown to Rees.</hi>) I showed that to Rees—I have no doubt I acted in pursuance of the other directions in the letter; that I asked him to write and say if 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the lowest he would accept, and whether he would swear to his statement for that sum, whether he would warrant his statement to be of such vital importance that Thomas would lose his 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I impressed on him how strong the case was, and that Mr. Turner would proceed either with or without him—I believe I said Dowding wanted to make some money of the case—I faithfully carried out the instructions received in that letter—I forget what Rees said—I wrote it down to Mr. Turner as far as I recollect. (<hi rend="italic">The Counsel here read Child's letter to Turner of 9th September.</hi>) "Could not get him inside "means could not get him inside the house—he had been in the habit of coming to my house—"He would just as soon tell you all about it without any considera<lb/>tion as have the money, "that was what Rees said, and all that he said—I should tell Mr. Turner all that he said—he said that if he got 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He would swear to the statement—I can't say if there is any more corre<lb/>spondence, I have not got any.

I understood it to be an offer of money to Rees for his evidence—it was as to making an offer for their evidence only on a guarantee from Thomas—that might not be expressed, but it was so. (<hi rend="italic">The passage from the letter of 21st September was read:</hi> "Is Mrs. Ovens working with us? I hope so. Do not let her get any of our writing.")

At the time of Mr. Whalley's death I was on friendly terms with Mr. Gunnell; I was not on friendly terms with him at the end of 1882—I think after Gunnell came down in August, 1881, he did not speak to me but very seldom—I am sure I was on friendly terms with him before August, 1881—after the death I did not speak to him because he did not come and speak to me; it had nothing to do with this case—I don't think I spoke to him after August, 1881—at the time of the death I was on intimate terms of friendship with him, but afterwards, from August, 1881, we did not speak—there was no ill-feeling on my part towards him—I was in partnership with Mr. Davis as coal merchants; some disagreement occurred between us, and two arbi<lb/>trators were appointed, I appointing Mr. Gunnell as mine and Davis appointing Mr. Bowden—this was in January or February, 1881, before Mr. Whalley's death—several meetings were held, and a preliminary award was made in 1881 by Gunnell and Bowden, by which book debts were to be got in and liabilities discharged—I refused to let that be acted upon—I was dissatisfied with Mr. Gunnell because he insisted on my partner's son collecting the book debts, and I wanted a solicitor—owing to this at the time of Whalley's death we always spoke and said "Good morning" when we met, but did not enter into conversation—I took no note of the conversation with Gunnell at the railway station on the day of the death—I only had two conversations with him; I took no note—I don't think there was anybody else present at the other conversation between us—Mr. Gunnell said he had got the will in his pocket and was taking it to his solicitor or a solicitor, I would not be quite clear which; in my opinion it was to his solicitor at Hereford—I know Mr. Gunnell has had business transactions with Mr. James Corner at Hereford; I don't know if he was his solicitor or not—I think as the train moved away Mr. Gunnell said something about not repeating our conversation to Thomas, but I won't be</p>

Thomas would not have been in it if it had not been for me"—I said "If Mr. Whalley's relatives find out that their uncle is dead and left all this money they will be trying to upset the will"—he said "They cannot do it; I am the only person as can upset the will"—I said "How, if the relatives cannot upset the will, can you upset the will?"—he said "I have a document in my possession that will do it"—he was very excited, and said "I have a document in Mr. Whalley's handwriting; where will Thomas be then? you see him and tell him that"—I said "I will try to see him"—it was on a Saturday night; I did not see Thomas—that was all the conversation at that time, except that he said this was the second railway man he had got a fortune for, or something to that effect—I think that was on the same date, the 4th June—after that we had a conversation at Gunnell's shop door in the front of his shop—he</p>

               <p>something has come to my mind that I recollect now—I never had any communication before the compromise from Child, Turner, or any one with reference to the mental condition of Mr. Whalley when he made his will—I don't recollect it—Mr. Gunnell told me they were going to try and prove the old man insane; that was the only communication—I don't recollect having a communication from Child on that subject before the compromise—I will not swear I had not, because we were seeing each other daily—I was constantly at the station, but I was not on speaking terms with Child, only on business—only Mr. Gunnell spoke to me about it—I don't think I spoke to Nash about it before the compromise—I don't recollect it if I did; I would tell you if I could, I don't want to keep it back—I had a lot of conversations with Nash, but I don't recollect any about Mr. Whalley's state of mind—I did not say to Nash that if he would go over to the other side, and say that Mr. Whalley was not of sound mind at the time he made his will, he could have 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never said or thought of such a thing—I am quite positive about that; he did not tell me that everything was done correctly and honestly; he told me it was a swindle—he did not say that the will was made perfectly honestly—before the compromise Nash told me why he did not put his own name in the will, because he could not be a legatee and witness the will—I remember that perfectly well, because it made a great impression on my mind; I thought it very strange; that is the only thing I recollect about that time—I was seeing Nash every day, and heard so much about this case, that I was perfectly tired of it—we might have talked over about the will—we did talk it over—I never mentioned larger sums than the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he might have, never 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How came you to speak to Mr. Turner before the compromise?—<hi rend="italic">A</hi>. He served me with a subpoena, and that was in pencil, he brought it to me as I was getting into the train; I knew what Mr. Gunnell had told me, but I was not with Mr. Turner or any one connected with it, because I would not have any<lb/>thing to do with the case—the first time I ever saw Mr. Turner was when he served me with the subpoena, that was the first time he ever spoke to me, and that was on the Tuesday before the compromise—I was going out for the day, and he jumped into the train, or to the door with me, and gave it me, it was in pencil, he pushed it on me and said, "Now it will be all right"—I said "You could serve it on me when I return home"—that was at the carriage door—that was the first time I had any conversation with him or spoke to him in any shape or form—I have, I think, told all that passed at that time—the first time after the com<lb/>promise that I saw Mr. Turner was, I think, on the Sunday night or Monday morning—I can't give the date, it was in June—I believe it was in the street, at my house door, about two minutes' walk from the Oak; I think he must have known Nash was working for me—he did not come in—I must have been at the door, I think it was in the evening, but I can't recollect now; he said from a conversation he had had with Joseph Nash, Thomas Nash's brother, with reference to the will case, that he suspected something wrong, for he had told him that his brother was to receive a large sum from Thomas, and if I would ask him whether he held any security; I said I would ask him—that was about all that passed between Mr. Turner and me at that time—he did not instruct me at all, but when Nash came to my house, would I ask him if he held any security—he did not say anything to me about approaching Rees—I don't</p>

I do not know that I have taken so very great an interest in this case; perhaps I have since the compromise, not more than an ordinary witness; a great interest if you like; have it your way—the conversation in Child's house was between Child and Rees; I spoke occasionally—I took notes of the conversation I had with Gunnell—I took those notes about the time that we had the conversation—the first week in June, 1881, we had the conversation, and I took the notes down I think about 21st or 22nd—that was before any proceedings by the next-of-kin—I took the notes from a conversation I had with Mr. Wallis, a solicitor of Hereford, who was at my house on 21st June; I took them after he left, I don't say the same day, it might have been the next day—Mr. Wallis had been talking with some friends before I arrived about the large sum of money left to Thomas; it was the talk of the county—Mr. Wallis said "From what you tell me something will turn up out of that matter"—I understood him to mean litiga<lb/>tion, and he said "I would take a note of that if I was in your place," and I was very sorry that I did take it afterwards—I took it for the purpose</p>

               <p>of refreshing my memory; I did not know whether Mr. Wallis would have mentioned it or not—I have not seen those notes for some time, I can't say when; I thought nothing about it until the proceedings were taken; in fact until the arrest of the prisoners; it might have been in 1882—I was subpœnaed as a witness in the Probate Court, but I was not called; in fact I did not come—I saw these notes before that; I had them then—I was also subpœnaed to give evidence in the action in the Queen's Bench—I saw them before that trial; that was last year—I refreshed my memory by them previous to that trial—I don't think I saw them after the trial—I looked for them when Mr. Birch first called on me, and I found this one in pencil referring to a conversation with Nash at Mr. Lloyd's—I was questioned by you at Bow Street about the notes I took of the conversation with Gunnell—you said "Have you got those notes?"—I said "I have not"—I have looked for them since, but did not find them—my first conversation with Mr. Gunnell with reference to this will was on the Sunday night after Mr. Whalley died; he died on the Satur<lb/>day I think, and this was on the Sunday night—I know Jemmy Wilkes by sight; he is a tax collector—I have not seen him since I have been in London—it was not at the first interview that Gunnell told me he had been left a fortune; he said he should never want to borrow money again of me or any one else—it was on the second occasion that he said "He has left me a fortune"—in the conversation on 4th June he said "Mr. Whalley's will was made by a solicitor," I am quite sure of that—I knew that Nash had been a solicitor's clerk—I told him that Tom Nash told me he had made it—I swear that, and he was very much sur<lb/>prised; I can see him now in the office, because he was in a passion to think that Nash had told me—I will swear Gunnell did not say that the will was made by Tom Nash, a solicitor's clerk—I took a note of the conversation when he said he had a document that could upset the will—I thought that conversation very strange—I had not the curiosity to ask him what the document was—I have written out a will myself, copied from another, and have been executor to a will with Gunnell on a pre<lb/>vious occasion—I have very little knowledge on the subject; I did not act with Mr. Gunnell at that time because he produced another will after the testator was dead—I don't think I am so well up in law as to know that the only document that can upset a will is a subsequent will—I know that a subsequent will, if properly made, will upset a previous one—I don't know that the document Gunnell referred to was a subsequent will; I did not know what it was; I can't say what I thought about it at the time—I thought it was extraordinary; something came up in my mind; I began to think something might be wrong in this—I thought in my own mind that I wished I had not had this conversation with Gunnell, because it brought a thing into my mind—I did not know what document he referred to, because he produced a will after the testator was dead in another will case, and I could not understand that, and I thought this was not altogether square—there was a man named Jeremiah Lockett, of Leominster, who met me in the town one day and asked me would I be executor to his will, as he thought of speaking to Mr. Gunnell if I had no objection to that gentleman, I said "Not in the least, "I believe Mr. Moore, the solicitor, made the will for Lockett, leaving me and Gunnell executors—when Lockett died I went to his house—I believe Gunnell was there, or he came in—Lockett's step-daughter wanted to know where she</p>

               <p>should get some mourning from—Gunnell would not make her any answer—she was repeating her question, and I said "You had better go to Mr. Graves, the draper, and get something in reason; don't go to much expense"—Gunnell tapped me on the shoulder and said "Come outside with me"—I went outside, and he said "You know you are not executor in this will"—I said "How is that?" "Oh," he said, "Lockett has made another will; I am sole executor"—I said "I am very glad to hear it, then I shall have nothing whatever to do with it"—he said "Oh, I must ask you to act with me"—I said "You know I can't act with you if I am not mentioned in that will as an executor"—he said "I shan't take 'No,' you must act with me and walk with me next to the corpse at the funeral"—I said "I might walk with you to the funeral, but I shall not act in any way; I am very pleased that I have nothing whatever to do with it"—about four to six months after that he met me in the town and said "I want to have a little con<lb/>versation with you; what shall we do about Lockett's will?"—I said "I have nothing to do with it"—"Oh," he said, "but about proving the first will"—I said "You can't do that; have you got the first will?"—"Yes," he said, "I have them both"—I said "If it can be done, it was the first will, because that was leaving the money between the brother and sister, and that was as Lockett's wife wished it left"—he said "Well, we will leave this till another day"—I heard nothing more from him for I should think a month; I then said "What have you done about Lockett's affair?"—he said "How done, done what?"—I said "Which will are you going to prove?"—"Oh," he said, "the estate is in debt"—I said "In debt to who?"—"Oh," he said, "lots of people"—I said "I under<lb/>stood from you that there would be 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to divide between the two"—"Oh," he said, "Lockett owes me a lot of money, I shall lose 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it"—I said "It is not usual for an executor to lose money if the estate is in debt"—"Oh, but," he said, "I would not let the old man lie in debt and I paid it," and I said "That is very strange to me after what you told me in High Street"—that was about all die conversation we had at that time—I should think that was about seven years ago; I am not very certain—Gunnell did not show me any books that he had as executor; he would not show them to any one—I believe I mentioned in my affidavit the con<lb/>versation with Gunnell, in which he said he had a document in his possession that would upset Mr. Whalley's will—I was not asked on that point in the Queen's Bench—I don't think I mentioned in the Queen's Bench that Gunnell said Thomas was the second railway porter that he had helped to get a fortune for—he did not say "railway man;" he said he had helped to get 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one man—I don't know whether I mentioned in the Queen's Bench the conversation in which Nash said "I was to have security given me in London, and it was put off in the morning till I was in the witness box"—I can't recollect if I was asked—I did mention it if I was asked; if I was not asked I did not—I asked Nash if it was security for the money that had been promised him.</p>

I am a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and an M.R.C.S.—I live at South Street, Leominster, in practice with Dr. Barnett—I knew the late Mr. James Whalley—I first attended him professionally on 21st March, 1881; my partner attended him on the 20th for the first time—I believe I saw him between 9 and 10 in the morning of the 21st—he was then in very great physical distress from shortness of breath; very ill indeed—doing any business would be a very great labour to him at that time—I don't think he was fit for much physical or mental exertion—I attended him regularly up to the end of the first week or beginning of the second week in April; then for a time he got better—I returned to him about 22nd April, not feeling so well—I do not believe I had any conversation with Mr. Gunnell as to Mr. Whalley's means before his death—on the morning of the death I called at the house about a quarter or 20 minutes to 10—I found Thomas and his wife in Mr. Whalley's bedroom; they were attending him—he was very ill indeed, apparently dying, when I got into the room; he was barely conscious—I think he knew me and muttered something to the effect that it was all over; he spoke indistinctly and was evidently is extremis—he died within a few minutes of my arrival—Thomas left the house to fetch some one to attend to the body—I did not then know the woman's name; I have since heard that it was Mrs. Evans—I waited with Mrs. Thomas till she came; I met her either on the landing just outside the bedroom, or coming through the bedroom door; at any rate, I know she was coming up the stairs before I left, because Mrs. Thomas was timid about staying there—I can't say where Thomas was at that time; I believe I saw him again before I left—I believe he came back with Mrs. Evans, but I won't be quite sure of that—I said to Thomas before that, when Mr. Whalley died, that I would let Mr. Gunnell know that the old gentleman was dead—I said that, because there was some conversation to the effect that there was a packet to be given to Mr. Gunnell on Mr. Whalley's death—this conversation was in the bedroom I believe—that was my only reason for saying I would let Mr. Gunnell know; I was going down the town and it was not out of my way—I went straight back down the town, and met Mr. Gunnell somewhere about the bottom of High Street, near his place of business, about quarter of a mile from 128—he was by himself as far as I remember—I don't recollect seeing young Mr. Gunnell that day—when I arrived in Mr. Whalley's room he was sitting on the edge of the bed with a grey shawl or coat over his shoulders, partially dressed, with a blanket round his legs; I can't say whether he had a waistcoat on—Mr. Gunnell had frequently asked me how Mr. Whalley was going on, as to his health; I knew that he had something to do with his affairs, he was interested in him in some way—I don't recollect the details of any conversation.</p>

               <p>he was as well as he had been before, but in April he was fairly well—he died while I was in the room—at that time Mr. and Mrs. Thomas were present—I don't think I sent Thomas to fetch some one to lay out the body, I think it was a suggestion of Thomas's—I don't recollect that he said he would fetch Mrs. Evans; he said he would go and fetch someone, and he returned with Mrs. Evans, and she came up into the room—I know she would be in the room before I got out almost—Mrs. Thomas was in the room with me all the time, I think—immediately on Mrs. Evans's return I left the house—I cannot say for certain whether when I left Thomas had come into the room with Mrs. Evans or whether he was out on the landing—there was no fire in the bedroom—it was so small that I do not think it would have admitted of a fire without burning the bed—I think there was a fireplace—Mr. Whalley had had an operation performed on his tongue, he had the whole of his tongue removed a long while, ago by an Edinburgh surgeon—if he wanted to fasten an adhesive envelope he would wet it with his lips, he had no tongue to do it with—I should not think a good deal of saliva would come on the envelope, unless his lips were very moist—his speech as a very indistinct guttural sort of speech; it was difficult to under<lb/>stand him without being used to his way of speaking.</p>

I am the wife of James Page, the ex-Mayor of Leo<lb/>minster—we live in South Street—I knew the late Mr. Whalley, and have often spoken to him—on the Good Friday before his death he came to us at Brunswick House and asked me to show him over the house—he looked over the lower part of it, the drawing room and dining room, and said it would suit him nicely; that he wanted to take a house, and he liked Hereford Road better than any other part of the town—I said "Are you going to leave Mr. Thomas's?"—he said yes, he had quite made up his mind, and he was very sorry Mrs. Griffiths would not take him to lodge with her—he said that if he took our house he should have a housekeeper, and should keep a pony and carriage.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness, and was till lately Mayor of Leominster—late in February, or early in March, 1881, I met Mr. Whalley in South Street, and asked if he was going to leave Thomas's—he said "I am"—I said that Mrs. Haycourt wished me to ask him if her apartments would suit him—she is a widow, who had just removed from South Street to a more central part of the town—he said that he should not like to go into the town to live; he wanted particularly to get into the Hereford Road, and was in treaty with Mrs. Griffiths for her apartments, and had sent a letter to her—on the morning of his death I met Gunnell in South Street, who said he had called at my house respecting a coffin for the late Mr. Whalley, and he gave me instructions for it, I being a builder and contractor—he said "Thomas is a lucky chap; Whalley has left him a lot of money; not a paltry thousand or two, but thousands"—I was surprised, and asked him how he had obtained his information so soon—he said "Oh, I am left executor; I have the par<lb/>ticulars here, "holding up something which he had under his left arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the York City and County Bank, Leeds—I knew Mr. Whalley ten or twelve years—I knew Priest<lb/>man living with him as a lad in the Isle of Man, when I was manager of a bank at Douglas—he once told me he had had a disagreement with one of his brothers, and had resolved not to leave them anything, but to leave all his property to Priestman—he asked me what remuneration I thought would be adequate for a trustee for his son, and asked if I could find a suitable partnership for him—a partnership was offered in the house of Messrs. Dixon, woollen manufacturers, who said that through the dulness of trade 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was as much as they required, but it could be increased to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards—he then sent me the letter of March 14th, 1881—after Mr. Whalley's death, Gunnell called upon me at Leeds, and introduced himself as Mr. Whalley's executor—I asked how Mr. Whalley had left his property—he told me as it stands in the will—the interview lasted three hours—I asked if there had been any quarrel between Mr. Whalley and Priestman—he said "No, nothing particular, but he had been annoyed at his not coming to see him before he died"—I said that I felt sure there was something wrong about that will, it could not be genuine will of Mr. Whalley's, as I knew from Mr. Whalley that intended to leave the bulk of his fortune to Priestman, and that very shortly before his death he had asked me to look out for a partner<lb/>ship, and gave him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enter as a partner—consequently he could never have made the will at an earlier date; some of my corre<lb/>spondence I had not got to refer to, but I thought it extended to a later period than the date of the will, and therefore he could never have left him 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. while in corresponding with me he gave him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into business—Gunnell said he could not tell how that was, he was no party to making the will; it had been made by a solicitor and attested in the ordinary way—he said "You see I am not benefited by it in any way, the only sum I receive is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble, and having had much experience in these matters I know that is not at all adequate for the trouble I shall have: I think the heirs-at-law are taking proceedings to set the will aside on the ground of incompetency on Mr. Whalley's part at the time it was made, and they have been in treaty with Priestman to join with them for that purpose"—I said I felt sure that was a plea which could not be sustained, as I believed Mr. Whalley to be quite competent—he said it was very foolish of Priestman to join himself with them, as if they succeeded he would lose the little that had been left him; and as I was an old friend of his father's probably I might influence him to join him in supporting the will—I declined to have any<lb/>thing to do in the matter, as the will appeared so extraordinary, and said it would be time enough for me to give my advice to Priestman when I was asked—when I was leaving he said that my evidence would be very important, and he supposed I should not require to receive a subpoena; if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170166"/>
               <p>he sent me a letter, letting me know when the Court sat, and a cheque it would be all right—I said it would not be all right, for I should have nothing to do with the cheque—he said that he sympathised with Priest<lb/>man, and if he supported the will he would use his influence with Thomas, or with the executors, to give him a larger sum than was left to him, 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been several years engaged in banking and I have had large experience of rubbing out pencil marks on account to summing up all our books in pencil, and have noticed that when rubbed out they will after a time revive to a certain extent and become legible.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ANDERSON</hi>. I am not sure, but I think I first knew Mr. Whalley about 1849—he left the Isle of Man, I think about 1875, and this happened in 1874—I left the Isle of Man in 1875 or 1876—this conversation was a year before he left—he did not mention that he should leave his son Priestman 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he asked me about the remuneration of a trustee, I said that will depend on the amount of property he will have to manage, he said about 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he meant to leave to his son—he asked me whether I thought a certain gentleman was eligible as a trustee for his son—I mentioned 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as remuneration while the son was a minor—he said "I don't think that is enough;" I said "I don't know what you are worth, it depends on your property"—he said, "I consider myself worth 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Then that is not enough, you ought to give him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be about the thing"—he did not mention any specific sum which he should leave to his son, but he said the trustee would have to manage that amount of property for his son—he told me he had quarrelled with his brothers, and they should not have any of his money—Gunnell told me that he had seen my correspondence among Mr. "Whalley's papers—it is nearly forty years since I first entered a bank—the reappearance of pencil-marks is the everyday experience of a bank clerk who rubs out his pencil-marks from the cash-book and turns it over at a future period and finds the marks which he thought he had thoroughly erased; I have done it myself—the erasure appears complete in the first instance—I can refer you to all the books in all the banks I have been in—bank books are made of very strong paper, but all banks are not equally particular—rubbing off the pencil-marks with indiarubber destroys the surface of the paper, the glaze, and much more on some papers than on others—in some paper it is not noticeable after the rub<lb/>bing, but it is if you examine it minutely—on some paper, if you examined it with your naked eye, you would not notice a disturbance—I have never used a magnifying-glass or microscope for the purpose.</p>

               <p>some two years ago I think; I can't remember exactly how long he I said—I said "Had he much money?" or "Was he a rich man?"—he said "Yes, he had left the money to a nephew; he had left some to his brothers, but hearing about a twelvemonth ago, or before that, that his brothers were dead he had altered his will, and he had made a will in favour of his nephew"—I suppose he meant his son Priestman; he named Priestman, and I remember his saying he had left a legacy of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the church in that will, but the Vicar had offended him, and he had altered his will; and then he spoke about Mr. Whalley's funny temper, that he was very crotchety, and the great difficulty he had to please him; that he had chastised him two or three or six times because Thomas got a glass too much to drink, and that he very often had to get in the back way into the house, to go quietly, that Mr. Whalley should not hear him—I think the same week as the funeral I met Gunnell at his Vaults' door, he called me across and I had a conversation with him—I don't know how we started, but we got talking about the politics of the town; he said he could not see why we wanted to go outside the borough and some distance away to fetch one to represent the borough, as during the time that he had been in the Council and had been Mayor he had had to stand up and address a company in the Corn Exchange equal or something similar he thought to what it would be to address the House of Commons—I said it required a man of capital to be be put up as member for any place, I thought—he said oh, that would be a small matter to him, as he was left in a very comfortable position—I know he said it was something through Mr. Whalley's death—he wanted me to join the volunteer corps, as, his son being a captain, they wanted to weed out some of the rough lot that were in it—I think three or four times we had conversations about the will—he said that it was astonishing the money that Mr. Thomas was left in this will; I don't recollect anything else he stated—Gunnell said he had been left the money, he should retire from the busi<lb/>ness in Leominster, and he would be purchasing the house in Kingsland, and would leave the business to his son—Gunnell employed me as valuer of the garden produce at Kingsland; that was some time during the summer of 1881, about October I should say; I could not say to a month or two—I think he had purchased the house then.</p>

I am a gardener by profession—this conversation on the day of the funeral was at Thomas's house, in the back doorway, before the funeral, about 12 o'clock I think—nobody else was there; all the bearers were in the back kitchen, about three yards from where we were—I don't know that any bearers could hear it, but one, not a bearer, was in our company most of the time—I think I first mentioned this conversation before the compromise—I made an affidavit after the compromise; there was nothing about this conversation with Thomas in that—I cannot say if that was made with reference to the proceedings in the Probate Court; I swore the affidavit on 20th November, 1882—I was not employed by Turner; I don't know that I was ever employed by him—I have gone about a good deal with him from the first time that he came to Leominster—he would turn into my house acci<lb/>dentally at times, not every day, nearer once a week—I go into the Oak very often; I am employed there—I have served two writs for Turner—he has not paid me a farthing—I have had nothing from him in any shape or way—I served these writs for nothing—that is not my usual practice—</p>

I was sitting in Thomas's house with Moyle on my right hand and Gunnell on my left—Gunnell said "I think I can see my way now to finishing that stained glass window"—some time after the funeral I met Thomas and Gunnell—Gunnell said that Thomas thought of putting up a memorial window, and asked me what it might be likely to cost—on a subsequent occasion I remember meeting Gunnell when on my way to Thomas—Gunnell said that Mr. Whalley</p>

                  </hi>. I am the relieving officer at the Leominster Union; I know the prisoners—at the end of October, 1881, I went to lodge with Thomas—I was there about the 8th or 9th of May—on one occasion Thomas told me that Mr. Whalley had died in his house, and was worth about 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that, with the exception of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left to Priestman and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Gunnell, he had left the remainder to him, and that the reason he had left his son so small an amount was that he had had a quarrel a short time previous to his making the will.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the resident clerk at the Hereford Probate Registry—I received this will of 21st March, 1881, at the latter end of May, 1881, by post, from Messrs. Lloyd and Son, accompanied by a letter—probate of the will was granted on 31st May—there are three rooms used at the Hereford Eegistry, the general clerk's office, the registrar's room, and a private room for waiting purposes—there is a strong room, of which I have charge, in which we keep the wills—I had the will in my custody from the latter end of May, 1881, about a week before its proof, probably, to November, 1882, when it was taken by my colleague, Mr. Lane, to London—during August I was away on my holidays, and then Mr. Lane had charge of the place—while I was there I had charge of it—there were 10 inspections, seven of which were in my presence, but I cannot distinguish between the seven—the persons who inspected it in my presence were Mr. Lloyd, senior, twice (his first inspection was not in my presence); Mr. Lloyd, junior, once; Mr. Neal, once; Mr. Gunnell, once; Mr. Turner, three times—on Mr. Lloyd, senior's, second inspection, Mr. Lane and Mr. Arnold were there; on Mr. Lloyd, junior's, Arnold and myself; that was when Nash was there; on Mr. Neal's, only I was there, and I was alone also when Gunnell saw it—on two of Turner's inspections Arnold, Earl, and I were there, and on another occasion I was alone, and on a fourth occasion Arnold was alone—the dates of the inspections were: in 1881, July 26th, August 23rd, and September 30th, and in 1882, January 2nd, 27th, and 30th, and April 13th, and November 1st, 2nd, and 3rd—when wills are inspected by the public at our office the practice is to place them on a table, and a clerk sits near so that he can view what is taking place—that is not a written rule, but it is the practice—I first heard of this will being supposed to have marks about October, 1882, the day after the assault, the origin of this case, was heard before the Magistrate—I inspected the will with a magnifying glass—I saw the letter "W" at the top of the will, and then throughout the whole body various pencil strokes and marks, and just below the last line of the will a word that looked like "silver," and below that "know my wishes," or "know her wishes"—I could distinctly see it—my memory is at fault; I think it was "know my wishes"—this was the glass I examined it with—I can still see them, but not so distinctly; I think the light would account for that; I can see marks, but not words—between the date of the compromise, June, 1882, and the time I saw these marks,</p>

               <p>nobody had inspected the will—a copy had been made for London, but nobody had searched it in the office—these books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the Registry contain the entries of the inspection—I recollect the day when the prisoner Nash was there with Mr. Lloyd; I asked him if he had been a lawyer's clerk—he said "Yes"—I said "What made you put the attestation in that shape?"—he said "I always do," and with that he left the office.</p>

He was with young Mr. Lloyd, who did not leave with him because he and I had a long chat afterwards; I am positive—the room where the public is admitted is on the ground floor; it is perhaps 20 feet by 16—one clerk, Mr. Lane, sits permanently in that room at a table in the open part of the room—there are two tables in the room—there are two windows on the north side of the room only—my table is close to the window, divided from the general office by a screen—there are the two windows, then comes my table, then the screen, and then the rest of the room with the other table, and there is no window on that side of the room—I sit on the window side of the screen, Lane on the other—there is a desk near the other window on the same side of the screen as my table, what I call my part of the room; I work at that desk occasionally, but do not sit there—persons occasionally take wills to that desk—if Mr. Lane is not at his table we place the wills on that desk that we may see them—there is no restriction as to time for people coming to see wills, they can see them as long as they please—Mr. Lane is chief clerk; he has no other duty to perform except sit at that table—he may be occasionally called away to other parts of the building, and that may also happen to me—there is one business room above, the Registrar's—occasionally both I and Mr. Lane have to go to him on business—I was there on the occasion of three of Mr. Turner's visits—we have no entry of the person who searches, but only of the will searched, "James Whalley"—I remember positively one date on which Turner called, 1st November—I have no entries of the names of the persons who called, I give them from memory; I have only the date in the book of somebody coming—I was away for 21 days in August, 1882—there is no entry of any search in August, 1882—the search was in 1881—in my absence it would be Mr. Arnold's duty to make entries in the book of searches—Arnold is clerk to the Registry now; he has been there 25 years—when I am there the entries of searches are invariably made by me—they have been copied from time to time from the rough book into the fair copy book—a fee is paid for each search—"Search" means that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is paid and a copy is produced, and if the original is wanted to be looked at, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra must be paid; then if a copy is wanted we charge so much per folio—in the entries book we put "search" and "original" against the entries, with the amount paid—here is July 26th, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>by myself and the Registrar, Mr. Paris—we examined it for some time carefully—we required an affidavit of plight or condition because we found it on half a sheet of paper—I cannot say we should examine it with more care than usual, because our attention was so called to it—we examined it with ordinary care, and noticed nothing unusual about it except the attestation part, the length and narrowness and peculiarity of that, its position was peculiar—there is no regular rule as to that, but there is a custom—we have many wills in our Registry with many peculiarities about them—the attestation usually extends half across the paper—we get as many wills on foolscap as on brief paper now they are shorter—I read the attestation clauses carefully—the marks I saw in October I could see very imperfectly with the naked eye; I could see them when I had found them with glasses—they were not apparent in October to the naked eye to ordinary observation, they were not apparent to my naked eye until I looked for them—I did not wear spectacles then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk-in the Probate Registry at the Principal Registry, Somerset House—I examined the will of 21st March, 1881, for the purpose of making the copy, which is known as the red copy, after the original had been taken to be photographed—I examined it for that purpose about July last year; when I looked at the original then I observed certain marks—by direction of the Registrar I marked on that copy of the photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) all the pencil writing marks which appeared on the original will that I was able to find—this is the paper which I marked—I saw on the original will over the word "street," between the first and second lines, that the bottom of the "D" runs through the two letters "ee;" the commencement of the "D" is above the letter "s" in "last"—after the word "street"—I saw a small mark like a comma; over the "s" in Leominster the capital letter "H;" between "Leominster" and "in"—I saw a mark like a "w;" between the words "in" and "the" a part of apparently a capital letter—in the third line over the first "n" in "gentleman" a mark like the symbol for "and"—between the fourth and fifth line below the letter "m" in "11 Priestman" a curved stroke (<hi rend="italic">The witness was proceeding to allude to other instances of pencil marks, when it was arranged that he should take another copy and place on it what the marks were that he observed, and produce it at a future period of the case</hi>)—when I examined the will in the summer of last year I used a magnifying glass, not principally for the purpose of magnifying the writing, but rather as a condenser is used in microscopic work, for concentrating the eye on successive points on the surface of the will, and then generally I saw the marks with the naked eye—I saw the will again at the police-court, and I have seen it to-day—perhaps the</p>

When I got there Mr. Edwards was there—I remained in the room till Thomas and Gunnell came, I was there all the time in the room with the body—Thomas was not in the room when I went there, Mrs. Thomas was and Mr. Edwards, they were both there when I went in—I heard Mr. Gunnell ask Thomas for Mr. Whalley's waistcoat, and I saw Thomas take the waistcoat from under the bolster of the bed—I couldn't tell how long I had to wait for the hot water, perhaps half an hour—I have been in the habit of going to Thomas's house—some time in the month of March I remember seeing Mr. Moyle go to the house, I can fix the date of that, it was 12th March—Thomas came to me in the morning; his wife was taken ill and he was going into the country, and he asked me to go and see Mrs. Thomas, and I went—she was expecting to be confined; I know the date, because Thomas had written out a telegram for his mother to come, it was not sent because Mrs. Thomas got better—Thomas wrote out the telegram, I have never seen it since—Mrs. Thomas was confined on 18th March, she was ill from that Saturday till the 18th; she was confined on the Friday morn<lb/>ing, the 12th was on a Saturday—there was a week between, and it was on the 12th that I saw Mr. Moyle go in there, I didn't see how long he stayed, I didn't see him come out.</p>

I couldn't tell what papers they were that were taken out of the cupboard, it was a bundle of papers like that (<hi rend="italic">produced from the ledger</hi>)—I didn't see the ledger taken out of the cupboard, I didn't see Captain Gunnell at all—when Mr. Gunnell went downstairs with Thomas he did not return again—I didn't see Maud Lee when Mr. Gunnell was there—I don't know whether Mr. Gunnell came downstairs directly he came into the house with Thomas.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">J. K. GREIG</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I was in the habit of receiving letters from Mr. Whalley, and have not the slightest doubt that this letter to Emma Priestman is his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. It appears to have been written with a steel pen instead of a quill, which Mr. Whalley generally used; with that exception I think it is the same writing—when he came to the bank he always had a quill pen in his pocket, as he did not like to write with a steel pen if he could avoid it—I do not think I have seen him at the bank since 1878—there is no material change in the character of his writing between 1878 and 1881 only when he was in bad health being an old</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170187"/>
               <p>man, he did not write so well, but the character of the writing is the same—I should say that in 1878 it had slightly deteriorated but not much changed, but looking at the correspondence there is no change—I had the whole correspondence to form a judgment upon—I had many letters more than were produced, as he was in the habit of corresponding with me ever since I knew him, we living in the same place—a great part of that is destroyed, including my own—I had, I suppose, a dozen letters to form a judgment from—I did not reduce my opinion to writing—I made that inspection before the compromise—I saw the correspondence again at the late trial, but don't know whether they were shown to me in the witness box or by some of the solicitors—I don't think it was Mr. Whalley's habit to leave a considerable margin between the writing and the edge of the paper—before the compromise my attention was called specially to the genuineness of this particular letter—it is rather less free than his usual style—I have never compared it with other letters—it appears to me to be altogether stiffer and sharper in the turns, which seems to be the effect of writing with a steel pen instead of a quill—in my judgment this letter of April 12th was written with a quill, and this letter No. 2 also—I examined these three letters through a microscope, and I formed that judgment partly from what I observed, and speaking from my business experience that does present even now the appear<lb/>ance of steel-pen writing—I examined other letters as well, with a microscope—this letter E before Priestman appears to have been made by a steel pen sticking in the paper—I refer to the large "E," the lower turn, and to the two horizontal lines under it, which seem to me to present that rugged appearance which is met with from the use of a steel pen, and particularly so as to the line under "Whalley," which appears rugged, as if the point of the steel pen scratched the paper—it is part of the business of banking to examine the signatures of cheques daily, and I should not look to the likeness letter by letter, but to the whole signature—a forger would make each letter singly, but in writing them together he would make the mistake of not imitating the character of the writing—each letter in copying might be a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>, but when put together you would see that there was a difference—I see the word "Leominster" in three letters before me—the "L" is not formed in the same way in each, but from the same reason, a steel pen being used instead of a quill—they are all three different to some extent—I can't say that persons acquire the habit of commencing every letter of the alphabet in a particular way, but I think almost every writer has a general character; there is a general resemblance, a general style; but, so far as my experience goes, there is considerable variety in the mode in which most parties form letters at different times—the two "L's" in "Leominster" in the two undated letters differ in the lower turn of the "L," and in the loop—the letters I refer to are Nos. 1, 8, 5, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25; also, Nos. 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 17—those are all in his writing—No. 5 is, I think, probably written with a steel pen; it is dated 13th April, 1881, and possesses the same character as that of April 19th—there are some parts which I confess I do not speak with much confidence to—I have examined it under a microscope with a strong light and formed the opinion that it is written with a steel pen, and this one of 25th April, No. 2, may be so also, but I cannot speak with any degree of certainty. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That, is the very letter that I put into</p>

               <p>your hand just now with that very object, and you said that it was written with a quill. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, it is written in a very shaky hand; it is difficult to form an opinion about it; I really cannot form any opinion in that way at all satisfactory—I now say, on looking at it more carefully that it might be written with a steel pen—there are some indications of a steel pen, but it is written in such a shaky hand that I feel unable to form a decided opinion about it—I have gone through most of them, and I think generally they are written with a quill—I don't know that there is a distinction between a quill and a steel pen—there is a peculiarity about steel-pen writing which sometimes you can speak to with cer<lb/>tainty, and on the occasion on which I examined the letter I formed a strong opinion that it was written with a steel pen—there is no letter I can point to with such firmness of opinion that it was written with a steel pen as the letter of April 19th, and if I had been shown that letter now for the first time I should have been in doubt whether it was written with a steel pen or not, had I seen it under the same circumstances; but when I formed the opinion I was aided by a powerful microscope and a good light—I have seen Mr. Whalley write with a steel pen—I had no quill pens in my office, and when he came in he sometimes would not have his quill pen with him, and he might write with a steel one—I have never been to his house; whether he had any steel pens there or not of course I don't know—I know he always preferred writing with a quill pen, and usually carried one in his pocket—he used it something like a pencil, a little bit, cut short, in some kind of holder which fitted the pen; I can't speak precisely to the exact way in which it was carried.</p>

                  </hi>. I am librarian to the Queen at Windsor—I was formerly for sixteen years in the Manuscript Department of the British Museum—I have had a great deal of experience in deci<lb/>phering documents—I was so employed during the whole time I was at the British Museum—I have inspected what is called the white will—I examined it in the summer of last year in the office at Somerset House—I observed written marks; in my judgment they were the marks of pencil writing—after a careful examination I formed the conclusion that those marks had been put on before the ink had been written on the paper—I looked carefully to see if I could find traces on pencil marks over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170189"/>
               <p>the ink; I could not find any—I came to the conclusion that there had been an attempt to erase pencil marks—from my experience I have found that when an attempt has been made to erase pencil marks, and it is apparently successful for some time, afterwards, in process of time the pencil marks faintly reappear—it is almost practically impossible to remove pencil marks entirely—I believe it is thus, that when a pencil is used, particularly if it is rather a hard one, a furrow is made in the paper by the impression of the pencil on the paper, and that if the pencil particularly has a sharp edge it breaks the filaments of the paper, and when an attempt is made to erase it with indiarubber or any ordinary erasing material, the filaments of the paper are broken up and cover up the furrows, and the dust and other material arising fill up the furrows, and so at first the pencil marks appear to be erased, and it is very diffi<lb/>cult to see them, but in process of time the filaments recover their natural bent, the dust becomes removed when the paper is moved at all, and then the faint traces of the pencil reappear on the paper—as I have said, it is almost impossible completely to destroy the traces of any mark of pencil of almost any material, and a sharp mark I should say absolutely impossible—I have in one or two cases seen that the ink seems to run a little more in places when it is on paper the surface of which has been previously disturbed—in some of the lines on this will I found a crowding together in a marked degree, particularly at the end of the tenth line, and in the middle of that line there is one of those places where the run<lb/>ning of the ink is very apparent—from that tenth line onwards I find a very great distinction to the earlier lines as regards crowding—the writing is smaller, the letters themselves are smaller, there are more words in a line, and the writing altogether is much more cramped, and the spaces left between the particular words are not so great as those left at the beginning of the document—by this light it is hardly possible for me to see the traces of the pencil marks; I see some of them, but it is very difficult for me to read them now on the will—I see one or two—here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the will upon which I made marks when I examined it at Somerset House; this represents what I saw—the first mark I saw of the pencil, in the order of its coming, was a capital "D," which occurs just over the word "Street" in the second line—what Mr. Rodman observed, and has put in red on this other photograph, is prac<lb/>tically coincident with what I saw—it is in the middle of the tenth line of the will that I saw the ink running at the beginning of the word "what's over"—the writing is much thicker there—there is a somewhat addi<lb/>tional thickness and blackness in the writing—there are one or two other cases in which the ink has run, I think several—I have seen these red exhibits (2 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 9) in the handwriting of Thomas—I can see the word "know" on No. 2 of these documents, and the conclusion I have come to is that that is written by the same hand that wrote the "know" on the will—this word "know" is identically peculiar with the first and last of the letters; they are both formed in a peculiar manner, and that peculiar manner appears in all these documents and on the will—besides that there is the capital "D," which occurs in the same manner, and I have come to the conclusion that it was written by the same hand as wrote the capital "D" in this No. 2—there is a very great peculiarity in the manner of commencing that letter—the first stroke begins very high up, and that is to be seen in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188411170190"/>
               <p>several instances in this, notably in one beginning "Dear Sir," when the letters are peculiar and entical—there are several other letters, but those I have mentioned are very peculiar—there is a capital "H," which is also peculiar, over the word "Leominster" in line 2, which is almost identical with the "H" in "Hereford," which occurs in the first of these (No. 2)—there is also the word "will," which occurs at the bottom before the word "know," which I have mentioned, and is in a precisely similar hand—I have looked at the signature "Charles Thomas," on the will; the final "s" is the same as in these letters, and the general character of the writing is the same as the pencil writing attempted to be erased—I think I have pointed out the most conspicuous similarities—I have examined a number of Mr. Whalley's letters, among others the letter of 19th April, 1883—I believe that to be in the same handwriting as the other letters of Mr. Whalley—at the trial in November last year I examined this envelope (25 <hi rend="italic">black</hi>)—it was the first time I had seen it—the conclu<lb/>sion I came to at that time was on looking at the reverse side that the envelope had been subjected to the action of damp, and had been opened and then reclosed, because on looking at the junction of the paper below the flap which is generally opened I found there marks which I see now which showed me that the paper had been distended by the action of damp, and had been closed, and there are two places where the paper is rough, which I never saw in any envelope or paper except what had been wetted, because they are generally made by machinery and are perfectly smooth; it is the lower joining (<hi rend="italic">The envelope was produced as one of those impounded by Mr. Justice Manisty</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFAD</hi>. I drew up a written report of the judgment I formed after my first or second examination in the summer of last year—I have not got it now, I have not seen it or a copy of it since—the reappearance of the pencil marks is simply mechanical, there is no chemical effect—what we call black lead is plumbago—the sharp point of a pencil makes a furrow in the surface of the paper, and then if an attempt is made to erase the pencil marks the minute filaments of the fabric paper closes over the furrow so that it looks a fiat surface, though the furrow is underneath, and when the filaments resume their erect position you see what is underneath, the remains of it, the greater part of the plumbago being taken away by the action of rubbing with the indiarubber; so that in order to establish that something had been im<lb/>pressed on the paper and then the pencil erased, so as to reappear it is to some extent an essential condition of that theory that the surface of the paper must have been disturbed by the action of the pencil to an extent sufficient to allow the filaments of the paper to close over the furrow—a light touch of a pencil would of course leave a very slight furrow behind—it is possible to make a mark on paper with plumbago without any furrow at all with a light and dextrous hand, or by putting a pencil piece of paper over a plain piece and rubbing with the hand—an entry on one leaf of a pocket-book will make marks on the opposite leaf after a little time, when it has been pressed—there would in those cases be no furrow in the paper to which the pencil marks had been transferred, no breach whatever of the continuity in the surface of the paper—have been able to point out a spot where continuity of the surface of this paper has been broken; the last pencil mark on this paper, just within 1/3in. from the "y" of "Whalley in the signature, that if not the only one, that is a</p>

               <p>particular instance—I think the whole fibers of the paper have been dis<lb/>turbed wherever the pencil can be traced—I think I was asked that question at the Queen's Bench—I said "I think I have been able to trace it"—I think I could see by examination with a glass the marks of interferences with the surface—"I think I have been able to trace it, but the disturbance is so minute it is hardly possible to, particularly after a paper has been worn and been in many hands"—that was my answer and my judgment at that time; I don't alter my judgment—I think I have been able to trace it, I say that now—I see distinctly the greyish colour of a faint pencil, not merely a scratch or furrow—I am able to distinguish it (<hi rend="italic">The Counsel read a portion of the shorthand notes of this witness's examination at the trial in the Queen's Bench.

I can hardly say at this time what that spot is, with this light I cannot see well enough—I think I said that the whole of the paper had been disturbed above the signature. (<hi rend="italic">The Counsel read a portion of the notes immediately preceding and including what he had previously read.</hi>) The place near the attestation clause is the place I pointed out just now—the disturbance of the paper, unless there had been some wilful effort to conceal it, would be there still, to a very slight degree I think, because with regard to the filaments recover<lb/>ing their natural bent, I may explain that this paper has been laid under considerable pressure, and handed about, and the original condition of its surface is very different now from what it was when I first examined it at Somerset House—I have not seen it worn in any improper way—there is an appearance of disturbance all over the paper, but I consider that the original disturbance of the surface of the paper by indiarubber, or whatever erasive substance was used, is not to be distinguished now from any other disturbance from the natural wear of the paper, by being mixed and carried about with other papers and being pressed; even where the original disturbance in a paper of that sort is very minute, the very putting of two or three other papers on it, and leaving it for an hour, would have an effect on it—I think in Court I have seen other papers laid on it—the way in which it is kept folded up in an envelope, and in a box with other papers, would give a pressure which would restore to the filaments their original bent, and the disturbance would appear less afterwards—I doubt very much whether the Jury with any appliances could see the disturbance at this time—I cannot trace any indentations now on the paper of the words I suggest to be in pencil, I could at first—I think I said in my report that there were very strong indications of pencil marks, I could not be certain if I said that there were indentations—I cannot say I ever used that particular word—I certainly intended to give the impression in my report that there were furrows, scores, or in<lb/>dentations on the surface of the paper; my term, "marks," was intended to apply to every kind of effect a pencil might have on the surface of paper. (<hi rend="italic">Counsel reading from the shorthand notes of the trial in the Queen's Bench:</hi> "I cannot see indentations now, but it appears to me there must have been an indentation at the word Whalley; that also is an indenta<lb/>tion with pencil.")

(<hi rend="italic">Counsel read another passage from the shorthand notes of the Queen's Bench trial.</hi>) I mean now as I meant by my answer at the other trial, that the only mark to which I paid particular attention was that about half an inch from the James Whalley—I don't mean to sug<lb/>gest it was the only one I observed, and that others may not have been there which I did not observe—I was there to observe and make a report on it—I should say it may be that if that was the only one observable that was the only one capable of being observed, the only one capable of notice—that one I did observe, and I do not wish to say that I observed any more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. My opinion is this envelope had been subjected to damp, opened and refastened, and that depends on the edges of the lower juncture of the back of the envelope, particularly on the right hand side—it looks as if there had been some slight disturbance of where the envelope in the first instance was gummed together and then severed—I came to that inference from this: when that envelope was opened the whole of the gum with which it was fastened became liquefied, and the whole envelope came open and whole paper was dis<lb/>tended with moisture, and to close it again it was necessary first to fasten down the lower part, which had been more disturbed, and in fastening it down there came two places on the edges which you can see, I think—my argument is that no machine did that, and therefore something else did it, and therefore it has been done twice over—I pre<lb/>sume that it came from the machine in a proper condition and properly fastened down—envelopes occasionally are not properly fastened down; in that case the piece of paper is perfectly flat—I assume this envelope must once have been in a perfect condition—it is not in a perfect con<lb/>dition now, but it is fastened up, and therefore somebody must have fastened it up—if it was originally not in a perfect condition and some<lb/>body fastened it up then it would be one operation and not two—this letter to Emma Priestman, 19th April, is of the same character as Whalley's handwriting—I think the first part of it shows a slight difference—it seems more formal than his usual cursive hand—his usual handwriting, as far as my experience goes, is very free—Mr. Whalley's is generally a free hand; the beginning of this letter is not—I think the first half is formal, and then he lapses into his original ordinary free writing—the first part is not his usual free handwriting—I have noticed some difference between the formation of some of the letters and his ordinary hand—the capital "L" at the beginning is in his own hand and the date—the first letter of his name, James Whalley, the "J," is different to his usual writing—here it goes straight up—I have made handwriting a study to some extent—it is undoubtedly one of the modes by which forged writing is detected to see whether a word has been painted, and the pen lifted at an unnatural part of the letter—in the fetter of 19th April I did not see any trace of the pen having been lifted</p>

               <p>at the top of the letters "h," "r," and "i"—I don't think the pen has been lifted at the top of these letters—I can't express a confident opinion that it has not been—I should require to examine a good many letters and combinations of letters of the same kind before I gave an opinion whether, if there were three such breaks with such a writer as Mr. Whalley it would create suspicion—it would depend on the character and direction of the strokes a good deal—the letter "A" in April is disjoined—I have not looked through the other letters to see if the "A" in April is formed in the same fashion—I have looked at most of the letters—I can't tell whether that is the usual way in which Mr. Whalley formed his "A"—I made a report on that letter—I was cross-examined on it at the other trial, and I then said I came to the conclusion that that was Mr. Whalley's handwriting—I do not think I made a written report.</p>

I am a solicitor practising at Leominster in partnership with my father—he has been in practice there over 40 years—I was at Leominster in May, 1881—I remember seeing the will of 21st March—my father brought it into the office on Saturday, the day of Mr. Whalley's death—I looked it over, read it over, and I read it on some other occasions, before it went to Hereford, several times—an engrossment was made in the office—I did not then notice any marks upon it, nothing at all to attract my attention—towards the end of August litigation commenced concerning the will—I communicated with Bees, one of the attesting witnesses—he came to our office for the purpose of making a statement with reference to the execution of the will—he did make a statement, which I took down in writing in his presence—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 19th August, 1881—it is in my handwriting—there is another statement of 1st December, 1881, and a third of 20th March, 1882. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "19th August, 1881. I reside next door to Mr. Thomas's house, where the late Mr. James Whalley was lodging. On 21st March last Mr. Charles Thomas called upon me and said Mr. Whalley wished me to go to him. I went accordingly. Mr. Whalley was then recovering from an illness. He said he wished to trouble me to witness his signature. I was not much acquainted with Mr. Whalley. I had not the least reason to doubt about his being in a fit state for the business. Mr. Thomas William Nash, but no one else, was present at the time. Mr. Whalley signed his will in the presence of myself and Nash. Nash then signed as witness, and I did the same, both in the presence of Mr. Whalley and in the presence of each other. Nothing particular was said by Mr. Whalley or Nash. I had no suspicion of anything wrong. I had witnessed a will before for Mr. Whalley, about 10 days before the will already mentioned. The will was in his own handwriting, and he complained his hand was not steady. He was not well then, but apparently able to go about in the usual way. When Nash and myself came downstairs on 21st March after having seen Whalley sign the will, I heard a knock at the street door, and saw Dr. Barnett, the surgeon, enter the house. I knew he was attending Mr. Whalley professionally." <hi rend="italic">The statement of 1st December:</hi> "Additional evidence of Mr. Rees: I am</p>

               <p>certain the first will witnessed for Mr. Whalley was witnessed about 10 days prior to the 21st March, 1881, because Mr. Whalley was at that time, although unwell, able to get up and go about partially. This will was witnessed by Moyle and myself in Whalley's sitting-room, and he fell ill a few days after signing the first will, and he then took to his bed, and was in bed on 21st March, which was the day on which the second will, prepared by Nash was signed. I only witnessed one will with Alfred Moyle." <hi rend="italic">The Third Statement of Edward Rees:</hi> "I am certain the first time I attended with Moyle to witness the will of Mr. Whalley was on 1st March, The second will we witnessed is dated on that day, which was a Monday, and therefore the first will would be dated Saturday, 1st March. I am sure about this because Mrs. Thomas, the defendant Thomas's wife, expected to be confined about this time, and it was on 12th March that the defendant Thomas left instructions for a telegram with the witness's wife to be sent to Ludlow in case the confinement happened on that day. It was on this day, March 12th, that witness was in the garden at J.B. Dowding's dwelling-house, Charles Thomas came to him and asked him to go to Whalley and act as witness. He does not remember Moyle's name being mentioned. When sent for as a witness he went and met Moyle at Whalley's, who stated he wanted him and Moyle to sign a paper. Does not remember Whalley called it a will, but that what he wanted was on account of the uncertainty of death. Understood it to be a will written on two sides of a sheet of blue paper, and the size of ordinary note-paper. When he witnessed the will on March 25th Mr. Whalley had it in his hands, and looked over it, that is read it to himself, before he signed it.") Those statements were given by Mr. Rees in my presence—I have often taken statements from witnesses in these cases—was in London on 10th June, when the compromise was made at the Probate Court—after we came out I went to the Inns of Court Hotel; I was staying there—I met Mr. Turner as I was crossing the hall from the Lincoln's Inn end to the Holborn end; he stopped me and expressed discontent with the terms of the compromise—he said Thomas ought not to have more than 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he asked me whether he would not have been content with that amount—I said "Certainly not; if I had my way we should never have compromised at all"—he then said "Well, you are mistaken if you think the fighting is over, we have not done it all yet," or words to that effect—I remember the letter to Emma Priest<lb/>man being produced shortly before the trial at the Probate Court—three or four affidavits of documents were made; it was the fourth affidavit of documents that disclosed that letter—directly I saw it I instructed Mr. Chabot, the expert, with reference to the genuineness of that letter, and I received a report from him—he is dead.

               <p>writing—I saw the word "know" at the bottom—I examined that last year in connection with writing of Thomas's—I can't say now whether that word "know" is very similar to Thomas's writing; I should like to see it—I said I thought it had a general resemblance—I had writing of Thomas's in my possession for the purpose of comparison—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a document that Thomas wrote for me to compare with—I have not seen any letters of his since—I don't remember seeing any documents of his at the trial, unless these are they—I believe these three documents were shown to me—I said then that the handwriting of those pieces which were written for me, appeared to be that of a man who was asked to give a specimen of his handwriting; there is a certain amount of difference between that and the natural handwriting of a man not asked to give a specimen—I looked at the writing in the little black book. (<hi rend="italic">It was handed to the witness.</hi>) There is certainly a good deal of difference in the writing here at different times; some is stiffer, and some freer—I should not say that had anything to do with the pen that was used; there is an attempt at printing—I don't think it is all written by the same pen; the difference might have something to do with the pen—one of the things in the letter to Emma Priestman that strikes me as not being genuine is the capital Y; I think that is an uneducated thing—the word "you" occurs several times in the letter without a capital Y; that is the only place in which it occurs with a capital Y in the middle of a sentence—it did not occur to me that there was anything in the sense which might account for that capital Y there—I can't say whether the writer might want to put emphasis on the word "You" in that place; I did not con<lb/>sider that at all—that capital Y was one of the things that led me to think it was not a genuine letter; it is not like any other capital Y in the letter—I observe in the word "have," in the second line, and in other places, a little horizontal stroke at the top of the "h"—that is rather a peculiar way of forming that letter—I do not see any other "h" made in that way—I have not observed that that peculiar mode of forming the occurs occasionally in the genuine letters—I should like to see them—I see a small stroke at the top of the "h" in "have," in the fifth line—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at two letters to Mr. Greig of 24th January</hi>, 1881, <hi rend="italic">and 5th February</hi>) here is a loop at the top of the "h" here—I find the "h" made in various ways; sometimes with a stroke down, and sometimes without any mark at the top.</p>

                  </hi>. In May, 1881, I was clerk to Messrs. Lloyd and Son, Leominster—I recollect this will of 21st March being brought into the office, and seeing it in the office—I made the engrossment from it for probate—I examined it carefully when I had it in my hand—I read the will to my fellow-clerk, who had the engrossment as we examined it—I certainly did not notice any marks upon it then—afterwards, in November, 1882, I went to the Registry at Hereford and examined the will on a desk, I believe, occupied by Mr. Arnold—Mr. Earle then pointed some marks out on the will, but in the course of our examination we found others—I should think we were at the Registry from half an hour to three-quarters, Mr. Lloyd and myself, with the will before us—a clerk was not with us all the time; Mr. Earle was the only one when we went in, I believe, and he produced the will, and then went and sat down behind his desk that has been described—the other clerk came in afterwards;</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say the partition was about four feet six to the top—Mr. Earle sat at a table—there was only the desk, no partition between us—as he was at the table he was lower down than we were at the desk, and could not see what we were doing on the top of the desk—both table and desk stood on the floor, but the table was very much lower than the desk, where we were looking at the will which was too high for him to see anything we were doing unless he stood up; I can't say we watched Mr. Earle to see if he stood up, we were busy with the will.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 57, South Street, Leominster—about the last week in July, 1882, I went to Gunnell's office in Church Street—when there, Captain Gunnell came in—a door opens from the office into the dining-room; after Captain Gunnell had spoken to me he went into the dining-room, I don't know who was there, he asked me where his father was—I was in the office when Captain Gunnell went into the dining-room—he spoke to Gunnell, his father, and said, "Rees is coming to see you and he is in a hurry, he wants to see you and he is in a hurry to go"—Captain Gunnell then came into the office again and said something to me, in consequence of which I went into the passage which leads to the office, Captain Gunnell also left the office—I saw nobody in the passage till Rees came to the door and went into the office from which I bad come out; Captain Gunnell had gone away, I remained in the passage—when Rees went into the office the door was shut—there is a door into the office from the street through the dining-room, not into the passage—when Rees had gone into the office I heard a conversation between him and Gunnell. I was then at the door between the office and the passage—the door was opened, I believe, by Mr. Gunnell after Rees had been in about five minutes, I could not say who opened the door—I heard high words, quarrelling between Mr. Gunnell and Rees; and when the door was partly opened I heard Rees say to Mr. Gunnell "If I can't have the money of you I can have it of the other side"—Gunnell said "Go and get it, go out of my office, you scamp," and then he shut the door—when he did so Rees was still in the office standing just inside, and Gunnell stood with the door in his hand—Rees did not go when he was told for a minute or so, but the door was shut and he remained in the office—in about half a minute or two he came out of the office, and Gunnell slammed the door as if he was in a passion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to take an order for four iron gates for Mr. Gunnell's house at Kingsland—I could not hear what passed when Rees first went inside, but in about five minutes one of them opened the door and I heard what was said, and then the door opened and Rees came out—I don't think I could have said just now that Gunnell stood with the door in his hand and Rees came out about half a minute later, if I did I must have made a mistake, he came out before the door was shut.</p>

I live at 39, Bridge Street, Leominster—about the first week in August, 1882, I was in Gunnell's place of business, in which, as you go in from the street, there is a bar and a small room, and out of that there is another room with no door between them, the second room is not large—I was at the bar in the next room and Rees stood at</p>

               <p>the bar in the other room, I was about as far from him as the farthest juryman—Gunnell came and brought me some ale and said "John, keep your ear open a minute," or words that meant "Take notice"—when Gunnell went back again Rees said to him "You had better come along with me to Mr. Turner"—Gunnell replied "What have I got to do with Mr. Turner, if you want to go to Mr. Turner go yourself"—at that time Thomas came in, and Gunnell said to Bees "There is the man, he can speak for himself"—Rees said when Thomas came in "You promised me 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"I am not quite certain whether it was 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Or not—Thomas said "You are a liar"—Rees said "You promised myself I will have it if I have the shirt off your back, if I go to gaol for it"—Thomas and Rees then went away.</p>

               <p>about 1 o'clock in the day, the prisoner called at my house—he gave the name of George Farmer, and said that he had come for the pur<lb/>pose of reporting himself once a week for three months, and if I would let him in he would tell me his story—I did let him in—I understood him to say that he had lived in our parish for some years past, but he had got into trouble, that he had sold a barrow that was not his own, and he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment at Wandsworth Gaol—I understood him to say that he had come out the day before, that he desired to get a fresh start, that he had had a good deal of advice from Mr. Horsley, who, among other things, had recommended him to emigrate; that he saw the emigration agent, and, being obliged to tell him the truth, they would not accept him, but told him that his only chance was to get a three months' character from the clergyman of the parish—I understood him to say that Mr. Horsley was Chaplain of Wandsworth Gaol, but that I can't be certain of—he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some bloaters with, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the hire of a barrow or basket, and as it was Saturday it was all-important that he should not lose a moment, because Saturday was the costermonger's best day, and he wanted to get to Billingsgate to get the bloaters—I advanced him altogether 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believed his statement to be true—he said of his own accord that he would see me each Saturday, and he would like to have a half-hour's conversa<lb/>tion—I found in the afternoon that the address he gave was false—I never saw him again till he was in custody.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister-in-law—he is a coal porter—I saw Mr. Edwards on the second day after he came out of prison—they got jangling over the money, and because it was not shared equally between them they got to fighting, and next day Thomas Edwards stopped me in Woolwich and asked how my husband's brother got on, that is the prisoner—I said, "He is remanded for a week"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "Mrs. Wheeler said he had the handkerchief, and Mrs. Smith said he had the base"—Edwards told me he had the handkerchief, and asked me to go to his place, as the prisoner was quite innocent of this case, and he, Edwards, had changed a sovereign at the Prince Albert.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of 168, Trafalgar Road, East geen<lb/>wich—the prisoner was my manager and first salesman on 21st October, and had been filling that position for two months—when my salesmen make a sale to a customer in business or out I provide each of them with a book which contains an invoice with my name, and that is filled in and given to the customer; they are numbered, and on the other side is a corresponding duplicate which is also filled in, and the two are torn out together and taken to the cashier at once—this is the prisoner's book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it has the name of Towns on it in his handwriting—this is the duplicate I spoke of—he has never accounted to me for the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for cashmere sold to Mrs. Lyons on 21st October—this is one of my bills in the transaction in question—on the evening of the 21st, from information received, I sent for the police after business hours—he was not charged then; we did not know his address—the following morning he was charged with embezzling 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was going to keep the money until he had sold this particular customer more goods, and then he intended handing it over in one large amount—I said I should give him in charge—he then went down on one knee, and put his hands in a praying position, and asked me to forgive him, as he would be a ruined man—this paper, No. 39, was brought to me after business on</p>

               <p>Monday evening by Heath, all torn in pieces, and I put it together as it is now—I asked the prisoner before the constable to account for the 39 cheque which was missing, and he said, as I have told you, that he was going to keep the money until he had sold these customers more goods—I did not mention about the cheque being torn up—he said nothing else than what I have repeated—the constable took him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His duty was to pay it over immediately—Heath has not to my knowledge received money and not paid it over till next afternoon, it has been brought to me since this case—Heath is the junior hand—only one instance has come to my knowledge, and that at Green-wich Police-court, in which Heath left some money in one of the recesses against the shop fixtures and paid it over next morning, but we held the cheques at the same time—I had not given the prisoner notice to leave, I told him he was not suiting me, and if he did not attend to his duty better than he had been doing, I should have to make a change, no more was said—he gave me notice on the evening preceding this charge—he said he would stay on for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or for any sum providing I got rid of Heath—he has made complaints about Heath to me, and I have communi<lb/>cated them to Heath—it was Heath told me he saw the prisoner tear up the duplicate—the prisoner had been in my employment before, and when he came back he advised me to adopt this particular system of duplicates—after he left me the first time I did not write, and when he called offer him the situation a second time, I am sure of that—I don't think he came in after he left the first time, and said "If I had charge of this business again, I could make it pay well," I should say not—there was a lapse of about eighteen months between his leaving and being employed again—I might have written asking him to call, I believe it was to dress a window—I can swear I did not ask him if he was in earnest about what he said on the previous evening about making the business pay—I made an agreement with him—he came to me and said he was leaving, and I had to wait seven weeks till he could come into the situation—he came to the shop on this morning at his usual hour, nine; immediately he came in I told him to step upstairs, I did not say good morning to him—a detective was waiting outside—I asked him to explain to this gentle<lb/>man about No. 39 cheque which was missing, he did not pull the money out of his pocket, he did not say "Here is the money, I intended to get another order and make the cheque larger," he said what I have stated previously—I asked him to explain about No. 39 which was missing, and he said "If you get my book you might find it there"—I knew that to be the 39 duplicate that Heath says the prisoner tore up in his presence—he volunteered that statement—I think I sent for the book—he did not look surprised when the book came and the duplicate was not there—I then said I should charge him with embezzling the money, and then he went down on his knees—he did not say he never intended to keep the money permanently—he was excited, the detective was in the room—he said nothing about "I admit having the money, but I never intended to embezzle it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the police-court twice, but only gave evidence once—I made a mistake before when I said that the prisoner instituted this system of duplicate cheques—I have not heard what the prosecutor said—I have heard him speaking to Mr. Newton about it, and also one of the others—before he came there were no duplicates, but we entered the amount on small cheques and balanced the money with the cheques—the prisoner would have a particular place to keep his book in the same as the rest—it would not be lying about the shop as a rule—I suppose he would put it anywhere he liked on his side—his name was written in it—I was not present when he charged Heath with stealing—when Heath picked up these pieces of paper he only said "I am going to have a look at these" as he put them in his pocket—it is an uncommon thing for bits of paper of that kind to be behind the counter—I never destroy a duplicate—if I make a mistake it is made void by the prisoner or Mr. Newton—the prisoner would have a right to make void a duplicate—he openly told me to make 39 void as he had given it by mis<lb/>take to a customer—that was in Heath's presence—I don't know if he was listening—I don't think I told Mr. Newton at first I had seen Heath pick up the pieces of paper—I did the following morning—I have seen pieces of paper thrown down behind the counter before—I can't say how many pieces he picked up—this was about four; I can't fix the time—I have heard the prisoner talking to Mr. Newton about the discipline of the shop—he may have fined me; I think only once—I don't know if he told Mr. Newton he had fined me—he has spoken about Heath to Mr. Newton—I don't know what he has said—I think he has made complaints about him.</p>

I am an assistant to Mr. Newton—between 3 and 4 on the afternoon of 21st Oct., I saw the prisoner taking some cashmere out of the shop—I saw him come back—I believe he had the goods then—he took out one parcel in white paper and brought a piece of white paper and the parcel, I believe, back with him; I don't know if there were patterns in it as well—when he came back I heard him say to Miss Brown No. 39 would be missing out of his book next morning, because he had given it to a customer by mistake—before that in the afternoon I was standing behind the counter and I saw the prisoner cut off a length of cashmere—shortly after he said that to Miss Brown I saw him come over to the other counter, open his book, take something out, tear it up, and throw it down behind the counter—I picked up the pieces and put them in my pocket; these are they—they were afterwards pasted together by Mr. Newton—I said something to Miss Brown about them.</p>

I Live at 8, Clarendon Street, and am a labourer—on Sunday, 21st September, about half-past 12 o'clock in the morning, I was with a man named Murphy and Arnold at the top of Clarendon Street—we all three went to a coffee stall at the top of Bermondsey New Road; we met on the road Harris, William Piggott, Margaret Good<lb/>son, and Annie Keefe—I did not know her, but I knew Goodson—Goodson said to me "What cheer, Punch?"—I said "What cheer, Mog?"—Harris immediately after that came round and struck me in the jaw—I said "What did you do that for?"—he then hit me again, and said, "What did you want to kick her for?"—I had not touched her—I hit him and knocked him against the shutters—Arnold then held me back and said "I am more his equal than you"—I got away from Arnold and struck Harris in the face—he then went to the shutters and pulled some<lb/>thing from underneath the left breast of his coat and struck me in the back—I then found that I was stabbed—Harris then ran away and Arnold after him—I was taken to the hospital; when I got there I found that Arnold was there—he was wounded also.</p>

I am a labourer, living at Tabard Street—on the night of 20th September I was with Nash at a friendly meeting, and about 20 minutes past 12 we went to the top of Clarendon Street, and there met Arnold—we all three then went along to Old Kent Road to a coffee stall—we met Harris with two or three women—Nash spoke to the girls and said "Halloa, Mog"—with that Harris struck him in the jaw and said "What did you kick her for?"—with that Harris stepped back and Nash ran towards him—I stood on the causeway and saw Harris running along by the shirt shop as if trying to get away from Nash—he fell back towards the shops—Arnold ran after him, and I ran towards him to see what was the matter—I saw Arnold stagger back, and he said "I am stabbed"—he then fell—I ran after Harris—a gentleman threw Nash's coat across my shoulders and threw his hat on the ground—I ran after Harris down towards Tabard Street—he was taken into custody as he was walking up from Falstaff Yard, and I and the constable and Harris went to the station—I was sober and so was Nash and Arnold.</p>

I live at Kent Cottages, Lovegrove Street, Old Kent Road, and am a laundry woman—about half-past twelve on this Sunday morning I was with Margaret Goodson and Elizabeth Pace going along the Old Kent Road—we met the prisoner, and while we were talking a man named Piggott came up, and soon after Nash and Arnold came up—I had not seen them before, nor Harris, but I knew Piggott—Nash and Arnold pushed up against us—there was another man with them, who I believe was Murphy—Arnold made a kick at one of us; it did not touch us—the prisoner then turned round and said "Don't interfere with these girls, they did not interfere with you"—Arnold then turned round and struck the prisoner in the face, causing his nose to bleed—the prisoner then turned round and struck him a blow in the face—they then struggled together and fell, and while struggling a lot of fellows came up Great Weston Street, and said to Piggott "Come on, let us have his lot," and they knocked Piggott down and kicked him—I don't know any of the chaps—while the three were struggling I saw the prisoner make a blow at Nash—I did not see what was in his hand; I thought it was his hand—I saw no more, and after I heard that the deceased was stabbed I saw Arnold lying on the ground; I don't know how he came there—I heard that Harris had run off, but I did not see him run—I afterwards saw Nash and Arnold taken in cabs to the hospital, and I saw Piggott brought back by a policeman, and I went home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't remember after Arnold struck the prisoner on the nose and he returned the blow his moving back a few yards—Arnold and Nash knocked him down and kicked him, and also knocked down Piggott and kicked him—the prisoner then said "Let us get up; oh, they are killing me"—I saw them kick him—the prisoner asked to be allowed to get up and he would fight them one at a time; they would not let him get up—Nash had got hold of the prisoner when Arnold and Harris were struggling together.</p>

               <p>and Nash and Arnold—I heard Harris say "I will do for you, you b——" that was to Arnold—a wrestle then took place, and I heard Arnold say "I am stabbed"—I ran to fetch a policeman, and in about five minutes I came back and Arnold was took to the hospital—I saw Nash standing by a lamp-post—there was a cab standing there, and I put him into the cab to go to the hospital.</p>

On Sunday morning, 21st Sept., about a quarter past 1, I was on duty in the Old Kent Road—Hanson came to me; in consequence of what he said I went across the road and saw Arnold insensible in the arms of two men, bleeding very profusely from the left thigh—I saw blood on the pavement—I at once got a cab, and with assistance lifted him in and took him to Guy's Hospital—Nash was also brought there in a cab; he had been stabbed—I saw a mark on his back—Nash handed me a hat—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station without a hat—he was apparently shamming drunkenness—I tried the hat on him; he said it was his—on 3rd October I was outside his cell while Ferris was examining him to see if there were any marks on his arm, and I heard the prisoner say "I would like to serve you, you b—, the same as I served the other two, and would if I had the same tools"—when I first saw him at the station there were some marks of blood and mud on his face.</p>

I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital on Sunday morning, 21st September, when Arnold was brought in, about 1.20—he had a wound on the outer side of the left thigh, near the upper part between two and three inches deep, and about lour inches long—he was in a state of extreme prostration from heamorrhage, and was in danger from that—he was unconscious, and almost pulseless—he rallied—I attended him till 25th October, when he died—in the meantime Dr. Goodheart had seen him once or twice, and was present at the post<lb/>mortem—the cause of death was pyaemia, resulting from the wound—that is a species of blood-poisoning—the wound formed an abscess on the lungs; that was a sign of the pyaemia—that is a very common result from a serious wound.</p>
