That the next Morning one of the Watchmen came, and told him, the Window was open, so he went and secur'd the Prisoner, and her Maid, the Maid being about making a Fire, and the Prisoner above Stairs dressing herself; that he telling her that she was his Prisoner, and must go before the Justice, she said she would not go without a Coach; he then ask'd her, If she had any Money to pay for it? she said, Yes, she had two Guineas, and that was all the Money she had in the World, and pulled out a Pistole, and gave him, saying, there is a Guinea, do you pay for the Coach, and give me the Change; that he looking upon it, said, Madam, this is not a Guinea, it is a Pistole, that the Prosecutor said presently, I had but one Pistole in my Money, and looking upon it, said, this is my Pistole, it is mark'd, and I know it by that to be mine. That she deny'd the having the Prosecutor's Money still, he thereupon got a Coach, lock'd up the Door, and carried her and her Maid to go before the Lord Mayor; but going to the Swan Tavern to wait while they could know that the Lord Mayor was at leisure, there she desired to have some Talk with the Prosecutor, and after that, said, well, if you say so, my Maid shall go with you, and you shall have all your Things; that thereupon he took Coach, went back with the Maid and some other Persons to the House, and she taking up a Case-Knife, went up Stairs, ript the Feather-Bed about a Foot in length, and feeling among the Feathers, pulled out a Clout, in which was 45 Guineas, and then going down into the Cellar, took the Watch and Snuff-Box from out of some Rubbish; after which going back to the Tavern, the Captain upon telling the Money, said, there was 46 Guineas in his Purse, and now there wanted a Guinea, upon which the Prisoner put her Hand in her Pocket, and gave him a Guinea.</p>

               <p>This it does in a way so regular and gentle, both by Stool and Urine, and with a Does each Time, so small and pleasant (the Quantity but of a Nutmeg) that the nicest Persons are as well surprized as delighted with it, and the more, as it agrees with every ones Constitution, hinders no Business, nor gives the least Suspicion to the nearest Relation.</p>
               <p>In a very small space of Time (living temperately ) it rids away a mild CLAP; and those more severe according to their several Degrees of Malignity .</p>
               <p>There never was, or can be, in the whole Art of Physick contrived, any Medicine or Method, capable of performing the Cure more certainly, more safely, or more speedily, for it is so compleatly adapted to every Circumstance of the Infection, and so fully answers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173101150026"/> the several Intentions of curing, that it is impossible it should once fail.</p>
