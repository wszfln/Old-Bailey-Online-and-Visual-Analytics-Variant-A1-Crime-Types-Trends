                  </hi>. I received from my son authority to collect the rent from the prisoner—I told her so, and showed her the authority—it was in writing—I have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—my son was then in gaol—on 15th Aug. I gave instructions to Mr. Webb to go there—I subsequently received a message from Mr. Webb, in consequence of which, I went myself—I went into the room—Mr. and Mrs. Browning began—I told them all I wanted was for them to settle the rent, and to know when it would be convenient for them to give up the apartments—she abused me, and called me every<lb/>thing, and said I had struck her—I never struck her, nor attempted to strike her—Mr. Webb was there, Mr. Target, and Mr. Knapp—the prisoner was very violent—her husband was between her and me, otherwise, I think, she would have scratched my face; however, she did not—she never touched me, and I never touched her—I never put my fist in her face—I might have lifted my hand, and said, "You owe me so much rent," but I never put my fist in her face—I did not touch her nose, or tear her finger—I never touched her—I used no violence to her at all from first to last—I saw a man in the room as well as her husband, and a woman also—they were examined before the Magistrate—Mr. Target and Mr. Webb were examined—Mr. Knapp was not examined there—I do not know the names of the other man and woman—I do not know what that man was—I believe bin to be a tailor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I know Mr. Browning, the prisoner's husband—on the day in question I was in Mr. Browning's room—I was not there immediately preceding the affair—the first I saw of it was two or three men endeavouring to force their entrance into Mrs. Browning's room, and she was endeavouring to keep them back—she had previous to that been struck, I should say ten minutes previously—she was bleeding at the time—I did not see the blow struck—it was struck previous to my coming in—I saw the blood on her finger, or thumb—it had been torn—it was a scratch—I advised her not to take the law into her own hands, but to seek pro<lb/>tection from a Magistrate—there was not a great deal of blood from her thumb—it was a tear, I should think, half an inch long—I saw the blood flowing from the thumb—I saw it drop on the ground—I heard Mr. Watts use a great deal of violent language—he demanded his rent—a policeman was sent for—I advised him to be sent for—I believe the daughter went for him—I saw Mr. Watts draw, or try to draw, Mrs. Browning out of her room—she was standing in the passage at the time, near the door—I am quite satisfied that I saw her thumb cut, and blood flowing from it.</p>

Q.</hi> Was there a pool of blood on the floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; spots, not particularly large spots—I should say I saw three or four spots—it was sufficient to say that she had been torn—Mr. Watts was there when I went there, inciting the people to force their entrance into the room—there were several people there, I should say four or five—Mr. Watts was there, in the passage—the men were endeavouring to force their entrance—I was then in the room—I and Mrs. Browning prevented them forcing their way in—I endeavoured to keep them out, because I considered she was being very much ill used—nobody struck her but Mr. Watts, to my knowledge—she had been struck previous to my going in—I did not force my way into the room—I knocked at the door, and it was opened by some person inside—I can<lb/>not say who it was—it was a man—I had been in there about ten minutes before I saw Mr. Watts use this violence—there had been a great deal of disturbance before I went in—the first thing I saw when I went in was Mrs. Browning standing in the room, in a very agitated state—I did not pass Mr. Watts and the rest of the people to get into the room—I believe Mr. Watts was behind one or two more that were in the passage—I had to go through a portion of the passage to get to the room—I did not go through the whole passage—I did not pass Mr. Watts—he was in the passage—the door is in the centre of the passage—I passed the one that opened the door—I have no doubt he was one that was forcing his way into the room—there were two or three in the room—Mr. Browning was there, and a man of the name of Lee—I was not before the Magistrate—I have not been in Court to-day, I have been outside—I was not subpoenaed here to-day—I was not told to come here—I came voluntarily—I told the prisoner's attorney, Mr. Henning, that I had seen the affray—I saw him this morning, when I came down to the Court—I am a tailor—Mr. Browning is a tailor—I merely called there on this day—we call on one another occasionally—this morning was the first time I mentioned to anybody what I saw, with respect to being here—I have told it to my wife—I have not talked about it to Mr. Browning—he saw me there, and so did Mrs. Browning.</p>

Hankeys', and found Eiley there—she was pointed out to me as the person who had offered the cheque, and I gave her into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque.</p>

I own to the one thing that I picked up at the corner of the court; I had it in my hand, and this prisoner, Hands, wanted to pass; I stood up for him to pass, and Jackson seized me; he said that I struggled, and there were twenty or thirty persons in the court; could he struggle with me in this close passage, and not lose sight of these things that he said I threw? when they were brought to him he put them in his pocket; there was no struggle; I only said, "Mr. Jackson, that will do, I don't want to be killed by you;" he searched me, and found nothing but 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a bit of tobacco.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Brompton, and am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. On 16th Aug., I was summoned to the house in Hill-street—I immediately went to the room where the body of the deceased was lying on the bed—it was cold and stiff—there was a large pool of blood on the left side of the body, extending from the seat of the wound to the hips—the body was horizontal—I conclude that the blood must have flowed at a time when the body wan semi-upright, before it was in the position in which I found it—it would not have flowed in that way after it was in that position—there was not blood on the floor, as there would have been if she was sitting quite upright—there was no blood in that part of the bed where her head would have been lying if she was asleep; it must have been done after the head was removed from the pillow—I examined her arms—the right wristband of her dress was marked with Wood, and a little above it on the inside—there were some detached marks of blood on the outside of the arm, by the elbow, and very little marking of blood at any other part of that right sleeve—the left arm was lying extended by the side of the body in the pool of blood—I carefully examined the wound—it was about four inches in extent, extending from a point level with the ear on the left side, two inches behind, passing downward and forward towards the windpipe, dividing vital parts in its way—there</p>

               <p>was a slight turning out of the wound towards the windpipe, which would lead me to infer that it had commenced behind—the right side of the neck was not touched, nor any other part of the neck—death would follow very rapidly from such a wound in an old person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your brother surgeon, I think, said that none of the arteries were divided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The internal jugular vein was divided quite through; the carotid artery and other important parts had escaped—it was not such a very severe injury as I have seen—the artery often escapes, it lies deep there—it was very remarkable that it should have escaped, because it lay about as deep as the vein, and the vein is a larger vessel and more distended, and therefore would arrive at a higher level—there is no pre<lb/>dicating what amount of muscular power even an old person would hare under certain stimulants—there was no mark of struggling or violence about the body, or on the fingers, or hands, and no bruises—I examined carefully—I examined the right hand side of the body, there were mere stains of blood there—the edge of the pillow that was lying by the side of the deceased was dipped into the blood, and a clean towel had been placed over it as if to cover the blood—the anterior part of the wound turned a little upwards, which is against the notion of its having been done by herself, and so is the fact of the wound having been done in a semi-erect posture; because that would not be a position that a person would take to commit an act of that kind, they would be sitting forward—if it was done sitting up, the blood would have been on the floor—I had not attended the deceased before—I ascertained that she was ruptured—that has very little effect upon a person when of long duration—I have not known it affect the spirits in any remarkable degree.</p>

Leaf, of Old Change—Mr. William Leaf has more than one partner—the prisoner was in their service, and was in my department as salesman—he managed the fancy department, and had authority to purchase goods for the house—it was his duty to examine goods brought in with the invoices, to put ticks to each item, and pass the invoice to me—the ticks would be a voucher to me that the goods were in stock—I am acquainted with his ticks, and believe these to be his (<hi rend="italic">looking at an invoice</hi>)—I received</p>

Leaf seven or eight years, and five or six months in my department—before that, he was general salesman in the hosiery—it is since his removal to this department that he has been a purchaser—this invoice is dated 19th Sept, and was presented to me on that night, and passed to my drawer—we had not many crochet sleeves at that time—I have looked at the books to see if these goods have passed our books; that was a few days after he left—he left three or four days after the invoice came in—the invoice was sent in with the goods, and sometimes before, and if we write into the country for goods, we generally have the invoke two or three days before the goods—from a week to a month may elapse before we pay—we have bought of H. and F. Nathan for a year or two—I have nothing to do with paying them; they have it when they apply for it—supposing this to be a genuine transaction, the goods may have beet delivered two or three days before the invoice was sent in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of fancy goods, at No. 58, London-road, and have been in the habit of furnishing Messrs. Leaf with crochet work and sleeves. On Wednesday, 19th Sept., I saw the prisoner at their warehouse—I have been in the habit of taking goods there, and giving the invoices to the prisoner—I went there to solicit orders, and he told me he had taken a quantity of goods for a debt of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had no means of disposing of, that Messrs. Leaf would not purchase them of him, and he had no way of getting rid of them without sending them into the house—I asked him what I was to do—he said that he wanted me to make out an invoice for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him whether I should send the goods—he said, "No, I have got them here; the stuff is cheap enough;" meaning the goods—I asked him to give me a copy of the invoice, as I did not know what he</p>

               <p>meant—he gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to copy it from, and told me to make out an invoice and send it to him, which I did—this is the invoice—my sister made it out by my directions, believing he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods there—he said, "I wish you would receive your account sooner than usual, as I am rather short of money"—he meant my monthly account there was an account due to me at the end of the month—I sent the invoice on the next day to Messrs. Leaf by my servant Mary Pockson—it was Tuesday, 18th Sept., that I was there as far as I remember, and on the following Saturday the prisoner came, but I did not see him the first time—he came a second time, and said that he was discharged from Messrs. Leaf's—I asked him what it was for, and he said, after some hesitation, that it was in consequence of giving a bill, similar to the one he had given me, to a person named Myers, and if Messrs. Leaf said anything to me about, I was to stoutly deny it—he said nothing about the bill being paid—I said, "Why do not you sell them to them yourself?"—he said, "No, that will not do; they would not buy them in my name"—that was the reason that induced me to send them in in my name—afterwards my suspicions were aroused, in I went and told Mr. Leaf.</p>

Hale, candle manu<lb/>facturers, of Queen-street, Cheapside—I am employed to go out with Cox's cart when candles are delivered—Cox was a carman in their employment—I have been in their employ about two years, and have been with Cox in the cart to deliver goods several times: a week in the course of the last nine months—on Thursday, 27th Sept., I recollect the cart being loaded at the warehouse—seven boxes for the town delivery were put in—Cox was the driver of the cart, and I went with him in it as far as Topping's wharf Tooley-street—after stopping there I went on with him, and he sent me with four show cards to a shop which my master serves, in the Borough market—I went from there to our factory in Orange-street, Southwark, where I got the horses' nose bags—I was to meet him at St. George's church, in the Borough, which I did—I was not often directed to leave the cart in that way—my masters' directions were to keep in the cart, and watch to keep the things from being taken out—Cox said that he had been to Hayes's wharf, and to a shop in Tooley-street—he did not say which shop—I know where Dinning lives; it is about five minutes' walk father on from Topping's wharf—that would not be his direct road to St. George's church—on a Thursday, a fortnight before 27th Sept., when we got as far as Thomas-street, in the Borough, he sent me with some onions to his house in Snow's-fields—I met him again at the top of Snow's-fields—Thomas-street is very near Tooley-street, and is about five minutes' walk from where Dinning lives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Hale, of Queen-street, Cheapside, candle manufacturers. On 27th Sept., in consequence of information I received, I went to a house in Tooley-street, opposite Dinning's shop—it is a small oil shop—at about five minutes past 2 o'clock, the prosecutor's cart drove up in charge of Cox—Dinning came out and assisted Cox into the shop with a twelve dozen candle box—they remained in the shop about five minutes, and then Cox brought an empty twelve dozen box out—they then took another twelve dozen box into the shop, Dinning assisting as before—that box was left there—he came out, and took into the shop a parcel containing apparently six pounds of candles—he remained rather more than five minutes, and then drove away—the boy was not there, but it was his place not to have left the cart—he was employed for that purpose—I returned, and gave information to Mr. Hale—I have looked at the books—twenty-four dozen pounds of candles in four deliveries, six dozen to each delivery, were sold to Dinning on that day—I was present when they were ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was ordered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first 6lbs. of Dinning was on 16th Aug.—the next order was on the 29th, and was delivered on the 31st; on 13th Sept. six dozen more, and 27th Sept. was the day he was apprehended—six dozen was all that was ordered on 27th—two boxes would be rather an extensive order for a shop of that description—they were com<lb/>posite candles—we were charging Dinning 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per dozen pounds, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. net—if the money is returned by the man who delivers them, we allow 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount, which was the case with the three previous lots.</p>

               <p>are pointed out by the packer, Buckmaster—Cox has been in the service nine years, or more—I have been there eleven years—I do not think he could get candles away without the connivance of another party—it is usual to take the goods out of the boxes, and bring the empty boxes back—an empty box sometimes remains at a customer's, for his own convenience, if he cannot put the candles away—it was perfectly dear to the passers by that the paper parcel was taken out of the cart—I saw no label on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Warren Stormes Hale, of Queen-street, Cheapside. Dinning was a customer of ours, and Cox was our carman—on 27th Sept., Dinning called at 10 o'clock in the morning, and gave me an order for six dozen, Times composite candles, sixes—I made out the invoice, and gave it to the packer—they were packed in one box, they would not fill it, they were all twelve dozen boxes that day—they would be taken by Cox; the price was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount—in conse<lb/>quence of something communicated to me I sent George Best to see what was delivered at Dinning's shop, and in consequence of what he told me, I went to inspector Newman, and then to Cox's in Snow's-fields, and asked him how many candles he had delivered at Dining's that day—he said, "Six dozen"—I asked him if that was all—he said, "Yes"—I said, "But they were in a box"—he said, "I know that"—I said, "But you have delivered more"—he denied it—I told him we had proof that be had deli<lb/>vered two boxes and a package; he said twice, if not three times, "I did not," and said that he knew he delivered a package, but that was to make up the quantity—there was no necessity to do that, if only six dozen were to be delivered—the inspector took him into custody—I afterwards went with the inspector to Dinning's house, waited till 10 o'clock till he came home, and then the inspector asked him how many candles he had received from us on that day—he said, "Six dozen"—he was asked if that was all—he said, "Yes"—the inspector told him that be had proof that he had two boxes and a package besides—he said that he had not—we said, that we must search the place—he showed us two papers of eights in the shop, one of which had had half a pound taken out; there were also some sixes in the window for sale—Dinning said that our carman had left the eights in mistake and he had told him so, and he intended to have returned them—he showed us the remainder of the eights, and we asked him if he had any more candles—he said, "Yes"—the inspector asked him where, and he said, "Down below"—we went into the cellar, and found forty-six pack<lb/>ages containing twenty-three dozen of sixes—all of them were Times com<lb/>posite, and were in papers with our marks still on them, and the words, "Times composite, sixes"—while I was counting them over, I said, "These</p>

               <p>are some you hare received to-day—he said, "Yes," and then contradicted himself, and said, "No, they were there before"—I am not sure whether he did not say the day previous—I found an empty candle box in the shop with our mark on it—the whole quantity we found was twenty-eight down eleven pounds and a half—on a bill file in the shop I found four invoice applying to the four transactions and no more.</p>

Hale about two months before, and about three months afterwards—I cannot say what I should have paid for candles at that time.</p>

               <p>stop there two minutes—I then went to meet the prisoner at Tom's Coffee-house, Holborn, nearly opposite Day and Martin's—he had appointed to meet me there, on my return from Orange-street—I told him that I had seen his friend, and given him the money, and it was all right—he then gave me a sove<lb/>reign, and gave me a small parcel to take charge of for him—he told me to take particular care of it, and asked me where I lived, in case he should want it in a hurry—it was a small parcel, about four inches wide, eight or nine inches long, and about half an inch thick—it was a very heavy parcel I never knew the contents of it—I told him I lived at No. 36, Blenheim-street, Chelsea—he said, "Why don't you get apartments in town?"—I said I thought I should do so shortly—the parcel remained in my posses<lb/>sion something less than a fortnight (I had seen Agar in the meantime at Humphries's)—at the expiration of ten days, or a fortnight, he asked if I would meet him the following morning, and bring the parcel with me—I met him at the Black Horse, in Coventry-street, Haymarket, the next morning, and gave him the parcel—he asked me to meet him again the fol<lb/>lowing evening, at the same house—I did so, and he then gave me another parcel—he told me to take particular care of it—that parcel was never opened until after his apprehension, I kept it until then—about the middle of July, he asked me if I had ever transacted business at a banker's—I told him I had repeatedly—he said he should want me to do a little for him some time—I believe that was all he said about it at that time—this was as we were walking from the Black Horse towards Oxenden-street—on 4th Aug. I moved from Blenheim-street to No. 61, Theobald's-road—on that day I met the prisoner by accident in Southampton-row—he spoke of the current things of the day, and then I think he said, "Can you meet me on Monday night?"—this was on Saturday, I believe—I told him that I had moved to Theobald's-road that day, or that I was going to do so—he said he wanted me to take a cheque for him to get the money—I do not know whether he mentioned the amount of the cheque that day, or on Monday—before this, he asked me if I should like to earn 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot positively say whether that was said on the Saturday, or the Monday, but I believe it was on the Saturday—I said I should, and asked him what it was to do—he said it was a matter where there was some little risk to run, but if I minded his instructions no harm could come of it—he then told me it was to present a cheque at a banker's for payment—I do not think he told me the name of the bank then—he said, "Take the cheque and present it in the usual way"—he did not produce the cheque to me then—he said, "If they ask you any ques<lb/>tions you may judge then that it is wrong; they will most likely take you round to the manager's room, and ask you who you brought it from"—and I was to say from Captain Pellatt, of the Euston Hotel, and if they asked me if I was his servant I was to say, "No, a gentlemen as I was passing the Euston Hotel asked me if I would take a note to Mivart's Hotel to Captain Fitzgerald, "to hurry there and back, and merely give it to the porter"—I was to say that on my return to the Euston Hotel the gentleman asked me many questions as to my character, and that he then asked me if I would take a cheque to the banker's and get change for it, and that I consented to do so—that was the story I was to toll if I was taken into the manager's room, and asked questions—I think that was all that was said on that occasion—nothing was given to me at that interview—these conversations occurred so frequently that I can scarcely say upon which day the separate conversations were—I met him on the Monday at Tom's Coffee-house—he said to me on</p>

               <p>the Saturday, "As now you have got up to this end of the town, can you look in at Tom's Coffee-house every night at 7 o'clock, and if I am there I shall see you and I will follow you out"—I met him there on the Monday and Tuesday outside the coffee house—it was on those occasions that the con<lb/>versation I have related passed—I could not pledge myself as to any particular day—on Tuesday, 7th, he appointed me to meet him at about half-past 3 o'clock on the following Saturday outside the coffee-house, in King-street, Holborn—I was to walk up and down there until he came—I' did meet him there be<lb/>tween 4 and 5 o'clock—I walked up and down the street until he came—he then asked me if I thoroughly understood what I had got to do, and asked me to repeat to him what his instructions were—I did so as well as I could, and he said, "You'll do"—he then said, "Take this cheque"—he produced it at that time, and also gave me a canvas bag and a half-sovereign—he said the cheque was dated for the following Wednesday, and he told me to go on the Wednesday, and I was to take a cab or walk to Sey-mour-street, Euston-square, first, I was to get a sheet of blank paper and an envelope and address it to Captain Fitzgerald, at Mivart's Hotel, to take a cab from Sey-mour-street and drive to Mivart's Hotel and leave the note, and then drive back to the Euston Hotel—I was then to go on to the bank with the cheque and get a glass of ale on the road, so that the change of the half-sovereign and the cab hire and the price of the ale should correspond with my state<lb/>ment—he said, "Take the cheque and present it in the usual way, if they ask you how you will have it, say 10 fifties and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and if you get the money all right come back to me in Southampton-row, Bedford-square, or Russell-square; I will be walking about there."—he said if I saw him I was to take no notice of him, but give him the money and meet him next morning at 11 o'clock, at Tom's Coffee-house, and he would give me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, but if I was detected he should not expect me after 6 o'clock, he should not wait after 6 o'clock, he should then watch the morning papers, and he said they could not do anything to me if I kept to that state<lb/>ment—he then gave me the cheque—after this I made a communication to Mr. Mullens, I believe on Monday, the 13th—Mr. Mullens gave me certain directions, which I followed—On Wednesday, 15th Aug., I walked up to Eaton-square and inquired at the hotel if Mr. Pellatt was there—the waiter said she believed he had slept there last night, but he was not there then—I then took a cab from there and drove to Mivart's Hotel in Brook-street, and left a letter there—I then drove back again to the Euston Hotel and paid the cabman—I then walked towards Lombard-street—I had a glass of ale on the road and some dinner, and then I rode outside an omnibus to the bank—I changed the half-sovereign for the cab hire and paid for my dinner out of the change—I got on to the omnibus in New Oxford-street and got to the bank a little after 3 o'clock—I went to Stevenson and Salt's banking-house in Lombard-street and presented the cheque—I gave the canvas bag which the prisoner had given me, and something was put into it by one of the clerks, I did not know what it was, I did not see it—I saw Mr. Mullens there—the bag was given back to me tied up, I took it in my hand outside the bank door—I was instructed to do so by Mr. Mullens—when I got out<lb/>side the bank I put it in my breast pocket—I walked direct down the Poultry and Cheapside and up Holborn, and to Southampton-row—I got there about 4 o'clock and walked about there for some time—I walked from there towards New North-street, and had a glass of ale at a public-house—I walked from there to Bedford-row, and was standing there some little time when the prisoner came up to me at the corner of Bedford-row and Theo-bald's-road</p>

               <p>—he came up to me, shook hands, and asked me if I had got it all right—I said, "Yes"—he looked across the road, and said, "Who are those two fellows over the way?"—I said I did not know, he looked round again and said, "They are following us, walk this way towards Holborn"—he then said "<hi rend="italic">Sling</hi> me the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>, and then I will run for it"—I gave him the bag—before I gave him the bag, he said to me, "How b——y careless you were in putting the bag in your pocket at the bank in Lombard-street"—I do not recollect that he said anything further—he said that I believe as we turned down Eagle-street, or one of the little streets from Bedford-row—it was after he said, "<hi rend="italic">Sling</hi> me the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>, and I will run for it"—I gave him the bag soon after, I could not at the moment, because the men were behind watching us, but as soon as an opportunity offered I gave it him, and he ran away as fast as he could—he told me to go into a baker's shop, and he would run to the fields, meaning Lincoln's Inn fields—he pointed to a baker's shop at the corner, so that I should not run the same way as he did—I saw him again in five or six minutes in custody of Thorogood and Goddard—I was also taken into custody by the officers, and we were hand<lb/>cuffed together—while we were at the Mansion House handcuffed together, he said to me, "It was your fault that I was taken, through running the same way as I did: but if you stick to me, if it costs me a thousand pounds I will get you out of it"—this was not said loud enough to be heard—we both sat on chairs together—it was before the handcuffs were taken off.</p>

               <p>but I corrected it afterwards—I should have said King's-place—it is in Pall Mall—I did live there three years back—it was what is generally termed a lodging-house—they are let as lodging-houses, houses of assignation—it was not a brothel—I believe there is a distinction between the two—if parties came there to hire a room, to stop for any period, I never asked them their business—the question was never put whether they wanted to stop a night or a week—if any persons wanted to occupy a room, they could do so by paying for it—there were no women kept in the house—that is, no women for the purpose you imagine—I believe men and women could come and hire a room there for the purposes of fornication whenever they pleased—I never let a room myself—I derived a little of my livelihood from it—I was living there and keeping the house with my wife—I was not gaining a livelihood by that, I was still at work at my own business—I did not leave my wife to manage the house—my servants did—she was never seen in it—she did not attend to the door—I kept that house about two years, it might be three—I have been an eating-house-keeper at St. George's-street in the East—that is since that—I have been nothing else, except my own business of a cabinet-maker—I have never been in this Court before—I have been in the Old Bailey before, tried as a prisoner, but I do not know in which Court—that is between eleven and twelve years ago—I was then eighteen years of age—it was for baying a watch, receiving a stolen watch—it was only one article—I was convicted, and had twelve months—that was the only time—I am quite sure of that—I am not sure whether it was in 1849 or 1850 that I began to keep the house of assignation—I was tried here in my own name—I kept the brothel in my own name—I have always gone by that name, never by any other name, not for one day—I swear that—I do not know whether Humphries is a married man—there was a woman who passed as Mrs. Humphries—her name is Emily Campbell—I never did mes<lb/>sages for her—I have gone out for spirits for her—I have not acted as servant at Humphries's house, but if I was asked to go on an errand, I did not hesitate to do so, and I have occasionally acted as clerk to Humphries when he has been out—he is a house agent and auctioneer—whenever I was there at work at carpentering, and he has said, "Smith, would you mind the office for to-day?"I have done so, and taken any names that came—I never knew him to act as an attorney, the only affair I knew of was when you had him at Bagnigge-wells for an assault, or some such case—I read of that, and I know of nothing more—I have known him to be engaged in collecting debts—he did not help me through the Insolvent Court—I have passed through the Insolvent Court in 1854—I never saw Humphries about that matter, to my knowledge—I do not know whether he is to be a witness; I have never heard—he had nothing whatever to do with getting me through the Insolvent Court—I did not know him at that time—he has never been concerned in preparing a bill of sale for me—I have not been very intimate with him—I have dined with him, at the same table with him and Emily Campbell—I do not know that the prisoner ran off with Emily Campbell—I swear that—I have heard it—I only know that the prisoner was living with her, in the name of Adams, from the evidence of the servant at the Mansion House, and from what Thorogood has told me—Humphries never spoke to me about it, and never alluded to it at all—Emily Campbell was not there at the time I made the communication to Humphries—I do not know that she was with the prisoner—she told me that she was away, with her mother, ill—she was not with Humphries—I do not know whether she</p>

               <p>is with him now—I swear that—I have not seen her with Humphries—I do not know whether she is there or not—I saw her last, I should say, nearly three months ago, about a fortnight before this case first came on—I may have dined with Humphries four or five times—I was tolerably intimate with him, when I was there I had a long distance to go home, and he generally made me have a bit with him—beyond that, there has been no transaction between us—I swear that—I was not engaged in the transaction at Bagnigge-wells—I read of it, and was at one of the examinations, and on one of the occasions I dined with Humphries—I believe it was about breaking into a house in Ormond-street, to get away a child—I believe it was on the second examination that I dined with him—I am not sure whether it was the second or third examination—I was never in the house in Ormond-street—I am not the person who represented a Roman Catholic clergyman, and called himself Scholfield—I never called myself the Rev. Dr. Scholfield, for the purpose of getting into the house in Ormond-street—I was not supplied by Humphries with a broad brimmed hat, nor had I my face blackened for the purpose of not being seen—the whole of it is a fable, as far as I am concerned—I have heard of it before, because I was at the examination—I never had anything at all to do with it—I had not the curiosity to see what the first parcel contained which the prisoner gave me to take care of—I have no idea what it was—I gave the second parcel up to Forrester—it turned out to contain several forged plates—I have no idea why the prisoner should have trusted me with it—he gave me no reason, no more than I was to take care of it for him—I have never seen the forged plates, except when they were exposed at the Mansion House—I did not look at them—I had not shown them to Humphries or Mr. Mullens—I told Mr. Mullens that I had a parcel, and I told Humphries—he did not ask to see it—he asked me what it was like—Mr. Mullens did not ask to see it—I rather think 1 told him about it on Monday, 13th, but I could not be positive—he did not ask to see it—nobody ever saw it until I gave it up to the officer—I had on previous occasions presented cheques, and received money for them—that was all in an honest way—I do not know a Mr. Sid serf—I know a man named Sidd; his name may be Sid serf—they call him Said—I do not know that his name is Sid serf—I have not heard him called Sid serf—I do not know whether Sidd and Sid serf are the same person—I have repeatedly spoken to Sidd at Humphries's—I used to call him Mr. Sidd, not <hi rend="italic">Sidd</hi>—I have known him dine there once, and only once—I do not know what he is—I have been a good deal with him lately—I have not been about the Court with him—I was not with him to-day nor yesterday—I saw him yesterday, but not here—I do not know anything about him—I saw him yesterday in one of the streets leading out of Gray's Inn-lane—I met him by accident, not by appointment—he and I have never had any talk on the subject of forged plates—I never learnt from him anything about his habits, or what his business was; I have always believed him to be a solicitor—I have seen him write at Humphriea's desk repeatedly—I believe him to be a solicitor from the style of his writing—I have never met Sidd here upon a former occasion, I never saw him here—I do not expect anything for this matter, more than my time to be paid for, I suppose—I have never said that I expected to get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that I would not take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my share, not to anybody—I am quite sure about that—I have seen a good deal of Roe since I made the communication to him—I saw him yesterday—I have told Roe that if I did not give Agar into custody, that Agar would</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to the associated bankers of the City of London, and conduct this prosecution. I first knew the witness Smith. on Monday, 13th Aug.—he made some communication to me, upon which 1 gave him instructions how to act—on the following Wednesday, the 15th, I attended at the banking house of Stevenson and Salt, in Lombard-street—I gave instructions to Forrester and Goddard, and two officers were placed in Glyn's banking house just opposite—about a quarter to 3 o'clock I noticed a man standing on the pavement opposite Stevenson's bank, smoking a cigar—he was under my observation altogether nearly a quarter of an hour—I was looking through the window blind of the bank—just about 3 o'clock a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up very fast, and pulled up all at once exactly opposite Stevenson's window, where the man was—the person in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> put out his hand, and beckoned to him, there was only one person</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220066"/>
               <p>in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and they spoke together very earnestly for a very short time; the man in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> then got out, just said a word to the other man, and went away, and I saw no more of him—I observed the countenance of the man who was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I noticed him sufficiently to be able to form a belief as to who he was—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I wag just the width of the pavement from him—I was sitting at the window of the bank, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up immediately to the window, on the same side—he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on that side—I believe it to be the prisoner—I saw him again that same evening at the station-house—he was dressed much as he is now, I think, but not in a coat of that colour; I did not see much of his dress, because all the time he was speaking out of the window of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw him get out, but he was away in an instant—all the conversa<lb/>tion was while he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I could only see his face, not his figure—when he got out, he walked quickly away—my impression is that it was a dark coat, not exactly a frock coat; it was cut away at the corners; I think it is called an Oxonian, but I would not undertake to say anything about it—I saw him again that same evening, but I have no idea how he was dressed then, I took no notice—from seven to ten minutes afterwards Smith came into the banking house—the man with the cigar remained—he was walking up and down before the banking house in Abchurch-lane until Smith came—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went away empty—the man who got out of it went away before the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man could get on his box again, he went so quickly—Smith came in, and presented the cheque for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought this canvas bag with him—I put into the bag 200 farthings, and some marked pieces of paper, and tied up the bag—I had not arranged with any one what should be done—Smith did not know—I delivered the bag to Smith, and he carried it away—I gave him some directions as to putting it into his pocket as he went out—he carried the bag in his hand until he got outside the door, and I saw him stand on the pavement, and put it into his breast pocket—any person standing about would have an oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing him.</p>

                  </hi>. I now reside at No. 7, Little Ogle-street, Marylebone. Up to the beginning of Aug. I was in the service of Mr. Humphries, at No. 19, King's-road, Gray's-inn—I think I was there three weeks or a month—during that time I frequently saw the witness Smith there at work</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220067"/>
               <p>—I also saw the prisoner there frequently—sometimes two or times in a day—he has asked for Mr. Smith when he has called, was he there, had he been there, or whether I knew if he was coming—I knew the prisoner by the name of Jenkins—I have seen him and Smith in conversation together at various times, and have seen them drink together, and have meals together.</p>

Q.</hi> When did you leave Humphries's service; in Aug.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was there, I think, three weeks or a month—he had a person living with him who was his housekeeper—she was my mistress—I do not know her name, and there was a lodger up stairs—some called my mistress Mrs. Humphries—they used to call her that, because they took her to be the housekeeper—I called her Mrs. Humphries—I think her name is Camp<lb/>bell—I never interfered with their affairs, it was nothing to me—I know Smith well—my father used to work for him some years ago—I have some<lb/>times seen him with Humphries, I might have done so very often—I do not know whether they have been together a long time—I do not know that they have been together for two or three hours at a time, I never saw them, they might have been so, but I never stopped—I opened the door to him, and then left him—he was doing the door when I left—I have not seen him and Humphries a good deal together, I have seen them together—I think they have dined together—I have waited at table when they have dined together—he was working for Mr. Humphries, doing the door—I have seen him as much with Mr. Jenkins—I was not before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years an officer attached to Bow-street office; I have retired. I was engaged by Mr. Mullens to assist in the detection of this affair—on 15th Aug. I went to Glyn's banking house, in Lombard-street, which faces Messrs. Stevenson's—I saw Smith go in and come out—before that I saw a man standing about five or six yards off, leaning against the side of the building—he was doing nothing, but merely looking towards the banking house—the fact is, there were two men—I observed one standing by the banking house for some time, looking towards the entrance, and shortly after I had observed him, I saw another man—whether he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or not I do not know, but I saw a man stand<lb/>ing opposite the door smoking a cigar—I have seen that man since, and have heard his name to be Pearce—I have endeavoured to take him into custody on this charge—I have not been able to trace him at all, not beyond his place of residence, at Kilburn—I saw Smith come out of the banking house; he remained a few seconds outside the door, and put a canvas bag something similar to this into his side coat pocket—Thorogood, a nephew of Forrester's, was with me—I cannot say that I observed the man with the cigar at the time Smith came out, because my attention was then directed to Smith—Thorogood and I followed Smith to the neighbourhood of Bos-well-court, and Theobald's-road—I saw him at last in Bedford-row—after being there some time he was joined by the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>five minutes—Thorogood was there also—we were all close together in the parlour—we were not sitting, we were standing—I heard what they said—I heard Humphries say to Smith, "He will not be here, "meaning, as I understood at the time, the prisoner—he said, "He will not be here now he will be at my office at 5 o'clock"—I do not know whether Smith made any answer—I am not aware that he did, I cannot recollect—this was said by Humphries openly, so as to be heard by me and Thorogood—Humphries then left the house, and Smith went out afterwards, and I after Smith—I saw what became of Smith until he joined the prisoner at the corner of Bedford-row—he did not join Humphries afterwards—Smith was walking up and down at the end of Bedford-row, and the prisoner came and joined him, and they shook hands—they remained in conversation for a very short time, and walked together up Bedford-row, and turned the corner of a street leading into Red Lion-square—the prisoner looked back—they walked on to Red Lion-square, and crossed Red Lion-square, the prisoner occasionally looking back, down Leigh-street into Eagle-street, and then into Kingsgate-street, where I lost sight of them for a few seconds—when I turned the corner of Kingsgate-street, I saw Smith, and he waved his hand, and said, "That way, that way, down Turnstile"—I went on down Turnstile, Thoro-good was on before me—I pursued down Gate-street into Great Queen-street, and saw the prisoner being led out of Parker-street into Queen-street by Thorogood—I did not see him taken, Thorogood was on before me—he and I had raised the cry of "Stop thief!"in Queen-street—I took him into a shop there, and as I was leading him into the shop Thorogood turned back and brought Smith in—I directed that they should be handcuffed together—the prisoner asked me what it was for, and said he would go quietly—I told him it was for uttering a forged cheque at the banking house in Lombard-street—I said, "This young man," pointing to Smith, "has been followed from the bankers, where he has uttered a forged cheque; have you received anything from him?"—he immediately put his hand into his pocket, and gave me this canvas bag—I said, "From whom did you receive this?"—he said, "He gave it me," pointing to Smith—that was all he said—I then took him to the Mansion House—they were together there in a room—there was no examination then, it was after hours—I observed that they spoke to each other, I did not hear what they said—I was at the Mansion House at the first examination—Smith was then examined as a witness—after the examination was over the prisoner said, in the room, that he was as innocent as the child unborn; that he was like an innocent man going to the slaughter; that he was innocent of this case—he said he had not knownn Smith, he never had more than a dozen words with him in his life—on the same evening that the prisoner was taken into custody, the 15th, I went to Smith's lodging, in Theobald's-road—I saw a parcel taken from a little box there—Smith gave it to Forrester—Smith was not com<lb/>mitted at all—on 4th Sept. I was with Thorogood, in Union-street, Black-friars—we followed a man who came out of a public house there—it was the man that I saw smoking the cigar in Lombard-street, the man they call Pearce—he went to Mr. Wontner's office, in Snow-hill—there had been two examinations previous to that—I think the prisoner was not then committed—Mr. Wontner had acted as his attorney—I was there, I heard him put questions to Smith in cross-examination—some time after Pearce had gone into Mr. Wontner's office, I and Forrester went in—I waited at the door—I did not see Pearce come out, in fact, I went away to fetch Forrester</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220069"/>
               <p>from the Mansion House, leaving Thorogood on the spot—when Forrester came he went in, and I went in with him—Mr. Wontner was there—some inquiry was made—I have never seen the man since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were a long time before you recollected about the prisoner saying he had not exchanged a dozen words with Smith in his life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—it is not mentioned in my deposition—this is the first time the prisoner has had the opportunity of hearing it from me—I have no recollection of his saying it was a <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> put upon him by Humphries—I did not hear him say so, or anything to that effect—I do not recollect his saying anything of the sort, not to me—I do not recollect his making use of the word <hi rend="italic">plant</hi>—he said he fancied there was some woman at the bottom of it—he said that Humphries wanted to cheat him out of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, that he owed him—I heard him say that he was going to receive 200 sovereigns but I did not understand from whom, and he thought that the money he gave me was that money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not an officer—I am nephew to John and Daniel Forrester, the Mansion House officers—I was employed in this case—on Wednesday, 15th Aug., about a quarter to 3 o'clock I went to Lombard-street in company with Goddard—I went into Glyn's banking house to watch Stevenson and Salt's house—I saw Smith, and I saw a man standing outside Stevenson and Salt's, whose name I have since ascertained to be Pearce—I saw him standing there, and also walking up and down, and smoking a cigar—I saw Smith go into Stevenson's—the man was not there then—I watched Stevenson's house, and saw Smith come out with a bag in his hand—he stood on the pavement opposite the door of the banking house, put the bag into his breast coat pocket, buttoned his coat up, and walked away—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> opposite the banking house—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before the man was walking up and down—the man and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> were there at the same time—I did not see the man get out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw the man with the cigar in his mouth walking up and down by the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was not there when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up—he was there while the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was there—he was not walking there before the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came up—he was walking up and down there whilst the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was standing there—I did not see him until just after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came up—I was put there to watch for a party going into Stevenson and Salt's banking house—I followed Smith with Goddard until he came to Bedford-row—I saw him go into a public house as he went along, at the corner of Boswell-court—at that time he had the bag in his breast pocket—I went into that public house—I afterwards followed him to Bedford-row, and there saw the prisoner meet him—he came from up John-street, I believe—they shook hands with each other—I saw them talking together I should think between three and five minutes—they then walked up John-street together, talking—they walked up several turnings through Red Lion-square, till they came into Kingsgate-street, Holborn—when I turned into Kingsgate-street I missed the prisoner—I ran up and spoke to Smith—I ran across Holborn, down New Turnstile into Gate-street, Great Queen-street, Little Queen-street, into Parker-street—I saw the prisoner running during this time; not the whole of the time, but from time to time—I am sure it was the same person that I had seen with Smith—I called out, "Stop thief!"—I am not aware that that was</p>

I watched that house, and about 7 o'clock in the evening, I saw the same man that I had seen smoking outside the banking house in Lombard-street, come to that house with another man, a Jew looking man—on 4th Sept., I was at Kilburn, and saw the same two men at the Red Lion there—I followed that man as far as Mr. Wontner's office, in Skinner-street—I have never seen him since—I have endeavoured to find him.</p>

I have been living with the prisoner as his wife for the last twelve months—on Friday, 21st Sept., I was with him in our room in Cock-court, there were the children in the room, his children by his first wife—I asked him if he was going to give me the money that he promised to give me to go to market—he made me no answer—he was undressed, I was dressed—my mother came to the door about half-past 6 o'clock—he would not let me open the door—I asked him what was the reason he would not let me open the door to let my mother in—he said, "I am undressed"—I said it was not the first time she had seen him undressed—he said "Let your mother go away, I will give you the money"—I told my mother to go away, and said I would meet her in Farringdon Market—she did go—the prisoner then got up and went to my box, and sat down for a few minutes on the box—he took two dirty dresses off my box and threw them on the floor—he said, "You have been talking a long time about going, you had better go now; gather up your things"—I asked him if that was what he meant—he said, "Yes"—I said I had very little going to what I had coming; "I brought more things to you than I am taking away"—I went to pick them up to put them where there were some more dirty things, and as I stooped he drew a knife across my throat—I did not see the knife in his possession—I did not see any more till I saw the stream of blood, and I cried "Murder"—I tried to get away—I ran towards the door, but the door was locked—he then began stabbing me about the head and shoulders, and gave me very severe wounds in my head with his fist; but he stabbed me with a knife in two places on my shoulder, one on my temple, and another under the ear, and one on my thumb—from the effects of these blows and wounds I dropped, and thought I was dead, but I was sensible afterwards—as soon as I dropped he ran into the cellar—I afterwards got up as well as I could, and got to the door—he bad the key that locked the door in his pocket, but it happened that I had a key—I opened the door and met the policeman—I was taken to the hospital—on previous occasions the prisoner had used language towards me of a violent character—he called me very bad names the night before this happened, and said he would do for me if I was to leave</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the service of Messrs. Millington for some months. I go out with the van with Wake—the cart is loaded by Miller, with the assistance of Neale—I am sometimes present, and some<lb/>times I have to go out—Wake drove the cart when it was loaded, and I went with him to take care of the goods—I know Mitre-street and Web-ber-street—about once a week the cart drove to the corner of Miter-street; it was stopped there, and I had to give Wake some double crown paper in reams out of the van, and tissue paper also, and he used to take them down Mitre-street, a good distance, and into a house, I cannot tell which house—I used to remain with the van—he took about six reams at a time—I saw no other person on these occasions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am finisher at the mills of Allen de Lay and Co., Paul's Cray, Rent—they sold these two reams of large blue laid port to Millington and Hutton—they are charged with duty on 17th July—I also recognise these two reams of medium—these two wrappers are what we sold to Millington and Hutton—the duty date of one is 1st June, and the other 17th July—I recognise altogether four reams and two labels, which came out of Mr. Smale's parcel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of divinity, and a Canon of Rochester Cathedral—I have had an account for some years past with the house of Snow, Paul, and Strahan—my account with that house began in Dec., 1830—at that time, I think, the firm was Snow, Paul, and Panl—afterwards, I think, it was Strahan, Paul, Paul, and Bates, and subsequently, when the late Sir John Paul died, it became, as it latterly was, Strahan, Paul, and Bates—I think the late Sir John Dean Paul died in 1853—I am not quite sure, but it was about that time certainly—from that time</p>

               <p>down to the bankruptcy the firm continued to be Strahan, Paul, and Bates—I was in the habit, from time to time, of employing my bankers to make investments for me—I think it was in the year 1850 that I first directed them to make an investment in the Danish 5 per cent bonds—this is my pass book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find myself debited here, on 4th Feb., 1850, with a sum of 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the purchase of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Danish 5 per cents—my practice was to give instructions for the purchase, and I think in almost all cases I received from them bought notes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought note referring to the purchase I have spoken of—on 16th April, 1850, I find this item in the pass book, "For 1,000 Danish 5 per cents. at 953/4, 958<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought note that was trans<lb/>mitted to me with reference to the last mentioned purchase—in April, 1851, I gave them a further order to purchase similar stock for me (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is the order contained in this letter—it is dated 9th April, 1851—the postscript says, "I shall be obliged if you will purchase for me 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Danish 5 per cent bonds. J. Griffith."—that I sent to the house by the post, addressed to Messrs.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220087"/>
               <p>an observation to them, that they had received my dividends upon these 5,000 Danish bonds, but that they had not received the dividends upon the gas shares which were at that time due—I spoke from what I had seen in my pass book—I had received my pass book a day or two before, and I saw that the Danish bonds were inserted, but the gas shares were not, and my object in calling upon them was to induce them to obtain the dividends upon the gas shares—the reply of Mr. Bates was, "Yes, we have, I think, received this very morning the dividends upon the gas shares, but they are not yet brought to your account, but I will go out and ascertain the fact"—this happened in an inner room, and he went out into the bank and came back saying, yes, they had been received on that very morning—I do not think anything more was said on that occasion about the Danish 5 per cents.—I know that this was on 28th April—Mr. Bates and Mr. Strahan were both present at that conversation—the dividends upon the Danish 5 per cents, have been regularly passed to my account in the pass book—the last entry is on 16th March, 1855.</p>

               <p>and yourself, upon that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> May I be permitted to refer to a memorandum which I made at the time, to refresh my memory?—I made it either that evening, or the day following—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was permitted to refer to the memorandum</hi>)—perhaps I may premise that a friend of Mr. Strahan's had called upon me before he came, two friends of his indeed had called at separate times, one of them I saw—Mr. Strahan's first observe<lb/>tion was to this effect, that he was surprised to hear that I could obtain no information at the bank respecting my securities, for he and his partners were there constantly to give whatever information might be required—this, I believe, was in reference to the conversation which I had had with his friend—he then stated that they were engaged day and night in making up their accounts, and that if I proceeded with the legal measures I had commenced, it would be very detrimental to the creditors at large, and particularly to myself, for the securities had been so disposed of that there was no possible chance of my recovering anything of them; whereas if I abstained from those proceedings there would be a good prospect of my having them replaced or redeemed (I forget which word he used, replaced, I think it was) as both be and Sir John Paul had great expectations of receiving money hereafter, by which those securities of mine might be restored to me, and indeed, he added, they had prepared notes of hand for me, in case I should have called at the bank—he then proceeded to say that my securities had been taken by Sir John Paul himself to the City, and placed in the hands of either Over<lb/>end and Co. or Burland and Co., he could not tell me which, but he said that Sir John Paul was not alone to blame, that he himself was equally to blame and equally responsible for the transaction, inasmuch as it was done with his full knowledge and consent; "Indeed," said he, "I gave them to him," and immediately added, "I assure you it was the first dishonest act of my life, I never before defrauded any man of sixpence"—I asked him when this happened—he said about 6' weeks ago—he then said that the securities so disposed of amounted in value to nearly 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was speaking in that conversation of the great body of securities, not in reference merely to this 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but of the body of my securities, and in making that observation I suppose he adverted to the whole misappropriations of the bank, not merely to the whole of mine, but to others as well as mine, to the amount of nearly 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"but," he said, "yours was by far the largest amount belonging to any one individual"—I asked him, in reference to the disposal of my securities, whether some of them had not been disposed of to Messrs. Peppercorn—they are brokers that transact business generally in the purchase of these securities—he answered that he believed some of them might have been disposed of through their means—I also asked him whether my special securities, speaking generally of them, were kept in my box—I had a box there, of which they had a key and I had a key—it had only one lock—he said, no, they were not; they were kept with other securities of a similar nature, but in a parcel tied up by themselves, with my name attached to it—I think he said they were kept in a strong room—he then urged upon me the impolicy of my proceeding, and stated that many others who were similarly circumstanced with myself had been very kind to them, and begged that I would abandon the proceedings—he said that he knew the warrants were issued—this was on the very day that Mr. Bates was in custody, I think that Sir John Paul had escaped from the officers, and that the warrants were out for the apprehension of Mr. Strahan—it was on the day following the issuing of the warrants, on the Wednesday—my reply to him was this that I was not actuated by any vindictive feeling towards them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220089"/>
               <p>but that I felt I had a public duty to perform; it was a duty I owed to society to proceed, and that I could not conscientiously pass over so grave an offence without continuing the proceedings—I also told him that I had placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I declined to stop and referred to my soli<lb/>citors, Messrs. Fearon, of Great George-street—his reply was, "If I go to him, he will arrest me at once"—that was the whole of the conversation—upon my declining, he said, "Very well, then, it must be so," and he took his leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years a clerk in the house of Strahan, Paul, and Co., bankers, in the Strand. The late Sir John Paul died about three or four years ago, I do not know the exact year—in 1850 the firm was William Strahan, Sir John Dean Paul, John Dean Paul, and Robert Makin Bates; that continued to be the firm up to the time of the death of Sir John Paul—there was no alteration in the firm after that; they kept up the same upon the cheques—I never heard of any alteration—the three defendants have continued to act as the members of the firm from that time down to the period of their bankruptcy—the securities that were in the bank before the death of Sir John Paul, continued in the same custody after his death—they were kept in tin boxes in the strong room—the usual mode was for the entries in the pass books of the customers to be copied into the general books of the bank.</p>

I have for some time been acquainted with the three defendants—Sir John Paul I knew very intimately—he came to me twice, and applied to me to lend a sum of money upon foreign securities—the first time was towards the close of 1853, I could not say the exact date—at that time he wanted me to advance 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wanted my Company to advance it—I told him that we did not advance upon foreign securities, but I suggested, as he was in want of the loan, that he could easily do it upon the Stock Exchange—he after<lb/>wards came to me again upon the same subject—then the war had commenced, and I stated to him there would be difficulty in borrowing at that time—he told me it was necessary he should have funds, and he was desirous either to<lb/>morrow or to sell the securities that he had with him—I only know the period of this second interview, from the facts that issued from it, it was in the beginning of March, 1854—he gave me a small memorandum of the securities, and he requested me either to obtain a loan, or, if that was not</p>

               <p>practicable, to get the things sold for him—in consequence of that, I asked my brokers, Messrs.

I am the only person in the firm of Hambro and Son—my father was the "son"—the Danish 5 per cent loan was negotiated by me—the bonds produced are some of the bonds issued by my house upon that occasion by the authority of the Danish Government—they all bear my signature—these are the bonds I issued—the coupons that are attached to them entitle the parties periodically to receive the dividends due—the practice is to tear them off from the bonds every six months, and receive them as they become due—the coupons bear the same number and letter as the bonds—no two bonds of the same number are issued of the same loan—it is impossible that there could be two bonds of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bearing the same number—as far as I remember, they were running num<lb/>bers, and then it would be impossible that there could be a bond of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the same number as a bond of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an official assignee of the Court of Bankruptcy. I was the official assignee of the bankruptcy of the defendants—in June last an application was made to me by Messrs. Fearon and Clabon, the solicitors of Dr. Griffith, with reference to some securities of his that had been lodged with the defendants—it was made verbally, and I think there was a note also—in consequence of that application, I went to the banking house in the Strand—I there saw Mr. Strahan, and I think Mr. Bates—I think it was on the 16th—it was after the bankruptcy—the bankruptcy was on 11th June, and it was in that same week—I asked Mr. Strahan what had become of Dr. Griffith's securities—he said they were sold or pawned—my impression is that he at first merely said they would not be forthcoming; but having seen my own note, which I made immediately, I find it is, "they were either pawned or deposited," and therefore I have no doubt those were the words he used, sold or pawned—I have not the memoran<lb/>dum now in my possession—Mr. Strahan used the words" sold or pawned—I do not mean that he used one or other of those words, but both—he was not prepared to say whether they were sold or pawned—he said they would not be forthcoming, and that they were sold or pawned—I am not certain whether it was on that day, but I had asked if there was not a general security book, and I got no answer—I asked that question in the course of that week, either then or on a prior day—Mr. Strahan and Mr. Bates were present when I asked about the security book—no answer was made; they looked at each other, and there was no book forth<lb/>coming</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220095"/>
               <p>—I am not sure that there was anything said upon the occasion—when Mr. Strahan said these securities were either sold or pawned, I cannot say whether Mr. Bates was sitting in the room or not, bat he was very much in the habit of walking into the shop in front, and of walking about the room—I am speaking of that interview—whether he was exactly seated by Mr. Strahan, I cannot say—I have no doubt he was in the room at the time—I had visited the house two or three times between the 6th and 11th—I do not recollect on which occasion it was that I asked about the security book.</p>

Fearon and Clabon, Dr. Griffith's solicitors, that Dr. Griffith was exceedingly anxious to learn whether or not they were safe, and I read these from this list—among other things that I read from this list there was 5,000, 5 per cent Danish bonds—Mr. Bates replied, that he could not say anything about them, or he could not say anything about them in particular; that if there were any securities, they would be in the hands of the official assignee.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As soon as the paper was signed, did not Mr. Parry apply to Mr. Lawrence, and ask him if he wished to put any questions to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not within my hearing or knowledge—I will not swear that did not take place, but I solemnly swear not within my hearing or knowledge, or to my belief—I will not say whether he did or did not say to Mr. Lawrence, "Do you wish to ask the bankrupts any questions?"and I will state why; I was engaged at the moment in writing down the depositions, the first one which accompanied the first petition and the account, and the Court was so crowded, and there was so much noise going on, that I really cannot under<lb/>take to say whether he did or not—I had not had any previous communica<lb/>tion with Mr. Lawrence, none whatever, except applying to him to know whether he would bring the bankrupts up, so that they might be examined at that meeting—Mr. Lawrence declined in any way to interfere or assist me, and I was obliged to apply to another Commissioner, not the one adjudi<lb/>cating upon the fiat, and undertake to pay the expense of bringing them up—I then communicated to Mr. Lawrence that a warrant had been granted for bringing up the bankrupts, and that was all that took place with refer<lb/>ence to it—the defendants were then detained in the House of Detention—I had to get a warrant to the Governor to bring them up, in order that they might surrender on the first public meeting, to make such disclosure as I thought might be beneficial in the event of a certificate meeting—at that time they were all in custody on criminal warrants upon this very matter—I believe the first joint examination before the Magistrate was on that same day; no, not the morning of the 25th; on the morning of the 22nd, which was Friday—upon that same day I applied to the Commissioner, about four o'clock in the afternoon, for a warrant to bring them up to be examined upon the Monday—it was not only for the purpose of making the disclosure—it was for that purpose amongst others—it was for the pur<lb/>pose of making a disclosure with reference to all the securities they had converted, and to be present at any meeting, to answer any questions which any creditor might put to them upon any subject.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 51). On Wednesday night, 3rd Oct., I was on duty at Fulham-fields, and about a quarter past 8 o'clock saw Chandler picking some onions up in a market gardener's ground—I concealed myself in a dark place, and watched him—he came up through the gate out of the field, and when he came about five or six yards off the gate, I stopped him, and found about a peck of onions in his possession—he was carrying them in a sort of smock frock which he wore—I said, "What have you got here?" he let them drop, and I took him into custody, and told him it was for stealing onions—he was pretty quiet, and walked with me—I asked a man named Carter, who was coming along, to pick the onions up, and gave him a handkerchief to put them in—when we got to the Britannia public house, a quarter of a mile further on the Fulham-road, a man named Ward asked Chandler to have some beer—I said that I could not allow him to have any, while he was in my custody—six or eight men then came out of the public house and said, "Give it to him! give it to the b—y b—r? kill the b—r!"—Chandler then commenced kicking and striking, endeavouring to trip me up—I <hi rend="italic">hauled</hi> him to the ground, and as I did so he hit me on my knuckles—a man, not in custody, drew my staff from my pocket and struck me on the arm—a man who was looking on came between me and the man who had the staff, and knocked it out of his hand as he was coming to hit me on the head with it—his name is James Knight—Chandler was on the ground at that time—he had been drinking, but I should consider him sober—I lifted him up, and he commenced kicking and striking more furiously than he did on the first occasion, and I threw him down again, and he bit my left thumb, and then my right hand—it was a very severe bite, I have not got the use of my thumb properly yet—at this time, Mack stepped off the kerb stone and struck me on my face, which cut my lip very severely, and he hit me several times, and kicked me on the side as I was stooping to hold Chandler down—the man with the onions was then some little distance off, and I saw Mack make towards him with another man who had knocked the staff out of my hand, and he said, "Where is the b—y b—r with the box?"—(that was not the man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220100"/>
               <p>who had had the onions previously)—Mack then came up and kicked me a severe blow on the cheek, so that I could not see for three nights and two days, and the sight is very thick now if I allow the light to fall on it—it did not make me unconscious—after that I was kicked several times about the body, but cannot say by whom—assistance came, and I helped to convey Chandler part of the way to the station house, till we got more assistance—I have not been able to attend to my duty, and have been under medical treatment ever since—I still suffer severely in the back and side.</p>

               <p>of 4th Oct. I went to Still's house—his face was very much swollen<lb/>there was a slight contusion over his right eye, the eyelid could not be separated, and there were marks as if he had been kicked on the right side of his face—his lip was cut very deeply—both hands were marked as if they had been bitten—his left thumb was more severely bitten than the fingers—I found no bruises on his body, but he complained of much pain, and seemed to be in great suffering—he has been off duty ever since, and it will be many months before he can do his duty again, perhaps never.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the whole time you were there, did Mack touch the constable in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a gentleman stood by with a parcel, he had a can on his back, and a handkerchief in his hand—he was stooping down, putting down a bundle down by the side of the constable, and I saw Mack make a strike at him, but he missed him and struck the constable, though not wilfully that I know of—he struck no other blow, there was a crowd at that time which were taking part against the constable—Mack struck no other blow—I heard no expression about a fair fight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About the Italian boys with the white mice, you were discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because a vile conspiracy was set up against me—I preferred a charge at Marlborough-street against a man for keeping fifty boys—it was not in consequence of that that I was dismissed—I did not lay a charge against him that he had fifty boys, and then when at the Court refuse to swear that there were more than ten—I was dismissed in 1844—I never brought any charge against Abiatti, but against his brother—that was in 1842—they never had Abiatti, he was too artful for that—no one paid me, I did it gratuitously—I mean I did all this for nothing—they set up a con<lb/>spiracy against me, and the police took my warrant away—I had had it seven or eight months.</p>

"—she said she had taken it of a customer—I said, "Who?" she said, "Either Coney's, the Butler's Head Tavern, or at the butcher's in Newgate-market"—I said, "You know you have told me a lie, and it is not the first"—I got up from tea, and went to those two persons that she had named—I saw them—1 came back to my own house, and charged the prisoner with robbing me—I told her that she had told me a falsehood, that neither of the parties she had named had given her that piece of coin, and she must have stolen it out of the writing desk, and I would give her into custody—I sent for a policeman, I told her before the policeman that if she would go with me and the policeman, and search her boxes, if</p>

I think it is mine"—she said, "Oh, dear, it can't be yours, I have taken it from Coney's, the Butler's Head, or from somebody in Newgate Market"—I said, "I think it is mine, I am sure it is mine, I am certain"—she seemed very much confused, and did not wish me to say anything about it, and said that she would get it changed next day—I said if I could not</p>

Miller was our porter—it was his duty to take the list from Mr. Gregory, our manager, at each day's town delivery—it was his duty to load the waggon for the town delivery—he had a porter, named Neale, to assist him—he would literally load the van, and, if he had not as much as was in the invoice, it would be his own fault if he did not point out the error—if there were twenty or ten reams additional, it would be impossible for Wake not to know it, as one of the reams in question weighs over a hundredweight—I do not think Miller could take ten or twenty reams by mistake—the boy, Joyce, used to attend on the cart—I do not think anybody could have put paper on the cart without Miller's knowledge if he attended personally on the loading—on 24th Sept, I think it was, I went with an officer to Lewis's shop, No. 36, Mitre-street—(that is where Moss gives his address on some of the invoices)—we first went into his little front parlour—he was engaged in taking an order for lucifer match boxes—the officer told him he would recollect that he had been there some few days before, about some paper, and said, "You will allow Mr. Millington to look over your premises?"—he said, "Certainly," and took me over—I saw probably twenty reams of paper, some without wrappers at all, and others with the labels; others with a portion of the wrapper torn off—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a perfect ream from my own warehouse—here are two wrap<lb/>pers—one has a label pasted on, and there is a little stamp, which bears the date as well as the label—this is one of the reams which were at Lewis's house, and I potently believe that it came from my warehouse, having received 450 reams of it—I asked Lewis where he got these papers—he hesitated and thought a little while, and then said, "Oh, that? I bought—that long before Christmas"—I said, "Indeed! that is strange, considering it only paid the duty in June last"—I do not think he made any reply to that—he said he bought it of different people, mentioning the names of Wilson, and Morgan, and Stacey—he said that he had invoices of what he had got, and had his file up, and looked for them, in ray presence, but could only find one, bought of a man named Evans, without any address on it, in the preceding year—he looked for the invoices some time—I was there an hour, or an hour and a half, but he produced no invoice but that—I directed his</p>

               <p>attention to the rest of the paper, and made the same remark, but he could not produce the invoices—I found one ream where the duty had not been taken off—the Excise laws regulate that this stamp shall be on part of the two folds—as it is done quickly, it is not always perfect, but this ream has it perfect—the date here is "7—6—55"—whoever did this, has omitted to tear off the dates on almost every ream—I have examined many of these reams—they all bear the same date—I think there were eleven reams of this sort of paper, and we received on the following day to this date, 450 reams—all the paper that we receive in stock bears the charge date—this is dated June 7th, and we received it on the 8th—I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it is our paper—I asked Lewis what his object was in tearing these off—he said that he had pill boxes to make, and tore these labels off, as being thicker paper—here are twenty-three quires of very large brown paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the cover was torn off one ream before the former ream was all used.</p>

On 17th Sept., after taking Moss into custody, I went to No. 36, Mitre-street—I went into Lewis's work shop; he is a lucifer match box maker—I saw a pile of paper there, between twenty and twenty-five reams, the whole of it had the excise labels on it, and they all appeared to be perfect reams—I did not disturb them then, I was looking for the catalogue mentioned by Moss—I went again on the fol<lb/>lowing Monday, the 24th, with Mr. Millington, after I heard of the cart stopping, and found about the same number of reams—there were then no excise wrappers, they had been torn off in the interim—I am sure of that—</p>

               <p>I saw Lewis both on the first and second occasion—he said that he got these nine reams of paper before Christmas—I saw Mr. Millington point out the stamp mark "June" to him—I asked him where he bought it, he said he had the invoice—I said, "Get it," and he could not find it—he gave me two invoices, which he said had reference to a portion of the white paper bought at Williamson's—Mr. Millington said, "There is no such name," and then he said that it was Wilson and Morgan, and of Stacey; and in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he pointed out that particular paper to me—I did not go in uniform on the first occasion, but I told him I was a policeman, and came to search, and that I had Miller in custody for stealing paper—on the second occasion I told Lewis that the carman had been bringing paper to his house for the last twelve months—he said that it was no such thing, and if it had been brought there he must have seen it, and that it was only a roll of music paper that Moss used to carry—I said, "Reams of paper brought here on a man's shoulder"—he again denied it, and said that no paper came to his house except to him, and he should not have allowed it to remain there—I described Wake, and asked whether he knew him—he said that he did not—I took him and the paper to the station—on the 2nd I took Miller and Wake; Miller said that he was innocent, and did not know Moss; and on the Wednesday, I asked Wake whether he knew Moss, the singer, and he said, "No."</p>

               <p>the receipts; he ought to have delivered nothing for which there was not an invoice, and for which he did not bring back a receipt—I recollect no customer in Mitre-street, ever—Wake had no authority to deliver paper there, without an invoice from the house—I find no receipt for goods delivered at No. 36, Mitre-street—we received a great quantity of this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>), and it is impossible to trace it, having had some in the house previous and since, but it is of the same quality, and is charged with duty on the same date, "7—6—55"—no paper has been sold to Lewis at all—the rest of the twenty reams are without wrappers, there<lb/>fore it is impossible to identify them, but it is my belief that they came from Messrs. Millington's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Miller Whittaker, of Black heath. The prisoner was in his service—she came on 10th July, and remained three weeks—six or seven weeks after she left I missed a merino dress, which had been kept in a box in her bedroom—I then made inquiries and found that the prisoner was living with Mr. Kennedy, at Belmont-hill—I went there, and told her we had a charge against her, but did not say what it was—she said that she was prepared for anything we had against her—(my husband and a policeman were with me)—I asked her to come with me—she said that she would not; her master was out; she should wait till he returned, and after that she would get her bonnet and shawl, and come with us—she asked a charwoman who was there to go and get her bonnet and shawl—she refused—she then asked me to go with her—I refused, as her master was out—she then ran up stairs, and I heard a window open—I went up and followed her—after a long time, she came down, dressed—while in the bedroom, I asked her where ray drab French merino dress was—she denied having it—when she came down my husband asked her if I had told her what I had against her—she said, "Yes," and denied it—he said to her, "Have you one of that description in your posses<lb/>sion at all?"—she said that she had, but it was hers—I asked her to product it—she said that it was down stairs—some one went down, but could not find it—afterwards she said, "Come out in the garden"—we searched, but could not find it—she then went up to search for it herself, but could not find it—she then went to the window and looked out—I said, "Yes, that</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I entered the service on 12th July; it was to be an easy place, and all the washing to be put out; but there were twelve in family, eighteen rooms, and all the washing done at home; fifteen dozen for one pair of hands; I felt my health and strength so fast declining, that I was unable to do the work; I told her that I could not do it; she said that she would have her revenge on me if I did not stay with her. and I should not go elsewhere; I was wearing that dress seven weeks in the neighbourhood, passing and repassing that house three times in the day, and they passing me, and never accusing me of it; when the prosecutrix came, it was half past 10 o'clock at night; she followed me up stairs into my bed room; I could hardly get up, as I was suffering from inflammation in my side, and I think she was in the room before me; she searched my box, and took me into custody, without any authority; my master and mistress were at a party, and I said that I would go when they returned; she called me all the vile wretches she could, and said that she thought Mr. Kennedy would be glad to get such a vile wretch out of the house; I told my master that I had purchased the dress at Mr. Shene's, High-street, Guildford, five years ago; I went into mourning for my mother, and after<lb/>wards, found that it was too small for me, and was obliged to graft it, as if you look you will see; if I had had the money, I could have brought twenty</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the door was closed, and you outside the room, how could you see what the prisoner had in his hand?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw he had something in his hand which appeared to me like a fender—I do not know whether my cousin wanted to go into the room—it was not my cousin who broke the door to go into Mahoney—I have been in that room which the prisoner went in—there was a fender there when I lodged there—I had not heard anything about crawlers during the evening—I had lodged with Mahoney, and he struck me, and Daniel Geary said he would have it out with Mahoney.</p>

A. F." which was sewn into the corner of it—it was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say that ten bags of linseed were missing—the tiers were stacked in elevens, and one tier had ten in it—there were four tiers disturbed; three were gone from each of the three tiers, and one from another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traffic manager to the Crystal Palace Company. Edwin Poiney was in their employ, in the stables, as feeder of the horses, and the elder prisoner, Robert, lived in a cottage about half a mile from the Palace—on 25th Sept., in consequence of information, I went with Marsh, an officer, to that cottage, and met the prisoner Robert on the way—I said to him, "Poiney, we are going to search your house; on account of having found some cigar cases in your son's corn bin, we are led to suppose that you have at your house some coats which have been stolen from the Com<lb/>pany's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220145"/>
               <p>stable yard"—I asked him how many coats his son had brought home within the last three months—he considered for a few minutes, and said, "I should not like to deceive you; there is only one, a black coat, which you will find hanging on the bed rail"—the said that his son had brought it home, and told him he had bought it for half a crown—I pro<lb/>posed that he should accompany me to the house, and he declined—I and Marsh then proceeded to the house, and found these two coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging, one over the other, on the rail of the bed, the one he spoke of, and another—the value of the black coat, of which he spoke, is three guineas—on a subsequent occasion we found this nearly new Mackintosh cape (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of it is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about two hours afterwards Robert Poiney came to my house, at the stables, and asked me if I had found the coat—I said, "Yes," and that we had found a second coat, at which he appeared much surprised, but made no reply—I told him he must be cautious what he said to me, as it was a very serious matter, and everything, no doubt, would turn op—I asked him if he knew of any other coats, or other things, which his son had brought home—he said, by the bye, there was a second coat which his son had brought home, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I told him we had discovered a third coat—he appeared surprised, but made no reply—I took him by the collar, and said, "Poiney, this is the third coat that is on your back"—he took the sleeve, and said, "By the bye, my son did bring this home, about three weeks ago, and say he gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is claimed for it.</p>

On 25th Sept, I went with Mr. Bourner, and met the elder prisoner with this coat on, but I did not notice it particularly then—I told him that Mr. Bourner was going to search his house, we having found other property in the corn box—he said, "You are welcome to search without a warrant"—I said, "You had better come back"—Mr. Bourner asked him how many coats his son had brought him within the last three months—he said, "One"—we then went to the house, and found two coats on the bed rail in the right hand room—I should think that that room was occupied by two people—there was a large bed in it—there was also a large bed in the other room—I cannot say which room was occupied by the elder prisoner—about two hours after<lb/>wards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220146"/>
               <p>Robert Poiney called on me at the station, and said that Mr. Bourner wished to see me—I went there, and Mr. Bourner said, "We have found the third coat," taking hold of the coat on Robert Poiney's back—he said that his wife told him that his son bought it for him of Mr. Richardson, and it was given in lieu of one which he had bought for his son of Mr. Richardson, of Penge.</p>

Q.</hi> What time did you see him first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 11 o'clock—I told him I was going to search his house—he declined to go with me, and I left him at the stable-yard and went straight to his house—I saw him again about two hours afterwards—he might have been home in the mean time; he was not under my surveillance—ho was wearing this coat—I do not remember whether he had any coat over it—I should think that this was a very expensive coat before it was altered.</p>

I am here"—I called out, "Thieves! robbers! No. 4, Bennet-street!"—my servant called out, "Sir, they are escaping over the wall"—I went and saw the prisoner Jones—I returned to my bedroom and commenced dressing myself, finding there was assistance at hand—I sprang my rattle again, dressed myself, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock maker, of No. 56, Blackfriars-road. In consequence of information I received from the last witness, I went to the prisoner's shop, in Webber-street, on 20th Sept.—I tendered the bill for payment of the dial, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had told my man that same morning that if I would give him change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, he would pay me—he was then absent from the bar for some time to get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as I supposed—after some time he returned with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his hand, which he laid upon the counter—I took it up, I did not examine it very particularly—I saw a name written on it—this is the note, it has the name of "Williams" written on it—it had that name on it when I examined it—it appeared to me to have been recently written, it appeared in a damp state, and a little smeared—I placed 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the counter—I took the note—the prisoner took the change—I left the shop—I saw the name of Amelia Cumby over the door—I put the note into my pocket—I had no other note—I went to Debenham and Storrs', in Covent-garden—while I was there, I wrote my initials on the back of the note—here they are "H. P" in my writing—while I was there I made inquiries, and the note was sent to Coutts' by my direction—I received it back, and took it to the prisoner's house—I told him I wished to speak to him privately—he said it was of no consequence, it was merely his daughter who was present—(this was near 2 o'clock; I had taken the note about two hours previously)—I said, "I have to tell you that the note you gave me is a forged one"—he said he could hardly think it, or some such answer as that—I said, "I am sure of it, I have had the opinion of two or three of Coutts' clerks"—I asked him where he got it—he said, "Of that man that comes here, a customer"—he and his daughter said that at the same time, or within a minute or so—I said, "Indeed! well, at all events, I suppose you are prepared to give me my 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back?"—he said he had paid it away—I said, "Indeed! it is rather premature; it is scarcely two hours since I was here"—he said, "Well, it is a fact; I can convince you that I have paid it away"—he took up his book—I said, "I don't know, I will take it as a matter of fact; I don't want to see your book, but you had my money about two hours ago"—he said that he should no doubt see the party that they took it of in the evening, about 8 o'clock, and the daughter made the same observation, that no doubt they should see the party—I said, "Well, from what I have seen of this business, I shall put it in the hands of the police"—I left them, stating that I would go home for an hour and consider it—I returned to the prisoner in about an hour, and I said to him, "Have you anything fresh to say to me about this affair?"—he said, No, only he had taken it of the party he spoke of, and that, he had taken it the night before"—I said, "What name did he give you? did you write it?"—he said, "No, the party wrote it himself—I said, "What name did he put on it?"—he said, "The name of Miller"—I asked if he gave his address—he said, "No, he did not"—I said, "No, you are quite wrong; Miller is not the name;" and expressed my surprise that he should give change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for a pot of beer,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220153"/>
               <p>which he said he did, without taking the address, particularly as he was wrong in the name—I then left him, and went to his house again about 8 o'clock the same evening, with two friends—I saw him and his daughter—I said to him, "I suppose you have not seen this party yet?"—he said, "Oh, it is scarcely time yet, he comes about 8 o'clock"—I then asked him what he meant to do about it, and whether he was prepared to give me the change—he said that ho was not—one of my friends spoke to him about the improbability of his taking a note in that way, telling him that he himself was a publican, and he should not have done so—the prisoner said, well, he took it, he was not so particular, or words to that effect—one of my friends began to test the note in consequence of the prisoner stating that he did not know it was forged, he had no proof of it—that was what he meant—my friend said, "I will test the note for you in two minutes;" and he called for a glass of water to test it—I, by the advice of my friends, was about giving the prisoner into custody—I was about leaving for that purpose—he seemed a little alarmed about my giving him into custody, and he then appointed the next morning at 10 o'clock to be with me—the next morning the prisoner and another man came to my shop—he said that he called to arrange about the note, that he was an innocent man; he put his friend's name and card upon the counter, and said he had got many other friends—I said, "What is the use of talking so? you came here to arrange about the note; as you have so many friends, you can easily raise 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said if I would give him till the evening, he would endeavour to get it—I told him I should put it in the hands of Mr. Freshfield, and he would have to convince him and a Jury, I should not wait any longer—this was when he was leaving me in the morning—I went to his house in the evening again and saw him—he said he was a poor man, and he hoped I should not be severe—I said if he would run his head into the fire, he must—I believed he knew it was a forged note—on the day following I gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 1st Sept., my atten<lb/>tion was called to the deceased, who was then in the reception ward at Lambeth workhouse—he was able to stand upright, and was conscious and rational, and able to reply to my questions—I found him tremulous, as if from a habit of hard drinking—he drew my attention to the condition of his chest—I found the fore part of it very much swollen, enlarged, and bruised, so that I could not feel the bones underneath—I had him put to bed in the sick ward—on 3rd Sept., I found symptoms of an abscess on the right side of the chest, which I opened, and there was a discharge of about a pint of very fetid matter—that appeared to relieve him—he appeared better the next day—on 6th Sept., he was much worse, and from that time till the 13th he continued declining—on the 13th, his state was one of imminent danger—I told him so at that time, and he said that he felt that he was sinking and could not recover—in consequence of that I directed a police Magistrate to be sent for, and the deceased made a statement to him in my presence—no longer time elapsed between my telling him he was in imminent danger, and his making the statement, than was necessary to send for the Magistrate—after that the deceased continued gradually to sink till the 20th, when he died—on the day after his death I made an examination of the body, and took some notes of it—the head was carefully shaved over the upper portion of the scalp—I found two contusions between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the brain—I uncovered the skull, which I found solid and unbroken—the membrane covering the brain was congested, and adhe<lb/>rent in its inner surface to a small spot at the upper part of the brain—the brain itself was slightly congested at the base of the skull—I examined the chest and found the large sinus of an abscess, extending from the right breast across the breast bone to the left breast about eight inches in length—it had penetrated into the hollow of the chest, and up to the throat back to the spine, and down into the belly—it had surrounded the surface of the lungs—it had partly got into the texture—the outer surface of the lungs were adherent to the inner walls of the chest—I found the fourth and fifth ribs broken on the right side, and the breast bone also—the external part of the chest was covered with dark discoloration, the result of contusions—there was a double fracture of the fourth rib, and a single fracture of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220157"/>
               <p>fifth rib—I afterwards examined the stomach, and other ports of the body—the muscular substance of the heart was pale and flabby—the cause of death in my opinion was the inflammation, and formation of the large abscess and an un united fracture in the chest, the result of external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, what length of time had elapsed between the in<lb/>jury and the abscess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is, that for the formation of such a large abscess two or three weeks must have elapsed—it might, in a bad con<lb/>stitution, have occurred in ten or twelve day—he was in a state of mus<lb/>cular debility from hard drinking—I do not know that if a man continued drinking for days after receiving this injury, it would cause the abscess to form sooner than it otherwise would—I should rather have recommended the continuance of stimulants—my opinion is, that the injury was caused by blows—it might be by great pressure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you think that blows inflicted by a man in a recumbent position, or kneeling on the chest, would cause such factories as you describe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think such violence might—I think the breast bone might be broken by the fist of a powerful man—the fourth rib had a double fracture, and the broken portion was partially dissolved by the matter sur<lb/>rounding it—the bone itself did not penetrate the lungs, it was lying loose—the abscess had partly penetrated the lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think a man who had received such severe injuries could walk about three hours afterwards, and continue exerting himself throughout the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A man with broken ribs might walk about, and does walk about—I never saw a parallel accident before, but a man might do it—I think if he were the subject of subsequent violence, his sufferings would be very much aggravated—if a person were to throw him down, I should say he must be a man of very stern feelings if he did not complain—the injuries of the head did not involve death; yet I should say the deposit of serum at the base of the brain was serious—I heard the deceased's state<lb/>ment—had I never heard the statement, I should have been of the same opinion—I should have expected such an abscess would have taken four weeks to form, but the length of time would depend on the state of the person's body.</p>

On the morning of 18th Sept I had been up all night with a neighbour who was ill—I was in an upper room, and about quarter past 5 o'clock that morning I heard a great disturbance in the street, and a woman making a great noise—I opened the window, and saw a woman standing under the window with a bonnet in her hand—I afterwards saw a woman in the act of lifting mud from the street with her hand and throwing it at the prisoner—it turned out to be the dead woman, Mary Ann Latimer—she was taking up mud and oyster shells, and what she could get, and throwing them at the prisoner, and calling him dreadful names, using dreadful language—I have seen him as a neighbour—he and this woman lived together—she called him a thief, and she called "Mr. Black, come down, he has stolen your shirt, and he has stolen three pairs of boots, too"—when she said this, she was running towards him with the mud in her hand, and throwing the mud over him—the prisoner went into the house, and she then ran and called Mr. Black, and said he stole his shirt, and three pairs of boots—the prisoner came out again, and she called him a b—y English <hi rend="italic">Sossener</hi>, and she turned up her sleeves as if turning them up to fight—she said, "I am a b—y lion, and I will tear your liver out"—she was then with her fists doubled, and her sleeves turned up, and was very near to him—up to this time, the prisoner had done nothing at all to her—he did not call her anything—I never heard him speak—on her using this threat, he raised his hand straight, as if he were going to hit her a blow, and he struck or pushed her, I cannot say which, but she reeled, and fell—she turned on her side, and her head struck against the iron post, at the corner of the street, on the kerb stone—I came down and went to her assistance—I lifted her up—she appeared quite lifeless—I put my hand on her chest, she appeared to have no pulsation—I put my hand to her forehead, and it was cold—I looked at her right hand, and there was a little blood—the prisoner struck her with his hand closed—I cannot say whether it was a push or a blow—I thought she was hit, as she fell—the prisoner went away as she fell—a policeman was called after some time—I heard the prisoner say she was not his wife, and that he had lived six months with her—I had not heard anything in their room before this—I had not opened the window—I did not hear the prisoner say anything about her brother.</p>
