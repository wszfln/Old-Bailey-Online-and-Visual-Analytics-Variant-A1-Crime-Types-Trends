                  </hi>. I live at Denmark Hill, and am foreman of the mantle department of the Incandescent Gas Company—the prisoner was a customer of theirs at 121 Mile End Road—they supplied him with two of these lights, burners, mantles, and chimneys—there was a form of contract—nine shillings a year is charged to maintain each light, for which purpose we have a staff of maintenance men who visit customers' houses, some weekly and some fortnightly; they examine the light to see if anything. has to be renewed; they are supplied with mantles and chimneys, but not burners, also with a card for each customer, on which he puts down his visit and the number of mantles and chimneys supplied—the card is signed by the customer and should correspond with the number of empty boxes brought back—Cooper had that round till towards the end of the year; his last visit was in July, 1895; he was then given a week's holiday, and on the 28th he was discharged for something quite distinct from this—these</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are Abrams' cards for August, September, October, etc., they are marked "Two lamps"—Cooper was succeeded on his round by Smith, who made a communication to me on October 7th, and I gave him instructions what to do, and on the 31st I arranged for a third person to be in the shop—the prisoner was arrested on a warrant in November—the letter from Benden was brought to my knowledge some time after the communication from Smith, who was acting under my in<lb/>structions before—these burners, lamps, and mantles found at the time of the arrest are the company's property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The assistant-manager brought the letter to my notice—I have only been in the company's service since July 22nd—I do not know whether these mantles are made of clay from Brazil—if you suggest that they are worth 2d. each I cannot contradict you—I know this mantle case because I marked it with red ink before I took it to the Magistrate—there are other incandescent gas companies—the employees of the company may buy for themselves, but are not allowed to sell to anybody else—I said at the Police-court, "The employees of the company have not now the privilege of selling at a discount; the practice was discontinued twelve months ago; there is a man at the stores to give the mantles out, and they are booked when they are returned."</p>

I have plenty of empty mantle boxes, and with me it is as sound as iron"—he was in the shop; I gave him the card to sign—he said, "You have used</p>

               <p>nothing; put down one mantle on the card; give me the mantle and I will sign for it"—I said, "I cannot do that; I have another job to do, and do not know what stuff I might want; if I have got any to spare I will call in as I come back"—I had not used any mantle—I do not know how many lights he had in other parts of the house, but I asked him what he did about the others; he said, "I maintain them myself."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a name on the collar of the burners, and on some of the chimneys—Lane went in with me; I believe he is a detective—he was an absolute stranger to me, and Abrams did not know him—he was two or three yards from me—it is a tidy-sized shop—there was a man in a corner nursing a child—everybody in the shop could not hear him say, "Have you got the stuff?" because he came up to me—I stood on a pair of steps at the window, and at some parts of the conversation Abrams stood on a chair to speak to me.</p>

I am an inquiry officer in the employ of the company—in consequence of instructions from Mr. Bartlett on October 31st, I followed Smith into the defendant's shop and sat on the second chair from the window—I could not hear all that was said—Abrams said to Smith, "Have you got that <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> for me?"—he said, "No, I have not; but I have got a dozen or so by me; by-the-way, I have seen Cooper, and he says that you always gave him 5d. for the mantles?"—the prisoner said, "Very well; I will give you 5d. each if you will give me some chimneys as well. I must have two to-night or four to-morrow morning for certain—Smith said, "I am going further up the road, and if I have anything left I will look in as I come back"—when Smith had finished attending to the lights he handed the card to Abrams, who said, "You have no mantle on the card"—Smith said, "No, nothing has been used"—Abrams said, "Put one mantle down, give me the mantle, and I will sign for it"—a young man shaved me, but in reality I was listening to what I could hear—I then got up—I was about a foot and a half from him; I got quite close to him.</p>

On February 22nd, between twelve and one p.m., I was walking along Wilton Road, from Victoria, and saw the prisoner, whom I knew by sight—she had threatened me at six o'clock, and said that she meant to do for me before the night was out, and at twelve o'clock she came behind me and put something into my eye, I do not know whether it was an umbrella or what—I was taken to an hospital and my eye had to be removed—she is an unfortunate woman.</p>

Cox and Co.; it is for forging the signature of Lord Frankfort to a cheque"—he said, "All right"—I afterwards brought him to London—when charged at Bow Street, he made no reply—on searching his house I found this diary, this receipt for payment for shoes on the billhead of the Civil Service Supply Association, and this brown paper bag with seventeen sovereigns in it—at the Police-court I put him with eight others—from the diary a piece under the date October 17th is carefully cut out—I found letters at his house addressed to him at 2, Liffey Street, Inche<lb/>core, Dublin, and dated October 22nd, 1895—the entry in the diary on October 16th is, "At home most of day, went into town and made a few small purchases; called in at the Institute and looked at the papers"—that part under the 17th which is not cut out is, "Attended Masonic Lodge in evening with Brother Shore; no business"—there is a note in the diary on October 25th, 1895, "Paid rent 3s., and gave notice to leave 2, Lifley Street on the following Friday."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found his papers showing that he had served twenty-one years seventeen days in the Army; he had reached the rank</p>

I am a professional expert in handwriting of 59, Holborn Viaduct—I have had before me this cheque, this list of names and addresses, the diary, and the bank-notes—I believe that all the writing on the cheque, the body, the signature, and the endorsement, is by the same person—I believe there is an attempt to imitate the signature of Lord Frankfort—it is an imperfect imitation—in my belief these writings are by the same person.

Have you got your ticket?"—he said, "No; take 9s. 4d. out of that," offering me a half-sovereign—9s. 4d. was the amount of a first-class fare between London and Northampton—I said "No; I cannot take your fare now. Will you come upstairs with me?"—that was the place where the Company's police have an office—Kynaston was the detective in charge there—in Scaife's presence I narrated the whole of the circumstances I have stated to Kynaston—from that time whatever conversation took place was between Kynaston and Scaife—when the train arrived at Willesden no one got out of the compartment before I got to it, nor did anyone get into it—I am quite sure no woman got out of the compartment.</p>

I am a detective officer in the employ of the London and North Western Railway Company—we have an office at Euston—on September 27th I was in charge there about 12.45; Scaife was brought in by Hill who related to me what had happened—I then said to the prisoner, "You have heard what the collector has said, "he said, "Yes, that is perfectly true"—he took out of his pocket a half-sovereign and said, "Take 9s. 4d. out of that," putting it on the desk at which I was sitting—I told him I could not accept of it, as it had been refused by the collector—he replied, "Go on, take 9s. 4d. out of that"—I told him again I could not accept it; I then asked him for his name and address, which he gave as John Scaife, 7, Mincing Lane—I asked him for his private address, which he refused to give—I asked him if he had anything in his possession to show that that was his name and address—he then produced from his pocket a memorandum, with John Scaife, 7, Mincing Lane, on it, and when leaving the office he said, "I will see someone who will accept the fare"—he again asked me to accept it, which I refused—I immediately communi<lb/>cated with the officials at Northampton Station by telegraph—on Monday, November 11th, upon instructions, I went to 42, Mount Place, Burdett Road, Deptiord, about 12, and watched the house—at 12.30 I saw Scaife leave that house—I had been in Court when Reeves gave her address as 42, St. Paul's Road, and also the address of the Isle of Man—on December 5th I was present when the lad Woodhouse was examined, I heard him give the address of a photographer, Mr. Wright, 81, High Street, Whitechapel—I went there about 1.20, and saw the manager; I made a communication to him, and he handed me this negative—after that I kept watch on the shop, and about 2.20 I saw Mrs. Reeves with two other females and two males, at that shop.</p>

               <p>ten lines taken by my colleague, Mr. Tate, the chief clerk, of the evidence given by the defendant, Hannah Reeves, on October 25th, on the hearing of a summons against John Scaife for travelling on the railway without a ticket—I know Mr. Tate's writing—she gave her address as Douglas, Isle of Man—"On September 26th I went to Northampton on business. I came back on the next day with the defendant (Scaife). I went down with my sister. I stayed at the Temperance Hotel, and the defendant at the Black Boy. I saw him there, and he complained about his health. It was arranged that we should return together the next day. Mr. Scaife took the tickets; he went to the booking-office and returned. He handed me my ticket, and went back to the ticket-office again. I returned with him to London, accompanied by another lady. Willesden was, I think, the first stop. The defendant got out with me there to see me into a cab. Before we got to Willesden the defendant gave me a ticket, and I returned it, because it was not the one I required. It was a return, and mine was a single. He gave me then a single ticket. At Willesden he gave it to the ticket collector, and gave his up too. After seeing me into a cab he went into the station. On the way he went into the lavatory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined:</hi> I had to be on the platform at 10.30; the train was before eleven, between 10.30 and eleven. I swear I travelled by that train with the defendant. I did not see the number of the ticket; I believe it was dated September 27th. I saw the defendant taking it to the ticket collector; he said he was going to see me into a cab. I generally travel first class. The defendant took the ticket. I did not pay him for it. He paid my fare down and my sister's. We travelled first class.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined:</hi> I went down to Northampton to buy a business of which the defendant was the liquidator"—on October 11th and 25th Horace Woodhouse or Woodward was examined—on the 11th he said, "I am the defendant's clerk. On September 27th the defendant came in and showed me half a return ticket"—on the 25th he was cross-examined and said, "At two o'clock in the afternoon the defendant came to the office and said he expected some bother, and asked me to notice the number and date of the ticket. I swear it was the 27th; the number was 3617. I made a note, now produced, at the time of the particulars of the ticket. I saw Inspector Pearson on the Monday or Tuesday after the 27th. I did not tell him my employer had not been at his office on the 27th. Pearson did not, I think, ask me had he been there on the 27th. I am sure he did not. The defendant was at his office from 2 o'clock till 2.30 on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>

I am a police-officer and wish to see him"—he hesitated for some time; then Pearson came in and said, "How are you, Mr. Scaife?"—I said, "Oh, you are Mr. Scaife"—up to that time, some three or four minutes, he had not given me the informa<lb/>tion that he was Scaife—I remained during the conversation between Pearson and Scaife.</p>

For goodness sake, give the right date when you are in the box"—I went into the box on the 11th and gave the evidence which has been read—after that, on 17th, the day before the remand, and on 24th, the day before I was recalled, he impressed on me that was the date, and that I was to stick to it—he suggested it was 2 p.m. on 27th that I had seen the ticket—on Monday, September 30th, a railway ticket was shown to me; it was the return half of a ticket such as a person would have who had taken a return ticket from Northampton to London and had given up one half at Willesden—I think about five days after he had shown me the ticket he asked me whether I knew a small photographer, and told him I did, and gave him the name of Wright, Whitechapel Road, who has been called; I knew the place—he said he would get his ticket photographed—on 25th I was re<lb/>called, and gave the evidence which has been read—I was charged with com<lb/>mitting perjury, and after that I made a statement to my solicitor without any communication from the London and North Western Railway Com<lb/>pany, and in consequence of that I was called at the last hearing on December 5th, and examined by you at the Police-court on another charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Rye. In 1886 I first met the prisoner. I was living with my mother at that time, at East Dulwich—he continued to visit me there, and in July, 1887, he proposed marriage to me; it was to take place either that year or the next—in 1888 it was fixed for July or August that year; something happened to postpone it. but the engagement continued down to June, 1889—he told me that his business was principally in Brussels, and the marriage was to be there—my mother did not approve of that, but in the end she gave way—at the end of August, 1889, I went to Brussels, my mother being already there, and on September 4th I went through the ceremony of marriage with the prisoner, before the Mayor; there were witnesses to the marriage—I handed in a certificate of domicile as requested, stating</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189512090028"/>
               <p>how long we had both been in Brussels—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner described himself as born in Manchester on February 15th, 1845, and described himself as a bachelor, and myself as single—after the marriage we went to stay at Ostend for a few days, and then came back to England—we remained here till about the 12th of October that year; then we went over to Paris, where he had a business, and we remained there down to September 1891—while there, he was very often going to England—my mother was with me in Paris; she died on September 27th, 1891; she had an income of her own—she made her will in my favour, leaving all to me—before her death she made a deed of assignment of her property to me; upon that I raised a mortgage, and I afterwards sold the reversion; the prisoner had the bene<lb/>fit of that—he had everything; I don't think I had more than between £400 and £500—we first had a mortgage of £2,000, that was taken up, and then some more money. I think he had between £3,000 and £4,000 before my mother's death; there was not a farthing left when she died; she had an annuity that died with her. The prisoner was in London at the time of her death. I telegraphed to him and he came over, but not in time for the funeral; he stayed two or three days and then went back, leaving me alone—he sent me a little money from time to time, about £20 in all, until February, 1892—I did not see him at all before I came to London; the landlord would not let me stay there as I could not pay the rent—in London I met the prisoner by chance in the street; he did not know that I was coming—he then told me to take a room somewhere. I did, and he came and stayed with me two days—then he said he had to go to Man<lb/>chester on important business, and I never saw him again till this year—I had letters from him, the last time was at the beginning of July, 1892—between those dates I made a discovery, in consequence of which I could not do anything. I had no money—in May, 1895, I was told he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be found, and I laid an information and gave him in charge—I gave evidence before the Magistrate at Clerkenwell, and he was remanded on bail for a week; he then went away and was afterwards re-arrested in Manchester.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before our engagement my mother invited the prisoner to come and stay there—we were not in financial difficulties at that time; We were not wanting money very badly—my mother had not quarrelled with her trustees' solicitors—they did not suggest that if I were to marry they would advance money to her—a Mr. L. came and told me that the prisoner was married; that was a year before our marriage—I spoke to the prisoner about it; he denied it—I knew a Mr. Daley—he was not a solicitor; he was clerk to a solicitor—he did not ad<lb/>vise me to go through the ceremony at Brussels, which was worthless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I was told this about the prisoner I wrote to him at Brussels to come back—he never replied—I was naturally angry—ray mother became ill; she was very much infatuated with the prisoner, very fond of him, because he said he was just about the same age as a son of hers who had died in December, 1888—while the prisoner was away we heard from a friend that he had come back to London, and my mother begged me to go and see him, and if he was not married to make it up again—he came back with me, and took his most solemn oath that he was never married to the woman, that he had lived with her, and had two children by her, but he would never have anything more to do</p>

I then called out, "For God's sake, Mrs. Green, send for a doctor;" she had taken it to a doctor about three weeks after she had been with me—she gave me a shilling a day, and half a crown on Saturday—she was away two days and a-half out of the week—when she was at home she looked after it herself; she always treated it very kindly, and was very kind to the other children—I had a sick husband to attend to.</p>

I am a fully qualified medical man and live at Park House, East Finchley—I remember the prisoner's child Reuben—I first saw it from ten months to a year before its death, about October or November, 1894, it was a poor, delicate, emaciated child—it was not then suffering from rickets or consumption of the bowels; it was from exhaustion; there was no definite cause for that, it was in an exhausted, emaciated condition, improper food would account for it, giving it food that it could not assimilate—I did not learn that from its birth it was a poor little thing, that would not influence my judgment, then, or now—I next saw it on October 10th, it was then dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> on that day in company with Dr. Hochee—it weighed 6 1/2 lbs. the normal weight should have been from 16 lbs. to 24 lbs.; it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189512090040"/>
               <p>was poorly clothed and dirty, not filthy; it was extremely emaciated—I could find no organic disease to account for that emaciation—I attributed it to malnutrition.</p>

That might arise from improper food, or want of food, quite as likely one as the other—that may happen with the kindest mother in the world, if she does not understand what food would assimilate—the first time I saw the child it was having condensed milk, and I altered that to cow's milk, and gave instructions as to the dilution of the cow's milk—it was a nurse child—I attended it for a week after<lb/>wards and then never saw it again; it was always an emaciated child from the first, and very small—milk would be the proper food—mal<lb/>nutrition would be not putting water to it, or giving it milk or food stuff which would not agree with it at the time—I told her to dilute the milk—I had some fault to find with the utensils in which the milk was kept; they were dirty, the bottle in which the milk was given was not clean, hence one could not be responsible for the milk; there was nothing harmful in the bottle except dirt, which is hurtful—the emaciation might arise from disease—I should rather suspect disease of some sort to linger in the frame of a child that was always a puny little thing—the appear<lb/>ances might be accounted for by want of a sufficient quantity of food, or want of strictly proper food, or disease—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> showed no disease; I never saw the child at its birth—if it always was so from its birth I should have suspected something wrong; it was very small when I saw it.</p>

I live at Park Gate, East Finchley, and am a fully qualified medical man—I assisted Mr. Hicks in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion—I have heard his evidence, and agree with it; there was no disease—frequently a child is born very small and very weak in consequence of the mother herself not being properly nourished, but not itself in a state of disease; being born small it may not be expected to survive—I could not say if it was not so in this case, but if I had such a child under my care I should require it to be very frequently fed with milk and water, one part of milk and two of water—it would entirely depend upon how it got on—the prisoner's husband was my groom some years ago—I have not seen anything of him since to my knowledge; I have understood that he has been a bad husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I have a very bad husband, and had to go to work to support my children. He ill-treated me badly, and has broken a brass rod over my back. I have had to send my children out sometimes. He gave me money sometimes. I never took to drink."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed in a paper which was read at length, in which she described a system of ill-treatment and drunkenness on the part of her husband, which compelled her to go out to work for the support of herself and children; that the baby was very small and delicate from its birth, that she did her best for it and the other children, but the child was always ill, and nothing did it any good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, having been sworn as a witness, declared that her written statement was perfectly true, and that she had not seen her husband since she came out of Barnet Union a month ago.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 69, Camden Road, Holloway—I have been working for the electric lighting department of the Islington Vestry—on Friday, November 22nd, between seven and eight p. m., I was in the middle bar of the Clarence public-house, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway—there are three bars—I had been paid my wages for the week, fifty-four hours, £1 9s. 3d., and I had in my purse a sovereign, a four-shilling piece, and a florin—I had paid for some beer—the prisoners were there when I went in—I have known them for years, but never associated with them—George is a labourer, and used to live next door to me—Reeks is a bricklayer—Ted Flack, the barman, offered to row me on the Thames the following morning for a sovereign, and I took a sovereign out and showed it to him—the prisoners could hear the conversation—Flack wanted to row on the Lea, but I objected, and put the sovereign back into my purse, and put my purse into my right trousers pocket—Mrs. Fisher, who I knew, was in a bar on my left, and from what she said, I went in and treated her and her husband to some beer, and had a glass myself—I paid for that with a florin, which I took out of my purse, and left the sovereign there—I took the 4s. piece out, and put it in another pocket—George and some other men asked me to give them some beer; Reeks was with them; he is called <hi rend="italic">Puddingy</hi>; he asked me for twopence, and I gave it to him—they asked for more beer, and I paid for another pot, and then Reeks asked for another two<lb/>pence to put to the first—I refused, and said, "You have had 10d.; you ought to be satisfied"—they said, "Go on; we will make it up to you when we get work"—they then held me against the partition; Reeks took me by my left shoulder, and George by my right and put his hand in my trousers pocket, and took my purse—I made a snatch at it, and he passed it behind him—I said, "Don't act the fool, give it me back"; I put my back against the door, and said that no one should leave the bar till I got the purse"—one of them named Webb shoved me away from the door, saying that he wanted to go to the urinal—I went out and called a police sergeant—the prisoners followed me out and went to the urinal—they all came back to the public-house, and George handed me my purse saying, "Here is your purse"—I looked inside it, the sovereign was gone, and I gave George in custody—the others had gone away—next morning I gave evidence at the Police-court against George, the Magistrate asked him if he had any evidence to call, and Reeks called out from the body of the Court, "You changed a sovereign at the bar;" and at the Magistrate's request he went into the witness box and I saw him sworn on the Testament—having given his evidence the case was adjourned till the afternoon when the two barmen were called, and the Magistrate committed George for trial; Reeks was put back for a week—I then went and made a state<lb/>ment to the Treasury.</p>

I said, "See if the sovereign is in it." He said, "No." I said, "Will you charge him?" He said "Yes." I took him to the station, he was charged, and made no reply—while the charge was being taken by the Inspector, Williams said for the first time, "They shoved or pinned me against the partition and took the purse with the sovereign in out of my pocket"—I am sure he said "They."</p>

I was in the Clarence public-house and saw the prosecutor paying for pots of beer," I did not see him take his purse out; I saw him take a sovereign out of his purse and change it over the bar for silver and gold, and put the change in his pocket"—the case was then put back for the barman to be called; the Magistrate pointed out what they had said—George then said, "I do not wish to call any witnesses; he came up himself; I do not wish to have him bound over"—there was subsequently a charge against Reeks, and I gave the evidence I have given to-day—when I had finished his evidence I read it over and he said, "I am very sorry if I told the gentleman that, I was in drink at the time"—he did not seem in drink—this was more than a week afterwards at 12 a. m.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of the sailing ship <hi rend="italic">Creedmore</hi>—on the 2nd of December, we arrived in London from the port of Manilla—the prisoner was cook on board, and the steward was a man named Sing En—they had been messmates between seventeen and eighteen months, both were Chinese—during that time so far as I observed they were on friendly terms—on November 22nd, at half-past two in the after<lb/>noon, the ship was on the high seas, about sixty miles to the southward of Ireland—I was called from my cabin, and found Sing En lying on the floor outside my cabin—he was making a tremendous noise, and blood all round him—I examined him, and I found a cut about three inches long one way, and another cut about two inches long the other way, in the centre of the big cut—I could not say how deep they were, a small part of his inside was hanging out through the wound—it was a clean cut wound, it was bleeding quite a lot—there was a clean cut on his left hand, right across the palm—I called the chief officer, and we took his clothes off and put five stitches in the wound, washed him and put some sticking plaister on, bandaged him up, and put him in his bunk, and made him as comfortable as we could. I sent for the prisoner—he was standing outside the cabin door while the dressing was going on, while I was at<lb/>tending to the deceased—I examined the prisoner; I found a big gash in</p>

               <p>his left arm—I should judge about two inches long, just above the wrist—it was bleeding considerably—his arm was bare; he had his sleeves rolled up—I did not notice any other wounds on his arm—I attended to that, and bound it up—I then asked him, in the presence of the steward, how the thing happened—the steward was conscious, and able to hear it—he spoke in English—anyone not accustomed to their talk could not make out what they said—he said he was standing by the water-barrel in the galley, cutting a piece of tobacco, and the steward was standing by the table, making the model of a little ship, and the steward said to him, "You don't do any work. Why did you not run away from the ship at Newcastle? I will kill you before you get to London"—the cook replied that he did not want to run away from the ship, and that he did his work properly—"What do you want to kill me for?" and, with that, the steward picked up the big knife off the table, and made a blow on his head like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>); that he put his left arm up to save his head, and he received the blow on his arm, which he now has the wound of—he then wrestled with the big knife, and, being the stronger, he got the knife from him and pushed it into his stomach—that was all he said then—I then asked the steward in the cook's presence, who used the knife first—he said the cook used the knife first, and that he did not use it at all; that he then told the cook to have fish for to-morrow's dinner, and with that he was sitting down making a small ship on the stool at the galley, and the cook picked up the knife in his left hand and cut his hand, and that they fell on the floor—I asked if there was anyone round there to see it—he said, "No; they came round after they heard the scream"; that he then came running aft to the cabin; he said the cook was a very bad man; he did not know what he wanted to kill him for; he said that to me frequently—I locked the prisoner up in his own room—I afterwards went to the cook's galley; I found nothing unusual there—while I was sewing up the wound the carpenter brought up three knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); one of them is larger than the others; this is the big one, marked "Bull dog"—it belongs to them<lb/>selves; I don't know whether it is the steward's or the cook's; it was kept in the galley for carving meat—I examined them; I found blood on the big one, close to the point—there was nothing on the other two—the steward got worse gradually, and died on November 29th, and was buried at sea—nothing had happened to him besides the wound; he vomited all the time, up and down—the wound was three inches one way and two the other; it was all one wound; it was as if the knife went that way, and turned round and went that way; it looked to me that they were both clean cuts—we touched at Newcastle on our way home—we had been there when the cook and the steward were in the company.</p>

In a couple of days more we will be in London"—that was all that was said to me—I noticed the three knives on the floor after the cook came out—I did not pick them up—they were lying together, a little bit apart, about a foot or so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Deputy Coroner for West Middlesex—I was present at the inquest held on the body of the deceased—the prisoner was then a voluntary wit<lb/>ness and gave evidence which I took down—it was read to him and he signed it, and the Coroner signed it—this it the Coroner's signature—I took the deposition—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining all the witnesses; he was represented by a solicitor—he was cautioned. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's deposition before the Coroner was read. In this he stated that his brother had worked for him, but that he got rid of him six weeks before on account of his dirty habits that he went to Peter<lb/>borough for two days, and when he came back found his wife drunk and his brother packing up the bedding, and a boy with a cart ready to take the things away; that he went to look for assistance; that certain things were taken away that night, and others the, next clay; that every day he saw his wife with his brother; that she used to be with him at night; that when he spoke to her about it she called him bad names; that on November 2nd he and Stromeyer met his wife with his brother, that they called him names; that he followed them to find where they were living, and that finally his brother hit at him, and he hit back, and his brother fell, but he did not know if his blow reached his brother.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, now living at 74, High Street, Bradford—on November 2nd, just before eleven, I was in a public house with the prisoner; we were both quite sober—the deceased and the prisoner's wife came through the door in the compartment, and she said, "Good-night, you dirty little pup," referring to the prisoner—and the deceased, as he followed her, said, "Good-night, Tommy Dodd; you cannot sleep with this no more," referring to her—the prisoner said, "Come with me, Alfred, and I will see where they are living, and I will see if I can get my things back"—he meant things that I knew had been taken away by the deceased and old Mr. Noble's boy—we went up the, main road towards Hammersmith, and when we got this side of Elliot Road the deceased challenged me and the prisoner to fight—Mrs. Noble only kept cursing and swearing—I did not see the prisoner make any attempt to fight before his brother offered to fight him—when they got to the other side of Elliot Road, I was going along the pavement on the left hand side, a tidy way from Little Hammersmith station, the deceased turned and said to a man, "Come and pick me up while I fight one of these two—I said, "I will fight you"—the prisoner did not fight; the deceased offered to fight him, and the prisoner refused two or three times—he and his brother were calling one another names going up the road—the prisoner spoke about his having his wife and his things—on the other side of Little Hammersmith station, under a big tree, where it was not very light, the prisoner was in the gutter and I by his side, and the deceased and Mrs. Noble were on the pavement—the deceased turned round two or three times to strike the prisoner going up the road, in a threatening way—the prisoner walked along by my side, and I did not see him do anything—then the deceased hit at the prisoner and the prisoner offered to hit him, whether he hit him or not I cannot say, but</p>

               <p>the deceased fell down—I saw him on the ground—I did not see him fall—it was about half an hour after we left the public-house that this happened, or it might be a shorter time—I knew the deceased had gone off with Mrs. Noble because I have worked for the prisoner, and we met them morning, noon, and night together; and they kept taunting the prisoner—the deceased kept laughing to me about going off with the prisoner's wife: "I have got his old woman."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been my employer—I gave some evidence before the Coroner, but I had hardly time to finish it—the de<lb/>ceased said outside the public-house, "I have got your old woman, good night," not inside—I was not called before the Magistrate because I had not time to wash myself, and my face was black, and for the same reason they would not hear me before the Coroner for a long time—on the second occasion before the Coroner my face was clean, and then I gave evidence and signed my deposition—Mr. Benson was sitting beside the Coroner when he would not hear me—when I got near Little Hammersmith station I went away for a certain purpose, and did not see the blow struck that made the man fall.</p>

I live at 7, Harpur Street, Bloomsbury—I am an officer of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children—on October 25th I went to No. 2, Rowley Street, Deptford, and to a room on the second floor—I there saw the prisoner—she had a baby in her arms, and there were four other children there, one aged thirteen—the room smelled very badly, a dirty kind of smell—the child she was nursing was very dirty, there were vermin in its head, also sores on its head—I said to the prisoner, "The baby looks very ill"—she said, "Yes, it is suffering from consumptive bowels"—I asked her if she had taken it to a doctor—she said, "Yes, about two months ago"—I asked what she had been feeding it on—she said from cow's milk and also from the breast—I asked her where it slept; she said, "On that bed," pointing to a 4-ft. 6-in. iron bedstead; it consisted of three sacks filled with shav<lb/>ings, and two pillows filled with flock, the whole of which were in a very dirty state—I asked her if she had any covering in the way of bedding—she said, No, she had not, but her husband was going to get some sheets and bedding on the following Saturday—I advised her to take the child to the doctor without delay—I went there on the following day, alone, and saw her and the child; it looked in the same dirty state—I asked if she had taken it to the doctor; she said she would take it to the doctor that night, Dr. Hawkesworth—she also said her husband was going to get the blanket and sheet on the Monday; the room was in the same condition—on the following day there was no food in the room, and I went for some milk and food for the children—I saw the child take the milk; it took it very ravenously—on the 25th I weighed the child—on the second day there was food, bread and butter, and some milk for the baby—I went again on the following Monday, the 28th, with Inspector Chown—there was no alteration in the state of the room or in the state of the child—she told me she had taken it to the doctor on the Saturday; in the mean<lb/>time I had communicated with Dr. Cable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, of 249, Evelyn Street, Deptford; that is about fifty or 100 yards from where the prisoner lodged—I remember attending her child in July—I do not remember who first brought it to me; I was told it had diarrhœ a and sickness—I gave it medicine—I saw it no more until October—the prisoner brought it to me on October 26th; it was then suffering from bronchitis and sores in the head—some of the sores I should say were due to lice—there was nothing about them to show that they came from lice, except that they usually accompany lice—there was one old sore which, I think, might have been due to ringworm—the child was thin and dirty; there was a nasty smell from it—I saw vermin in its head—I told the prisoner to take it home, and ordered some beef-tea and milk for it, and I think a little whisky or brandy; I saw it again either on the 30th or 31st, it was then alive, but very bad—I saw it in my surgery, a little girl brought it—I considered that it was</p>

               <p>dying, I did not notice as to its cleanliness, it was too ill—I told the child to take it home and not to bring it out again—on November 2nd I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of it, it weighed 13 lbs. some ounces, the normal weight of such a child would be 24 or 25 lbs., if fully developed and thriving—it was a fully developed child; I saw nothing to tell me it was not; it was a delicate child—I noticed lice on the body and on the head, and sores, some on the back and some on the head—I should say some of those on the back were probably bed sores, and others were old ones; I could not say what had caused them—I found traces of bronchitis and the whole of the internal organs were very pale and bloodless—the bronchitis in itself was enough to cause death—want of cleanliness would have a bad effect, it would require a little extra care to keep off the vermin—bad air or unsuitable or insufficient food would account for the emaciation.</p>

As to food, what will suit one child will not suit another; we find a good many kind mothers who do not know how to treat their children, they give them unsuitable food and they do not thrive—the presence of lice would prevent sleep, and cause great irritation; lice very often come of themselves, or from dirt; I have sometimes seen very clean people catch one or two, they breed very rapidly, it would take a week or two to get into that state, it had vermin on the head when I first saw it—I cannot remember whether I spoke to the prisoner about it—I should be likely to; as far as I can remember—children vary very much in weight; in a child a year old it would vary in from sixteen to twenty instances—I understood that this child was two years old; I was not in the habit of seeing the prisoner; I was never inside the house.</p>

I am a medical man, of Royal Hill, Green<lb/>wich—on October 27th I went and saw this child; I had never seen it before—the room was in a filthy condition; it smelt very offensive—the child was dressed; it had on a small frock and a little shift; I could see the body; I lifted up the frock—the child was in a very dirty condition, in fact, grimed with dirt—the smell in the room was as if filth had been emptied on the floor and had not been cleaned up, and there was soap and candle grease, and other matter, as if it had been all grimed in to<lb/>gether—I told the prisoner that her room was in a very filthy condition; why did she not clean it—she said she had—I said "You have made a very poor attempt at it"—I saw vermin on the child's head; it was apparently very ill—it was suffering from bronchitis, that was enough to kill it—I could not trace the suffering from anything else; there was emaciation—I told the prisoner it was very ill, and she ought to have great care of it, or she would lose it; that she must keep it warm, and act according to the instructions she had received from Dr. Hawkesworth—I thought his advice excellent—my attendance was on behalf of the society to report—they generally prefer to have some one who has seen a great many of these cases, and able to examine into them—I have other practice.</p>
