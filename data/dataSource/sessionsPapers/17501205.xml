I went the same morning into Plumtree street, where the prisoners lived, and found them; there lay the soot in the yard loose, and Blake looking at it. Williams had hid himself in the necessary house. I asked Blake what they had done with the sacks; he said they had slung them away at St. Giles's stocks; we went there, but could not find them.

               <p>- Smith. I am the man that sold the soot to the person, of whom the prosecutor bought it; these two witnesses came to me; I went and look'd at the soot as it lay, and found it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you know it by?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had swept a smith's chimney, and that is quite different soot from others; and also there was some dust of a corkcutter. By what I saw of these, I can swear it is the same soot. I went to the prisoners in the Roundhouse, and Blake there said, after I gave-them some gin, that he was as deep in it as Williams, for he rolled the sacks out of the waggon upon Williams's back. The prisoners denied knowing any thing of the affair.</p>

About seven o'clock this night the prisoner at the bar came to the George Inn at Hammersmith ; he put up this horse there, and took a room, saying, there were more people coming, as if there was a family coming; he had a great fire made and a bed sheeted, and said to the landlady, pray give me half a guinea in silver; she had just 7 s. 6 d. in silver, she gave him that; then he went up stairs to see the fire; then the landlord came in, and the landlady told him there was a young man had took a room, and wanted change; so he went to him to give him the rest of the change; the prisoner said he had not half a guinea till his master and mistress came, so he returned the three half crowns; he went down stairs, and away he went, and left the horse in the stable.</p>

            . The prisoner came in at the Bull Head and Three Tuns in Kensington, between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, Nov. 4; he asked my landlady if she could lodge him; he called for two pints of beer and three halfpennyworth of bread and cheese; when he came to pay he pulled out a paper, and, with an oath, swore, as he opened it, he was ruined, he had received a halfpenny instead of a guinea; then he wanted to take lodging there for a week; I thought he had something in his pocket; as he turned himself, I saw a pistol. I took it from him, it was loaded with two balls and prim'd. Produced in court.</p>

            . I met the prisoner in Kensington; said he, can you get me a lodging? said I, where are you going? said he, to town; I told him it was not so late but he might go to night; said he, I am tired, I came from Reading to day; I went with him to the Thistle and Crown, their beds were all full; then I went to the Bull Head and Three Tuns. He confirmed the last witness.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Bath, where I was discharged from my master's service (Esq; Carter) he there hired a servant who could talk French, and is gone to Paris; I served him a year and eight months, part in Ireland and part here. This pistol was one of his, the other was broke, and it was my perquisite. Coming along the road I met this horse on the other side Kensington, and no soul with him, about seven o'clock at night; I stopped him and waited to see if any body came up; nobody did, so I brought him to this Inn at Hammersmith and called for the hostler, and delivered the horse to him; there were some post chaises at the door; after I had been in the house, drank half a pint of wine, and paid for it, I went away in haste to get a ride behind one of them chaises. I did design to advertise the horse ; I went to enquire for lodging as I could not get a ride, and met with that soldier, who went with me from one house to another; and when they stopped me, he would have let me go, if I would have given him a piece of money.</p>

I cry'd, stop thief, and three men laid hold of him; then I saw him sling away the tankard. I am sure this was the man.

            . I was that same morning at the market about 6 o'clock, and had bought some shads, and we were dividing them; the man that was with me said, he had lost his handkerchief, at that time my handkerchief was in my pocket. I saw the two prisoner's standing together ; going by Kingston he directly turn'd upon me, and I felt him pick my pocket; I felt his hand in my pocket, and miss'd my handkerchief directly; I saw him go to the other prisoner, and give him a handkerchief, whether it was mine or not I will not swear; the other was about four yards from me, when he pick'd my pocket; then I went past him and happen'd to meet a fishmonger; said I, such a one has lost his handkerchief, and I have lost mine, and that man has taken mine, and given it to that other man. We secured them as beforemention'd.</p>

I advertised the things lost on the 26th and 27th, but could not hear of them till the 10th of Nov. then a man came to my house, and asked me if I was not robbed such a time; I said I was; he said, we have taken three of the thieves, and if you come to Bridewell you'll hear more of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did you lose?</p>
               <p>M. Ormand. I lost eight pewter plates, &amp;c. ( mentioning each thing as in the indictment.) The next morning I went to Bridewell; I was bid to ask for Forrester, otherwise Hatton, and they brought me to the next evidence, who can give a better account of the taking them than I can.</p>

            . I was going through Lincoln's Inn, they told me there had been a fire, and a hosier had been robbed; after this, near Hide Park corner, at the sign of the Faulcon, I saw the prisoner at the bar selling stockings this 13th of Nov. he sold them cheap, and I suspected he did not come honestly by them; so I came back again, and told Mr. Rotheram about him; in the mean time came in Mr. Turner, so he and I went to take him, which we did with some of the stockings under his arm. They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

            , and if he wants me, I should be glad to drink a tiff of punch with him; Mr. Manning said, here is such a gang of smugglers they will do you a mischief; after this a message was brought, they had an intent to take me; there were eleven of them came to the door arm'd, the prisoner was one of them, they broke the door open; I sled to the barn, and set my self down in some barley; the prisoner came in and found me, then they all hollow'd, as gentlemen do when they catch a fox; there was one Chapman, who is since executed: after they had beat me, to whom I said, this is very hard, they oblig'd me to go with them to Mrs. Peirce's; then one Cockeye great his hand, rub'd it on the chimney, and black'd his face; after this they put a gun betwixt my legs, and rode me round the room, saying, I should be their member of parliament; then Cock-eye beat me with a leather thong; afterwards they let me go to the farmer's house about eight or nine o'clock, and I went to bed about ten, and lay with a servant of Mr. Manning's ; then they came and took me out of bed without giving me time to put on my cloaths; one of them took a line that was in the garret, and carried me into a field and whipp'd me with their whips till the skin was all off my fingers; I begged and prayed for mercy; then they carried me into the churchyard, one of them took out a long knife, which was as long as a hanger, and offered it to my throat, and obliged me to answer such questions as they asked me concerning the reasons of my coming down ; after this they took the piece of cord and tied my arms round me very hard, and put a cord about my neck and held me up upon a tree; they held me up some time; after that they let me down, and forced me to unbutton my breeches, and made me swear damnation to my soul if ever I revealed it, and asked me very immodest questions; then I went to Mr. Manning's house; the next morning Chapman called me up; said he, I know you have been used ill, but if I could have got to them you should not have been used so; then I went to Mrs. Peirce's house again about eight o'clock, and about 11 or 12 they had a very good spying glass; I took it up and looked, and said, there is your cutter, which I was glad to see, for they swore I should not go till she came in; I went down and lay concealed, I saw them go down, to the number of 34 or 35 men; I saw the cutter unloaded, the tea was in oilskin bags that held about 27 pounds, a great number of them, and casks called half anchors of brandy; they had 45 horses; I saw them load and go off from sea; the prisoner rode by me returning from the Beach, they rode two and two; they went to a place called Summerton, then I lost fight of them.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. I prayed him to get away, and cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. There was something wet came into my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you willing he should do so?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any force with you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. He held me down with his hands, by my shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in that posture.</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. About five or six minutes; then he went up to bed. I liv'd with him about a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing of this to any person?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. I did not till after I came home to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. Because I was asham'd to speak of it; I told her the same day I went there, I had a great running upon me, I could not walk as I us'd to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing you observ'd, after you awoke?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. My master was then upon me; and the bed-clothes were off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been awake, before he did any thing to you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. He wak'd me directly; he put his y - d into my body, as I awak'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. He said nothing at all, but bid me hold my tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress hear you, when you cried out?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master undrest?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, he was not, his cloaths were unbutton'd before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any talk with him after this?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever ask you to let him do so again?</p>
               <p>M. Chalkley. No, he never did.</p>

               <p>Woodward. No, my lord, none at all, or threats either; he said, he knew it was no more than a swimming bout, so voluntarily told the whole; he said, he came into the court about 2 o'clock, and went to work, saying, I came to the shop door, and work'd the pin of the window about, and it came out; I took down one of the shutters, and got into the shop; then I went into the passage, and open'd the street door, which has only a single lock, and bolted; I then put the shutter up again, and shut the street door, and went into the parlour, and grabled about as well as I could, for it was dark, and I was drunk; I tumbled down once, and wonder'd none of you heard me; so I took these things away, and if there had been a thousand pounds I would have had it.</p>

I live in Turnmill-street; the prisoner at the bar came to me, last Tuesday was a month, and ask'd me if I would buy some prints; I told him, I did not understand them ; he said, Will you buy a tea-kettle? I said, I would if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050016"/> liked it; he had this kettle; (the prosecutor deposed to it) we agreed for it, and as soon as I bought it, he gave me this velvet cap (deposed to by the prosecutor) into my hand, and said, I had this of the same person; I bought the other things of him; it is of no use to me, you may take it; the very next morning I saw this advertisement, upon which I went directly to the prosecutor's house with the tea kettle and cap; just as I came to the corner of the shop I saw the prisoner at work in it, so I did not go in, but went to a publick house and sent for the prosecutor: he was not at home, but an acquaintance of mine living near I sent for him, and told him the whole, and he acquainted Mr. Woodward of the affair, so he came to me on the 29th of October, about five o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Woodward. When the men had put up the shop windows, I heard them say, tell Jenny to key the window; I went down stairs and put the key in the pin, it was the very first time I ever did it, and don't know whether I pushed the key quite far enough for the spring to catch: there were a gentleman and gentlewoman drank tea in the parlour, who staid at my master's till almost eleven o'clock at night: I fastened the parlour window before I went to bed, but in the morning the window was a little open, and the blind and sash put up a small matter: the pictures were all in the room when I went to bed: as soon as I opened the window I saw a daub as though a man had been there: I missed the kettle at first, but did not look round to see whether any of the pictures were gone.</p>

            . I am brother to the prosecutor. On the second of November he told me he had got intelligence of the man that robbed him, so I went with him before my lord mayor: I heard him confess he opened the shop window: the same as the prosecutor depos'd before, with this addition, he was very sober when he made this voluntary confession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of October I was at this shop in the morning, and went to breakfast at the Peacock in Bread street with the other men; then I parted with them, and in the evening I happened to go there again; I staid there till about eleven o'clock, then I went home to bed, and getting too much in liquor, I lay almost till nine next morning; when I went to the Roebuck to get some purl, in order to go to work; going along Turnmill street (properly called Cow Cross) I met a man with these things under his arm, he was a carpenter by trade; he said to me, my wife is dead, and I am afraid of having my goods seized, so I want to get somebody to dispose of them; I told him I never dealt in any thing that way; he told me he could get 12 or 14 shillings for them, so I agreed to give him eight shillings and sixpence; I had a shilling left; then I parted from him, and carried them home to my lodging ; I intended to have gone to work at noon, but stopping in Field lane at the Elephant and Castle, and failing into company, I spent great part of the day there ; then I went and found my master I work'd for, afterwards I went into a publick house; then I went home, and the next morning I went again to the Peacock in Trinity lane; there was my master; he said, John, I am glad you are come; I said it has been a drunken sort of a week; I designed to go to work, but met a man that sawed stone; he said, we have had a sad misfortune here, your master Woodward has been robbed; said I, in what manner? said he, on Tuesday about noon; so I went to work, and there was no more of it; then we went to breakfast, and dinner as usual; when I was apprehended I had time enough to have got away had I been guilty; when they mentioned it to me I put my coat on and went with them to Mr. Groves's, and there I told them I sold the kettle to him; said they to me, you might as well own it as not, you shall not be hurt ; then they called for a quartern of brandy, and gave me a glass full; then they gave me some purl, and I was so drunk that I could scarcely stand; I told them what money the things cost, and that they were not demolished; I gave them a note, directed them to my wife, and desired her to send the prints; as for the man I bought them of, I never saw him since.</p>

               <p>Q. to Groves. Did you hear him make this confession? and was he sober?</p>
               <p>Groves. I was not there when he confessed; I heard him say in the street he would confess, but I went home; I am sure he was not drunk when I left him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not apprehend any thing of his being drunk, I thought he was as sober then as he is now; he said, if I would give him a full pot of twopenny, he would tell.</p>

            . On the 31st of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, Mr. Allop was going to Queenhith, and saw, as he told me, the boat taken away; I then went up to justice Theobald's yard, where I saw Stevens standing; there lay Mr. Hilton's boat ; as soon as he saw me row up to the boat, he ran through the timber yard, so I landed and ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was in the boat?</p>
               <p>Knowles. I opened the tilt and saw the cheese and eggs, and other things; I took Stevens and rowed him down in my boat, and another man rowed Mr. Hilton's boat down to Cole Harbour, and when we came back from before my lord mayor Durham was taken.</p>

            . I saw the prisoners row by me at Queenhith, October 31, between ten and eleven o'clock, they were in Mr. Hilton's loaded boat covered with a tilt,; I saw them row as hard as they could towards the Old Bargehouse, Surry; seeing them come out of Cole Harbour, I rowed down thither, and inquired if some poor man's boat was not taken from thence; a boy answered. yes, Mr. Hilton's boat was rowed away with; then I saw Mr. Oadley at the Old Swan, so he and I rowed up to Esq; Theobald's, where we found the boat; I jumped into her; Mr. Oadley took Stevens and brought him down to Cole Harbour, and I rowed the other boat down; Durham owned the fact before justice Hammond.</p>

            . I took the prisoner the 17th of November with this cotton on Galley Key, between the hours of one and two at noon; there are two pounds and half of it. ( The evidence produced an apron which was tied about the prisoner when he took him with a pocket in it, with a slap to cover the pocket on each side, made on purpose to carry off such like goods undiscovered.) First of all I saw him go up to the corner where the cotton lay, and observ'd his apron hung loose as being empty: I went round to get upon the bags and detect him in taking it out, I saw him hustling against the bag, but cannot say I saw him take any: I did not observe a hole in the bag before, but afterwards there was one visible enough : I met him loaded, and took him by the collar; he said he did not care what became of him, for he had as lief be transported as stay here to starve to death.</p>

            . I am a watchman; just after the clock struck one, on the 3d of December in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing at the prosecutrix's door, in a white cloak; she spread her arms wide, that I should not see the four chairs in the passage, behind her at the stair foot. I saw them and ask'd her, whether they were coming in, or going out; she said, she had just brought them in; I had seen the door shut too, about a quarter of an hour before, when I went by; then I call'd up Mrs. Turnbull; she came down, and said, the chairs were her's; we then went up stairs, but the prisoner had fastened the door, and would make no answer; upon which, Mrs. Turnbull fastened the passage door, so I went away and came again at 3 o'clock; then the landlady push'd the prisoner's door open, and said, she miss'd the things mention'd in the indictment; I took her to the constable of the night, there she confess'd she brought one of the chairs down.</p>

               <p>I went out that night between 5 and 6 o'clock, and when I came home about 9, my husband had carried away all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Did she take the room as a single, or a married woman?</p>
               <p>E. Turnbull. She took it as a single woman; I never saw a man with her; she has talked since of a husband, and she has said, she did once live with a man 8 months, but was not married to him.</p>
               <p>The watchman said, he liv'd in the same house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050020"/> but never was in the prisoner's room, nor did he ever take her to be a married woman, saying, he never saw a man with her; but that this night, at about 11 o'clock, he saw a man in a blue coat near the door in the street, leaning upon a post.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Bennet; these 16 sheep were deliver'd to me in Smithfield last Monday was sevennight; there were twelve weathers and four ewes; they were mark'd cross the foreheads with oaker, and red lead on the backs; I drove them as far as Mile End, there I met my master, and he help'd me to drive them home; we put them in the field, and on the next morning, which was Tuesday, they were gone; the prisoner said, he employ'd another man to sell the skins, and that a man brought them to him; we got the man that sold the skins, and went to Barnaby-street, and found the skins there; I am sure they are the same skins.</p>

There were two porters brought in 13 sheep to the prisoner's shop, when I was there; Mr. Syms, that lives at the next door, said, they should not hang up there; he wanted me to move them; I said, Mr. Syms, why should I work for nothing? the prisoner said, the sheep were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050023"/> his, and that he would pay me if I would move them; he paid a shilling to the clerk of the market when I took them to the place where the countrymen come in, I saw him sell two of them; after that I cut off the heads for him, and sold some of them, so gave him the money; then he went to the Beehive in Leadenhall market and paid me; he afterwards told me he should have threescore more pigs and sheep together, and I should sell them all; I sold the skins at the Ship alehouse in the borough of Southwark for the prisoner.</p>

            . I lay there on Saturday night with Mr. Burch, and saw the prisoner at the bar as I came in at the door; about ten minutes after that the prosecutrix said she had been robbed; Mr. Burch went up with her and searched the room; I staid below stairs to see who went out; I saw the prisoner searched and the goods found upon her as mentioned in the indictment; I held her by the arm while Mr. Draper and the prosecutrix seized the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Are you sure these things were in your pockets at the time you say you was going to bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure they were.</p>

               <p>Those two witnesses were along with the prosecutrix when I went for the candle to make my bed; the prosecutrix came after me, saying, you have got my pockets, and stripped me quite naked; said I, if you search my room, search every room in the house; they all came about me, but what they put into my pocket I know not.</p>

            . I live in the parish of St. George's, Wapping; I am a perriwig maker; I have been acquainted with the prisoner two or three years; I employ'd him as a broker, to buy and sell stocks; he once sold out about 250 l. of mine; he advised me to make use of my money, to lend upon East-India warrants, because then I should receive five per cent, which the stocks did not bear; I employ'd him to sell it out; then I desir'd him to lend it on East-India warrants, which he had before recommended to me; this was sold out in March last; I saw him in about two days, and he then told me, he had lent my money upon these warrants. When I came again, he brought me one of these receipts, No. 782; this is not the first he brought; the first he brought me, I since deliver'd back again, for another with more money; the first was in the same nature as this, for 103 l. that was on the 18th of March, but this I had the 21st of March, he brought this for the security of 156 l. 18 s. 7 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accept that as the only security, or did he give you any other?</p>
               <p>Dear. He gave me his own note with it, at the same time; to the best of my memory, it was drawn in my presence; I understood it he had a receipt of Mr. Constable; the prisoner acted as a middle man between us; he told me he had a note of Mr. Constable's, but I did not ask him for that, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have lent this money on his note, without having this, which you at that time took to be a warrant?</p>
               <p>Dear. No, I would not, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it dated?</p>
               <p>Dear. It was dated March 21, 1749.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make application to Mr. Floyd. in order to be satisfied, as to the reality of that instrument he had pledg'd with you?</p>
               <p>Dear. Some time afterwards, I believe about three months, I ask'd to see the goods; I expected to see them in the East-India company's ware-house; he told me, it was not customary to see the goods; that they were under two keys, the company had one, and the government the other: so I was satisfied at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Constable?</p>
               <p>Dear. No, I did not. I receiv'd the first quarter's money when it became due; and the next I receiv'd was of the prisoner, in the month of August; I made farther enquiry of a gentleman, to whom I was recommended : he satisfied me so far that he thought they were good, but he said, if any one of the parties should die, I might be troubled to get my money. I had ask'd the prisoner several times after Mr. Constable, in order to see him, to be satisfied about it, whether he had had my money; but he did not tell me where he liv'd. I wanted him to call my money home at the expiration of six months; I demanded principal and interest on the 21st of Sept. He told me he had seen Mr. Constable and told him of it, and had appointed a time of payment : it being prompt time at the India-House, he said, he could not pay just then. I apply'd to the prisoner after this again, then he brought me a guinea, he said Mr. Constable sent it to buy me a pair of gloves, and told me, he would come down to my house. I refus'd to take it, he lost it on the table; after this I saw him again, and ask'd where Mr. Constable liv'd; he said, near St. George's church Southwark ; I desir'd him to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050025"/> to him along with me, this was on the 15th of Nov. he told me, he was to go out about business in the morning with a gentleman; then I desir'd him to set a time next morning; he said, he could not go, but at last agreed. I call'd upon him that morning, and found him at home in the Minories, between 9 and 10 o'clock. Then I claim'd his promise to go with me; he said, he was oblig'd to go out about business ; I importun'd him much, he said, he could not. Then I ask'd him to give me directions where he liv'd, for I was resolv'd to go myself. He told me he liv'd near St. George's church in the Borough, but said, he had forgot the street: he told me I might enquire at the Grayhound Inn there, and there I should have a full direction. I went immediately ; when I came there, the master of the house was out, and the woman did not know any such Man. She said she knew the prisoner. I was about an hour and half enquiring about there, at length I found where he liv'd, by enquiring at a publick house, where the servant maid told me she had liv'd with Mr. Constable. I found by her he liv'd on the back of Guy's Hospital. I went and found his house, and his servant told me he was at the King's-Head coffee-house, Swithens Alley. I went thither, and there I found him and told him my business; he desired to see this receipt, before that I thought they were warrants; he looked upon them and immediately said they were false. I ask'd him if he had had any dealings with the prisoner in the Tea way; he said he never had in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drew the Promissory Note?</p>
               <p>Dear. The Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the hand Writing in the receipt and that it is filled up with the same?</p>
               <p>Dear. I cannot tell whether it is the same or not. Mr. Constable desired me to go and take the Persons up, or I should lose all my Money. I went with the receipt to Mr. Oswell an attorney, and he went with me to the East India House; there I saw Mr. Holbrook, he is the Warehouse keepper. I desired him to go and check this receipt; we found the goods were weighed, Mr. Holbrook deliver'd the receipt to Mr. Oswell, and Mr. Oswell to me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same receipt you received of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dear. I am sure it is, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has it been out of your hands?</p>
               <p>Dear. Ever since the 16 of Nov. [it is read, and is to this purport.] No. 782 received 21st of March 1749, of Mr.

               <p>Q. Did not you imploy him to borrow on it?</p>
               <p>Constable. No, sir, no person would lend any thing on it. Mr. Dear brought it to me at the Coffee-house, in Nov. that was the first time I ever saw it, he wanted to know of me whether I sold these goods mentioned, or whether it was a genuine warrant, I told him I never sold Mr. Floyd any such goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is he now?</p>
               <p>Constable. I don't know, he is gone off.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard since he is gone off, some ill practices of his ?</p>
               <p>Constable. I have been informed he was suspected of forging the company's warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing, do you know, between the prisoner and Venter?</p>
               <p>Constable. I never saw them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy goods for Venter?</p>
               <p>Constable. I did at the Michaelmas sale ; I cannot tell what sort, or who they were delivered to. They were weighed in my name.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Venter write?</p>
               <p>Constable. I have [he is shew'd the false receipt.] I do not think it any thing like his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think any man that is a Broker would take any of these receipts for the security of money?</p>
               <p>Constable. A man that is a Broker knows better, he must know it is no security at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he not suppose it was a true receipt?</p>
               <p>Constable. The receipt never is delivered till part of the goods are delivered, if part of the goods are delivered they write that upon it, then it is good for the residue, that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man has a true receipt with nothing more upon it, would it be of any use to any man living?</p>
               <p>Constable. I would not lend one shilling upon it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I do declare I did borrow the money of Mr. Venter, and at the same time thought the receipt was as good as India bonds, or other security; I carried them to Mr. Dear, and made no manner of doubt in giving him my note as an indemnity; I have always attended publick in my business, and was in Sept. with Mr. Chancey, who, at that time, asked me how I should act was he in my case, that he might not be charged with an officer at that time; I told him, was he in my case and I in his, he should deposit something in my hands, and I accordingly gave him two warrants; by the account I gave him he thought me to be an honest man, and advised me to do the most I could to detect the villain that had imposed upon me ; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050027"/> try all manner of arts and schemes to take him. After I had been with Mr. Chancey near a month, I voluntarily went to him again at the East India house, and attended him there in order to have the liberty of selling my goods. Mr. Dear is mistaken in saying I did the business for Mr. Constable; I did not tell him that till the 21st of September, at which time I knew Mr. Venter was gone, for which reason I made use of Mr. Constable's name in order to get time to take Venter up, and to pay the money, which I expected I must do out of my own fortune.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chancey. Mr. Venter had made use of a receipt that appeared to be a forgery when it was made; Mr. Floyd was then absent from England; I was uneasy about these false warrants and receipts ; when the prisoner was brought to me I examined him how he came by a receipt which was forged, and produced against him; he told me he had it of one Venter, with much the same he has now declared; I thought him innocent, but told him I could not let him go without some security for his appearance ; he did deposit two warrants with me for teas to the amount of about 120 l. I did not chuse to do this of my own head, so I sent for a friend to talk the thing over, and it did appear to me he was not guilty. Some time after this he said he had an opportunity of disposing of the teas, and applied for liberty so to do; he was before the committee and told his story there, who gave him leave to go about his business upon condition he deposited the warrants. This is the fact as near as I can relate, but this does not relate to the affair now before the jury.</p>

            . The prisoner did apply to me to look after Venter the latter end of this summer ; he said he lived opposite the Fleet prison, and was a grocer; I went to the house at the corner of Fleet lane and enquired out his character; the prisoner said he had bought some notes of him, and that he thought they were forged, so wanted to bring him to justice. I repeated my enquiry on Sunday following, but could not find him; Floyd came to me afterwards, but I told him I could not go any more; he asked me if I knew where to find a person that would, and I proposed to him one Williamson.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 17th of last month, I and another man went into the Shovel alehouse, East Smithfield ; in came Dawson dressed very well; I said to him, you look pretty tight, &amp;c. he told me he had got four guineas and a half of a man, and he kept four guineas of it to himself, dividing the other half guinea among his apprentices. A young man of my acquaintance, who was with me, wanted a watch ; I asked him if he had ever a one; the prisoner said he had one in pawn for 30 s. and that I should have it for six more; he said he did not pawn it himself, but a young woman did, whom I will send to fetch it out ; I was to meet him at the Swan in Swan alley about four o'clock; I spoke to two or three more men, and we went together to the Swan thinking to apprehend him, but he was gone; the next day I heard he was taken.</p>

            . Dawson, I, and Little Will, committed this robbery; Dawson and I were drinking at the Portland's prize, about seven oclock on the 11th of November, we went to Little Will's lodgings, he ask'd us where we were going, we told him upon the Scamp; we went all three together, and met the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Little Will know the meaning of that word?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. Yes, he did better than I did; we went towards Stepney Fields, it was a very thick hazey night; at a rope-walk hard by Stepney, we saw a man dress'd well, we followed him, he ask'd us the way to Rag Fair; Dawson said to him, follow us, we are going there: we carried him a back way, and at a corner when we got out of the rope-walk, the gentleman said, it was too dirty for him; said Dawson, Why don't you stop him? then I laid hold of him, and said, stand: I was behind him, and the other two were before him: the two prisoners took hold of him directly ; after Dawson had taken away his cane with a china head, I search'd him, we took from him three or four half crowns; the cane was sold in Jews-court, it was a very large one; I took from him some pocket pieces, a bunch of keys, with a seal on them, and some buttons capt with silver; we took his hat, coat and handkerchief, it was a white coat lined with coarse Blew ; the same was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050030"/> produced by the pawnbroker, which the prosecutor deposed to) I carried the coat and hat, Dawson had the money, and Little Will came running along side us ; he had hold of the prosecutor at the time. I said, I'd knock him down if he made any resistance: we came to the Portland's Prize, and shared what Dawson pleased to pull out for us; the coat and hat were given to that woman, ( the prisoner at the bar, Dawson's wife) and she said she would go and pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she been his wife?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. I do not know that; the next day we were at the Portland's Prize, when she came in and said, she had pawned the coat for two shillings and the hat for one.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of the money had Little Will?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. He had half a crown, we had each the same.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Barnwell. Last Saturday was se'nnight, my lord; I happened to come in about nine o'clock that night; he wanted some victuals ; I said he had no occasion to go out for any. I had a piece of a hog's face, so he and I sat down to it; I went and fetched a full pot of beer; after that there were words between his wife and he, but I don't know upon what occasion; at first he threw the candlestick at her, then he took up the box iron, I cannot say he threw that; he rose up in a passion, knock'd her down, and then knock'd her daughter down; the prisoner came in at that time, and endeavoured to prevent him beating his wife; then Chamberlain struck the prisoner several blows with his fist, and tore his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Chamberlain appear to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>Barnwell. He did, my lord, he was disguised when he and I sat down to eat; then Mr. Fishook came in, who is the deceased's wife's brother, and lives at the next door; he struck the deceased over the eye; then he went home again; Chamberlain stripp'd himself to fight Fishook, and went to his house; Fishook's wife was standing by her fire side ; she said, pray, Richard, don't strike my husband, for he has a wound on his head already (that was done a night or two before) then Mr. Stroud came in and said to the deceased, Dick, you have hit me several blows, now I have a great mind to hit you one, so he struck him two or three blows with his fist on his breast, upon which the deceased fell down and never spoke more.</p>

I was up stairs at this Fishook's house, and heard a great scuffle betwixt Fishook and his brother in law; Mr. Fishook bid him get away, saying, he had got a broken head already; he did not go directly; then the prisoner came in and swung the deceased out of Fishook's arms, saying to him, if you can't manage him, I can; then he clapp'd him up against the closet door, and going to strike the deceased, the deceased ran his head into his bosom; Stroud gave him a blow, and he fell down directly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Simpson. I am a surgeon. The accident was on the Saturday, and on Monday I saw the body of the deceased, and there seemed several bruises on his head and his face, but nothing of consequence, they were only in the skin ; I examined the lungs, the heart, the stomach, and all the noble parts of the body, but could not find any bruise or contusion that could be the cause of his death; there was no outward appearance of any blow given that could be the cause of it; it must be something internal; the blood might, by receiving a blow on his stomach, be driven into the brain, and give him an apoplexy; I could not account for his death, so was obliged to enquire if he had not been drinking, which, when I found, can give no other reason for his death than this, but it is impossible to be certain about it.</p>

               <p>When I first went in there was murder cried out, the deceased was beating his wife behind the door, so I went to part them, but it was more than I could do; at that time Fishook came in: the deceased struck me several times and tore the cuff of my coat almost off; Fishook went out and came in again, and laid the deceased upon the table; when that was over I went out and brought in a full pot of beer and drank with them; I staid there about half an hour, and then went to Fishook's house, where Fishook and I drank together; soon after I heard a sad noise again, so I ran in, and found them quarrelling; then he stripp'd off his cloaths ; I endeavoured to pacify him, but he ran into Fishook's house, and pulled him out of his chair; I ran in after him to part them, and got Fishook away, so he came and struck me several blows on the side of my neck with his fist, which made me reel against the door, he drew blood from me ; we had a little scuffle together, but how the thing happened the Lord above knows ; I only said, Richard, be easy, and don't be quarrelsome; I did strike him in the scuffle, but there was no malice between us. We have done many a hard day's work together, and drank many a full pot of beer together.</p>

            . I was coming down an Alley in Fetter-lane, right against Mr. Jackman's, Nov. 13. I saw the prisoner take a box up at Mr. Mason's door, next door to Mr. Jackman's, I saw the porter set it down, first upon the step of the door; there was a woman in a scarlet cloak helped the prisoner up with it on his shoulder, as soon as he had got it up he cross'd the kennel, I was just facing him; there were a man and a woman going up the Alley, he said to them have a care, let me come by; I had seen the prisoner at the bar before come out of a house with a creature there, and knew him well; there was a lamp over my head, and our light from our windows; I saw his cloaths, he had on, blew gray cloaths, a brown wigg, and no hat, blew gray stockings, and white flat rim'd buckles, he past by me.</p>

            . I was sent by the prosecutrix to Doctors Commons, to fetch this box and trunk, I set out from the Commons about a quarter before 6, coming up Fleet-street, there was a man overtook me about the middle of the street, he dropped his stick between my legs which had like to have flung me down; he took his stick up and beg'd my pardon; he ask'd me where I was going with that box and trunk, I said into Fetter-lane: he said I live in the Lane, tell me to whom you are going and I'll tell you the house. I said when I come into the lane I would look into the note; when I got into the lane I pull'd the note out, and said it was to Mr. Jackman's; when I came to the door on this side his house there was a man stood at it, it was shut; another man came to him and said, your servant Mr. Jackman, the man that answered to the name Jackman said to me, young man you have brought the things very right, they are my servant's things who is coming to live with me, adding you brought them from Doctors Commons. Then he ask'd me if he should help me down with them, he laid hold on the box I had under my arm, and I put the other down my self. Then he desired I'd go over the way to the Coffee-house, for his clerk, who he said had got the key; I said I had rather he'd go and I'd stand by the things, he said I had brought them very safe. So I went, and in the mean time the box and trunk were gone, and he also, and I have not heard of the things since.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Honychurch, on the 5th of Nov. in the morning I was alone, the prisoner came into the shop with a watch to have it clean'd, he then appeared in another complection than now, he had on a laced hat, a waistcoat with either gold or silver button holes, he desired me to take his watch to pieces; while I was doing it he said some of the works were drop'd, adding, he was sure some of them were lost. I looked upon the ground, there were none down but all right before me, then he was for taking it to show to some other watchmaker, I said I must not take it to pieces and put it together again for nothing; he said, I'll take it and shew it to another, and if he says there is nothing lost I'll bring it again; he took it not put together, also 2 new wheels, a third and cantrite wheel away with him that lay before me; when he staid longer than I expected I began to suspect him; I looking about saw a hook was empty where a new watch hung just before he came in. I went to the watchmaker, where I supposed he'd go to, and ask'd for him; he told me no such person had been there; then I told my master the affair. Master told me by his book it was a watch he was making for a gentleman in Devonshire. When Mr. Price seat for my master I went with him and knew the prisoner.</p>

While our man was gone, the prisoner own'd to my master and I, that he had stole it; we went before Justice Fielding the next day, and he was committed to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What he has said is false; I cannot deny but I carried that watch to be pawn'd; I was coming down Snow Hill, and a well dress'd man ask'd me, if I had a mind to earn a shilling, I said, yes; so I carried it to pawn; then the young gentleman said, there had been a watch stole, so stopt me.

            . Mr. Gastineau applied to me about the 23d. of March for 1000 l. to lend Mr. Baker, and also brought me the security the same day; as to Mr. Baker I never saw him in my life till I saw him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Gastineau bring to you for security?</p>
               <p>Holland. He brought to me ( producing the note ) this paper, and eight warrants (the note read in court ) the warrant put into his hand, No. 784. I delivered this warrant to Mr. Deputy Slater with the others, for him to go to the East India house to see if they were right.</p>
               <p>Deputy Slater. The eight warrants I received of Mr. Holland, I carried to the East India house to have them examined. About the 15th of Nov. I applied to Mr. Holbrook, who looked and said he could not find the check for them, and that he believed them to be bad, for he could not find the numbers to tally ; then he apprehended the goods were delivered; he looked into the sale book to see if the goods were weighed off, and found in the entry book that they had been delivered for the warrants which I had, so assured me they were bad ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by bad warrants ?</p>
               <p>D. Slater. That are not good for any thing; then he said he had orders from the directors to stop any warrants of this kind; I told him I did not care to part with them, for I had them of a friend whom I had a great regard for; he desired, if I had any objection, I would go to Mr. Chancey chairman of the East India company, which I accordingly did, and Mr. Holbrook took the warrants and went along with me; he sent a servant to Mr. Holland, who told him what had happened ; Mr. Chancey said he'd detain the warrants let the consequence be what it would; their check is so regular that they cannot be imposed upon. Mr. Holland said he believed he could have his money again upon giving up the notes, and that he look'd; upon the prisoner able enough to return it him back; they were all in the hands of Mr. Holbrook till we came to Mr. Chancey, except the 8th, which I had; after we had been there about an hour he ordered Mr. Holbrook to mark the warrants, and some time after he desired me to mark them; said I, they have been out of my possession a considerable time; I marked No. 784, so did he, and declared he had it of me.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Baker?</p>
               <p>D. Slater. I have known him many years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his general character?</p>
               <p>D. Slater. His general character was so good as to substance and honesty, that I would have given him credit for 1000 l. at any time in my way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holbrook. Who delivered this warrant, (No. 784) to you?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. Mr. Slater delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has it been ever since you went with Mr. Deputy Slater to Mr. Chancey?</p>

               <p>Holland. I gave him a draught upon Mess Frame and Barcley, bankers, for 1000 l. and he delivered the warrants, Mr. Baker's note, and defeisance to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the draught paid?</p>
               <p>Holland. It is paid.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these brought to you as a joint security for 1000 l.?</p>
               <p>Holland. They were, there was this note, and the others as a collateral security; I really believe, had there not been this prosecution carried on, we should have had our money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he had an intention to defraud you?</p>
               <p>Holland. I don't know that he had, and, by circumstances I have heard since, I don't think he had; I have heard he has paid Mr. Moryton and others, and I believe he would have paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then apprehend these eight warrants to be good ones.</p>
               <p>Holland. I did then.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have lent him the money on his word alone?</p>
               <p>Holland. I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holbrook. I am warehousekeeper to the East India company. I made a thorough search to see if these warrants were forged; I turned to my sale book in order to see for the number, and found it; there is the letter of my journal put down, to which I referred, and found the goods were delivered; then I immediately thought these warrants were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search about No. 784 in particular?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. I cannot say I did that more than the others; I particularly searched every one, but did not look for the receipt, which we generally check the warrants with, for that night it was too dark to do any thing of that kind; our journal is at all times so correct, that I was very certain it was a forgery; since that time I have looked to see for the receipt that will check with it, but have none that will.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or not if these are honest good warrants, there is a receipt which is cut through the marble part that runs cross that will check with the warrant?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. Yes, sir, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the warrant is real and good you try it by checking it with the receipt.</p>
               <p>Holbrook. That is the way we examine them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this warrant for?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. For three chests of bohea tea described under particular Numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that these quantities of goods had been delivered out?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it appear they were delivered?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. They were delivered the 15th of Feb. 1749, to Mr.

               <p>Q. Is there a note brought, which they call the clearing note, from the accomptant's office?</p>

               <p>Sedgwick. The use of that is, upon orders given to the warehouse keeper, to weigh any goods; he delivers a printed paper, as this, Mr.

               <p>Q. Are the warrants fill'd up by the officer, or the bearer?</p>
               <p>Sedgwick. I believe they are seldom fill'd up by the company's officers; there are such great numbers come in on the prompt day, it is not practicable for the Clerks to fill them up that day themselves; the quantity is so great.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this, [he had the real one put into his hand.] Who fill'd this up?</p>

               <p>Mr. Hughes. I was present about 3 weeks ago when the prisoner was before my Lord Mayor, she at first denied she knew any thing of the forgery, but said she was the cousin of the man: she went out and I followed her; she said if she might be allowed an evidence she could make a discovery of the persons that forged it; after that she declared before my Lord Mayor one Dunn had wrote the will, and gave it to her in order to go to Doctors Commons; but she wanted to accuse the wife of Dunn who was in custody, on suspicion of being concerned in this affair; the reason she was taken into custody was, that after the prisoner was taken she came to our office to enquire for her.</p>

               <p>I can neither write nor read, I did not know any thing about it, I did not carry it to the Commons at all, I said it was made by one Dunn, he lived in Ratcliff High Way at one Newman's, I came to receive my brother's effects, and he and my husband made me go to administer upon this will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hughes. She told me she was present when Dunn forged it, and that he had forged a great many more, and was coming to Doctors Commons with them.</p>

No, we did not, but he knew very well how we came by them: we had used to bring in goods all hours of the night, we brought them between twelve and one in the morning, the door being always open till two or three in the morning: Old Thomas at first lock'd them up, but when we went to bed Powel took some of them, and Old Thomas took the rest, and brought them into our room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you bring these things to Thomas's house?</p>
               <p>Leblon. It was on the 14th of November that

             told me he knew some old houses where there was some old lead to be got: he went up and somebody else had taken the lead: there was a sort of a shed went up with two or three steps in Whitecross street; he went up and put his hand in at the door and said, here is something better than lead, so took out one of these skins and handed it to me; we took nine of them.
