             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. On Monday the 28th of July, about twelve o'clock at noon, I went, in company with Ray, Ferris, and a woman of the name of Lack, to <placeName id="t18000917-1-crimeloc3">No. 2, Ebenezer-court, Cherry-tree-alley, in the parish of St. Luke's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did Lack make her appearance when you first went into the house? - A. Yes; but, I believe, not so soon as I did; up one pair of stairs hung this bed-gown, with this dirty appearance that it has now, (producing it ); in the chimney corner, where there was no stove, lay this piece of linen, it was then very wet, and the liquid had drained upon the hearth, it appeared to have been used with aqua-fortis, or nitre-fortis and salt; Ray then being in the room with Mrs. Tunstall, I desired him to search her person; I heard Ray say, have you any thing about you; nothing, she said; she was searched, and I saw, I think, twenty-six counterfeit shillings, and eighteen counterfeit sixpences, taken from her, they were in a bag; I was then called down by Ferris, I went down, and some counterfeit blanks, not finished, were produced to me by Ferris, which he has got; I was then called into the room over the one pair of stairs, which had a sky-light, which went out of the bed-chamber, and there I saw a bench, (producing the top of it), and a box containing other things, which Ray has got; then we brought her and the things away; we had Lack with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not find any thing but what you have produced? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no aqua-fortis found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither by you or any of the other officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This place, where you found the gown, was in a room where Lack had access? - A. Yes; She said she and the prisoner laid together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Lack's father is? - A. A porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever taken up? - A. Yes, for having bad money upon him; but was discharged.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was with Armstrong and Ferris; we left Ferris at the bottom of the house, and I went up stairs with Armstrong; I asked Mrs. Tunstall if she had got any thing about her; she said, no, she had not; she was very willing to let me search one pocket, and then she turned her side to the wall, and said there was nothing in that pocket; I then put my hand into her pocket and pulled out this bag, containing twenty-six shillings and eighteen sixpences, (produces a paper bag); they were then in a sit state for circulation; I then went up into the two pair of stairs room, above the sleeping room, where I found this bench, and this box, containing corks, scowering-paper, and files; on the bench laid this file, and this cork, and a pair of pliers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those ingredients necessary to carry on this business? - A. I have not a doubt of it; these two punches I found, which correspond with the impression upon the shillings. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you say you found every thing necessary to carry on the business, you do not mean to say that without the assistance of aqua-fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any bottle of aqua-fortis? - A. No; we found a bottle that seemed to have had some in it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am clerk to the Solicitor for the Bank: In consequence of information, on the 4th of April, I apprehended the prisoner at a house in Bowling-green-lane, Clerkenwell; a young woman was apprehended with him with whom he lived, and who passed by his name.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner as to the place of his residence before that time? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he inform you that he had any residence in White Lion-street? - A. He certainly did not; he mentioned several other places but not that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody at that time? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what condition did you suffer the prisoner to go at large? - A. Upon condition that he would be at his lodging in Bowling-green-lane at nine o'clock, when I was to call to make some inquiries; I went at the time appointed, but he was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after that, use any means to find the prisoner at the bar before he was apprehended? - A. I did; dilligent means were made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the prisoner was again apprehended? - A. On the 28th of April, I was present; he was found in a back room, a bedroom, at the house of a person of the name of Gibbs, in Banner-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, go to the house of a Mrs. Painter, in White Lion-street? - A. Yes, on the 5th of April, where I found this, (producing a pot containing a composition); it produces exactly the same appearance as the water-mark upon a Banknote; and here are some papers upon which it was tried in my presence, (produces them); the ingredient is warmed over a candle in order to produce the appearance, I have also tried it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite certain the prisoner had not communicated to you any thing respecting the house in White Lion-street? - A. Certainly not, for I found it out by accident the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner upon the 5th of April - Did any conversation take place with respect to the note offered to Mr. Packer? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the conversation was not at all upon the subject of this indictment? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. But the inquiry was directed as to where his residence had been, and was at that time? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I live at No. 92, White Lion-street, Pentonville: I know that the prisoner at the bar, he took two rooms, up two pair of stairs, in my house; to the best of my recollection, he had them eight or nine weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live there constantly? - A. He did not; he used to come now and then, I do not think he slept there more than three or four nights; he used sometimes to come and run up stairs, and frequently run down again, without stopping; at other times he would come and stop a little, sometimes half a day together.</p>
               <p>Q. On working days? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day? - A. Generally about ten or eleven o'clock in the forenoon; and he has told the boy if anybody wanted him, so say that he was not at home, but that was on a Sunday; I do not recollect that he was there of the Sunday but once the whole day.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Was the room you shewed Mr. Loaring the same room that the prisoner occupied? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the cup found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you keep an oil and colour shop? - A. Yes; a person called, and asked for Mr. Holt; I told him he was at home; he picked out a few camel's hair pencils; Mr. Holt said, Mrs. Painter, I did not know that you told them, I use a great a many in my business; I showed him some, and he bought two or three, and a little gum.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the conversation about the gum? - A. Yes; he asked me if I sold white varnish; I told him I had none, but I could tell him where he could get some; he said he had tried a great many varnishes but they all turned yellow, he wanted to varnish a drawing of nice white satin; I told him I had none, but I gave him a little drop of fine white gum, and a little turpentine, and I never saw him after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know what business the prisoner followed? - A. Yes; a japanner, and a landscape painter.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being in custody there? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, at any time, make any proposal to you? - A. Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in custody? - A. I cannot say; he made applications several times; he wished, first of all, to have a hook made, to throw over the wall to pull himself up by; I told him I could not; I said, if you want to get out, there are plenty of ropes about; he said, he wanted a friend on the outside to assist him, at some certain time, if I would keep out of the way; I did not see that he had any friend, nor nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate this conversation to Mr. Aris, the Governor of the prison? - A. I did; the prisoner afterwards employed me to carry a letter to a gentleman on Clerkenwell-green; I received the letter from him, and gave it to Mr. Aris first, and then Mr. Aris sent it to Mr. Valentine, by me; I gave it to Mrs. Valentine, her husband was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the letter that you received from the prisoner, was the same letter that you gave to Mr. Valentine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter? - A. That is the letter. Jury. Q. Are you quite sure that is the letter? - A. Yes, it was never out of my sight. (The letter read.)(See page 471, last sessions.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I keep a house, at No. 46, Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a lodger of the name of Gibbs? - A. Yes, Richard Gibbs; his family consists of himself and his wife.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am but little calculated to make a defence, much less when I consider that every eye is upon me, and every ear open to the words I utter; I am but little skilled in logic, but considering the situation I am in, I feel it necessary to exert every nerve. First of all, let us take a slight view of the solicitor for the prosecution, Mr. Loaring, he has been telling you, that I had a lodging in such a place, after that, in such a place, and after that in such a place. Can he prove to you that I bore a bad character at either of those places? Can he prove to you that I defrauded him or any other person, at either of those places? Can he prove to you that I have committed forgeries, or that I have circulated bad notes at either of those places? If he cannot prove that, where is the utility of his speaking? He might as well have told you that I was born in Birmingham, and after having been at school, was apprenticed, and at the expiration of that apprentiship, became a journeyman; it would have been as fully applicable, or he might as well have told you, that Paris was the metropolis of France, or that the Old Bailey did not stand upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170007"/>London-Bridge. He did not tell you that I was a clerk in the Bank; he did not tell you that I was employed to go about searching every place to discover forged notes; no, he did not tell you that, because it would have militated against himself; but I leave it for you to draw the inference upon his character, while I attempt to proceed a little farther. I will now take a view of the Counsel for the prosecution, and in doing this, I cannot but feel myself astonished to see a man stand up in this Court with all his strength, with all his might, with all his logic, attempting a stab a fellow-creature to the heart; he has been traducing, vilifying me, stating that he has not the least doubt of proving my guilt by such and such a circumstance, by such and such evidence; and he has not least doubt, that the facts will be proved; forgery cannot be proved against me, but he hopes to cast me upon circumstances. Gentlemen, be careful, consider the situation you are in, consider the eye of God is upon you, and likewise consider that you have this day taken your oath to do me justice. Has the prosecutor proved to you, that I committed the forgery? Has any evidence proved that I circulated it, knowing it to be forged? Have they proved the least appearance of what I now stand charged with? Gentlemen, your reason must tell you, no; no man's life ought to be taken without the clearest proofs, particularly for forgery, for as soon as a man is cast for forgery, you may as well shoot him dead at the bar, for there is no respite, all is then over; suppose either of you had a son, most likely some of you have; suppose it to happened that your son had taken a Bank-note, and he pays it to his tailor or his doctor; it turns out to be a forged one; it is traced to his possession, he is taken, doubled ironed, and tried for the forgery; what would be your feelings, as fathers, upon that occasion? Would it not be your prayer to Almighty God, that his innocence might appear; would you not sympathize with his situation, would you not feel for him? Certainly you would, and what would be your opinion of that Jury, who should find a verdict against him for nothing at all? should you not think it head that your son should lose his life for nothing? Can any reason upon earth be brought forward to justify such a verdict? No, Gentlemen, your reason will tell you, no, it is impossible. Gentlemen, be careful, let me exhort you to bring your understandings to the test of truth. Has the prosecutor believed to you, that I am guilty of the circulation of the notes of which he wishes to convict me upon circumstances where the evidence is not clear? If you think as I do, and as every body must do, that the Counsel for the prosecution has not proved the least appearance of guilt, you cannot, consistent with your oaths, this day, find me guilty; you cannot, consistent with the principles of justice and humanity; you cannot, consistent with the duty of Christians this day take away my life. Gentlemen, I have oftentimes heard, that men have lost their lives upon circumstances. This, in my opinion, is extremely cruel, because, if circumstances are ever so pointed, if they are ever so obvious, if they are ever so clear. they only amount to probability, and probability implies at least a kind of uncertainty, and where there is no proof, gentlemen, you ought to be very careful; but even supposing a man ought to lose his life upon circumstances, here there are no direct circumstances at all; for if I am to lose my life because I pay away a note, you, and every person present, might stand at this bar for the offence - offence I cannot call it, but you are as liable, gentlemen, to take a bad note as I am, and if that is the law of this country, don't let England set herself up as an examples to other countries. The Bank would with to convict me upon slight circumstances. With respect to the letter,they would wish to urge it as an evidence of conscious guilt, nothing can be more ridiculous, in my opinion, than this. When I was first taken into custody, I was taken to the House of Correction, and there the Governor (you have most likely heard talk of him) took me into the kitchen, and desired all the turnkeys to watch me closely; no person was suffered to speak to me; my sister came twelve miles from the country to see me, but was not permitted; she went to the justice, and he did not think fit to give an order; I have a brother, who came one hundred miles, and he, with difficulty, got admittance; after I had been there some time, the Governor took me into his private closet, as he calls it, and said, Mr. Holt, you are in a serious situation, depend upon it you will lose your life; you had better tell me all, and you shall have an attorney and counsel, and the best advice, for, says he, the Bank-directors are so severe, that they will. prosecute a person for only having about him a forged note; I told him I had nothing to fear, and therefore as to discovering any thing to him, I could not; I was informed they meant to do all they could to convict me; this induce me to write this letter, in order to make my escape, though I was innocent, knowing I had such a body to contend against, and having heard that men had been executed upon such circumstances, I began to be alarmed, which was the cause of my writing that letter, but after that, I had several opportunities of getting away; I was placed in the kitchen where the keys were kept, and I could have let myself out, as well as all the prisoners confined in the prison, if I had pleased, but I was determined I would trust to Providence and take my trail. It is very true, that I lived with a female, and in order to get rid of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170008"/>her, I took this other lodging. As to the materials that have been produced, they are such as I use in my business as a varnisher. Gentlemen, whatever may be your verdict, it will not make me unhappy, as I am conscious of my own innocence. I do not conceive it to be necessary to say any more upon the subject.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen of the Jury. You are now charged a second time to enquire of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner at the bar, on another capital charge. Gentlemen, I have many years been acquainted with the practice of the administration of justice in this country, and in no instance was the purity and the mildness of that administration more conspicuous than in the late case. Gentlemen, I have not been in the habit of taking notice of any thing that an accused person may say, with respect to myself, but I cannot suffer it to go out into the world for a single moment, that any body stands here to enjoy the pleasure of plunging a dagger into the heart of that young man. No, Gentlemen, the Bank of England never, never prosecute with such views, to them it is a most painful task, which is imperatively imposed upon them, and I have the good fortune to day to give a practical illustration of what I have just said. I have the honour here to represent the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, who have an opportunity once more to put him in hazard of his life, once more to impress upon you the circumstances whence to infer his guilt, once more to put you upon your oaths to deliver him, and to run all the hazards that belong to that consideration; it is in their power again to call a witness who has given evidence upon a former occasion, but whom they did not call because he had disgraced himself; nay, it is in their power now to apply to the Court to put off the trial until next Sessions, in order to obtain the evidence of another most important witness; but, Gentlemen, they do not delight in blood; and I hope this will be a serious warning to the young man at the bar. Be it remembered, however, that this is the fourth forged note that has been traced into the possession of that prisoner, who complains of the harshness of his prosecutors. Need I then ask if the Bank would have done their duty, if they had not brought forward these cases, and submitted them to the consideration of Juries of the country? - Gentlemen, unless the Court command us to go on, we now consent to take a verdict of acquittal.</p>

I missed the sheep, I searched the field all round, and found some blood in one corner; the belly was cut open, and the entrails let out into the ditch, the caul fat was taken away; I then went home; on Saturday night I searched again, and found some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170009"/>more blood in another field, adjoining to the prisoner Smith's garden; about one hundred yard from my field, at a stile within twenty yards of the garden, I found the appearance of the sheep having been hung across the stile, for it was bloody, and there was about half a pint of blood lying at the bottom of the stile, which had dropped down the bars of the stile, it was not a common foot-path; on the Sunday morning I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant; upon searching, we found two shoulders of mutton, two legs, and part of two necks, part of the scrag was cut off, and one loin felted in a pickling pan up stairs; and I found a quantity of fat melted; the prisoners were both at home at that time, they said they had nothing of mine; Penn said he had bought it in London on the Tuesday; he said he had bought it of a man with a horse and cart coming up Snow-hill; he said he sent it down by a country waggon, but did not know whose waggon it was, nor the man; Smith said he did not know any thing about it; the sheep was dead when he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to tell, from the mutton, whether it was ewe mutton or whether? - A. They were little sat ewes; the mutton had the dug on, the weight tallies with the sheep that I lost; it had not been killed by a butcher, it was cut and mangled sadly; they were of the Bakewell breed, there was no other mutton of that breed in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q. You are very well acquainted with Smithfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You often buy sheep there? - A. I have within these few months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that this sheep is so different from others of the Bakewell breed that you are sure it is the same? - A. If I had not bought the sheep myself, and handled it, I should not have known.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Whose house do you say this is? - A. It is Smith's house, Penn lodges in the house with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you turn yourself out from his service? - A. I was brought here as a felon at that bar, on his account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn yourself out of the Excise? - A. It is evident now that I did, because I cannot recover it; but I would not accept it now, if they were to offer it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you not advertised with a reward for apprehending you? - A. I was so; the first that I saw of it was at Teignmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your good friend Sleath, alias Robinson, alias Sturgess, go with you? - A. Yes; she had embarked on board a Newcastle sailer before we had seen the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not know of your both being advertised? - A. Not at the time that we embarked from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you? - A. The post-master, at Shields.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been, perhaps, in confinement ever since? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Your business did not call you at Hackney till eleven o'clock - now I ask you, whether long before eleven o'clock, the letters are not sorted at the Post-office? - A. At this time of the year in general they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, it was in your power, were you so disposed to go there? - A. I might go in as well as any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You might go in and see the letters? - A. I might go in, but I could not get near them; the gentlemen would not suffer me to stop there.</p>
               <p>Q. But a great deal of effectual business may be done, before a man can get out of a room? - A. I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been there? - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been turned out? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the gentlemen would not let you stop? - A. When they demanded me to go, I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for any purpose but for looking after what you could get? - A. I might have called there once, but not more.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, that for the taking this draft, you were liable to be prosecuted? - A. I am very well convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are equally well convinced of another thing, that by attributing the crime to this man, you save yourself? - A. So Mr. Parkin informed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you therefore any doubt of it? - A. Mr. Parkin told me, if I spoke the truth, I should be admitted an evidence, and that was on account of an innocent woman who knew nothing of it, or else I would not have come forward.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Woodsall. The prisoner lodged at my house: I saw the prisoner and Hill, they went out together on the 9th of June.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The evidence given by Hill is totally false; any thing further I leave to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys contended, that the draft in question could by no means be the subject of larceny, in as-much as it was not stamped, and was drawn at the distance of more than twelve miles, and therefore not a valid instrument.</p>
               <p>The Court consented, as it was a new case, to reserve it for the opinion of all the Judges.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called fifteen witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

                        targets="t18000917-12-off49 t18000917-12-crimeloc52"/>; I was coming from Turnham-green, and going home to Acton, my sister was with me; we met the prisoner, he passed us, and at a short distance he called to us to stop; we did not stop, and he called to us again; on his first calling to us we hastened our pace from him, and when he called a second time we hastened again, but he gained upon us very much, and got before us; he then put his hand into his bosom and desired us to give him our money, or he would blow our brains out; I gave him what money I had, which was a shilling and a sixpence; he asked me if I had any more; I told him I had not; he then asked my sister if she had any; she said she had not; he asked her, was she sure she had none; she said she had not; then he said, God bless you, and turned off.</p>
               <p>Q.When he put his hand to his bosom, did he produce any thing that caused an alarm in you? - A. No; I thought he had something, but he did not pull it out; he was dressed in a light coloured coat, a stone colour, or something of that sort; he had a round hat on, a blue waistcoat, and a plaid handkerchief about his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man a wig? - A. I cannot say; but it seemed to me to be his own hair hanging about his face; he had the appearance of a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might this take up? - A. I cannot say to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any crape, or any thing to hide his face? - A. No; I found him at the watch-house at Acton.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from the place where you were robbed? - A. Not half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Try and recollect what time of the day it was? - A. I believe it might have been between four and five, or it might have been between two and three; he was taken to the watch-house, there was my father and brother there, I believe, and a great number of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pointed out to you as the man that robbed you, or did you pick him out? - A. He was not pointed out to me, I pointed him out to my father as the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was the man? - A.From the impression his face made upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man at the watch-house in the same dress as the man who robbed you? - A.Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your money such that you could have sworn to it? - A. No; he had some money when he was carried before the Magistrate the next day, but I could not say it was mine; there were two persons that I met with just after I parted with the prisoner, I told them I was robbed, and asked them if they knew any thing of the man, for he had robbed me; and they said, yes; he had been sitting with them on the grass all day, and they could not get rid of him; but they have disappeared.</p>
               <p>LUTHANIA MAGUIRE sworn. - I am sister to the last witness: I was with her when she was robbed, on Monday the 14th of July, in the afternoon, I cannot say exactly as to the time; the prisoner passed us, and called out after us to stop, or he would follow us; we went on, and he called after us again; he put his right-hand to his bosom, and desired us to deliver our money, or he would blow our brains out; my sister then gave him a shilling and a sixpence, I saw her give it to him; he asked her if she had any more money; she said, no, she had not; then he asked me if I had any; I told him I had none; he asked me again, was I sure I had none; I told him I had not; he then said, God bless you, and went away towards Turnham-green; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170019"/>see him again till the Friday afterwards, when I saw him at Bow-Street; I saw him in the passage going into the office, and at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time know that he was the man charged with robbing your sister? - A. I heard him ordered to the bar; I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pointed out to you as the man? - A. No; I made the observation first, and told Mr. Bond that he was the man; he had on the same coat that he had on when he robbed my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that struck you the most forcibly about him? - A. His features; he wore his own hair, and had the appearance of a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his voice? - A. I knew his voice again immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Under all the circumstances, do you believe the man you saw at Bow-Street was the same man? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon your mind? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came to be taken up? - A. We described him so particularly to our brothers that they made inquiries after him, and traced him to Turnham-green.</p>

             sworn. - I am the father of the prosecutrix: I took the prisoner into custody at an alehouse on Turnham-green, I think they call it the Barley-mow, about six o'clock; I saw him in a country club-room, there were a great many people in the room; I took him into custody, and brought him to the constable's house, at Acton; he was taken to the watch-house, and there my eldest daughter saw him, and said he was the man; I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing at that time; he went very quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business? - A. No; I have been in the army, but am a private gentleman, and live at Acton.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Frances Macguire.) It never happened to you to be robbed before, I suppose? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you under any alarm at the time? - A. I certainly felt an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Macguire.) What passed when you went into the room, did you charge him with robbing your daughter? - A. Yes; but he was silent, I thought rather stupid, he was leaning down; a woman that was with me pointed him out to me; I don't recollect that he said any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to my club on the 14th of July, I was there by twenty minutes after one o'clock, and I was not out of the room till I was taken out by that gentleman; as soon as the gentleman came in, he said, do not be alarmed, for there is a person in the room that has committed a robbery, then the girl pointed me out, and he said, I must go with him; I was smoking my pipe; I begged of him to let me drink a glass of punch before I went, which he did, and then he took me to Acton, to the constable's, and then I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Frances Macguire.) I wish, if you could at all recollect, the time with more certainly? - A. I can only fix it by this, that a good while after I had been home the clock struck three.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you last come from? - A.From Turnham-green; I had been to the Post-office at Hammersmith, and was very much tired, and when I came from the Post-office I sat down upon a stile for some time, I cannot exactly say the time.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Luthania Macguire.) Can you say, with more certainty than your sister, what time it was? - A.No, I cannot; but I think it must have been near two.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat upon the stile some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you were robbed? - A. Before we were robbed.</p>

I saw him at twenty minutes before two o' clock, I looked at my watch when I came upon the Green, and he was the first man that I saw upon the Green, standing under a tree, looking at two other members playing at quoits; I always regarded him as a very honest man, and a very good member.</p>

               <p>Q. What did that mean? - A. About what they were tossing for; Penn was within hearing; I then jumped out, and ran before them, says I, I will tell, you how your score stands, if you do not put down the bacon I will score your head, I had a cutlass in my hand; Neatt was very civil, and laid it down before my feet, from under his smock frock; Wall put his down from under his smock frock, upon the wrapper from which he had taken it, and said, this is the first time, I am not off the premises, and you shall not hurt me now; Barrett came towards the door, I shoved him in; says I, you are all concerned, if you attempt to get away I will blow your brains out; I then sent for Mr. Milward, and they were taken before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this closet? - A.Just going down the cellar stairs; the porter is not here; I missed fourteen cotton shirts not made up, they were cut out, and laid there to be put out to be made, there were about thirty-four yards of it; the dust-cart was gone, I went through several streets and could not see it; they were brought to me afterwards by a constable; I know them again by the mark, and the pattern of the cotton; the closet-door was shut when they went down; when the constable brought them back I opened them.</p>

            ; the prisoner was employed by us in cutting out linen check shirts: On the 30th of July, in consequence of information that I received, I went over to Union-hall and got a search-warrant; the prisoner usually left his work at one to go to dinner, he lives over the water; I placed myself at Mr. Bull's door, who is a linen-draper, a few yards from my house, on the same side of the way, and in about three minutes I saw the prisoner come out; I kept him in conversation going down the street, till we got to Globe-court; I desired him to step up the court with me; I had something for him to do there; when we came to the end of the court, the constable opened the door, and we both walked in; my partner, Mr. Knott, and Mr. Riley were behind me; I told the constable he had some of my property about him; he then put his hand into one pocket, and pulled out a remnant of two yards; then he put his hand into the other pocket and did the same; I then told him he had more of my property about him, which he denied; I then desired the constable to strip him, upon which Chapman said, he would not give him the trouble to do that; he then unbuttoned his waistcoat, and from his left side took a remnant of two yards, and from the other side he took two more, making four in all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the quantity you usually allow for making a check shirt? - A. No, not the proper quantity at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those which were taken from him at all marked? - A. They were; I marked them, my partner marked them, and Mr. Railey marked them, that we might know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked when you found them upon him? - A. Yes; they were marked with the letter K. and another letter that my marking clerk will give you a better account of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are they your property? - A. Yes; I know them by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any of them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not other shops the same pattern? - A. The shops very seldom have any such.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170025"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. This check is for sailor shirts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your checks for sailors shirts are quite different from every body elses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that any body else has checks like your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other partner in the trade besides Mr. Knott? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no confidential clerk who has a proportinate share in the business? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never suffer any work to be done by your servant at his own house? - A. No; if they do, it is stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. But, suppose they bring it back compleatly made? - A. No such thing is ever done at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons may you employ? - A.From one thousand to twelve hundred a week, every day.</p>
               <p>Q. And all of them working upon your premises? - A. No; the cutters work in our house, but the other people do not; the prisoner was a cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no persons that work upon the premises besides cutters? - A. No, only the porters.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this man live with you? - A.Seven years; I always had a very good opinion of him, and was sorry to find that this had happened; I gave him good wages, thirty shillings a week, and ten guineas at Christmas.</p>
               <p>HENRY KNOTT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the partner of Mr. Darby: Immediately after the prisoner had left his work on the 30th of July, I went into the place and missed three remnants of check that I had marked the same morning; Mr. Riley had marked them with the letter J.; I put my own mark immediately under, a small k.; I then immediately went to Mr. Darby, who was at Mr. Bull's door, and gave him information; the prisoner walked down towards London-bridge, which was in his way home; Mr. Darby also walked by the side of him; Mr. Riley and myself followed close behind; when we all came to the end of Globe-court, Mr. Darby desired the prisoner to go up the court with him; Mr. Riley and I still followed close behind; they went into the house of Gill, a constable, and we followed close behind; Mr. Darby desired the constable to search him, for he suspected he had some of our property about him; at first he said he had nothing, but almost immediately after he said he had nothing but two remnants of check; he put his hand into one of his coat-pocket, and took out a remnant of linen check; he then took one out of his other coat-pocket; Mr. Darby still charged him with having more, and ordered the constable to search him; he said he would not give him the trouble, but slackened his apron, and from under his waistcoat took a remnant about the same size, and then another; before I looked at them I told him they were marked, and I immediately opened them and shewed the marks upon them; they were deliverd into the charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How many hands do you employ? - </p>
               <p>A. It is impossible to guess, I could not state the number within five hundred; we employ a great number of parishes, and how many of the poor are employed upon our work it is impossible for me to tell.</p>

             sworn. - I was with the prisoner in Seacoal-lane; I went into the cellar with him, and when we had got our load, I asked the gentlewoman for some beer; she said when we came back for the remainder we should have some; when we came back she said she had lost her bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window open at all? - A. Yes, the farther window was open, and she was at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never heard any thing at all about the bundle? - A. No; she found us as we were coming back for the remainder of the dust, as she had promised to give us some beer; she said she had lost her bundle, and that my fellow-servant had put it up into the cart; I said, if it is so, ma'am, if you will go back you will see the load is but just shot</p>

             sworn. - I know the prisoners, I have been acquainted with them two or three years: On the 10th of April, about ten o'clock, we went to this house and pushed against the door, and the street-door came open; we all four of us pushed against it with our shoulders; then Rayner went into the entry and lifted up the latch of the outer door; Rayner then brought out a lappelled coat, two great coats, a pair of blue striped trowsers, and a pair of pantaloons; in one of the coat-pockets there was a pocket-book, which we threw into a ditch in the New Road; we took the things to Solomon Jacobs, and asked him two guineas for them, Robus and I and Moren went in, Rayner staid at the door; Jacobs gave us a guinea and a half for them; when the money was paid Rayner was in too, and we shared the money between us.</p>

             sworn. - On the 9th of August, I was in the meadows, near the river Lea, measuring Edmonton-marsh to and fro all day; when the coals were taken away, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was about sixty yards from the river, I saw the barge marked Edward Ellis, and also marked upon the barge, Page, steersman; I saw Page on board, I never saw him before in my life; I saw the prisoner, Mann's cart coming down, and backed to where the barge was, in a creek before you come to the river Lea; I saw him in the barge with four or five other men, Corby and Mann were among them; I knew Mann very well; two of them were shovelling coals into the sacks, and two holding them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Chapman? - A.Yes; he was assisting them in filling the sacks; they shot the coals out of the sacks loose into the cart, there were about six or seven sacks, Mann and Corby went away with her cart; Chapman and Page then went and borrowed a cart of one Carpenter, in the Marsh, and in about ten minutes after they loaded that likewise; they had no horses, they drew the cart themselves, and placed it to the barge as the others had done, and loaded the cart with coals; I cannot say what the quantity was, I was not so near them then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they about it? - A.About twenty-five minutes; Chapman drove the cart away, and Page remained in the barge; as Mann passed me, I said, Mann, I think you buy coals at a cheap rate, don't you; he made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the three prisoners? - A. I have no doubt at all about it; Chapman I never saw before, but I have no doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You say there was another name upon the barge besides the prosecutor's? - A. Yes,

               <p>SMITHSON DAWSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a land-surveyor: The last witness was with me, on the 9th of August, measuring the Marsh; I saw some persons in a barge, but I cannot swear to any of them; there were two carts, and five persons engaged in loading them out of the barge; they shot them into the carts loose, when one cart was full the other was fetched; two of them went away with the first cart, and then two of the other five went for the other cart, and loaded that from the said barge; there was the name of Ellis on the barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were at work on the same spot with Osborn? - A. Yes; at the same distance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Ellis.) Q. How many barges have you? - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more than one barge upon the river that day? - A. I believe the other was in the Thames, but I am not sure, I think it was, loaded with timber, going to Blackwall; I am sure she was not loaded with coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Page authority from you, or your mother, to sell coals for you? - A. Never; nor or did I ever sell a coal in my life to any body at Edmonton, or between London and Heriford.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Q. Page might have given directions to persons to unload a quantity of coals from that barge? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. He was in the barge himself, loading these coals; that is more than giving directions.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner, Mann? - A. Yes; I am a wheelwright, within a few doors of him, in Upper Edmonton; he came to me on the 9th of August, about five o'clock in the afternoon; he came and asked me if I wanted to buy a small quantity of coals; he said he had got a few that he had bought, that he wanted to part with; I did not answer him the first time; and as he was going out at the door, he says, will you have them or not; I said, Will, you know it is Saturday, and I run short of money; he made answer, if you cannot pay me to-day you can to-morrow; he then said, if you like to have them, say so; he owed me a little bill; I said, if he would give me half money and half coals I would have them; he then went to his own yard, where the coals were; he was to bring me six sacks, but I did not see them measured; he brought them in the cart, and my smith helped to unload the cart; to the best of my knowledge they were in sacks; I paid him a guinea and a seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you outset the debt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What is Mann? - A. He keeps a horse and cart to carry any thing on the road.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Ellis.) Did you examine your barge when it came home? - A. I could hardly miss a chaldron of coals out of a barge of coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your steersman's name upon your barge? - A. Yes;

               <p>Q. Have you, at any time, had any conversation with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before the prisoner said any thing to you, what did you say to him; did not you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No, I was aware of that; I took him to his own house, and told him there was a charge against him for stealing some sugar from his master; I and my brother officer asked him if he had got any in his house; he said he had got none.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this after you had been to Mrs. Knotman's? - A. No, before; I staid with the prisoner below stairs, while my brother officer searched and found a piece of sugar, which he has here; after that, he begged very hard to let him go, on account of his family; and she went down upon her knees to let him go, he had five children; we then told him we could not, we were officers of Justice; and we then took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The piece of sugar found at the prisoner's house is a very considerable quantity I see? - A. Here is all there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it? - A. Here is part of a mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a mark is it? - A. I believe it is a dent in the sugar in the baking.</p>
               <p>Q. Roberts is a cow-keeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And deals in sugar? - A. I should think so, or we should not have found it there.</p>
               <p>Q. A cow-keeper a dealer in sugar? - A. We found some other things there besides; we found some linen, some liquorice, and some handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you believe all those things were stolen? - A. No, I do not believe they were; there was a tin pot that was owned.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, Roberts, gave you a great deal of information, I suppose, before you went to the house? - A. No, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mrs. Roberts? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make known to him that you were officers of Justice? - A. To Mrs. Roberts I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you told her you were officers of Justice, she refused to tell you there was any sugar in the house, and refused you the keys? - A. Yes; and she refused us other keys besides that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was good Mr. Roberts at home, the cowkeeper? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Some sugar was found under the bed, in a place of concealment? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. It is precisely a kind of place in which a cowkeeper and a grocer would keep it? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some in the back-kitchen, in a chest? - A. Yes; it was standing by the fire-place, locked up with a key that we found in Mrs. Robert's pocket; there was a towel found there, with the mark picked out.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mr. Nealey's you found some bags? - A. Yes; and some pepper, in the chest in Nealey's bedroom; he was at home, and his wife too.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them you were officers of Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they shewed you directly where the things were? - A. No, they did not; they said we were welcome to search.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a Police-officer, I was with Vickery: I found the things he has produced at Mr. Roberts's; I went in company with Vickery to apprehend the prisoner, on Tuesday the 9th, to Watling-street, at his master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in consequence of any thing that passed at Roberts's that you apprehended the prisoner? - A. It was; we desired him to go with us to his house, in a court in Hill-street, Holywell-mount; I asked him if he knew a person of the name of Nealey; he told me he did; I asked him if he had let him have any sugar at any time; he refused to tell me whether he had or had not; I then proceeded to search, and asked him if he had got any sugar in his house; he said, no, he had not; I found a great deal of sugar broke up in lumps, fit to put into tea; I found this lump, (The lump produced by Vickery), wrapped up, in a closet; it appearing to be of the same quality with that that was found at Roberts's house I took it before the Magistrate; he seemed very much alarmed, and begged we would not take him before the Magistrate, but let him go; that he was very sorry for what he had done, and would never do so again; his wife went down upon her knees, and cried; I asked him if he could inform me where he bought the sugar, if he bought it at any shop in the neighbourhood; he told me he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any where else? - A. Yes; from the information that I received from Robert's wife I searched Nealey's house, and there I found three bags, and a quantity of papers; there were some small pieces which corresponded with the fine sugar but we did not bring it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You said, upon my learned Friend's examination, he refused to tell you; did he say he would not tell you? - A. No; but he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. The small piece was all you found there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What would it weigh? - A. I suppose a pound, for hardly so much.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Phone.) Q. Look at these two pieces of sugar. (The sugar found at Mrs. Knotman's? - A.

               <p>Q. Look at that bag. (The bag found at Nealey's)? - A. This is my bag, I know it by the number, the letter S, and figure 85.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the sugar found at the prisoner's? - A. It is the same quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is that mark 7, and a stroke, your own making? - A. It is not.</p>

               <p>Q. The sugar found at the prisoner's? - A. That I cannot swear to at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the bag, you know that by the number? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it ever happen to you, as it does to other tradesman, that sacks are lent? - A. I never lent a sack in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants do you keep? - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. When you send out goods, do your servants use bags to carry them out in? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your other servants here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that on the 1st of August, that bag was not out, carried out by some one of your servants? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they be in the custody of your servants to bring home your goods, without your knowledge? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is the mark that is upon it your own mark? - A. No; it was a mark that I bought with it.</p>

Jackson was robbed, I observed the prisoner coming down within one hundred yards of me; he came from a quickset hedge to the place where we were, in a beaten footpath; he came close behind us, got over the bank, and went to some paling, along which was a footpath, over which Miss Jackson had to go; the paling was made of ship-timber, and there was a part of the ribs; he hid himself behind one of them; he came out again, and passed her; he then turned round and passed her a second time, and then turned about and stopped her; I saw her deliver something, first with one hand, and then the other, at different times; he then set off that way, the way that she was going, but hearing people in the lane, he turned out and came towards me; I made a cry of stop thief, and saw him taken immediately; I never lost sight of him for a minute, or a sixtieth part of a minute; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I took him down to Miss Jackson, and asked her if that was the man, she said it was; he did not say a syllable; we took him to a public-house, on Newington-green, and searched him; we found upon him about five pennyworth of halfpence; Miss Jackson described that there were some new halfpence amongst them, and there were some new ones amongst those that he had, and a tin box, containing his discharge from the barracks at Chatham, on account of his bad sight.</p>

               <p>- JONES sworn. - I heard the cry of stop thief; I went to stop the prisoner, when he threw away this stick, (producing it); he was taken not one hundred yards from where Miss Jackson was robbed; Miss Jackson said that was the same stick that the prisoner had presented to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I was brought back, Mrs. Jackson was asked if I was the person, and she said she could not tell; then they took me to Newington-green; the constable asked her, and she said she not say that I was the man, and then a gentleman came and said, he would swear he saw me take the purse out of the lady's hand.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Miss Jackson.) Did you ever say to any one, that you did not know whether he was the man or not? - A. I never did.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to withdraw when you had those suspicious? - A.

               <p>Q. The woman herself told you where her lodgings were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into a watering-house, and saw this man and another girl drinking together, and I came away; after that, I saw him again by himself, very much intoxicated, and he wanted me to take him home with me, I took him to a house in a court in Whitcomb-street, and he made me a small compliment, and then wanted it back again; and because I would not give it him back again, he said I had robbed him; and as we came down the stairs he turned his breeches-pockets inside out, and they were full of holes.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Devonshire, of Byfield, near Banbury, is a correspondent of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any letter from him on the 19th of April? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are the person who opened the letter? - A. I opened the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, is that the letter that you opened? - A. It is, it contained two notes, No. 3195, and 3196.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing strike you particularly at that time, so as to lead you to examine the letter more closely? - A. No; the letter laid by for two or three days; we did not examine it minutely till after I had received another letter from Mr. Devonshire; there appears an alteration in the word two, and in the word twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the outside of the letter? - A. Yes; we examined the place where the wafer was; there appeared to be two wafers, not exactly one upon the other, but partly so, it appeared to have been opened and sealed up again; I examined the post-mark, and it appeared to me to be a little defaced; Mr. Yates made application to Mr. Robarts's Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two Bank-notes? - A.These were in the letter that I received on the 19th; they were paid into Bobarts's, with other notes, and some cash.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the letter E is visible in that post-mark? - A. Yes; when I came to examine it more minutely; and it is now in the state in which I delivered it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have known this young man, I believe, ever since he was an instant? - A.I have known the family, as neighbours living within a few doors; I always thought him a steady and an industrious young man; they are a very industrious family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Ferguson.) Q. What does the letter E import? - A. It shews that it was stamped at the table E, and the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. The table where the prisoner was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. That stamp, letter E, is only in the Inland-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter E is in a different office from that where he was? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you get three thousand or three hundred a year, he has exactly the same sum? - A. Yes; but if I become a bankrupt, every shilling of his must come forward, and he acts in the business every day, from five in the morning, till eight at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Whatever losses are sustained in the trade, fall upon you intirely? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I attended the search-warrant at Prince's street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any of the articles found that you can speak to, as being yours? - A. A screw-driver, a tinder-box, and we had plated wire, about this quantity, and very much like it; I was also at Mrs. Egerton's; this watering-pot has our mark upon it, and this saucepan cover; these skewers I can speak positively to, they were marked for Lord Camelford, L D C, and the pruning-knife; two brass bolts, and several pieces of timber, that I know to be ours; in all, there are two hundred and thirty-nine pieces; the stoves I cannot swear to; here is a washing-tub, a blunderbuss, and several other things that I believe to be ours.</p>

It was; I saw a green cart, a little country cart, exactly opposite to Bell-alley; I saw a man fitting in the cart; he sat there a minute or two, and another man came to him in a blue coat; he went away, and then the man in the cart, who had a light-coloured coat on, went away with the cart, and came back again in a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing his person? - A. No, I had not, I only saw his back, I was going to market; I did not see any thing particular, except the cart standing there; I left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor, what was your opinion then? - A. I was not near enough to make any observation of them; Price had the same coloured coat on.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gold seal-marker and jeweller; I live at No. 27, Tash-street, Gray's-inn-lane; the prisoner, Price, lives in Little Tash-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your house command a view of his? - A.Yes: On the 11th of July, Friday morning, I was up about five o`clock at business, with the window open, and I saw Price and another man come to the door; they stood at the door some time.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the other man here? - A. No; he goes by the name of Bob, I do not know his sirname; after they had stood at the door some little time, they went in again, and left the door ajar; then they came out again and I saw a tall man come in a chaise-cart, or a country-cart, like a higler's cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the colour of that cart? - A. It was green.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. Yes, that is him, next to Price, his name is Robinson, he had five bags in the body of cart; he tumbled them out as quick as he could, and they fell soft upon the ground; when Price, and the other man that came to the door before he came up, took them in as fast as ever they could; when Robinson had chucked the last bag out, when there were about two to get into the house, he drove off; then Price and the other man took the remainder in.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the bags fell soft, explain that? - A. As if they contained linen, or something soft in them; in the course of the day I saw Price very busy running backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular towards the afternoon of that day? - A. Yes; about four o'clock I observed Price go out with a white apron on, like a porter, and Robinson, and this other man, Bob, in their shirt sleeves, each of them with one of those bags upon their shoulders; they went down Tash-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body at Price's house in the course of the day? - A. I saw a genteel man in black, with his hair powdered, go backwards and forwards two or three times in the afternoon before the first bag went away; I did not know who that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a girl of the name of Sarah King? - A. Yes; I know her about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if she was at Price's house that day? - A. Yes, she was; she went out of Price's house either before or immediately after the bags went out, but I cannot exactly say which.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You did not know the prisoner Robinson's name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at this time? - A. Up two pair of stairs, the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you engaged at your business at the time? - A. Yes; but seeing this transaction, engaged my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. For the whole day? - A.No, I did not see all that they did, but most of what they did that day.(

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. I am an officer: On Saturday, the 12th of July, in the evening, I went to the house of the prisoner Price, in Little Tash-street, with Sapwell, Read, and a Mr. Osborne, clerk to Mr. Lambe; we found Mrs. Price, Mr. Price was not at home; we searched the house, and upon searching the house, below stairs in the kitchen, I found some pieces of wrappers, which were wet; I called Mr. Osborne to look at them, which he did; upon searching further, Sapwell found, in my presence, a centrebit, some knives and forks, and table-cloths; I went away, and left my brother officers there; when I returned, I brought Price in with me, I found him within nine or ten yards of his house, Mr. Sawyer was with me; I said, Johnny, I am glad to see you, you are the man I have been looking for; he said, very well; and I immediately took him into his own house; I searched him, I observed his left-hand come quick from his pocket; I immediately seized his hand, and found it clenched very tight, I got his hand open; says I, Jack, what have you got in your hand, I must see; upon that I opened it by main strength; and in his hand I found a Banknote of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any writing upon that Banknote? - A.

            , in Queen-street, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Rainbow's, had you seen young Mr. Frith? - A. I had; Mr. Rainbow was not at home; I afterwards found young Mr. Rainbow at home; I asked him if he knew any thing of a fifty pound note having been in his possession within a few days; I did not shew him the note; he strictly denied knowing anything of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about any silk? - A. I cannot recollect that I did; at that time, he said, his father would be at home in a very little while, in the course of half an hour; I told him I must request of him to be so obliging as to stop with me till his father came home; I shut the door, and was in a little bit of a warehouse, with young Mr. Rainbow; during that time, somebody knocked at the door, which was Mr. Rainbow's porter; I thought it my duty to stop him, which I did, and desired him to go into the kitchen, his name was Wright; young Mr. Rainbow then went to the door, and said, here is my father coming; and he then came in; that might be in about half an hour; I asked Mr. Rainbow, sen. if he knew any thing of a 50l. note having been in his possession within the course of a few days, or whether he had paid a 50l. note away; he hesitated a great deal, and said he knew nothing of any such note; I told him a 50l. note was a heavyish one, it was not like a one or a two-pound note; it was very odd he did not recollect it; I then asked him if he knew Mr. Frith; he said he did; I asked him if he had not received a 50l. note of Mr. Frith, in part of 200l.; he then recollected something of it, and explained to me what he had received that 50l. part of the 200l. for; he told me that a person had been with him with a sample of silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then asked him whether he had purchased any silk? - A. Not till after this; he said a person had offered him a sample of silk, and he had purchased it, and given 200l. for it; I then asked him if he knew the person; he said he did; I asked him his name; he said his name was Burdett; I asked him where the silk was; he said he had purchased it, but he had not received it yet; I told him I thought it a little mysterious that a man like Mr. Rainbow should pay 200l. without seeing the quantity of silk or the quality; he said so it was, he had done it; I told him I could not be satisfied that he could give 200l. without receiving the silk; he strictly denied, upon his honour, that he had received the silk; I asked him how he could put that confidence in Mr. Burdett; he said it was through a Mr. Sansum; that through his acquaintance with Mr. Sansum he became acquainted with Burdett.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about being recommended by Sansum? - A. No, I cannot recollect any thing about recommendation; I then heard a knock at the door, I went to the door and it was Sapwell; we had some conversation, and then I sent him away; I told both Mr. Rainbows that I expected Mr. Lambe; they then seemed to be agitated; Mr. Rainbow, the father, informed me that it was something singular that he had not received the silk, for he had been that morning up to Mr. Burdett's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you had mentioned the name of Mr. Lambe? - A. No, before; then Mr. Lambe came in with Mr. Osborne; they had not been in long, before Mr. Rainbow, sen. acknowledged his having the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He said that he had the silk; and added, my son shall go over with you, it is at his house; his son took down the key, and I went with him to No. 24, College-hill; when I came there the door was a little way upon the jar, with the chain upon it; it was an empty house; young Mr. Rainbow knocked at the door, and a kind of chair-woman came and opened it; upon that young Mr. Rainbow went up stairs, and Sap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170055"/>well and I followed him into the one pair of stairs, and at the further end of the room young Mr. Rainbow opened a cupboard, and there we found five bags of silk; it has been locked up in the Marshal's office ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You are a City officer, and have been many years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are well known to be a City officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you apprehend persons you always take what property they have upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You sometimes find people very unwilling to part with property which afterwards turns out to be their own? - A. Sometimes we do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Price's house you found some pieces of wrapping in the kitchen? - A. Yes, wet. Q. Was it canvas? - A. It was something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Your conversation with young Rainbow was confined to his having had in his possession a 50l. note? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went with Tipper on the Saturday night, to Price's house; he was not at home; I staid in the house while Tipper went out; he brought in Price with him, and I saw Tipper take something out of his hand, which I believe was a 50l. note; I found a centre-bit, a saw, and a steel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any keys? - A. No, I did not; Tipper then secured him and took him to the Poultry Compter; he returned about half past twelve; I took Mrs. Price up stairs to search her, and while I was up stairs with her, I heard Tipper call, Tom, Tom, come down! I went down and there was Tipper and Read had got Robinson in custody; I searched him, and in his job I found 65l. in notes; I asked him how he came by them; he told me he took them in trade; I asked him what trade he was, and he said, a private soap-maker; then he was taken to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the notes? - A.They are in my possession; (produces them;) two of 20l. two of 10l. and a 5l. On the Monday morning, about nine o'clock, I went with Tipper and Mr. Osborne to Mr. Walpole's, a banker, in Lombard-street, to enquire about a 50l. note; then we went to the house of Mr. Rainbow, the elder; Mr. Rainbow was out; I went to the Lord-Mayor to get a search-warrant; I then returned to Mr. Rainbow's; I knocked at the door, and Tipper opened it; I went in, and found Tipper and the two Mr. Rainbows; I did not hear any thing that passed, because I went into the kitchen to apprehend the porter; I then went with young Mr. Rainbow and Tipper and Mr. Osborne, to a house, No. 24, College-hill, where young Mr. Rainbow took out the key of a closet, and shewed us the five bags; I took them to the Mansion-house, and there they have remained, in the Marshal's office, under our seals ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Robinson told you he was a soap-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that turn out to be true? - A. I do not know; I have not heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you enquired? - A. Yes; but every body told me, no.</p>

               <p> Q. Did you go, and when was it, to the house of the Rainbows? - A. It was on Monday morning the 14th of July, about ten o'clock; I found Tipper and both the Mr. Rainbows together; immediately that I entered, old Mr. Rainbow asked me how I did, and acknowledged he had bought the silk; I asked him who he had bought it of; he said he had bought it of a man of the name of Burdett; but that he had not yet got the silk; he said that Burdett had asked him two hundred pounds for it; he said his reply was, that he had not the money by him, but he would procure it; and that he had borrowed two hundred pounds, by which he had paid for the silk; the officers interrogated him very much to let them know where the silk was; after much interrogation, he said it was at his son's house; his son was by at the time; and immediately that he had made that reply, the officers desired young Mr. Rainbow to walk out with them; while the officers were gone out with young Mr. Rainbow, I asked old Mr. Rainbow who this Burdett was; he told me he knew but little of him, that he had seen him two or three times before; I then asked him if there was any Book China, which was a particular article among the rest that we lost two bales of; he told me he could not tell, for he had not seen it; I then asked him what weight it was; he said he did not know, perhaps 200lb., perhaps 300lb. and perhaps more I told him it was very odd that he should trust a man with two hundred pounds, and buy such a quantity of silk, that he knew nothing about; he said it was so. and that he trusted this man through the recommendation of a person of the the name of Sansum; immediately after that almost, the officers returned.</p>
               <p> Q. Did you accompany Tipper and Sapwell, or either of them, to trace these notes? - A. Yes; I went with them, to Walpole and Co.'s, in Lombard-street, whole name was written upon the 50l. note, that was on the Monday morning about nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170056"/>o'clock; we afterwards went to the Bank to trace the other notes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a school-master, and live in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know old Mr. Rainbow? - A. Yes. and the young one: On the 11th of July I lent Mr. Rainbow two hundred pounds; I paid it him in a 100l. note, a 50l. a 30l. and the rest smaller notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get those Bank-notes? - A. I received them at Walpole and Co.'s, bankers, in Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you parted with them had you written any thing upon them? - A. Yes, I wrote Walpole and Co. upon the front of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that 50l? - A. That is my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. That was one of the notes that you advanced to Mr. Rainbow? - A. I presume it must be; I got them from Messrs. Walpole's in change for a draft or 180l. of Bruckshaw and Co.'s stock-brokers, at the Royal Exchage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q.If you had not the highest opinion of Mr. Rainbow's integrity you would not have lent him the money? - A.Certainly not; I have known him fourteen years; I should as soon suspect-you now to be guilty of the foul crime of murder, as Mr. Rainbow be guilty of any thing dishonourable.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you received any other 50l. Banknotes of Walpole and Co. recently before that? - A.No, I cannot say that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was young Mr. Rainbow in partnership with his father? - A. I do not know any thing of their concerns in business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Wright.) Q. You were asked about these things being up stars: the warehouse was rather small, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not common for goods to be kept up stairs when the warehouse was full? - A. I never saw any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner desires me to ask of you this question, whether, while you were his porter, you do not know that he kept goods that came into his shop in the fair way of his trade, up stairs? - A. I never knew any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever recommend him to Mr. Rainbow? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You do know Burdett? - A. I dined with him once in company with Mr. Rainbow, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then If he has said he became acquainted with Burdett in your comapny, it was strictly true? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.What is Burdett - do you know? - A. A Sheriff's-officer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. And I belive you know that he has absconded? - A. I have heard so. (One bag of silk produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Lambe.) Q. Be so good as look at that silk - are you able to say that that is a parcel of the silk taken from your house? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. From experience in business, it is an easy matter upon the inspection of such an article as that, to be able to say? - A. I took very particular fabric, and if differed very materially from the fabric that I have had before, and I sent for our broker; I firmly believe it is the identical silk; I saw the other bags at the Mansion house, but I cannot speak to them so positively as I can to this.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had this bag the tickets on them that you mentioned? - A. No; these are not our bags, they have been changed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What was the value of the silk? - A. Four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. With the duty upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value without the duty? - A. I do not exactly know what duty it pays.</p>
               <p>Q. There were different denominations of silk lost from your house? - A. Yes, ninety-three pounds eight ounces of Friuli silk; the quantity of Friuli silk that we lost, and the quantity found, corresponded, as near as possible; and the China silk, I believe, will agree to an ounce.</p>
               <p>- BANBURY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am a silk broker, and have been many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember examining a quantity of silk with Mr. Lambe, that you had bought for him? - A. Yes; I recollect this silk perfectly, it is a very peculiar silk.</p>
               <p>Q. But, in general, in the examination of an article, is it of a nature for you to say upon, being produced, whether that is the article or not? - A. In some kind of silks there is a difficulty, particularly in China; but I never-saw a bale like this in my life before, either in size, quality, or throw; I am almost positive it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the value of four hundred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170058"/>pounds worth of silk, without the duty? - A. About three hundred pounds.</p>

            's defence. My Lord, and Gentleman of the Jury, it has already been related to you with respect to Burdett coming to me and telling me that it was smuggled from on board a ship belonging to a person that he was intimately acquainted with; I told him I could not speak to him them, for my wife had been run over the day before, and the surgeon was then up stairs; he called again in about an hour and a half, and I bought the silk of him, for which I paid him 348l. I borrowed 200l. of it my friend, Mr. Frith; I never had the smallest suspicion of its having been stolen; I never had my name called in question before.</p>
               <p>William-Thomas Rainbow's defence. My Lord, and Gentleman of the Jury. My feelings this day you will better conceive than I can express: I served my time to my father, and have been servant to him ever since; I could not conceive, nor do I believe that my father was a person who could do that which was wrong, or which could implicate him, who must be the dearest to him, his son. My Lord and Gentleman, I have been married three months last Monday; my father took this house at College-Hill for me; I was only his servant, and acted under my father's direction; I believe solemnly, as I stand at this bar, and as I believe that I shall stand before the bar of the Almighty, that my father had no idea of this transaction being illegal.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- TATLOCK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I have been engaged in the silk trade twenty years, as a silk broker.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your business, I take it, to attend to the quality and nature of different sorts of silk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that silk; from your judgement, and skill in the trade, I desire you to tell my Lord, and the Jury, whether that silk, having been in your possession yesterday, or the day before, without any ticket upon it, or any distinguishing mark, do you think you could, conscientiously, swear to its being the same silk, from its colour, from its texture, or any thing else intrinsic in the silk? - A. The fabricator of this silk sends a great quantity to market; we call these Burgams, but it being out of condition, I should thing it impossible for any person to swear to it on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a large quantity manufactured by the same manufacturer, would not long package have the same effect? - A. No; frequently same parts will be out of condition, and other parts not; but this silk is finer than this fabricator generally sends to market.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing I was to take this silk, and lock it up for a week, could you, at the end of that time, be able to swear to it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You say this silk is finer than the fabricator usually sends to market? - A. Yes; it is smarter in the throw, it has had more work in the mill.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you know Mr. Rainbow? - A. Yes; I have known him some years; his transactions with me always marked the character of an honest man.</p>
               <p>The prisoners, Rainbows, called twenty-four other witnesses, who gave them an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. stated, that he had a list of one hundred and eighty witnesses, who were attending to speak to their character.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner Robinson.</p>
               <p>- LAMB sworn. - I am a tallow-chandler, at Dock-head: I have known Robinson three years; he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. How long have you known him? - A.Three years.</p>
               <p>Q.Has he been at home during all that time? - A.I never knew where he lived; being a private soap-boiler, I never wished to inquire; he used to come to my shop.</p>
               <p>Did he come regularly, week by week? - A. Sometimes he would not come for a fortnight, when he was afraid of being found out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I wish to know what a private soapboiler is? - A.That is boiling the soap without paying the duty.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say, whether the bags that were taken from the prisoner, were the same that you found behind the chest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This man is not a commodore yet? - A. He is acting commodore, though he does not receive the pay, he does duty.</p>
               <p>Q. For the good natured purpose, trying whether your messmates would commit a felony or not, you put them back into that place? - A.I was ordered so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, before he would be suffered to go out at the gate, he would have been pretty closely rubbed down? - A. He would have been rubbed down.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has, himself, been the means of detecting persons who have been committing those fort of depredations? - A. Yes, it was his duty so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that the nutmegs in that warehouse, belonged to the merchants who had purchased them, and not to the India-Company? - A. The nutmegs were in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do I understand you rightly, that he had denied having any thing? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are sold in the sales, do they not remain afterwards under the care of the Company?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there such nutmegs in the warehouses at the time? - A. We had such. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been a long time in this warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And so has the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he is a man that I always thought a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has been the means of detecting some persons who have been committing depredations? - A. One person he has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Stinton, the elder, told me, if I found any thing concealed, to let him know, and I should be promoted in the warehouse, and as he was not much liked in the warehouse for fear of a trap being laid for him, three years ago, I stopped a man with nutmegs, and it was dropped; I could not walk the streets safely after it, I was so ill used, and that was the reason why I took them to him in that private manner; I have been thirteen years in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. They will not answer the purpose of any other stocks? - A. No; the taps are for the axletrees, and the stocks are to screw the nuts on; it is a thing I never suffered to go out of my shop, it is a right-hand and a left-hand stock.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a smith, in Tottenham-court. road; I know the prisoner at the bar, he worked for me about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember buying any taps of him? A. Yes, somewhere about the middle of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these taps? - A. I am not so well acquainted with them as the man that works with me; I believe these are the same, I gave five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Pike. They cost me twenty-five shillings new, and they are the better for being old, because they are seasoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any taps of the prisoner before? - A. No; the taps laid in my shop, I suppose, three weeks before I paid for them; I had them valued by a screw-maker, at four shillings.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you any stocks to those taps? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are not certain that these are the very screws that you bought of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did I understand you rightly, that in the begining of your evidence, you said you had no doubt they were the same? - A. I have not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any other taps in your house about this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other man bring you any taps? - A. No; when I bought them, they were very much out of repair, my man was a day and a half repairing them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought these taps of a young man that was going Armourer's mate on board an Indiaman.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think any man is able to swear to taps? - A.It is impossible, unless he has a private mark.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Suppose they fit the stocks? - A.There are so many, it is impossible to swear to them; I have two pair with me, the same tap may fit different stocks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Mr. Pike has said, that it will not answer the purpose, though it is of the same size? - A. It certainly will answer the purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do not you think a man could swear to a pair of taps if he had no other in his house? - A. I think he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you employed Tweedie to procure you a pair of taps? - A. No, I had not. The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            </rs>.(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>JOHN MARCH sworn. - The prisoner came to live with me in March 1799; she said, that she understood I wanted some person to take care of my house; I asked her what wages, she said, she did not want wages, she wanted peace and quiteness, she referred to a M. Le Marchand, a counsellor of the Parliament of Rouen; he came with her, and said she was a very proper person.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At <placeName id="t18000917-67-crimeloc367">Knightsbridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was any application made to you by Mr. Winden, to settle an account for bread? - A. No, nor did I know that such a man did exist, till I was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you furnish the prisoner, from time to time, with money to pay for the articles of housekeeping? - A. Yes, regularly every day, constantly</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of August, was there any dispute between you and her, with respect to accounts? - A. I was arrested upon a note which I never gave; I sent for Mr. Winden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, during the explanation, stay in your house, or did she run away? - A. She left the house; I then examined my plate, and, instead of finding it, I found but three silver knives.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the place where the plate was deposited? - A. She had, and went away with the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time give her authority to pawn any of your plate? - A. Never; I called at Bow-street, when I left the spunging-house, and got a search-warrant; I was present when the house was searched; I found this pocket-book full of duplicates, and in searching the drawers, they found other tickets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had no dispute with the prisoner till the 25th of August last? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived in perfect harmony with her? - A. Yes, as much as a master can do with a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it extremely odd that you should be arrested, and she be the means of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the dispute arose? - A. I had no dispute.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a little angry at her being the means of your being arrested? - A. Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you prefer a bill of indictment to the Grand Jury at this sessions, for forging that note upon which you were arrested? - A. I did</p>
               <p>Q. And the Grand Jury threw out that bill, did not they? - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this note, and this dispute, did she remain in your house? - A. She went away directly, I never saw her again till I saw her at the bar at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she went to Mr. De Clerville's, and that he came with her the next day to Bow-street? - A. I did not think Mr. De Clerville capable of so base an action, after he had eaten and drank, and been cloathed in my house for five years, and after I had begged for him -</p>

               <p>

               <p>Q. In December last, did you pawn any thing, and what? - A. I never have since the prisoner has been in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never redeem any property which was pawned in December last by the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in December last? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those things that you redeemed? - A. A gold watch and a diamond ring, and to the best of my recollection I never redeemed any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner live with you after that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. A month? - A. More than that.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that you never gave her authority to pledge any thing? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. There was that ring, you know? - A. I pledged it by some person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send it by the prisoner? - A. To the best of my recollection, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that ring pawned for 10l. during the time that the prisoner lived with you? - A. I cannot recollect; I gave her a watch to pledge for me that I had redeemed.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave her no wages at all? - A. I gave her a present now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not in the character of a servant to you? - A. I never took her in any other shape.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not dine with you, and sit at table? - A. Yes, she did; she prepared the dinner, and dined with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never gave authority to the prisoner to pledge any of the articles, except the watch? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the habit of pawning your plate for some time? - A. When I wanted money, I thought it was better to go to the pawnbroker's, than to go for the bills that were owing to me; I have done so for fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you ever given the prisoner authority to pledge any one of those articles for which the is now indicted? - A. Never.</p>

             M'CARTY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Do you remember any parcel being left at your house? - A. Yes, the end of July, I think the 30th; the prisoner had some rum and water in the kitchen; he called for a pen and ink, and I saw no more of him; I went about my business, and when I came back into the kitchen I saw a kind of pocket-book or a memorandum-book lying upon the table; I supposed it to be his, and let it lie for some time, thinking he would send for it; I left it on the table, and did not meddle with it; there was a string round it; when Mr. M'Carty came home, he took it off the table, and put into a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty.) The parcel that you put into the drawer, was it the same parcel that you delivered to Dawson? - A. Yes, three days after.</p>
               <p>Mrs. M'Carty cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This kitchen is a room appropriated for all guests that come? - A.House-keepers come in.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several persons drinking in that kitchen? - A.There might be in the sore part of the day; but not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in the sore part of the day? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long was it from the time you left him writing at the table, till the time you came back again? - A. It might be a quarter of an hour; there had not been any body else in to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you drunk or sober? - A. I was not insensible; I had only drank one glass of brandy and water before I met with the prisoners, and I had two glasses of brandy with them; I was very ill and asked for some water; The prisoners said, they lived close by, and persuaded me to go with them, and they would get me some; I went with them to a house in <placeName id="t18000917-74-crimeloc401">Angel-court, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time did you go into the public-house? - A. A little after eleven; they then both said, they would come down stairs with me, but being very dark, they went up the court with me, instead of going into Bishopsgate-street; we passed a house, where there was a door standing open, the prisoners went with me into this house, and as soon as I had got in the prisoners pulled the door upon me, and ran away; the passage being to very dark, I could not find the door, I made a noise, and a woman brought a candle; I examined my pockets, and missed my watch, a five-pound note, and seventeen shillings and sixpence; I came out of the house, and called the watchman, and went with him to the constable of at night; he told me, I could do nothing till the next day, and must get a search-warrant; the next night, about ten o'clock, I came past the same court and saw the prisoners standing at the corner of the court, I went up to them and told them, I wanted to speak with them a moment; I asked them if they did not recollect drinking liquor with me the night before, and they both denied it; I told them I was perfectly satisfied they were the persons, when Lawrence immediately said, she would be damn'd if she would deny but what, she did drink some liquor with me; I told her, I had lost my watch and I was determined to have it back; they both denied it, and said they never saw any thing of the kind, while I was speaking to them, the watchman came past, his name is Barlett; I told him those were the two women I was in company with the night before; he told me, he was on duty, but if I would wait till he came over, he would take them into custody; in the mean time, a person of the name of Wright, a constable, came up, and told me not to have any thing more to do with it yet, he would call upon me in the morning, at my lodgings, which he did and told me the prisoners were in custody and my watch and handkerchief found upon them; I went before the Lord-Mayor, and saw my watch and handkerchief, I knew them to be mine; I am certain the two prisoners are the same women; the watch had a silver hoop round the works, instead of a cap.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of Bishopsgate ward: Last Saturday week, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, and another lad, lurking about, and looking into a number of shops; I watched then till I came to Mr. Turner's shop; I observed the prisoner look about the window and the door several times; I saw Mrs. Turner open a door, and go into the parlour, I then saw the prisoner go in double, upon his hands and knees, and go round the counter; I then watched for his coming out, he came out, and made a run, I never lost sight of him; I caught hold of him, and from under his left arm he dropped this hat, which, I believe, was his own hat; I opened it, and there were ten shillings worth of halfpence in papers, but they were broke in the fall; he then begged very hard for mercy, I took him back to Mr. Turner's; Mrs. Turner did not know that she had lost any thing, she looked, and missed two five-shilling papers of halfpence; I secured the prisoner, and took him to the Compter,(produces the halfpence); Mrs. Turner said, in the hearing of the prisoner, that they had been lying upon a shelf behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Turner. The halfpence were rolled up in papers ready for tying, but not tied; when I heard of the robbery, I went to the place where these halfpence were, and missed them immediately, all but three-pence halfpenny, which he had left behind; I have no doubt but they are the same that I lost.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called his father and mother, and four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; upon my going into the shop, I asked Tarratt who was with him; to the best of my belief, he said nobody; I said I was sure he had accomplices, and I would detain him; he denied it; and afterwards, he said, if I would let him go, he would fetch the hat; I asked him who was his father, and he told me; I sent for his father; he told his father that Spikes was with him, and that he had the hat; the father went out, and brought Spikes with him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing at all to encourage them to say what they had done with the hat? - A. I did not; Spikes said he had given the hat to one Slack; Slack was sent for, and acknowledged that he received the hat from Spikes, and said that he had left it at Willis's; I went with Spikes and Tarratt to Marylebone watch-house, and when I returned home, Slack came back with the hat; the officer has had the hat ever since; to the best of my knowledge, it is my hat; I had finished it but half an hour before I went out.</p>
               <p>HENRY LOVITT sworn. - I am an officer: Slack, and the hat, were delivered into my custody at Mr. Fallon's house; I received this hat (producing it) from Tarratt's father.</p>
               <p>Fallon. To the best of my belief and knowledge, this is my hat; there is F marked in the inside; it is the manufacturer's mark; I missed the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that hat? - A.Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what you would charge to a customer for it? - A. It is worth more than that to a customer.</p>
               <p>Tarratt. The prosecutor promised, if we would bring forward the hat, he would forgive us.</p>
               <p>Fallon. To the best of my recollection, I did not, I believe; Mrs. Fallon said they should be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was that? - A. Before the hat was brought back; it was after Tarratt acknowledged that the hat was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had said who had taken it? - A. I cannot charge my memory with that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, except the woman; I do not know much of her: I went with Tarratt and Spikes, on the 16th of July, to Mr. Fallon's; I went to St. Giles's to see for them; I heard that they were there; I found them coming out of a house in Dyot-Street; then we went to a house in Warwick-Street, to have a pot of beer; and then to Mr. Fallon's; Tarratt said, let us go into this shop; I went to buy a hat.</p>
               <p>Q.Had nothing else been said about going into the shop? - A. No; then we all went in; Tarratt asked for a hat; he looked at two or three hats; I staid a quarter of an hour there; I came out first, I thought they were all coming out, and then Spikes came out with a hat in his hand; Spikes gave it to me, and told me to take it to Mrs. Willis's, in Bird-Street, and leave it till he called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you enquire whether he had bought the hat, and paid for it? - A. No, I did not ask any questions at all; I gave Mrs.

               <p>Q. Nor the shop? - A. No; Spikes directed me to it; it is an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you any questions about it? - A. No; I left it, and went home directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you knew of no intention they had in going into this shop? - A. No; Tarratt said he wanted to buy a hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Willis.)</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think he had stole this hat? - A. I did not see him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any notion that he had stolen it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a witness against any body else, this Sessions? - A. No, I was not called up.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of you afterwards? - A. My father was sent for, and he took me to Mr. Fallon's shop, and from there I went to Mrs. Willis's, and asked for the hat that I had left, and Mr. Willis gave it me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the husband when you left it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the man in sight then? - A. He was in sight, he was just going over the hill; I went home and told my mother of it; my father came in just after, and I told him of it, and he went out in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170079"/>persuit of him immediately on her horseback; I saw the prisoner again the next day at the Crown Inn at Stanmore; my father had taken him; I knew him perfectly; I went to the Magistrate, we could not prevail upon him to act, and he got away; the Magistrate said, the constable was gone into another parish about some other business, and the Magistrate's brother was lately dead; I saw no more of the prisoner till he was taken last Friday week; I am sure he is the same man.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman of foursmiles's parish; my box was in Great Wild-Street: On the 30th of July, about a quarter past three, I heard the rattles spring, somewhere near Clare-market; a little time after I heard a rattle in Drury-lane; I then ran to the corner of Steward's-rents, and two men came down from Drury-lane; they ran right against me; and the watchman from Drury-lane after them, springing a rattle.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that Ragan? - A. Yes; one of them said, I think it was the prisoner, I am not sure, but one of them said, d-n his eyes, we will do this fellow; and the prisoner then immediately fired at me, and I received the contents in my neck; I have got here part of the shot that was in the handkerchief round my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he when he fired? - A. At the distance of six or eight yards; he immediately made his escape up Wild-Street towards Queen-Street; I pursued him as near as I possibly could, kept the rattle springing, and crying stop thief; I never lost sight of him till he was taken; I threw a stick at him, which made him stumble, but he did not fall, he recovered himself; two watchmen, and part of the hand of the Duke of York were at the corner; when he came very near them he took a turn, and squatted down underneath a shutter; he was doing so when the two watchmen came up; I told them to take care, for he had a pistol; upon taking him up the pistols lay underneath him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him after he had fired the pistol at you? - A. No, I never had.</p>

             sworn. - I am a milkman; I spent the evening with Kelly and another man, at a friend's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you? - A. As well as I am now, to do any business that I wanted to do, I could walk home very well; when Kelly got into Broad-Street, Bloomsbury, he was taken very ill, and fell down, and I desired his partner Brannon to help him up against the wall, and I would call for a coach; there was no coach upon the stand, and I did not go three yards from him, I just turned round to call a coach, and that was all; I turned back, and then three men came up, one of them was pretending to help him up, and I observed him very busy about his thighs, that was Freak; I then called to Brannon, to take care of Kelly's watch; upon that he put his hand to his watch, and said, that he had no watch; the watchman was coming across towards us, when I took hold of the prisoner, Freak, and gave charge of him; then one of them immediately ran away, and Samuel did not stir, he stood by looking on; a proposal was made to search them, upon that, Freak handed a pair of gloves to Samuel; I really think that Samuel was innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the gloves? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Samuel. Q. Did I not assist in carrying Kelly to the watch-house? - A. I have heard so, I did not see it, I had him upon my back, and carried him to the watch-house; it was mentioned at the watch-house, that he had hold of his legs as I carried him on my back.</p>

             sworn. - I had been with Kelly and Reardon, spending the evening; coming through Broad-street, Kelly was taken ill, whether through liquor I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You had drank liquor enough to satisfy you? - A. Yes; Reardon called a coach; he then called out, take care of Kelly's watch; I directly put my hand down and missed his watch; I had seen his watch in the course of the evening, it was a silver watch, with a steel chain; Reardon then gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170082"/>charge of the prisoners, and we went to the watch-house, and put Kelly to bed; Freak then handed over a pair of gloves to Samuel, the watchman has the gloves.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HEEDITCH sworn. - On the 21st of August, I saw Reardon and his company coming up Broad-Street, very drunk; Kelly fell down, very drunk; there were two or three more that passed them backwards and forwards, I cannot say who they were; the others were a little disguised in liquor, but not so much as Kelly was; I turned round, and saw Kelly taken up by Reardon, I had seen the watch in Kelly's pocket, not a minute before; I saw his hands several times about his thighs; one of his companions says to the other, take care of his watch, upon that the watch was missed; when Kelly got to the watch-house, he was so disguised in liquor, that he could not stand; I desired the constable to search Freak; when he found he was going to be searched, he took out a pair of gloves, and pushed them into Samuel's hands; I took them out of his hands, and found they were gloves; he said nothing in his defence before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Kelly. I know these to be my gloves, by a small hole at the top, and another part that is mended; I am sure I had them in my pocket when I came out.</p>
               <p>Freak. Hebditch took up another man, after he had took us up.</p>

               <p>Hebditch. I took up a man upon the information of a girl of the town, who was drunk; she gave me information of a man that knew where the watch was, and when she came before the Magistrate, the next morning, when she was sober, she denied all that she had owned to me the night before.</p>
               <p>Freak's defence. Mr. Kelly was very bad; I was coming down through Broad-Street, St. Giles's, and saw him against the wall, with his head bleeding; there were, I dare say, ten people round him, besides us.</p>
               <p>Samuel's defence. I was coming through St. Giles's, I had been spending the evening at Mr. Davis's in Broad-Street.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner Samuel.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn. - Samuel left my house alone, at past twelve o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any particular pen to which your attention was drawn? - A. Yes; a pen with fifteen sheep in it; there were amongst them three polewethers; they were marked with a dot on each hip, and a dot between the shoulders; they were ruddle marks; I saw them all in the pen between eleven and twelve on the Sunday night; I then saw

             bring some sheep down towards the next pen to that in which the fifteen were; I saw him open our pen-gate, and turn a sheep out of the pen; it was one of the three pole-wethers that I have mentioned; he put it amongst the others that he had brought down, and then he drove all the sheep back towards one of the empty pens, near St. Bartholomew's-hospital.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he driving them down in a direction from your pen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Christmas, at all? - A. Yes; when Thomas drove the stock towards the other pen, Christmas followed him, and assisted in driving them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that stock, after your polewether had got into it? - A. The two prisoners drove them away; they both helped to drive them right across the market, from Long-lane to Cowlane.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of night was it, when you last saw the two prisoners in that act? - A. Better than half past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got with that stock, in which your pole-wether was? - A. About fourteen or fifteen yards from our pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you many other sheep to attend to that night? - A. Yes; about four hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see your master? - A. Not till about five o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that was given to your master, was any thing done? - A. I shewed my master the remaining two pole-wether sheep that were in the pen, and then I told my master how it was; I took him to the pen where the sheep was, that had been lost; it was Curtis's pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes; they used to work with Curtis, and did then; they are what we call London drovers; they drive for Curtis to the market, and from the market.</p>
               <p>Q.At five in the morning, you took your master to a stock of sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that stock, was there or not, the wether sheep that you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, that you are sure that sheep was the same that you had lost? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; it was a pole-wether sheep.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the mark of which you speak, been altered or not? - A.It had; it was ruddled right across the dots; right across the loins, from hip to hip.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding that alteration of mark, are you able, upon your solemn oath, to say, that that was the same sheep that you lost from your pen? - A. The very same sheep; I have been in the habit of looking after sheep these twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it to you again; are you, upon the solemn oath you have taken, certain that it was the same identical sheep? - A.It was the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what pen was it that you saw this sheep, when you shewed it to your master? - A.Seven or eight pens further from our pen, than the stock were, before they drove them towards our pen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. What was done with the sheep that was so pointed out? - A. My master took the sheep out, and had it locked up at the Bear and Ragged Staff; that was between seven and eight in the morning, and it is there now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have had the care of four hundred sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drove them from the country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a shepherd, but a drover? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We know that a shepherd knows the face of every sheep as well as a man knows his wife's face; but you, as a drover; cannot know the laces of the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the occupation of the prisoners to remove sheep that have strayed from one pen to another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it in the possession of the prisoners in Curtis's pen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Curtis attending there? - A. No; his salesman was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was there before you took this sheep away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the prisoners that they were doing wrong? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had supposed they were stealing it, you would have stopped them? - A. I knew they were doing wrong; I followed them, and saw the sheep safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, in point of fact, you had never lost the sheep at all, you always knew where to find it? - A. They might have taken it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170084"/>Q.But it was not taken away it remained in Curtis's pen till you found it? - A. I found it there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You wished to have an opportunity of letting this sheep go astray, that you might have an opportunity of prosecuting these men? - A. I saw them drive it away.</p>

               <p>Q. But, you know, you might have saved the sheep, and saved this prosecution, if you had told them they were doing wrong? - A. I followed them to see where they went.</p>
               <p>Q.There were no other pole sheep in the market but your master's? - A. Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, don't you know there is a reward for sheep-stealing? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. So this sheep was never lost at all; and you came here to prosecute, in order to get a share of the reward? - A. It was drove away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. You do not know the countenances of the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But I suppose you are pretty well acquainted with the marks of sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you at all account for that cross-line from hip to hip? - A. It was put to blind the mark, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did it or not resemble the mark of any other sheep in that pen where you found this sheep? - A. No, it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gate of the pen, where the fifteen were, was opened, was Mr. Curtis present? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Nobody else? - A. Yes; there was another man just by.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a salesman in Smithfield market: On the 7th of this month, the last witness, Sculthorpe, was in my service, he was employed by me to watch my sheep; I had amongst them three pole wethers, in a pen of fifteen; I came into the market on the Monday morning about five o'clock, when I received some information from Sculthorpe.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information, did you go with him to another pen? - A. I did; and found one of my pole wether sheep; the country mark, before I lost it, was a dot upon the shoulders, and a dot upon each hip; when I found it, it had a fresh ruddle across the loins from the one dot to the other; it appeared so fresh, that it must have been done since the first mark.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time does the market commence? - A. About five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be any transaction of sale, or delivery, at eleven or twelve o'clock at night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did these sheep belong to you, or were you only the agent to sell them? - A.Only the agent.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did they belong to? - A. Mrs. Gilbert.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you never saw this sheep at all till you found it in Curtis's pen? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Though the market does not begin till five, any person might have drove the sheep out of the market between twelve and five? - A. Not unless they give a good account of them, there are so many constables about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you belong to this prosecuting society? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. If a man is seen driving a sheep out of the market before market hours, he would have a good chance of being stopped by the constables? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are answerable for these sheep; and if they are lost, you must pay for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any sheep in Curtis's pen that were marked in the same way that this was? - A. I do not know of any.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

             sworn. - I live within about two hundred yards of Shackle: I knew nothing of this till I was alarmed; I saw the two prisoners, and a boy, pass my house towards Shackle's house, the man was first, the woman followed the man, and the boy afterwards, that was about twelve o'clock on the day of the robbery; the boy had a little bit of a black brush, and a shovel, and a cloth round him, in the description of a chimney-sweeper; some time after that, I heard an alarm, in consequence of which, I went up to the garden of Shackle's house, and from the information I received, I saddled my horse, and went after the prisoners, and in about four or five miles I overtook them; I asked the man what he had got in his bag; he said, what is that to you; and the woman said, directly, what business have you with us; I desired to see the contents of the bag, and he did not seem to be willing I should; I then jumped off my horse, and he opened his bag, and turned out the things; the first thing I saw was a cloth cloak, the next was a silk handkerchief, and two pieces of cheese; the man was putting the things into the bag, when the woman said, give me my cloak and my handkerchief; I told him to put all the things in; she said, she would not go with her breasts open, for it being a hot day, her breasts were quite open; I told her, as she had gone so all day for her own pleasure, she should go so now for mine; the man then went down on his knees, and said, as that was his first offence, he hoped I would let him go; I told him I could not do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promises, or threats, to him? - A. No, I did not; we could not find the boy, we brought them back to Shackle's; when we got into the village, I said to the man, were you ever in this place before; he said, yes; we went a little further, now, says I, shew me the house; he said, that house down the lane, the furthermost house of the two; then I gave them into the constable's possession, and the bag was opened at Shackle's house, and his wife owned the things; they were taken to the Justice's, and committed; the scissars and the penknife the woman pulled out of her pocket before the Justice, she pulled them out herself. (Produces the property).</p>
               <p>Mrs. Shackle. This is my cloak, I know it by a mark upon it; and I know the other things, but there are no marks upon them.</p>

               <p>Ward's defence. The scissars and the penknife were given to me by the boy; I am innocent of it.</p>

             sworn. - Drewee lodged with me, he is a Switzerland man; the prisoner lodged with me two or three months before Drewee, I always found him a very honest man; on Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner in the shop; about twelve o'clock, he had not slept at home on the Saturday night; I had several times given him leave to wear my shoes and boots; on Sunday morning, I saw him with a large pair of shoes on, and a pair of stockings; I asked him how he came by those shoes; he said Drewee had lent them to him, and he went out; when Drewee came back, he missed the property in the indictment; I saw no more of him till Drewee brought him into my house, about ten or eleven o'clock on Monday morning; I don't think he would have done it, but he was in liquor, and he wanted to go to see his sweetheart on Sunday, which made him put these things on; he was so very much in liquor, that he could not tell what he had done with the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much in liquor on the Saturday night, and I asked Drewee to lend me some clean things to go out with; he said, he would; I went up into the room, but could not find him, and I took them; I went out, and spent the day with my friend that I had got intoxicated with, and, as I was coming home on the Sunday evening, I met with a girl that asked me to go home and sleep with her, which I did, and when I got up in the morning, I had got nothing left but the shoes; I told Drewee that I would make him any recompence in my power. (The shoes were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a cabinet-maker, I work with Mr. Platt, No. 29, Greenhill's-rents, I have worked for him five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you are acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to appear as a witness for him? - A. I saw an advertisement in the paper, on Saturday the 13th. (Mr. Knowlys produced the Morning Herald of that day, the witness read the advertisement.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of the persons? - A. To the best of my recollection he is the man; I heard the man say a guinea and a half; the prisoner shook his head, and said, it was too much; and that was all I saw or heard of it; I attended at Bow-street, and the Magistrate said it was of no use to give that evidence there, whatever it might do here.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been in the habits of intimacy with the prisoner? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q.Where had you been that day? - A.To Piccadilly, upon business for my master, I was going home to the shop in Greenhill's-rents.</p>

               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner before? - A.Never.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of him? - A. His dress was remarkable, he had a black waistcoat, and breeches, and stockings, and a light coloured coat, with a velvet collar.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there extraordinary in that? - A. His face was remarkable too.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not stop at all? - A. I did not stop above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you stop at all for? - A.Seeing two men with a trunk, excited my curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. What excited your curiosity? - A. The two men with a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your master take in this paper? - A. No; I saw the paper at the Castle, in Greenhill's-rents.</p>
               <p>Q. Not knowing this man before, and having nothing to excite your attention, you just stopped long enough to hear one may say a guinea and a half, and the other, that it was too much? - A. That was all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the other man dress? - A. In a dark-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the trunk-maker's? - A. I do not know the trunk-maker's.</p>

            : On the 18th of the present month, I went into that part of the cellar, in which we had formed a stove for drying sugar; I there observed a tub full of raw sugar, covered with a sheer of brown paper; knowing it to be an improper situation for the sugar, I knew there was something wrong, it was a sort of sugar that we do not use for drying; after I came up, I observed the prisoner go there almost instantly, he continued there for half an hour; when he came up again, he was sent into the lamp-room to paper a few loaves; I then went down a second time, and observed, that a considerable quantity of sugar had been taken out of that tub; he was then going home, and had got several yards from our premises, when the other witness and I secured him and brought him back; we took him into the place from whence he had taken the sugar; he denied having any knowledge of the sugar that was missing, till it was felt through the trowsers; I then went for the constable; I felt the sugar under his stockings myself; I am certain, that which remained in the tub, and that which was found upon him, was exactly the same sugar.</p>

            : On Thursday the 18th of the present month, between seven and eight o'clock, in consequence of suspicions that had been entertained, I stopped him about eight or nine yards from our door; I brought him back, he denied having taken the sugar, and denied having any till it was found upon him; I saw it found, there were twenty-one pounds taken from him; I compared the sugars, and they were exactly alike; from the appearance of it I believe it to be our sugar, but I cannot swear to it; I asked the prisoner if that was the way he served his masters every evening; he said, no, he did not do it above twice a week, sometimes he did not do it above once a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw the coat at Staines? - A. Yes; and I saw it when my master got out at Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it, that you can positively speak to having last seen three great coats? - A. At the watering house at Turnham-green.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrole and an extra constable of Castle-Baynard ward: As I was going towards Paul's Chain, I observed three men with a parcel; I followed them to the corner of Carter-lane, and there they stopped to examine it; I put my hand upon my sword, and said, don't stir, for if you do, I will cut you down; they then threw down the great coat, and all ran away; I called out, stop thief, and he was taken by a gentleman; I came up, and took him to the watch-house; I am sure the prisoner was one of them, I saw them distinctly when they were examining the coat; they all three had the coat between them, facing the Horn Tavern; Mr. Reynolds is out of town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When a man draws a sword upon an unarmed man, is it unnatural that he should run away? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing his face? - A. Half a minute; I was in a great flurry.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you mean to swear positively to the prisoner? - A. That is the man, I am positive; I had the lamp over me; he was dressed in a blue coat, a striped waistcoat, a round that hat, and a dark-coloured apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in half a minute, you being flurried, and with a sword in your hand, mean to swear, that that is the man? - A. That is the man, I was close to them when they dropped the coat; I saw the chaise come past, and I saw them coming from the Chaise.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you observe the dress of the other two? - A. Yes; there was one, with his back towards me, wore a long brown surtout coat; I did not see his waistcoat, nor his face, expect the moment that I came up, and then he turned his face away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Could you swear to his face, do you think? - A. Yes, I could; the other man was dressed in a blue surtout coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see his face too? - A. Yes, I saw all three of their faces; I should know them all, if I saw them.</p>
               <p>- HATERD sworn. - I am a constable of Castle Baynard ward, (produces the coat); I received it from Mr. Copper's maid; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. This is the same coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is a common driving great coat; is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Falkner. This is the same coat, I know it by the straps, the buttons, and the collar; and I have had it in my hands so often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it not a common drab-coloured great coat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not two Mr. Reynolds's acquaintances of your master's? - A. Yes; they are brothers.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never see the other Mr. Reynolds in a drab great coat? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Going along Carter-lane, I heard some men talking very loud, and I stopped, out of curiosity, to hear what they were talking about, and the patrole came up, and said, he would knock them down, if they attempted to run away; they directly ran away, and a gentleman caught hold of me, instead of one of those men.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- DEWELL sworn. - I am a painter in William-street, Bridwell Precinct: The prisoner left his work on the Tuesday night, between six and seven o'clock; he has worked for me three months, and always conducted himself with honestly, as far as I know.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Hoby, pawnbroker, in Holborn; here is a pin, that it is said I bought of Moore, but I do not recollect whether I bought it of him or a woman.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Elliott.) Look first at the articles found in Moore's box? - A.This pair of tops of ear-rings, the prisoner Moore had in his custody, from me, to repair the other parts of ear-rings; the two fronts of pins, and the heads of pins are all struck from punches of mine, and such as he used in working for me; here is the ring found on his person; the front of this ring is struck from a punch that was never in the possession of the prisoner, but has always been in my custody, he could not get at it without opening a place that he had no right to do, because it was in a locked up place in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the articles found at Cuff's? - A. One pair of ear-rings is struck with a punch of mine, and the others are struck from the punches that were found in the necessary; the seal-key I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170100"/>cannot say any thing to; these three pins are struck from punches in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Pybus access to you at that time at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Except that article of which you say you kept the punch locked up, all the rest might have been manufactured for his own private use, and with his own gold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish articles so made from those which he made for you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Mr. Elliott.) Q. Have I not sold you gold during my apprenticeship, which I have purchased of my friends? - A. I believe once; he applied to me to make a ring for his uncle, and I cannot say but I might, in return for making that ring; I do not recollect that I ever did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Moore left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you made them over to him? - A. No, to another gentleman; it was a bill of sale to Mr. Palmer for fifteen pounds, but I never received any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Palmer? - A. I don't know, he is a lawyer, I believe, and as soon as the paper was made out, I was to have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. I don't know, Mr. Watson knows, they both pretented to be my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the bill of sale dated, the 21st or 22d of July, I lost my goods upon the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. What has the woman prisoner to do with it? - A. The woman him upon the road, and assisted in moving the goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they to be sold? - A. No. Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where is your husband? - A. In Guy's-hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Your poor husband don't know anything of this prosecution? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.You helped to pack up these goods for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire the prisoner to take the goods to Wellclose-Square, in order that it might not be discovered where you were going; and from there to the West end of the town, and from thence to Plumber's-row? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never apply to get any body pressed? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never applied to get your husband pressed? - A.No; I was advised to get him to sea, to try if it would do him any good; he was out of his element when he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the prisoner spent almost all his time with you, in the absence of your husband? - A. No, he has not.</p>

               <p>JOHN BLANCARN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a tide-surveyor: On the 22d of August, between six and seven in the morning, the prisoner came on board the ship from shore, went forward into the galley, came out again with a cleaver in his hand, and said he was going to grind it for the steward of the ship, and he was to have a bottle of arrack for so doing; he got into a lighter; I asked him what he had got before him; he said, nothing at all, only the cleaver; I insisted on his coming on board again, to let me see: when he came on board I was endeavouring to feel what he had before him, and he resisted my searching him; however I did search him, and found a bag of pepper under his frock, at his left-hand side; I delivered him to Mr. Timbrell, the commanding officer; and the pepper, to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When he was on board, the hatchways were all shut down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you never stopped a man smuggling goods on shore, who has told you that he had nothing? - A. It is a common thing, he said, he had it from a black man; the blacks were all called upon deck, and he was desired to pick him out, but he did not chuse it.(John Shrimpton, the officer, produced the pepper).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was impossible for me to have stolen any pepper; I gave a black man some tobacco for it; I thought it was his own property.</p>

               <p>THOMAS DICKINSON sworn. - I am a messenger belonging to the Police-office, Worship-Street: I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of July; I met the prisoner in Norton-Salgate; I asked him if he knew Mr. Hodge, he said, he did not; while I was talking to him, I observed this pistol in his pocket; I took him into a shop, and searched him; I found upon him some counterfeit money, a tobacco-stopper, and a snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Hodge. I lost a pair of pistols, but I cannot say that this is one of them; the snuff-box, I know to be mine, I have had it ten years; it is mended with a piece of putty at the top.</p>

             sworn. - I went to fetch the bed, and paid half-a-guinea for it; that is all that I know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence to the following effect:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. My husband has left me with two helpless infants, I believe he is pressed into the King's service, I have not heard of him since he has been gone. In order to support my children, I went to live as a servant in Cnarlotte-Street, Fitzroy-Square; after that, I went to live in the family of a Jew; their method I found would not suit me, and I quitted that situation in the first week, and the day I quitted, I saw the prosecutor selling greens at the corner of Denmark-Street; I enquired if she could inform me where I could get a lodging; she said, she would accommodate me with half of her bed; I slept with her that night; she had but one room, and in the morning she introduced three men into the room to me, and they over-persuaded me to send for gin; I was over-persuaded to drink, till I was so intoxicated as not to be able to know what I was doing, and they treated me as their brutal design led them; two or three days before she charged me with this offence, she introduced one

                  Thomas 
                  Jones
               <interp inst="t18000917-131-person1219" type="surname" value="Jones"/>

             to me, and he made me intoxicated again; and being deprived of my money and clothes, I was over-persuaded to fetch a broker, and sell the goods, for money to get more liquor; I believe he was in the room, or the adjoining room, when the broker was dealing for the bed; the price was half-a-guinea, and half a pint of gin, Jones, myself, and another woman, drank the half pint of gin; the half-guinea was changed, gin sent for, and the broker's man partook of both; the other woman in the house bought some giblets, and some more liquor, with the money that was received for the bed; then they left me in that miserable and intoxicated state; and when I became a little sensible, and saw my wretched situation, and reflected upon my conduct, in order to replace the bed, I went to a pawnbroker's to pledge some things of my own, when she had me taken up. I solemnly declare, as I believe there is a God above, that I never robbed or defrauded any one; and if I had not been intoxicated with liquor I should not have done as I did. I therefore trust this honourable Court will exercise as much mercy as the circumstances of the case will permit; the prosecutrix has had her bed returned, and her expences paid; she is a married woman, and her husband is abroad.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Grotage.) Q. Have you a husband? - A. No; my husband has been dead these eight years, he died in Well-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any truth in this story of men being introduced to her? - A. I was not at home from Sunday morning till Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Dunbar. Mrs. Grotage's own account was, that she went out on purpose for her to have her sweethearts there, that she might get her some money.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday, the 29th of August, about half past six in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, and said he wanted to buy a pair of breeches; my people were busy, and I came into the warehouse myself; he tried three pair on; he then asked me to shew him a waistcoat; I turned my back to open the drawers to shew him a waistcoat, and heard the breeches move on the counter; I turned round and saw him put these breeches, which I have in my hand, into his breeches; I shewed him a waistcoat; he asked the price, I told him a guinea and a half for the waistcoat and breeches; he bid me twenty-two shillings; I told him I could not take that money, and I let him go down stairs; I was afraid to challenge him in the warehouse, because I was alone; I let him come down, and then collared him; but instead of his resisting, as I expected, he ran back into the shop unbuttoned his breeches, took my breeches out, and threw them down; I then sent for a constable, but the constable not coming, and there being a stand of coaches opposite my door, I called a coach, and a neighbour went with me in the coach with the prisoner to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I came down stairs Mr. Gore laid hold of me, and called his wife out; he overhauled my breeches, and pulled them down over my knees; he found nothing there; then he said to his wife, they must be somewhere behind the counter, and there they found them; I never had the property at all.</p>

             sworn. - I drive a barrow in the street: A gentleman bought sixpennyworth of pears of me, and put them in his pocket-handkerchief; he wanted change for a seven-shilling piece, and I went with him down Holborn to get change, till I got to this gentleman's door: he had got the prisoner in hold, and a mob round him; he sent for a constable, and then he unbuttoned his small-clothes just within-side the door; I am sure the prisoner was never in the street at all; he was coming towards the door when the gentleman made a prisoner of him; he pulled down his small-clothes, and found nothing about him; he got no constable; I and then a boy picked up the breeches by the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Be sure you swear that which is true - Are you sure you saw the gentleman unbutton his small-clothes? - A. Yes, and found nothing; I know nothing of the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here? - A. His wife and three children were coming down past my barrow the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his wife? - A. No; the children were crying, and I asked her what was the matter, she told me she was going to the gentleman's house that took the prisoner, and I told her that I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q.What brought you here? - A. I was summoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your summons with you? - A. No; I never was before a Judge and Jury before.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gore.) Where did he throw the breeches? - A. Just by the door, on the left-hand side, my boy picked them up; I saw the prisoner throw them out of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you laid hold of him? - A. Outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It is true that you unbuttoned his small cloaths in the shop, and found nothing upon him? - A. It is not true, he unbuttoned them himself, and threw the breeches out.</p>

               <p>The Hon. Spencer Percival. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. In this case, I am of counsel for the prosecution, and you will find that your attention will be directed in the trial of this indictment, to a very interesting and extremely important case; of the importance of it, you must be already apprized by the opening of the indictment, which discloses that it charges the prisoner with a capital offence. Gentlemen, I feel myself fully justified in saying, that in the decision of this case, and in your attention to it, you will feel great anxiety and concern, because, in the part that I have had to discharge, and a very inferior part, in such a duty as this, I have felt very considerable anxiety and concern, for, Gentlemen, I have felt it to be my duty, and an extremely painful duty, I can assure you, to advise this prosecution to be carried to this length against the gentleman who now stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Thomas, the prisoner at the bar, is an attorney, in Northamptonshire, a gentleman of very excellent character, excepting in this transaction, in which I say he is implicated in very gross fraud. Gentlemen, he is a man of very considerable fortune, as I understand, independent of his professional pursuits; he is a gentleman for whom I see here, from my personal acquaintance with the country of Northampton, many excellent persons attending to testify to his good character; I have, by a letter from the member for that county, received the most ample testimony to that character, furnished under circumstances which render it impossible for him to attend here, on account of his public duty, in endeavouring to suppress those riots which are disgracing that part of the country as well as others. These peculiar circumstances, in the situation of the county, at this time, though they may not have prevented him from the benefit of many respectable witnesses, yet, as they may possibly exclude him from more than I am acquainted with, leads me to think it a duty which I owe to the prisoner, to state in the outset, that I do really believe you may conscientiously come to a decision upon this case, with your prejudices strongly in favour of the prisoner at the bar; leading you to believe, that from his situation in life, leading you to believe, that from his circumstances and his property, leading you to believe, that from his general character, he is as unlikely a person to have been guilty of this or any other felonious fraud as any that could possibly have been brought before you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having said thus much in justice to the prisoner, I must say a little in justice to the prosecution, and if there is any blame in bringing this gentleman to trial, under these circumstances, it is a blame that I wish to let you and the public know should not fall, and should not rest any where but with those, who having had all the materials laid before them, have thought it their public duty to bring it to this issue.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The case against Mr. Thomas is a charge for uttering a variety of acquittances and receipts, for the purpose, we say, of defrauding his Majesty. A person of the name of Collinridge, who died in 1798, was a public accomptant, and a person employed under the Navy Board, to convert timber for the purposes of the Navy; he had been in that situation several years, and when he died, in 1798; there was a charge against him of 11, 535l. 16s. 1d. a sum of money entrusted to him for the public service for some years back, of which he had rendered no account; it was therefore thought expedient to issue an extent upon the property, not that it was supposed, perhaps, that the whole of this sum, or any large part of it, would ultimately be found to be the balance against the deceased; but, however, the public, not knowing to what extent that balance might reach, made their claim, and under that extent, the real and personal property of Mr. Collinridge was sold, the personal property was sold for something between four and 500l. and the real estate produced upwards of 100l. a year. At this time, the prisoner, who was an attorney in that neighbourhood, wrote to a gentleman in the Navy Office, that he was employed by the executors of Mr. Collinridge, for the purpose of settling and adjusting this account, between them and the Navy Board; he stated, that he had got all Mr. Collinridge's papers, that he had got the rough draft of the account, but not being well acquainted with the matter, found great difficulty in settling this complicated account, and therefore prayed to have the best assistance that this gentleman, under the Navy Board, could give him. This letter was laid before the Navy Board, and Mr. Thomas, not having an answer so soon as he expected, wrote a second letter, which we have notice to produce, and which unquestionably we shall produce. Upon the face of these letters, there is certainly nothing but what appears perfectly right, fair, and consistent with the character of a person intending to do justice. It does, indeed, appear a slight circumstance, that in these letters, the prisoner represents himself to be employed by the executors, and in a subsequent letter, he says, that he did it for the creditors. These letters were laid before the Navy Board, and were, in the due course of office, sent by them to the Solicitor for the Navy Board, for him to give a proper answer; Mr. Bicknell, Solicitor for the Board, accordingly returned an answer to Mr. Thomas, representing to him, that he apprehended, as he had found a rough draft of the account, it would not be involved in that difficulty, that he imagin ed, because, from that rough draft, if it was supported by vouchers, the balance would be easily ascertained; but Mr. Bicknell did undoubtedly give Mr. Thomas to understand, that it was absolutely necessary that he should produce vouchers for the sums that he insisted should be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170114"/>set off. In consequence of this, it will appear that the prisoner undertook the transaction; that he procured vouchers; represented that he had found some vouchers already signed, and procured others to be signed that were due, and transmitted them to the Navy Board, and upon that account it appeared, that instead of a balance against Mr. Collinridge, there was a balance of 1200l. in favour of the deceased's estate against the Navy Board. Gentlemen, this was not expected, and it was, perhaps, the first circumstance that rendered it material to look into it; they were therefore put into a course of examination, and the person employed after Mr. Collinridge, in the same situation in the country, was a person that the Navy Board conceived most capable of procuring useful information, and therefore the account and vouchers were sent into the country to Mr. Boddy, for the purpose of examining their accuracy; upon Mr. Boddy's enquiring into the state of these accounts; the result of it, which he discovered in a very short time after he was employed in this way, was, that he found some of the receipts forged for money that had never been paid, and for work that had never been done; the discovery of this fact, though certainly in the first instance, not to a very great extent, made it necessary to take up the business in a very serious light. Gentlemen, you will find that the prisoner came to Mr. Boddy several times, with great anxiety to expedite the settlement of these accounts, for the purpose of releasing the estates; Mr. Boddy told him he found the accounts very wrong; he told him that he had discovered these forgeries; upon this the prisoner, at the bar, appeared, as I understand the witnesses will say, extremely agitated; such an appearance, I am ready to admit, may be consistent with innocence, because, if a man is charged with a serious offence, it is no wonder that he should feel great anxiety; but, however, in consequence of this, he told Mr. Boddy, that if that was the case, he would give up the balance, he would undertake on the part of the executors that the balance should be given up, and if the Commissioners of the Navy would consent to refund what they had received upon the sale of the personal effects, and remove the extent, that they would give up this balance of twelve hundred and odd pounds.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen. The person who was employed in the country, feeling the great difficulty in which he was involved, in getting accurate information, thought it not inexpedient that such a proposition should be forwarded to the Commissioners; and, therefore, at the request of Mr. Thomas, he wrote to the Commissioners, adopting a letter dictated by Mr. Thomas, the draft of which we have to produce. Gentlemen, this offer the Commissioners did not think proper to accept, and Mr. Thomas, understanding that they did not think proper to accept it, made a more extensive offer; he offered to give up the whole of the demand, and let the Commissioners of the Navy do what they pleased. Gentlemen, if this was a transaction in which Mr. Thomas was concerned for his own interest, in which Mr. Thomas was claiming this balance of 1200l. for himself, in which Mr. Thomas was concerned for his own interest, in endeavouring to procure the release of this estate from the extent and the return of the four hundred and odd pounds for which the personal estate was sold, it might have been a matter of Mr. Thomas's direction to say, I will give this up, that I may not be harrassed with any further proceedings; but this was not Mr. Thomas's money, but money that he was employed to collect for others, for the purpose of making the estate of this gentleman solvent, and to discharge his debts; it does; therefore, seem rather an extraordinary conduct on the part of Mr. Thomas, that rather than the enquiry should be proceeded in, he should be desirous of giving up the whole demand. However, these repeated offers were not thought proper to be accepted, it therefore seemed expedient to have a warrant issued to take Mr. Thomas into custody, and he was brought to town for examination; this was as long ago as October, 1799. In the course of this examination, Mr. Thomas presented a memorial to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and Navy. At that time, the case did not seem to me for the purposes of public justice at all, in a state in which either, with regard to the interests of the prisoner, or the public, it was ripe for trial, and therefore I did, and I hope I did nothing wrong in so doing, I am sure nothing harsh towards Mr. Thomas, in consenting on the part of the Navy Board, that Mr. Thomas should be let out upon bail; this was in October, 1799.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It is now necessary to state to you the contents of this memorial; he states, that after the extent had issued, the executors were so alarmed, and so disinclined to embark in the trouble of enquiring into these accounts, that they determined to have nothing to do with the effects, and relinquished their trusts in consequence of it; and that he was employed by the creditors in endeavouring to liquidate the accounts. He then states, that he had been told by Mr. Bicknell, by letter, that it was necessary for him to procure vouchers, in order to make good his demand against the public, which was to be set off. He says, in consequence of the above letter, your petitioner's clerk examined into the papers for vouchers, many of which were found in a loose state in the box, and some others, for small sums, appeared to have marks to them; and your petitioner then believing, and still believing that those sums had been paid, and were really due; and the said Adams representing to your petitioner, that Mr. Collinridge in his life-time had occasionally procured receipts for monies paid to be attested afterwards; and your petitioner placing such confidence in said Adams's representation, requested him to attest some of them, which he did without the most distant idea of fraud or intention of imposition. He then states the case of his apprehension, and of the forged mark of a man of the name of Onan, who is represented as not having been capable of writing, and whose signature is attested by persons of the name of Adams and Bigxby.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with a view to that, he says, that he learned from Adams, that Mr. Collinridge was in the habit of obtaining attestations to the marks of persons subsequent to the period of their making that mark, and finding that that was the habit of Mr. Collinridge, he adopted it, but without any intention of fraud on his part; this showed great inaccuracy, great impropriety, and great neglect, in the manner of that gentleman settling his affairs; and it did not appear to me, that if it could be made out, in fact, that this mark of 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1377">Wm. Onan</persName>
             had been put in Mr. Collinridge's life-time, he, perhaps, having forged it himself; that Mr. Thomas having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170115"/>procured another person to attest, as if he had seen it done, that that was the mark of the man; however strongly this might lead to fraud, yet, that it would not come up to the charge of uttering an instrument, knowing it to be forged, against Mr. Thomas; and, therefore, the enquiry that I thought important to be made, was to know how far we could, or not, support that part of the assertion contained in the memorial; we made enquiries, and whether it was owing to a great number of persons being creditors, or whether it was from the affection that the people in that neighbourhood have for the character of this respectable gentleman, I know not, but there was considerable difficulty in procuring any intelligence; it then became a question, not being able to prove that these receipts were not so found among Mr. Collinridge's papers, whether it would be proper that this prosecution should be instituted, in the exercise, perhaps, of a very bad direction, I thought it should not, and as soon as I so felt, I thought it proper to give Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1378">Thomas</persName>
             the earliest intelligence, that it was not the intention of the Navy Board to prosecute him; I had hardly given this pleasing information to Mr. Thomas, when we procured intelligence of extreme importance, which will be laid before you in evidence, namely, that the receipts, with the mark of

            , which are represented in this memorial to be found ready marked among the papers of Mr. Collinridge, were receipts not so found, but receipts drawn up by the amanuensis of Mr. Thomas, subsequent to the period at which they were purported to be drawn. We had, at the same time, procured the means of showing the hand-writing of Mr. Thomas, himself, to a forged receipt, which did away, as appeared to me, the defence that was set up for him; it appeared to me, therefore, to be my duty to give Mr.

Under these circumstances it is now brought before you.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, The only William Clarke that we can find in that neighbourhood, is a wheelwright; and the receipt purports to be for wheelwright's work; we have made all the enquiry possible, and the result is, that no money had ever been paid; that there was none due; nor any work done by him for Mr. Collinridge, at all, subsequent to the year 1788; and that for nineteen years past, the whole amount of work done, by him, for Mr. Collinridge, was no more than 1l. 19s. The forgery of this acquittance will, therefore, be proved; the concern of the prisoner, with the receipt, will be made out, in his own hand-writing, for money which was never paid, and which was, in point of fact, never due.

               <p>Gentlemen, The next cases are those of Sanders, in which there is this particular and important circumstance: Sanders undoubtedly had been employed by Mr. Collinridge, and had been paid by Mr. Collinridge, and, therefore, there was no impropriety, as far as I conceive, in Mr. Thomas procuring from Sanders, vouchers for money actually due; he applied, therefore, to Sanders, and told him, he found in the accounts of the deceased, some sums of money that had been paid by Mr. Collinridge to him, for which there were no vouchers; Sanders said, he had no demand upon the estate, but if it was so, and others had done the same, he would; he accordingly signed several of these receipts; he found, however, that he had signed one or two receipts of the year 1796, and, upon looking at them, he says to Mr. Thomas, this cannot be right, because I was out of the country in 1796, and, therefore, these receipts I ought not to sign; upon which, Mr. Thomas said, if that was the case, he should sign no more, yet there are, in this account, and charged in this indictment, no less than four receipts of the year 1796, purporting to be signed by this very Sanders, who will tell you, they are not in his hand-writing. If they were receipts that Sanders had signed, Mr. Thomas being afterwards apprized that they could not constitute just items in the account; if Mr. Thomas had not forgot what was due to his own character, and to justice, he would never have presented those receipts; it is for Mr. Thomas to account for that circumstance; if they are signed by Sanders, to be sure, it is no forgery-it is nothing but a gross fraud; but if they are not signed by Sanders, it is both fraud and forgery of the grossest kind.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There are other receipts of a person of the name of

            , and he will tell you, it is not his handwriting; that if it is meant for him, he has not signed it, and it is a forgery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There are other cases, which I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170116"/>know that it will be necessary for me to state to you of charges for money not due, for money that has not been paid, and supported and confirmed by false vouchers.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, under these circumstances, it appears necessary to say a few words, and a very few words more. With regard to the nature of making up these vouchers, I should certainly think, that if Mr. Thomas had got persons, who had been paid, and whose receipts had been lost, to sign vouchers for money actually due, that there could be no possible blame rest upon him for endeavouring to obtain accurate vouchers for payments that had actually been made; but, though Mr. Thomas might believe that these sums were so actually due from the public, no man can doubt that the obtaining a false signature, would amount to the crime of forgery, but if he has obtained vouchers for money not due, and from persons, whose names they do not bear, it is a complication of fraud and forgery together.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, What Mr. Thomas's motive could have been for doing this, is beyond my reach, - an adequate motive for the commission of any crime can never exist; the motives which do influence persons to commit crimes, operate different ways-they may operate upon some minds, and not upon others; but I am afraid, it is too true, that whenever the fraud, intended to be practised, is to operate, either by taking money from the public, or with-holding money from the public, that there is a greater facility in the commission of it, than there is when the fraud is to operate against any of our neighbours. When Mr. Thomas was asked if he had any demand upon the estate, he said, he had none; whether any client of his had mortgages upon the estate which had been extented, I know not; whether from good-nature to the numerous creditors of Mr. Collinridge, he was so far blinded as to think it fit to execute such frauds as these, I am perfectly unable to say, but the fact is done; and if Mr. Thomas has wilfully and knowingly uttered these receipts, upon which there can be no question that they were forged, there can be no doubt that he is guilty of the charge laid in this indictment.</p>

Yates's (who are gentlemen of character and fortune). have desired me to apply to you on the subject, to know what they had best do in the business, not wishing to bring themselves into any difficulties, but, at the same time, desirous of doing ample justice to his creditors, if any thing should be left after the Crown is satisfied. The books and papers of the late Mr. Collinridge are brought to my house, and, on looking over them, I find a rough account in his own hand-writing, made up to May 1797; but, as myself, or the executors, cannot possibly undertake to make out the accounts (not understanding the business), and as they wish to give up every thing they have found, for the information and satisfaction of the Honorable Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy, in order to make out the accounts in the best manner possible, I will either bring the whole up to town to lay them before the Honorable Board, unless they rather choose to send some person down to inspect and settle them. The sooner something is done in this business, the better, as expences will be continually incurring on the extent, and I am to request the favor of your early answer, which will very much oblige the executors, and,</p>

The subject on which I address you, is respecting the late Mr. Collinridge, of Potters-pury, who, a little previous to his death, made his will, and appointed two gentlemen, for whom I am concerned, his executors in trust, for the purposes therein-mentioned. I am further to inform you, that immediately after the corpse was interred at Potterspury, an extent, at the suit of the Crown for 11, 500l. and upwards, was entered against all his property, being monies advanced by the Navy-office, on account of his employment in Whittlewood and Salcey Forests, since his last settlement with them in the year 1791. As it is impossible for the executors, or myself, to settle his accounts with the Board, they wish for the favor of your advice and assistance, how they had best act, in order to get the accounts settled, as they wish to shew forth every document in their possession, to enable the Board to make out the accounts in the best manner possible. Mr. Wife. of Potters-pury, advised me to write to you on this subject, as he supposed you must know more of the late Mr. Collinridge's accounts, than any other person.

I have found a great many vouchers for monies paid by the late Mr. Collinridge for various sorts of work for the navy business and as a great number more will be wanted to be signed by the several persons who give been employed and paid by the late Mr. Collinridge, who as kept an account thereof in his books, I presume (from your letter) such receipts must be obtained before the accounts can be passed I will endeavor to make out the accounts in the best manner  I can, and send them to the Commissioners as soon as posibile, and hope they will make allowance for any error</p>
               <p>I may make therein, being a stranger to the business, but by the executors to do the best I can, that some* may be obtained with the Board, in order to enable them to judge what will be coming to his creditors, which are very numerous.

I hope to be able, in a short time, to bring the late Mr. Collinridge's accounts to London, for the purpose of settling the same with the Commissoners of the Navy-office. I have had an infinite deal of trouble to obtain the necessary vouchers of the many different persons employed by the deceased who were dispersed in various parts of the kingdom, which, Mr. Bicknell informed me. would be absolutely required, before any thing could be settled with the Commissioners.

I have (through Mr. Bicknell, the Solicitor) delivered the accounts and vouchers to Mr. Hartwell, and I do, on behalf of the executors and creditors of the deceased, most humbly request the favour of your Honors to oder the accounts to be examined, as soon as possible, in order that the extent, issued at the instance of your Honors against the effects of the deceased, which are all in mortgage to different persons, may be taken off. The effects of the deceased sold under the extent, according to the accounts I have received from the auctioneers employed therein, were as follows:</p>
               <p>At Potters-pury, by the sheriff of North. l. s. d. amptonshire - - - - - - - 176 14 2</p>
               <p>At Hooknorton, by the sheriff of Ox. fordshire - - - - - - - - 141 1 0</p>
               <p>At Wigginston, by ditto - - - - 31 9 0</p>
               <p>And at Adderbury, by ditto - - - 182 4 3</p>
               <p>Total - 531 8 5</p>
               <p>This sum, your Honors will please to give credit for in the account, and I am sorry to say, the effects sold at a very great loss to the estate of the deceased. As the late Mr. Collinridge has died very much in debt to a great many poor carters, who he hired to carry the timber to Oxford, and they are now in the greatest distress and continuously pressing upon the executors for their monies, or a part thereof, but as the accounts are unsettled, and the extent still remains upon the deceased's estates, the executors cannot proceed to make any sale, a dividend among the creditors, until the accounts with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170118"/>your Honors are first settled and adjusted. As the excent swept off all the personal property of the deceased, immediately after his funeral, the executors have not even the mean of repaying themselves the money they are obliged to pay to the undertaker on that account. I shall be very glad to receive your Honors instructions and directions what to do for the best for the general creditors of the deceased, for whom I act under the direction of the executors, who are gentlemen of property, and very little known to the deceased, and are very desirous of doing what is just and right.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. How long was it after the death of Mr. Collinridge, before this letter of the 28th May, 1798 (in which Mr. Thomas states the impossibility of settling the accounts, and his readiness to put the accounts into the hands of the Navy Board) was written? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Thomas? - A. All my life-time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are of the same profession? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, have had an opportunity of seeing his conduct as a professional man, and as a private man? - A. Yes; I have transacted business with him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, no doubt, had an opportunity of seeing the estimation in which he has been held by others? - A. He bears a universal good character; no man in the profession need with for a better.</p>
               <p>Q. From an acquaintance with his character, do you think a large pecuniary sum would induce him to commit a fraud? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it happens to be within your knowledge, that he has to-day surrendered himself to take his trial upon this capital charge? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. You are solicitor for the Navy-office? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In the early part of 1799, did you see Mr. Thomas at your house in Norfolk-street? - A. I did. Q. Did he ever deliver to you any accounts, as vouchers? - A. He brought a book of accounts, and a parcel tied up, which parcel I did not open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver them to you as the vouchers for that account? - A. He delivered them to me as accounts to be delivered to the Commissioner of the Navy; the next day I carried them to the Navy-office, and delivered them to Mr. Hartwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hartwell the proper officer for their examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Thomas express to you the purpose for which he delivered them to you? - A. He expressed a desire that somebody else should be appointed by the board to settle them; I told him that could not be done, he must make out the accounts himself, and if he could, from the papers that he had found; I likewise told him he must produce vouchers for the payments, or else they would not be allowed; he called once or twice upon me afterwards, and I told him the accounts were in a course of investigation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. When you told him he must make out the accounts himself, had you seen those accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It contains a great variety of items for small sums, digging a saw-pit here, greasing wheels there, and an infinity of articles, and not kept with any degree of accuracy? - A. The book was tendered to me after the prosecution commenced, but I never looked into it.</p>
               <p>Q. In those conversations which you had with Mr. Thomas, long before any prosecution was thought of, did he not represent that the account was almost an impracticable one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That there were a great number of vouchers, some signed, and some not, some with marks, and some with names? - A. Yes, to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q.And wished the Navy-board would take it into their own hands? - A. Yes. Q.Among those vouchers there are several hundred receipts? - A. I cannot say, there were a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the amount in value of those, upon which this indictment is framed? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampicr. About eighty or ninety pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you know that Mr. Thomas was neither an executor nor a creditor, under Mr. Collinridge's will? - A. No. Q. Have you any reason to know that he has no pecuniary interest up to the extent of one shilling, or one penny in making up the account of Mr. Collinridge against the Navy-board larger than the truth? - A. I do not know that he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any more interest in the subject to your knowledge, than yourself, or any other respectable solicitor? - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been in that situation? - A.Three years last May.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 6th of June, 1799, did you receive from the Navy Board this account book? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you reside at that time? - A.At Potter's-pury; after I had received that book, I received the vouchers.</p>
               <p>Q.The vouchers that you received, you afterwards gave to Mr. Knight? - A. I sent them to the Board.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the same vouchers? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards? - A. I did; he came to my house, and enquired whether I could give him any information when it would be settled, and I told him I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards again? - A. He came to my house several times; I shewed him a copy of the book, and the receipts, and I told him the consequences appeared to me alarming; says I, I have found a man that was not in the country during that time, and that he could write his name; that was 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1425">Wm. Onan</persName>
            ; I told him, I had shewn him the receipt; he seemed rather alarmed, put his hands together, and said, if I would write to the Board, he would do any thing that they wished; he said, there was twelve hundred and odd pounds, I think, due from the Board, and he would give that up; he sat down in my room, and wrote a copy for me to write to the Board.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. This is the copy that he wrote; I saw him write it; I took out what I thought necessary, and wrote to the Board.(The copy read)." Honorable Sirs,</p>
               <p>In consequence of your letters to me, desiring me to make enquiry into the state of the accounts of the late Mr. Collinridge, I have been with several of the persons stated in the accounts, and find many errors therein. Mr. Thomas, of Brackley, attorney for the executors, hearing of my being employed to look into the account, and on my apprising him of there being many errors and mistakes therein, and for the sake of settling the business, made a proposal to give up to your Honors the balance which, by account, appeared due from your Honors to the executors, and to request your Honors to give up to the executors the monies the goods sold for, and release the extent upon the several houses and estates of the deceased, which were mortgaged for very nearly their worth, and some for more than their worth; which proposal, if your Honors chuse to adopt, I think it will be bringing the business to a conclusion in the best way that I can think of, as it will be impossible for me to find out the true state of all the charges that ought to be made upon your Honors."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that conversation again? - A. He came to my house some time after, and asked me whether I had had any letter from the Board, and I told him, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, or did he know, that you had sent a letter according to that copy? - A. I told him that I had; he then said, I am willing to give up to their Honors the estates and lands to do as they please with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any further conversation pass between you? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect any thing at any other time? - A. Whenever Mr. Thomas has come to my house, the conversation has been in the same manner, when I thought it would be finished, and whether the Board would accept it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him what the result of your enquiries were? - A. I saw that there were things and vouchers there that I thought Government ought not to be charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew the prisoner your mode of keeping accounts? - A. I did; and he said, he thought it was exceedingly well; he said, there was none like unto that in Mr. Collinridge's accounts; he said, it was all in a confused state, as he had received it, to the best of my recollection; he said, he had got some rough accounts, that he had gathered what he could from, and that there was no book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. There was a box full of loose accounts, some importing to be vouchers, some bills, some receipts; in short, a confused mass? - A. Very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, before Mr. Collinridge's death, you offered to assist him in his accounts? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Collinridge had been a shipwright in Deptford-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before his death had you applied to him to offer your assistance to make up his accounts? - A. Five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of the business, do you not think that it was impossible for any man, but himself, to make out the accounts? - A. I never saw his accounts; he was requested by the Board to give me all the assistance he could, but he never would let me fee any of his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon all these occasions he was very anxious to have the accounts settled? - A. Yes; after he had applied to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Mr. Thomas is an attorney of great respectability, and doing a great deal of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no time to do this himself, and he employed to make out these accounts as well as you could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And for that purpose, he put into your possession, as far as you know, all the papers of Mr. Collinridge? - A. I believe, every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. They consist of loose memorandums for work done, some receipts signed, some unsigned, and a variety of other matters? - A. Just so; there were some papers with dates, and some without.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the papers handed to you, were there some receipts which imported to be for payment made, which were figured? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there others which imported to be receipts for business done for the Navy Board, not yet signed, but ready to be signed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from those documents you made out vouchers; for instance, when you found 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1432">Wm. Hall</persName>
             for digging a saw-pit, though there was no voucher, you entered that in your book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you looked for corresponding receipts? - A. Yes; there was a great number of receipts that I found signed.</p>
               <p>Q. In many other instance, did you find receipts made out, corresponding with your charge, but not yet signed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath that you have taken, did not Mr. Thomas desire you to make out the account as accurately as you could, but, above all, to make it justify, and to charge nothing that you did not see a voucher for? - A. Mr. Thomas always desired me to make out a just account, to the best of my abilities, between both parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the smallest intimation to charge a single farthing against Government, for which you did not find charges? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, making out that account, charge a single farthing against Government, that you did not think conscientiously you had a right to do from the papers of Mr. Collinridge? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, as far as you could collect from the papers of Mr. Colinridge, make just allowances to Government? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Thomas, upon all occasions, when he talked to you about the account, tell you to charge fairly and justify? - A. He always desired me to do that that was right.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it happens to you to know, that it was Mr. Collinridge's course, instead of taking every Saturday a receipt for eighteen shillings, seven shillings, three shillings, and so on, from the different people, to get them together at different<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170123"/>periods, and take vouchers in the lump? - A. I have understood so from his workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. But in point of fact you found many papers that appeared to be prepared for that object? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you make one single voucher ready for signature, for which you did not find a charge in Mr. Collinridge's papers? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Do you mean to say, that every receipt you made, you found a charge for? - A. Every one.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, of your own knowledge, that a great number of those memorandums from which you made your vouchers, are actually destroyed? - A. They are, a great of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not make out your account in a room appropriated for that purpose, and in which the children of that unfortunate gentleman, and the children of a Mr. Jones were frequently playing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there was a charge of

             for filling up saw-pits, when you had taken that from a loose paper, did you store it up? - A. No, I frequently laid it a side, thinking it was done with.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know that those children played with them, and made thread papers of them? - A. Yes; I have seen them playing with papers, and have taken them away, and given them other slips that I thought were of no use, they had access to the room as much when I was not there, as when I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, have you any doubt that a great number of Mr. Collinridge's papers were destroyed in the manner in which you have described? - A. I have not the smallest doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, that after you had made out your book account, and had got together such unsigned prepared receipts as were found in the papers of Mr. Collinridge, and had made out other to correspond with the demands, that public notice was given to a persons who had done work for Mr. Collinridge to assemble at a public-house to sign voucher? - A. I know there was an appontment made for them to meet there.</p>
               <p>Q. And made publickly known to the whole country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after you had compleated your work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival. Q. Did Mr. Thomas know that these papers wre upon to the access of these children to destroy? - A. Yes, he knew they were there, he was in the next room, in his own office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he aware of the careless way in which you kept those papers, which were the only documents for the books that you were making out? - A. He knew that they were in the room, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he knew they were lying about in that careless way? - A. He must have known it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take occasion to tell Mr. Thomas of the children taking these papers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, Of your own knowledge, that there was a great many destroyed? - A. I knew that there were a great many gone somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them destroy a single one? - A. I do not know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that some of these papers are destroyed and missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those papers destroyed immidiately after the account was delivered in, or lately? - A. None lately, none since Mr. Thomas has been prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr.Thomas has looked for those papers? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know of Mr. Thomas's bringing those papers to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Thomas that there were some of them lost? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you found out that some of them had been destroyed? - A. Since I have been in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been in London upon this trial? - A. No, I had been in London before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was is that you looked over the accounts in London? - A. It was the first time that I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A. At Mr. Thomas's agent's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after Mr. Thomas had been before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Mr. Thomas presented his memorial to the Lords of the Admiralty? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you remember Mr. Thomas coming over to you at Potters-pury, in the winter of 1798? - A. I remember his coming over, but I cannot say when it was; it is about a year and a half, or two years ago; he sent for me to the Rein-deer; he asked me whether I had done such and such work, I said, yes; I did do such work, but what it came to, I could not tell; he said he was likely to settle the business of Mr. Collinridge.</p>

Because I know very well that I was in London at work at the time they were dated; for I signed one of that date before I was aware, that was in the year 1796; and then I refused to sign any more, because as I was in London at the time, I knew it could not be right.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, if it should appear to the Court and Jury that I have done any thing wrong in this matter, I am the most unfortunate of human beings. I was called upon, by Mr. Collinridge, to make his will: after his death, it was necessary that his account with the Navy-board should be adjusted; it appeared to me next to impossible that it could be done; I was desired to do it as well as I was able; I had neither leisure nor ability to do it; I employed an accomptant, and the papers and vouchers were made out by him in the best manner he could; I had no suspicion there was any thing wrong; I had no interest in the subject, I had no indictment to do any things amiss; I have transmitted business to a large amount, for persons of the highest respectability, to whose voluntary and kind testimony to my intregity, I have the satisfaction to appeal with confidence; in October last, I had the first intimation, that a charge of a serious nature was made against me; I have, since that, been many months at large upon bail, always ready to meet any charge that might be brought forward; I have now submitted myself to the justice of my country, in the humble confidence that they will not take away a life valueable to myself, more valuable to my family, for an offence from which, if I had committed it, I could not have benefited one shilling, and for which I hope the whole tenor of my life proves I could have no inducement.</p>
