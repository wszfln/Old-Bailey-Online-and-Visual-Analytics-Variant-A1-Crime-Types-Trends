The Deceas'd sat down by the Prisoner, and gave her a Dram, and she gave each of us a Pear, and then she got up and stood against the Wall, just by where Andrews was sitting upon his Seat at work - he makes Leather-Clogs. The Deceas'd went to her, and said, My dear, I'll have a Kiss. And in a Minute or two, he flew back, and cry'd, O Lord! O Lord! I'm stabb'd ! He had a Loin of Mutton in his Lap, I took it from him, and saw that he was wounded in the Thigh. I did not see any Knife in her Hand, but a Knife drop'd from her side upon Mr. Andrews's Seat, and it was bloody. There was no Quarrel betwixt them, nor one Word of Anger, nor did the Deceas'd offer any Rudeness to her; he only said he would kiss her, but did not kiss her then, tho' he had kiss'd her before when she sat in the Chair.</p>

He had kiss'd her before she got up, but there was no Anger, nor struggling upon that Account, for she liked it well enough.

               <p>Mr. Kersey, Surgeon. The Wound enter'd the upper Part of the Thigh, a little below the Groin, and divided the crural Artery, so that the Wound was Mortal; for the Deceas'd lost so much Blood, that it was impossible to save his Life. I said to the Prisoner, Was it not barbarous to stab the Man thus? And she answered, Tho' I did stab him, it was but in jest. I reply'd, You will not much care to be hang'd for your Jest. Who heard me say that I stabb'd him? Says she. Why I did, you impudent Jade, says I. I have heard that she and two or three more Women like her self used to resort to Hornsey-Lane.</p>

I gave him a push and bid him stand away, and some how he run against the Knife, and I did not know he was wounded 'till he cry'd out.</p>

She died on the 8th of August, about 11 at Night.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Petersham to London; I paid the Turnpike at Putney-gate, and as I was going over the Bridge, about the middle of it, a Knife Grinder set down his Barrow, at which the Horse started, and had like to have thrown me over the Rails into the Thames; and then he ran forward with such force, that the Fulham Turnpike keeper perceiving it, he threw open the Gate for fear I should fall upon the Spikes. My Horse got the Bitt out of his Mouth, so that I could not manage him. I call'd to the Woman to get out of the way; and told her I could not stop the Horse. And if I gave him a Cut or two it was to prevent his running against a Post.</p>

            . I keep a Brandy-shop at the End of Gloucester-Court in White-Cross-street. On the 23d of July between 6 and 7 in the Morning, the Prisoner came to my Shop for a Dram. The Woman had something ty'd up in a Handkerchief, and desir'd me to let her leave it a little while in my Shop, and let Nobody but her have it. So she put it upon the head of a Cask, and they both went away together; the Man came again by himself, in half an Hour, and wanted the Bundle. No, says I, the Woman bid me deliver it to Nobody but herself. Well, says he, then take care of it and don't let her have it except I come with her, for there is something of Value in it. Something of Value? Says I, Then it can never belong to her, for she thinks herself rich when she's worth a Bushel of Cinders - You must know she's a Cinder-Wench - It's no matter for that, says he, there is a Salver Taster in it. So I opens the Handkerchief, and there was a Parcel of Rabbit-skins, a Brass-candlestick, and this Silver-cup. Is this your Taster? Says I, 'tis a good sizeable one! By and by in comes the Woman, and I charges a Constable with them. And upon enquiring I found out the Prosecutor; I had never seen Edesbury before, but the Woman had been several times at my Shop.</p>

               <p>Court. It seems you were taken up together.</p>
               <p>Edesbury. That's true to be sure; but I never had the least acquaintance with her till that Morning when I happen'd to see her at the Fire - I was drinking at the Woolpack in Petticoat-Inn till 12 at Night, with others of the Craft - The gentle Craft, my Lord; and there was a Prize-shoe to be shewn, and after that I went to see one of my Shop-mates home to St. Martin's lane; and in coming back I saw this Woman at the Fire with these Things in her Apron. You Bitch you, says I, what have you got in your Lap? She said it was something she had found, and then she ask'd where Tom Gilpin was -</p>

            ? You said you had never seen her before, how came she then to know that you were acquainted with Tom Gilpin?</p>
               <p>Edesbury. That's well observed indeed, my Lord - I believe I over-run my self a little there - I have but a bad memory, for I forgot the main Article - Yes, I had seen her before, for I and my Shop-mate and Tom Gilpin, coming from Petticoat-lane, met this Creature in Cheapside and pick'd her up; Tom asked her to go to Drury-lane, and she agreed to it: But there she dropt me, and my Shop-mate went along with Tom; and so I and my Shop mate went to St. Martin's-lane together; and as I came back I met this Bitch at the Fire, and ask'd her what she had got in her Apron, and so she came to ask me where Tom Gilpin was; You Bitch, says I, You have must reason to know where he is, for you were with him last. And then she and I went through Temple Bar into Fleet-street, and turn'd down Chancery-lane, and so came to Fetter lane, and then to Shoe-lane, and down Harp-Alley to Fleet-ditch, and up Fleet-lane to the Old-Baily, and cross Newgate-street to Giltspur-street, and through Pye-Corner into Smithfield, and so to Long-lane, and cross Aldersgate-street to Barbican, and then down Red-Cross-street, and up White-Cross-street to Jemmit's Brandy-shop; and there we drank together, and she left the Things and then we parted.</p>
               <p>Court. But you thought fit to call there and demand the Bundle, as if you had aright to it; and it seems you knew there was something of value in it.</p>
               <p>Jemmit again. When the Constable came, Edesbury said, for Christ's sake be favourable, or I shall be hang'd for these Things; and he own'd they were taken at the Fire.</p>
               <p>Edesbury. I said I believ'd she had stole them there - And has for her part she got drunk, and gave Jemmit a slap of the Chops as she was going into Newgate.</p>

            , Do you know him? And he answered, Yes; he lives at Paddington. When we came to the End of the Field, the same Man started out upon West, from behind a Hedge, and said, Damn your Blood! your Money! He took 3 s. 6 d. from West, then he robb'd me, and my Daughter, and Mrs. With. He took my Hat and Cap, a muslin Hood, an Apron, two Handkerchiefs, and 18 d. and after that he went again to West, and made him pull out his Buckles. It was then between 9 and 10, but nearer 10 than 9 I think the Prisoner is the Man, for I took pretty good notice of him; he had a light Wig on, and he was new shaved. He was taken next Morning, and I believe he had on the same white Frock that he has now, and had when he robb'd us.</p>

A Man came by us, and said, Good Night, Ladies; Good Night, Neighbour. As soon as he was gone, some of us said to West, Who is that, John? and he said, I believe I know him; but I can't call to mind his Name. When we came to the End of the Field, which was within two Fields of our own home; the same Man bolted out from a Bush; Lord bless me! says my Mother. The Man came up to John, and said, Damn your Blood, your Money. Then he robb'd John, and afterwards robb'd us. He took from me a Leghorn Hat, a Cap and Topknot, a muslin Apron, and two Handkerchiefs. It was between 9 and 10 at Night, but nearer 10 than 9. He was in a white fustian Frock, with metal Buttons, and a white Wig; and to the best of my Knowledge the Prisoner is the same Man. We found him the next Morning a Mowing at Paddington, and he had then on a white Frock and metal Buttons; but I am not sure it is the same, for I thought it look'd cleaner.</p>

Yes; says he, but I can't remember his Name. He robb'd John first, clapping a Pistol to his Breast, and then me, and the other two Women. He took from me a Hat, a Cap, two Handkerchiefs, an Apron, a Callimanco-Gown, and 3 s. 6 d. and afterwards he went to John again, and made him pull out his Buckles. When he got what he could, he bid us go on, and said he would leave our Clothes in the Field.

I live at Paddington; I went out on Saturday Morning to take a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110009"/> Walk as usual, and coming home, the Landlord of the Green-man said to me, Lord, Sir! there is a Man at our House charged with a Robbery, and we have no Warrant nor Constable to take him up. Phoo, says I, any one may take a Felon without a Warrant. So I went in and said to these Witnesses, 'Tis a sad thing to swear away a Man's Life; and therefore I'd have you be very cautious - Are you sure that this is the Man? And they all said they were positive.</p>

On the 2d of August, about Noon, I went to see the Men stand in the Pillory, in Broad-street by Carnaby-Market, after which I staid with some Friends in Carnaby-street, till between 8 and 9; and then I went by the Prisoner's House, in Bell-Lane, in Mary-bone Parish, and he was at the Door; it was then within a few Minutes of 9 a Clock, and his House is two Miles from Kilburn. He's a labouring Man, and his Character has been pretty good latterly, but about a Year ago he was Servant to one Smith, a Horse-Courser, who run away.</p>

He bought one, and in an Hour afterwards came for another. Here's a Hat would do for you now, says I, but it's none of mine, it was brought to be dress'd; and so I shew'd him the Hat that Lucas left. Why this is one of the Hats that I have lost, says the Captain. Is it? says I, then I can help you to the Man I had it from. And so I took Lucas at a House he frequented in Wells-street</p>

Then Newell struck a Light, and lighting a Candle in a dark Lanthorn, he gave it to Martin, who went in at the Window, but came out again presently, and said he heard a Woman speak to a Child. Upon this I pull'd off my Shoes and crept in, and brought out 2 Coats, 2 Petticoats, 3 Hats, a silver Watch, a pair of silver Buckles, some Linen, and other Things. My Wife sold the Watch for 36s. I kept 12s. for my own Share, and gave the Prisoners 12s. a-piece. Martin allow'd 4s. 6d. for the Buckles, he reckoned 18 d. for his own Share, and gave us 18 d. a-piece.

            . I have Lodgings at Mr. James Bowden's. The Prisoner was directed to me by Mr. De Costa, and came to my Lodgings on Sunday the 18th of August, about 4 in the Afternoon. He brought a Letter, in which he said he had received a Bill of Exchange on Mr. Vassalli, and desired me to inform him where Mr. Vassalli lived, that he might direct to him. I told him I would enquire. He came again on Monday, and I went with him to Mr. Welford, who gave him Directions. He came a third time on Wednesday Morning, and desired me to let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110012"/> him write a Letter in my Room. I told him he might have been furnish'd with Pens, and Ink, and Paper at his own Lodgings, which was in Cecil-Court, near St. Martin's-Lane; but if he chose to write in my Room he might. And so he sat down at my Desk and began his Letter. My Desk was open, for I had just been writing there my self; and I had left 17 Guineas, 3 Crown pieces, and some Shillings in one of the Drawers. Before he had done, he desired me to help him to a Glass of Water. I went down and brought a Glass: and he was still writing. When he had finish'd his Letter, he directed it to Mr. Vassalli, and then I shut my Desk, and we both went to Dinner to Mr. Angelis, where we staid till evening; and then went again to my Lodgings, where I found Mr. Costa waiting for me. We all 3 went up into my Room, I open'd my Drawer, and mist my Money. Mr. Costa perceiving some alteration in my countenance, asked me what was the matter, I said I have lost 15 Guineas and 10 s. But I know and can swear who has it - For while my Desk was open, there was Nobody left in the Room but the Prisoner - I added, I'll take the Law, and have satisfaction. The Prisoner turned pale. I went down to ask Mr. Bowden's Advice what I had best to do. The Prisoner and Mr. Costa quickly follow'd me. I asked the Prisoner to stay, but he would not; and so we all went to the Prisoner's Lodgings. And while I was knocking at the Door, he ran down St. Martin's-Lane, and by the Church, I follow'd, and cry'd Stop Thief! And as he was running, he put his Hand in his Pocket and threw the Money upon the Pavement, for I saw the motion of his Hand, and heard the Money fall. He was stopt soon after, though he made great resistance in the mean time. The mob picked up the Money, and a Sharper coming by and claiming it, they gave it to him. When the Prisoner was carried before the Justice, he said I lent him the Money, and being ask'd why he ran away, He answer'd that I assaulted him with a Knife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not ask for Water till after I had done my Letter, and you lock'd the Desk, and took the Key before you went down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tadie. No, I left it open.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Why did you run from your own Door, and throw the Money away?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. After the Prosecutor had complain'd of his Loss, I said to Mr. Costa Let us go, or we shall be imputed. And when I came to my own Door, I was assaulted in the dark by 3 Men, who demanded my Money; and therefore I run.</p>
               <p>Court. But why did you throw the Money away?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took it out of my Pocket in order to save it, but in the Fray it dropt out of my Hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Costa. I waited in the Evening for Mr. Tadie at Mr. Bowden's, who said he had not seen him since Noon. While we were talking, Mr. Tadie and the Prisoner came, and we all 3 went up into Mr. Tadie's Room. He open'd his Desk and pull'd out his Drawers; upon which he look'd very uneasy, and gave himself a knock of the Pate, - What have you lost any Money? says I, Yes, by God, says he, but I know by God who has got it, and I'll see the end on't. But he did not name any body then, though he told me the next Day.</p>

               <p>Court. Did not Tadie say, that Nobody was left in the Room but the Prisoner while the Desk was open?</p>
               <p>Tadie. No, I told de Costa that I knew who had it, but I did not name the Person at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Costa. While Mr. Tadie went down to Mr. Burden, the Prisoner turn'd his back to me, fumbled in his Pocket, to shift his Money as I thought, and he dropt a Guinea, or some such piece of Gold; I stoop'd to reach it, but he took it up himself - When we came to the Prisoner's Door, Mr. Tadie knock'd, and then the Prisoner ran away, and Mr. Tadie after him; but I staid at the Door - The Prisoner was a stranger, and had been but 2 or 3 Days in England.</p>

I heard a cry of stop Thief, and ran to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110013"/> Door with a Candle, and found some Money lying on the steps: What's the matter? Says I, a Gentleman has been robb'd, says one, What Gentleman? Says I. This Gentleman, says another, and pointed to a stranger who was very well drest in a light Suit and Ruffles. So I pick'd up some Gold, and gave it to that stranger, and others did the like. I was going to take up a Guinea and a half more, but my Mistress came and bid me not touch anymore; and so I kick'd it towards the stranger, and bid him take it up himself. Then I went in; but hearing a fresh Noise, I stept to the Door again, and Mr. Tadie had got hold of the Prisoner. What, says I, was it you that was robb'd? Yes, Why here has been a Stranger that has taken all the Money - The Prisoner struck those about him with his Cane, and in the scuffle the Cane was lost.</p>

            . We met at Slaughter's House to agree the Matter up. Says the Prosecutor to Slaughter, Why do you encourage an informing Rogue (meaning the Prisoner) in your House? Do you intend to turn Informer too? For the Prisoner had laid an Information before the Commissioners against the Prosecutor. - Says I to Smith, I'd have you make the Matter up, for Knot is a very honest Man, I have known him fourteen Years. Why, says Smith, you don't know what a Rogue he is; I have been too favourable to him, I could have hang'd him, if I had sworn the Door was lock'd when he rob'd me; but now it can be only Transportation. I saved his Life once before, when he went to hang himself; for his Sister found him swinging, and set up such a damn'd Squaul of Fire and Murder, that I run up in a surprize. He began to keck, and I, like a Sot as was, cut him down, and his damn'd Clum-foot came thump upon the Floor. - I ask'd his Sister about this, and she said she knew nothing of it - The Prosecutor at last offered to make it up, if the Prisoner would pay half the Money that was due on the Information. But the Prisoner would not agree to it.</p>

I stood waiting and looking for his return; till I saw a Man coming into the Field, and supposing it might be my Husband I turned about and went forward slowly. I had not gone far before I was overtaken by two Men in light Colour'd Stockings. They past by me without speaking. I was afraid they were Thieves, because of their white Stockings - For it seems white Stockings is a mighty Fashion among Thieves - One of these Men was the Prisoner. They walked a little before me, and coming into a small puddle of Water, the Prisoner offer'd me his Hand. I thank'd him, and so we went on to the End of the Field; where the path divides in two; one goes to a Gate, and one to the Gap. I went towards the Gate, and they the other way: But presently they turn'd towards me - And one of them, not the Prisoner, came up and said, What Money have you got young Woman? I told him none. Upon which he pull'd a Pistol out of his Pocket, and took away my Bundle, and gave it to the Prisoner. Then he took off my Cloak and Apron, and put his Hand down my Bosom; and asked if I had got any thing there. I said - No - Don't frighten me, for I am with Child, Damn your blood, says he, stand still and I won't hurt you - The Prisoner at the same laid his Hand upon my Shoulder, and ask'd me why I made such a Noise, and said they would do me no Harm, if I would be quiet. Then the other took my Ring off, and ask'd me again what Money I had in my Pocket; I said a little; and was going to take it out, but he thrust his Hand in and broke my Pocket off. There was 5 s. a Cypher-ring, and my Wedding-Ring, and some other Things in my Pocket. I begg'd them to return me my Wedding-ring, and promised to send them twice the value of it to any Place that they would appoint, and never complain of them. But they jump'd over the Ditch and went off with that and the rest of the Things - The Prisoner had dark Clothes, white Stockings, and a blue Linsey Woolsey Apron. I turn'd back and met my Husband about the middle of the Field, and told him how I had been robb'd.</p>

             was coming from Hamersmith towards London, we were attack'd by 2 Men near Holland walk by Kensington. It was a Moon light Morning, and I believe the Prisoner both by his Person and Voice was one of them. He came up and to me asked what Money I had. I told him but little, upon which he curst me, and presenting a Pistol, said, Deliver directly, or I'll shoot your Brains out. I gave him a Shilling which was all the Money I had, and then he made me strip off my Coat and Waistcoat, which he took away. My Violin was in my lining of my Coat, and was Pawn'd by the Prisoner's Wife to John Gay who was my Acquaintance, and told me of it.</p>
               <p>John Gay. The Prisoner's Wife brought this Fiddle to me on the 2d of August. I took it in because Towle had told me that he had been robb'd of a Fiddle, and I was in hopes it might be his, though the name was scratch'd out. She said she had it of her Husband, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110016"/> he own'd it and said he bought it at Rag-Fair.

For my part: was pretty easy, for I had nothing to lose; but the Prisoner took a Shilling from Towle, and was going away, but was so kind as to turn again and ease him of his Coat and Waistcoat and Fiddle - The Prisoner had a shabby Coat and a Crape Hatband.</p>

               <p>Thomas Taylor. My House was broke open on the 5th of May, between 1 and 2 in the Morning, and my Goods taken away.

               <p>William Ward. I live in William Newman's House, where the Prisoner had work'd a Week; I miss'd the Money in my Chest on Friday Afternoon. I suspected the Prisoner, and charg'd him with taking it. He at first deny'd, but afterwards confess'd it; and pull'd part of it out of his Pocket. He said he had laid out the rest, which was 4 l. in buying a Horse, and some Clothes at Watford; tho' it was then but 7 Hours since he stole it. I found 7 l. 13 s. upon him, and I got the Money again for the Horse, but 36 s. was quite lost.</p>

               <p>Jackson. I found him at a Brandy-shop 3 Hours after the Exchange, as he call'd it, and ask'd him where my Hat was? He answered, Damn it, I have none of it. I carry'd him before Justice Manly, but not having my Witnesses there, he was discharged. And after that, he was gone, I don't know where, for above a Year, and I took him as soon as I cou'd - I heard that he offer'd to sell the Hat - But I have no Witnesses here that can prove it. <rs id="t17340911-42-verdict202" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Edward Mason. On the 5th of August, between 2 and 3 in the Morning, I happen'd to be in Liquor, and as I was going along Fleet-street, I was pick'd up by what we may call - not a Woman, I suppose - but - a Mistress of the Town, and I was taken into Sword and Hanging-Alley, or Hanging and Sword Alley, or some such a cramp sort of a Place.</p>
               <p>Court. What happen'd after you were carry'd into this Alley?</p>
               <p>Mason. Carry'd? - No, have a care of that, I was not so drunk as that came to neither - I was not carried - I walk'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110019"/> or as a Body may say, I was conducted, by this Woman, as I took her to be; but I can't be positive what she was, Because I did not examine her, and I would not swear to a Thing that I was not sure of.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it either of the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Mason. No; no, it was none of the Prisoners - But I was conducted up into a Room where I found the Prisoners. We had 2 or 3 Quarterns of Cherry-brandy, and other Liquors to the Quantity of 2 or 3 Shillings. Then they persuaded me to go to Bed, because they saw me in Liquor; and so I began to strip, and in the first Place the Shoes - Aye, I suppose the Shoes must come off first; and then to be sure the Breeches must come next, and the Breeches I laid upon the Table, and then -</p>
               <p>Court. You went to Bed?</p>
               <p>Mason. No; I don't suppose I went to Bed - But I was making Preparations to go to Bed, and so far is right. And when I had laid my Breeches upon the Table, the Prisoner, Betty Cook, snatches them up, and runs down Stairs with them. I cry'd out, Stop Thief ! my Breeches! my Breeches! she has got my Breeches, and all that I have - And indeed it was all that I had at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. All that you had?</p>
               <p>Mason. That is, all that I had in my Breeches, when my Breeches were off - Take me right - I don't say t'other and all - No, no - that was all safe.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Mason. My Watch, and two half Guineas, and 30 s. may I believe I could swear to a Guinea more, for I had 4 or 5 l. not long before I met the Woman, and I had been in no other Company that Night.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you get fuddled?</p>
               <p>Mason. At the Tavern along with some Friends.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you were in Company?</p>
               <p>Mason. Yes; in Company with Men, but with none of the other female Sex, that was what I meant, for I was not so drunk as not to know one from t'other - I left my Friends at a Tavern upon Fleet-street-hill, and at several other Places, and I had my Money and Watch then, and that was not much above half an Hour before I lost my Breeches</p>
               <p>Court. Did you follow the Prisoner Cook when she went away with your Breeches?</p>
               <p>Mason. No; the other Prisoner Bartlett bolted the Door, and would not let me run after my Breeches.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the Bolt within side the Room where you were?</p>
               <p>Mason. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. And could not you open it then?</p>
               <p>Mason. I might have done to, but if I had where should I have found my Breeches?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever get your Breeches again?</p>
               <p>Mason. Yes? a Man brought them to me afterwards, but there was nothing in them except this Rule.</p>
               <p>Court. When you were so drunk as you say, could you take so much notice of Cook as to know her again, and especially as you had been such a little while in her Company?</p>
               <p>Mason. Yes; for I'll tell you what - It's just like as when a Man was frighted, his Senses strike quicker than ordinary at such a Time.</p>

No; but you took my Breeche that I'll swear, and I was not over and above drunk neither, for I remember that you were brought out of the Bed, and had no Stockings on, because as I have heard since, you were famous for slight of Hand - And I found you again, about a 11 a Clock, the same Morning, with the Watch upon you - No, that's a Mistake, for you were upon the Watch.</p>

I went and thither and found her upon a Bed. As soon as we came in, I perceived her take something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110020"/> off the Bed, and put it in a Chair, and then she sat down upon it. She desired us to go out a little, because she wanted to make some necessary Occasion. You Saucy Toad, says I, get up! and then we found the Prosecutor's Watch under her. I carry'd her to the Bull-Head, and there she was so outrageous, that she swore, and damn'd, and broke all the Windows, and we were forced to send for a pair of Handcuffs from the Compter, before we could manage her - At last she offered the Prosecutor 18 s. to make the Matter up.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. On Sunday Night between 9 and 10, I met with some Company, and went to drink with them at a House in Newtoner's-Lane, where I left my Watch-case for the Reckoning, and then going out I met with the Prisoner and three more. They ask'd me to drink, and said it should cost me nothing. So they pull'd me into a Gin-shop; I ask'd what was to pay, for they promis'd to treat me. I did not expect they would. They said there was a Crown to pay. I found I was got into ill Company, and therefore pull'd out my Watch, in order to secure it; but the Prisoner snatched it out of my Hand, and ran away. I follow'd her, but could not catch her. Indeed I met with her next Day, and took her up with a Warrant, but I never got the Watch again.</p>

As I pass'd by him, he said, You have serv'd me with a Summons from the Baron, but I am not oblig'd to take notice of it - I went to my Seat, and coming down to go to the filing Chest, near the Office Door; He said, I am going to Tunbridge, and must have some Money. I answer'd, I believe you'll be mistaken - You have impos'd upon the Court, and the Baron has been inform'd of it. God damn you, says he, You lie! What do you mean by that? says I. I tell you, says he again, God damn you, you lie! I told him it was like his Irish Manners. If I was to be born again, says he, I would chuse to be born in Ireland, for I never was asham'd of my Country, and damn you you dare not go out of the Office. I reply'd that I did not fear him or any Gentleman. He struck me on the Breast, and afterwards taking hold of the small End of his Whip, he struck me a violent Blow over the Eye, with the Butt End. I was confin'd under the Surgeon's Hands for near two Months, and it appearing that my Life was not out of Danger, the Baron committed him to Newgate - My Eye is still painful to me at times, and I find a decay in my Sight when I apply closely to reading or writing - Mr. Halpen indicted me before my

Mr. Hawkins said, It's not Gentleman like; but it's like your Irish Manners. Mr. Halpen dared him to go out of the Office, to which he answer'd, that he was willing to meet any one. Then there was a Scuffle between them, but I can't tell who begun first, for I heard Blows before I saw any. I think the first Blow that I saw, was receiv'd by Mr. Hawkins on the Breast, and Blows were repeated - The first Blow that was offered was given by Mr. Halpen; but there was a little Scuffle before that - By a Scuffle I mean a rushing in upon one another - I cannot justly charge my Memory whether the Scuffle was before that Blow or not - I am sure there was no Scuffle before.</p>

            , Surgeon. On the 30th of June I was sent for to the Mitre Tavern, to dress a Wound on Mr. Hawkins's Right-eye - The Wound was made with a bruising Instrument.

               <p>Mr. Holloway. No; but he went to Bloomsbury on Monday, for which I reprimanded him - I should not have given him leave to have gone abroad in less than a Week or ten Days - I believe that he's perfectly recover'd, I don't apprehend that his Eye is weaker than before.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rawlins. On Saturday about 6 in the Afternoon, Mr. Halpen came into the Office. I was then sitting at Mr. Oliphant's Seat, which is three Seats from Mr. Hawkins's - Mr. Hawkins came in, and to the best of my Remembrance, he gave the first Blow - I was near them and in a convenient Place for seeing what was done - They were both in an upright Position, walking down the Office. Mr. Hawkins went foremost, and turning short, near the Door, he took Mr. Halpen by the Arm to shove him out. This was the first that I saw, and there could not be a Blow with out my seeing; for my Eye was stedfastly upon them all the time. Mr. Halpen was talking first with me, and Mr. Hawkins came in and interrupted him - I saw Mr. Halpen give Mr. Hawkins several Blows, but none on the Breast. Mr. Hawkins struck Mr. Halpen in the Face with his Fist, and then they closed. I saw all the Blows that were given - The Blow on the Eye was after some struggle.</p>

               <p>The Admirable Electuary.</p>
               <p>WHICH infallibly cures all Degrees and Symptons of the Secret Disease, with more Ease, Speed, and safety, than any Medicine yet publish'd. Any old running, tho' of several Years standing, whether occasion'd by an Overstrain, Weakness of the Seminals, or the Relique of a former infection, is certainly cured in a short Time, without a Minute's Consinement, Suspicion, or the Use of Astringents; being a Medicine so wonderfully pleasant and easy in its Operation, that the nicest Palate, or weakest Constitution, may take it with Delight. Two Pots are generally sufficient to compleat a Cure in most Cases. To be had (with Directions at large) only of the Author Dr. CAM, a Graduate Physician, who has publish'd it 30 Years, and is constantly to be advised with, at his House at the Golden Ball in Bow Church-yard, Cheapside, at half a Guinea the Pot.</p>
               <p>N.B. Since nothing is more requisite, in the Cure of any Distemper, than for a Patient to have free Access to his Physician; therefore beware of buying Medicines at Toyshops, Booksellers Shops, &amp;c. the Authors of which are always conceal'd, and not to be spoke with on ony Occasion: And tho' by their specious Pretences you are promised a cheap Cure, youl'll certainly find it very dear in the End.</p>
