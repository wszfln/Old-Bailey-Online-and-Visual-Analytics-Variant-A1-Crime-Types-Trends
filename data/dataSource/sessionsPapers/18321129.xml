            . I belong to the Foreign Post-office, and lodge at Mr. Duncan's, who lives in the house himself; we both enter at one door; I have a key of the street door, as I am often out late. On Friday, the 20th of October, I went out about a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, and came home between one and a quarter-past, having been absent about an hour; when I went out Mr. Duncan and his family were all at home; I had the key of the street door, and am sure the lock sprung when I went out - on returning I opened the door with my key; I had no light - I was bolting the top bolt of the door, and the passage being newly painted, I was obliged to turn my face from the door - I perceived on the newly painted wainscot a shade, and it turned out to be the shade of the prisoner; I said "What the devil do you do here?" then another man ran down the passage, and put his hand over my mouth - I stood with my back to the door; the other afterwards made his escape - I held the prisoner tight, and got him outside the door; I put my leg out to throw the other man down, which I did nearly, and the prisoner got out of my hand - I pursued him closely; he was never out of my sight - the watchman seized him: I am certain he is the same man, for I never lost sight of him for a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How did you leave the door when you went out? A. On the spring lock, and I locked it fast - nobody could open it without a key; I found it shut, on the spring, when I returned, but not locked - several persons live in the house; I am the only one who has a key - the party must have got in by a false-key.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I was requested to attend to his house on Monday, the 15th of October, and about five o'clock in the afternoon, just as my little girl came home from school, a young man dressed in a flannel jacket and a pair of light coloured trousers, was at Mr. Goldsworthy's door - he knocked at the door; I pushed up my kitchen window, and asked him who he wanted - he asked me for the name of Andrews; I said no such person lived there, and he asked me if there were any lodgers - I said no, the family had the house to themselves, and they were not at home; I saw a person next morning at Lambeth-street office, and think he was the same man, but I cannot positively say - he only knocked once at the door, and when I told him there was nobody there, he went away: about half an hour after that there was another knock, and I opened the window again, and saw another man, a tallish man, dressed in dark clothes, and he asked me for the name of Drew - I was very agitated, and left the window without answering him, as I knew my servant was shutting the parlour window, and she answered him- I shut my kitchen window down; I had not a good sight of that person, but he had a dark dress, and was a very dark looking man - the prisoner Taylor appears to me to be the first man whom I saw - he appears to be the very same young man who asked for Andrews, but I cannot positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. This was a little after five o'clock? A. Yes - the child generlly leaves school at five; it was not dusk - I could see pretty well: I was at the kitchen window, which is below; there are bars before the window, which would impede my view of him - I can speak to his dress, but not particularly to his features; I cannot speak to the features of either of them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Mills. On Monday, the 15th of October, I saw a man knock at Mr. Goldsworthy's door; that was the second knock - I did not see the first man, except just his back - I heard mistress speak to him; I cannot speak to the first person at all - the second person knocked at the door, and asked for Drew; I said there was no such a person lived there - I was at the parlour window; he stopped there two or three minutes - he said, "I was directed to No. 51, Tothill-street," and asked if there were any lodgers; I said No - he would not go away; he staid there two or three minutes, close to the window - I had to answer him a second time before he went away; I told him no such person lived there, and the family were all gone out - he looked through our parlour window, and then went away; about half-past six o'clock a Policeman came to our door, and as he stood at the door three men came by the window, from Mr. Goldsworthy's - I had not heard any thing between the time I spoke to the man and then: I was in the house, not watching the door; the three men passed our door, one by one, and looked veryhard at the door - I knew the last man again, and gave the Policeman some information, as I recognized Allen as the man I had seen; the Policeman followed - I saw him take Taylor and Allen - Taylor got away, and the third man run away; he secured Allen; Taylor was dressed in a flannel jacket, and drab trousers - Allen is the man who asked for Drew; I knew him directly the Policeman brought him to the door - I just saw Taylor's back, but not his features.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you first see Allen? A. Half-past five o'clock - when he asked for

             I was in my mistress' parlour, and answered him from the window; he was right in front of me - he came off the step of the door, right facing the window - it was quite light then; I had never seen him before; I swear positively he is the man, and have been as certain of him from first to last; I was twice before the Magistrate - I said at first that I was positive Allen was the man - he looked right into the parlour window; I could not be mistaken.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to Mr. Goldsworthy's on the 15th of October, between six and seven o'clock; I found the house in a very confused state; all the things tossed about; the back door was open, and the front door on the spring lock, and the top of the door bolted - as I came towards the house I saw Allen, Taylor, and another man come up by Mr. Goldsworthy's door - I stood at No. 51, which is Mrs. Mills', and as they passed I looked very sharp at them - it was between six and seven o'clock; Mrs. Mills and the servant were at the door at the time, and when they had passed fifteen or twenty yards the servant gave me information - I ran after them; as soon as I got close to them I heard something fall, it jingled - Taylor ran away; I laid hold of Allen, and the other; I called for assistance, but got none, and the other one forced himself from me; I kept Allen - he has not been secured - Allen threatened that if I did not let him go he would strike me; I took Allen down to Mrs. Mills' door, and asked the servant if that was the man who had knocked at the door, and in his presence she said, "Yes, that is one of the men;" whether Allen made any answer I cannot say; as I took him to the watch-house I met Smith, the Policeman, and he assisted me - we locked him up; Smith got a lantern, and we went to the place where I heard the things fall, and found six spoons and a punch-ladle, two small bits of candle, and the top of a phosphorous-box, on the ground - we afterwards went through Mills' house to the back of the prosecutor's house, and found the back door open, went in, and saw the things in the house very much tossed about; I did not go into the house very much tossed about; I did not go into the house till after I took him - Smith went for Mr. Goldsworthy; Goldsworthy found the skeleton-key in the closet - I found in Allen's pocket a latch-key; he would not let me search any more at that time - I searched him again at the watch-house, and found a large penknife, and a small bit of whalebone; I found a small bit of whalebone on the step of Mr. Goldsworthy's door, about the size of a brass pin, but it did not correspond with the other; on the following morning, when I came to take Allen to the office, I saw Taylor outside the door - I knew him again, and the inspector sent for Mrs. Mills; we did not take Taylor then; he followed us to Lambeth-street office, and was then taken - he was dressed in a flannel jacket, and had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290005"/>coat he has on now outside it - I knew him to be one of the three who passed the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time did you see the three? A. Between six and seven o'clock- Taylor had a hat and a flannel jacket on then, but in the morning his coat was over it - he could see me as well as I saw him; I was dressed as a Policeman; I had a great coat on at night, but not in the morning - the Magistrate offered to admit Taylor to bail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did the house appear to have been entered by the back door? A. I cannot say, but it was open - I was the first person who went in; there is a skittle-ground at the back of the garden, and they could get from there into Palmer-street - the prosecutor's house is not in a populous place; I saw nobody else pass while I was there; when I saw the three men they were walking one after the other, close to each other, within two or three feet of each other; I seized Allen at once, and told him he was my prisoner - I did not tell him the charge till afterwards, and then he resisted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him what you took him for before he resisted? A. Yes. both before and after.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to where the scuffle took place, and found two bits of candle and a phosphorous-box - we went round by some alms-houses, and over a wall found the six spoons and punch-ladle, just opposite where the scuffle was - I went to Goldsworthy's house, and found the front door was fast; I afterwards went in at the back, and found the house as Mullins has stated - I went next morning to the same spot, and found a bunch of keys by the alms-houses; there were footmarks at the prosecutor's back door, apparently of two or three persons - they were made apparently in getting away from the house; Taylor came to me next morning at the watch-house, and asked leave to see a prisoner, whose name I do not recollect; I did not let him see him - there were eight or nine prisoners taken before the Magistrate that morning for different offences - Taylor followed them; I saw him speaking to Mrs. Mills' servant as he went along.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. After the scuffle you found the spoons and things over the wall? A. The spoons were over the wall, which is about sixteen feet high - there is a gas-light a little way off; the footmarks were about two hundred yards from that spot, at the prosecutor's house; the wall the things were found over is in the street - there were no footmarks where the keys and things were found, as it is grass there; the footmarks did not go in that direction.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what hour did you find the spoons? A. About a quarter to seven o'clock, directly we had put him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOLDSWORTHY. I believe, when I went out, I fastened the back door as well as the front; I might have left it on the latch - I double-locked the front door, and put the key in my pocket: I am confident I shut the back door too; it was not left open; in fact I am almost certain I bolted it - when I saw it afterwards there was no appearance of force about it; this punch-ladle is marked G; I have had it four years, and am certain of it - the spoons are not marked; I lost spoons of this description, and these are my keys; they fit my locks - this skeleton-key was in the back closet door, which was forced; it is not mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you quite sure you may not have left the back door open? A. I fastened it - it has no lock on it, but I believe I bolted it; there is a latch to it - I am confident the latch was fastened.</p>

               <p>JAMES MULLINS. When I went to the prosecutor's house I looked at the back door; there was no mark of violence on it - the skeleton-key would not open the front door.</p>
               <p>Allen's Defence.

On the Monday night I was going to fetch my child home from Macclesfield-street; I came down Brick-lane, and in Golden-lane saw a person carying a box, which I believe to be the one produced - he was not above twenty yards from Pigeon-court; I had heard a noise in Pigeon-court, like the scraping of something against the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290008"/>wall, and I made way for the person with the box - he was dressed in a white flannel jacket, and a leather apron; he came out of Benbow-rents - he had something which seemed like a sort of great coat on his shoulder under the box; forming a kind of pad - the prisoner is the man who was carrying the box; I have seen him off and on for the last eight or nine months, and speak positively to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man was not broght forward till the second examination. Witness. I did not know any thing was wrong at the time - I put my child out to nurse, being a widower, and fetch it home every evening; I know nothing of the prosecutor's family.</p>

            . I am the wife of Michael O'Brien - we live in Redform-place, Little Whitecross-street; it is a court which is no thoroughfare, and is a dark place. I found this box next door to my house, and gave it to the Policeman - it was in a dark place in the court; I found a little black-pocket book, containing three sovereigns, in a little till in the box - Reform-place is a great deal more than twenty yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>

I was at Seal's public-house on the Monday evening, about seven o'clock; the prisoner, his father-in-law, his woman, and child were there - I saw them go out at the back door; the prisoner, and his father-in-law said they wanted to see Horragan, to borrow some money of him, as they had none; the back door of Seal's house is about ten yards from Pigeon-court.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About eight o'clock on Monday night I received information of this robbery -I went down the lane with another Policeman, and the prisoner called out, but it being very dark I could not discern who it was - I went forward, and he begged pardon of the man who was with me, and said he thought it was somebody else - I saw he had a flannel jacket on; I went into a public-house with him, and said to my brother officer,"Why, he answers the description given by Harragan," as he had a white jacket and curly hair;" when he came out, I said, "Do you know a man with a white cap on? he said he did not - I said I suspected him of robbery; he said he would go to him with me - I took him to Horragan, who was at the public-house in Whitecross-street - I found 18s. 2d. on him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He had no suspicion of me till I mentioned my name - he asked me to go with him to the Cherry Tree, which I did, and went quietly to the station; Buckley was afterwards brought to the station by Horragan.</p>

I asked him what I should give him for it, as I wanted one, he said he did not know - I told him I could buy a new one for about sixpence at Enfield, and I would give him a pot of beer for it, he said he did not want beer - I told him I would give him fourpence for it, which I did; I gave the same hammer to Guiver - he asked me if I wanted to buy a carpet; it was about eight o'clock in the morning - he did not show it to me; I said I did not want any thing of the kind; he asked if I wanted a copper - I said No; he did not show it to me, but said it was pretty handy; I saw him with a bell in the stable - it was a bell made to stick into a wall with a kind of bow to it; I saw that when he was in Mr. Palmer's stable - it was at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the carpet in the high road; Sleight met me, and asked what I had there, I said"A carpet;" he said, "Will you sell it?" I said Yes; and asked 4s. 6d. - he offered 2s. 6d., which I took; Hobbs saw me with the hammer, and asked how I came by it - I told him I found them all tied up together.</p>

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290010"/>pursued, calling Stop thief! and took him about one hundred yards further on - on my coming up to him, he put himself in a posture of defence, and said, "What do you want with me?" and said he had not done any thing; I took him back to Tryon's-place, where a crowd said a lady had been robbed; I saw the prosecutrix in the crowd, and asked if he was the man; she said she was so frightened she could not swear to him - I searched him, but found nothing; I took him to the watch-house, and asked what brought him to Hackney, and where he lived - he at first said in Green Arbour-court, Aldersgate-street, and afterwards said it was in Old-street; he said he had come with a boy with butter to the Cat and Mutton, and he had known the boy eight or nine months, by sight; he was searched again at the watch-house, and 4s. 7d. found on him in common coin; when he ran from Tryon's-place I saw nobody with him - at six o'clock next morning I and Jones went to West-street, and in the front garden of a house near the spot where the prisoner was taken, Jones found the bag, against the wall in the direction it would have fallen, if the prisoner had thrown it; he had passed that garden.</p>

On the 5th of November I went there about half-past seven o'clock, and went through the shop into the parlour; I remained there about a quarter of an hour - I did not see the prisoner there; I received some notes and a draft, which I put into my pocket-book, and three sovereigns, which I put into my purse - in going from Pinner to Ruislip; I pass the Black Horse at Eastcote - it is about half a mile from the half-mile gate, and half a mile from <placeName id="t18321129-9-crimeloc51">Ruislip</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon afterwards did he say so? A. In a very short time; I cannot say that I saw any bludgeons; the attack was from behind - I saw my man attack one of them, and that parto had a bludgeon, and I saw one in the hand of the man why knocked him down - I saw two bludgeons, but that was not the first attack; the prisoner was one of the two who had a bludgeon, and took an active part - he had a hairy cap on, and a drab coloured dress; I cannot tell whether it was a coat or jacket - I do not know what trousers he wore; I left my servant fighting with them, because I was disabled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to any body, "Well, I will not swear to him till I see whether my man does?" A. Never, nor any thing of the kind; I had a conversation with Mrs. Webb on the morning he was taken, but said nothing of the kind; I saw several bonfires on the road.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PEVERILL. I am servant to Mr. Fountain, and was in the chaise with him - we arrived at the half-mile gate about half-past eight o'clock, I think: there were three men in the road before us - I will not swear to them; directly we passed one of them seized the horse by the head, the other two dropped behind, and hit us with bludgeons; I jumped out, ran round the wheel, and made a grasp at the one who held the horse; the others came up instantly, and knocked me down - they were unbuttoning my clothes, to take what I had; they said, "Where is it, deliver it;" I said I had nothing to deliver - they said,"Where are your side pockets?" I said I had none; I am sure they had sticks - one of them said, "D-n him, let us kill him;" I said, "That is never worth your while" - they took my knife from my watch pocket, and 3s. 6d. from my breeches pocket; they got from me, and ran out of the high road into the field which is on the left, going towards Ruislip; I received a blow on my head, which stunned me for a moment - I did not notice how any of them were dressed.</p>

On the 5th of November, a little before eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner with John Wilchen and William Cooper; I called out to him, "Halloo, Joe, how came you over here?" he said Halloo, and went away - they went at a quick pace towards Ruislip; they were in the road, and about ten minutes afterwards I saw a one horse chaise pass.</p>

            . I am a farmer's man. On the 5th of November, about ten minutes to eight o'clock, I was at the half-mile gate, in the road, near Pinner, and saw three men with each a stick; one of them had a kind of dark cap - I cannot say whether it was hairy - I know the prisoner by sight, and am certain he was not one of them; about twelve minutes after I saw them, I saw Mr. Fountain in his gig, going out of the village very fast.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. With whom do you work? A. I am on the parish now, and have been so for a fortnight - I had been out of work three weeks before I got relief; the man who had the cap had a dark coat - each had a stick: I knew the prisoner by his serving bread - I did not go before the Magistrate about this; I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock that night - I was lodging at Ruislip; I ran all the way from the half-mile gate, and got home about two minutes to eight o'clock; I ran because I was afraid of those three men - I did not know either of them before; they did not speak to me, but looked very rough - I had 3s. or 4s., which my father had given me; there is a shorter way from Pinner to Eastcote, across the fields; I went that way - my wife was with me.</p>

            . I am a plasterer, and live at Pinner. On the 5th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was cleaning Mrs. Webb's son's horse, in her stable, and the prisoner was cleaning Mrs. Webb's horse; we agreed to go to Eastcote together, to see a bonfire - we left about half-past seven o'clock; we saw Wilchen on the bridge, and he went with us - the prisoner went into Mrs. Nash's house, and staid about three minutes, then came out, and we went to the Black Horse public-house, and had a segar each; we got back to Pinner about nine o'clock - the prisoner was not out of my sight except for the three miminutes he was in at Nash's; he wore a black hat - neither of us had a stick or bludgeon.</p>
               <p>MR. BALL. Q. Is it a plasterer's work to clean horses? A. No, but I had done no work for a long time - I did not live there; I did not see Mr. Fountain that night, nor any chaise at the door - the prisoner works in a kind of skin cap.</p>
               <p> - WILCHEN. I am apprenticed to my brother, who is a shoemaker, and have known the prisoner about half a year. On the 5th of November, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw him and Cooper over Pinner-bridge - neither of them had a stick; the prisoner had a black hat on: he went into Mrs. Nash's house for about three minutes - we then went into the Black Horse, and had three segars; we went to the bonfire, returned to Pinner together, and got there at near nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know the footway across the fields? A. Yes; it is shorter than the carriage road - we returned that way; we could go from the Black Horse to Pinner in twenty minutes; it was about half-past eight o'clock when we were at the Black Horse - we went from Pinner to Eastcote by the fields; I saw nobody with bludgeons - when we returned the prisoner went into Mrs. Webb's; I waited outside for about an hour and a half, till half-past ten o'clock, and he came out to me after he had his supper - I was examined before the Magistrate, and stated this; the prisoner had on a black hat, white trousers, and a kind of drab coat - he wears a hairy cap in his business; I never saw him wear it in the street.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you see him at three o'clock? A.

I had some coffee in my warehouse on the 22nd of November; I am not quite certain whether I was there that day - I was sent for the same evening, and perceived a quantity of coffee taken out of a cask, and put into a bag; I had given no order for that - there were between 2 cwt. and 3 cwt.; I have a wine warehouse at the back, and there I found a bottle with the cork knocked off, and the wine drank - I have seen Draper frequently; I do not know how he was employed - I found Magraw secured in the warehouse, and two bottles of sherry close by him; he had no business there - the sherry had not been drawn: it laid close to the coffee, which was not the proper place; on searching further, we found a dark-lantern and chisel - the entry had been made by picklock keys.</p>

            . I am twelve years old - I live in Three Cradle-street, nearly opposite Morrice's warehouse. I came out about seven o'clock, to get a penny worth of biscuits for my schoolmaster's little boy, and saw Draper at the gate of the warehouse, by the lock - I went back to school with the biscuits, and about eight o'clock I came out of the school, which is over the prosecutor's warehouse; I saw Draper standing at the corner of the court - he went away for about five minutes, and then he came back; I was standing at the corner of the court - he went back, and came over to the gate of the warehouse; I thought he was making water at first, but I heard the padlock struck up against the door several times: the door was secured by two padlocks and bars - I then went, and called Mr. Purser, who has the care of the warehouse, and lives two or three doors from it; I went on to the corner of the court, and heard the locks knock up against the door again, and then Draper went away; I saw him run from Mr. Purser.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Morrice. I was at the warehouse at a quarter or twenty minutes after five o'clock, and left it all safe; John Knight came and gave me information - I went to the warehouse directly, and found a padlock missing from the gate; it was fastened - the warehouse could not be entered without undoing the lock; I saw Draper standing at the door - as soon as he went away I followed him; he walked quickly; I caught hold of him by the coat - he struck me, and broke from me, threw the lock and key down the area, and then ran away - I afterwards saw the padlock and key brought up; the padlock belonged to the warehouse, but the key in it was a skeleton one; he ran away as hard as he could - I never lost sight of him; Crook stopped him: I went to the warehouse, and found a bag of coffee which had been filled from a cask, which stood there - there were 220 lbs. or more; it was quite safe when I left - I searched, and found the other two prisoners in the warehouse; they had no business there - they had no means of getting in, but by opening the gate; on going farther up the warehouse I found another bag, with 70lbs. or 80lbs. of coffee; I am sure it had no coffee in it when I left it - I found two bottles of wine alongside the bag, which had not been opened, and there was one bottle with the neck knocked off, and the wine gone.</p>

I live at No. 49, St. Maryaxe; I came out, saw Purser and others running, and in about a minute, as I followed them, Crook and Purser were returning with Draper - I pursued till he was lodged in the watch-house; in going along, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Mr. Lindo's, No. 14, St. Mary-axe, and asked for the lock and key; Mr. Lindo gave me a padlock and two skeleton-keys - I did not see where he got them from; Purser claimed the padlock - I went into the warehouse, and found Spencer; as we entered the premises he cried out, "Here I am master;" he did not say how he came there: we found two bags of coffee and two bottles of wine, and on searching the farther end of the warehouse we found Magraw concealed in some hampers - I have the padlock and keys; we searched further, and found a dark-lantern, and a chisel.</p>

On the 3rd of November, about half-past two o'clock, the prisoner called at the warehouse, and asked to look at some tea-poys; he said he had come from Mr. Hunter's of Finsbury, and Mr. Hunter had a gentleman from Manchester waiting to see some; he selected two - I never saw him before, and had no dealing with Mr. Hunter; I got them ready, called the porter down, and gave them into his possession; I directed the porter to go with him, and take them to Mr. Hunter's, and gave him directions not to leave them; this was at about twenty-five minutes to three o'clock; I told him after they had looked at them to bring them back, as I thought they were only going as patterns; about half an hour after, the porter returned without either of them - one was worth 5l. 15s., and the other 4l. 15s.; one of them was returned three or four days afterwards; about a fortnight afterwards, I saw the prisoner in custody at Hatton-garden, and was quite certain of his person, and he said he would pay for it; I cannot find the other poy - it was worth 5l. 15s.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Pitway. On the 3rd of November I was called to take two tea-poys to Mr. Hunter, in Finsbury - the prisoner went with me as far as Long-lane, and then left me; I met him within three or four doors of Mr. Hunter's - he told me to wait there till he came back; I waited about a quarter of an hour, and then he came - I was told not to leave the poys; I saw him go into Mr. Hunter's with Mr. Hunter's man - he went up the gateway; I did not know the person to be Mr. Hunter's man - he came back to me in a quarter of an hour, and took me up the gateway; he was there with the man, and helped me down with the two poys; they carried them both into the place - the prisoner came out, told me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290014"/>keys of the poys were not there, and Mr. Hunter could not decide which they would have, because he wanted to try the locks; he said, "How long will you be getting them?" I ran off directly to get the keys, leaving both the poys behind; I was gone about an hour and an half, and on returning I went in - the prisoner was gone; Miles, Mr. Hunter's man, asked me what I had come about; I said I had come for the poys - I found one there, and told him not to let that go away; he said the prisoner had taken the other to Mr. Paynter's, in London-wall - I went there immediately, but could hear nothing of it; I have not seen it since - I returned to Mr. Hunter's, told him to keep the poy, which they did for about a week, and then it was returned - I did not see the prisoner again till I gave him into custody.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Hunter, a wholesale cabinet-manufacturer, in Finsbury-place - the prisoner is not in his employ; I had seen him five or six times before, but not in Mr. Hunter's employ. On the 3rd of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him: he said he had two tea-poys to sell; I said he could not sell any goods then, as Mr. Hunter was going to bury one of his children - the house was shut up; Williams was not present then - about a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned with Williams, and the tea-poys, through the gateway at the back of the premises; I helped them down off the porter's back, and helped him into the front warehouse with them; then the prisoner and I were left alone - he asked if Mr. Hunter would be back to business that afternoon; I said he might, about dusk - he said he wished to take one of them to show to Mr. Paynter, in London-wall; supposing them to be his poys, I told him to take it- I was not present when he spoke to Williams; I saw Williams again in about an hour and a half - he asked me to see if there was any keys in the tea-poys, and there was one; the poy was afterwards returned to the prosecutor -I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken; he never called for the poy.</p>

            . I was night constable. The prisoners were searched in my presence; the handkerchief was in the seat of Turner's trousers - he had only one handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Turner. He took it out of the side of my pocket, Witness. I felt he had something very bulky, and told him to unbutton his trousers; he rather shifted it round to the side of his trousers - it was not in his pocket at all.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Turner's Defence. I left home to go to a stationer's in Tooley-street, and in the dark part of the bridge I kicked something - I found it was this handkerchief; I went after one gentleman, and asked if it belonged to him; he said No; I then met Reardon - two gentlemen came and took him; they then said they might as well take me.</p>
               <p>Reardon's Defence. I met this young man on the bridge, and asked how he did - he did not tell me he had found the handkerchief.</p>

On the 2nd of November I went home; I got to the farm gate a little after six o'clock; I saw Stevens standing outside, as I supposed, waiting to take my horse, but instead of that, he went in at the gate and said, "Here comes master!" I did not see any one else; I spurred my horse, and went in at another door; I went up to him and said, "What are you doing? I think there is something wrong;" he said,"No, nothing is wrong;" I got off my horse, and felt with my stick, and felt something; I got nearer, and found it was a man with a sack of oats on his back; I said, "Who is here?" Need said, "It is me, Sir;" I said, "What have you got here?" he said, "Only a few oats, which the groom (meaning Stevens) has given me for my horses;" I had myself given out corn to each of the carters the same morning, sufficient for them till the Tuesday following, as we give out corn every Tuesday and Friday morning, and I had locked up the key of the granary in my cash drawer, so that it could not have been opened by that key; I made Need put the oats down, and he said, "I hope you will forgive me;" I went to the granary, and found the door locked, and in an old granary, about five feet from the door, I found a sack with some corn in it; and before I got into the granary, I found a basket which Stevens had been using that morning for another purpose, the bottom of which had been recently tarred, and some oats were sticking to the bottom of it; when I went into the granary I found some oats had been taken from the bulk since the morning, and on the bulk was the impression of the bottom of the basket; I went to the stable, and said to Stevens, "This is a very bad job;" he began crying and said, "I hope you will forgive me;" I said, "It is not my place to forgive you, I shall tell Mr. Mellish of it;" I then got a warrant, and the officer took both the prisoners; the granary must have been opened by a master key, as no force had been used; I have compared the oats found in the sack with those in the granary, and have no doubt they were the same.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoners. Need said he was very sorry for it, and hoped his master would forgive him; I compared the corn, and have no doubt it was the same - this is the corn and the sack.</p>
               <p>Need's Defence (written.) I wanted some corn to feed my horses; the prosecutor's foreman was not in the way, as I was informed by the prisoner Stevens, who was in the loft - I told Stevens I wanted some corn, and observing two sacks full standing on the landing-place near to the granary, I asked him whose that was - Stevens said he did not know; he looked towards the landing-place from where he stood, and saw the corn - I went, and put one sack upon my back, intending to take it to my horses in the stable - while in the act of so doing, I saw the foreman coming towards me; I was afraid he would he angry at my taking the corn without his leave - he came to me, and asked what I had there in the sack; I told him without hesitation - I declare I had no felonious intent; I became alarmed, because I thought he would discharge me for having taken the corn without his leave; had I contemplated any felonious act, it was impossible I could carry the same into effect without immediate detection, because a watchman is always stationed at the gate, who would not allow me to pass out at the gate with corn or any thing else, unless I fully satisfied him.</p>

On the 17th of November the two prisoners came together to the door, about six o'clock in the evening - I was behind the counter, and saw them through the circular panes of glass; I saw Stains draw this piece of print from the inside to the outside of the rail - she motioned to the other to take it off; they then both ran away - I followed, and took them both; Pluce had the print.</p>
               <p>Stain's Defence. I had just left work, and saw this on the ground, hanging quite off the rail; he took hold of her first - I asked what she had done, and he took hold of me, and said he would let me know; I had not touched it.</p>

            . I keep a corn-chandler's. On the Sunday morning the prisoner came to me, and bought some corn and chaff, which came to 5s. - he paid me 4s. in silver, and 1s. in copper; I put the copper into a drawer, with some other copper - Mr. Underwood came in the evening, and took some copper out, which I have here; I cannot see any mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there other money in the drawer? A. Yes, and it remained there till Mr. Underwood came; I believe he had no money in his hand when he came in - he had gloves on; he requested to see the contents of my drawer, and took the money out himself - I have not seen his daughter at my shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you told us all the transaction? A. Yes, as far as I have been required; I know Fell's two brothers - they are respectable; we had a pint and a half of porter for supper that night - he had been very dull for several days, and that night he was very cheerful, and we sat up till about twelve o'clock; I swear he slept in the same room the night before, and I and Pever in my master's bed - I went into Fell's room for the light after he was in bed that night; I sat down on the edge of his bed and we sat talking there - I swear that I and Pever were not laying on his bed; I only laid on the edge of the bed - I was not there an hour; Fell was in a very merry humour - we did not lay down on the bed; we might have joked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290021"/>on the bed - I had my gown on; I was not in my nightgown - Pever put, her night-gown over her things.</p>

            . I am a friend of this witness, and slept in the house with her for about five weeks, in her master's bed, and Fell slept in her bed in the next room. On the morning in question, the creeking of the dressing-room door awoke me, and I heard a person go down stairs- I awoke the cook, she rang the bell, and ran into Fell's room; I got on my gown and went to him; he said,"How frightened you look;" I said, "There is some one in the house;" he said, "Nonsense, it is only the cats;" he got up and we went into the dressing-room, and found the drawers all opened - he went to the window, and found it was unfastened; I can take my oath it was fastened the night before; the cook then called the Policeman, and Fell said, "Stop a minute, if you think there is any one in the house let us go down and see;" and he took a poker and went down - the cook called the officer in; McPherson never slept there while I was there - I never saw him till last Tuesday; when we got down we found the kitchen door wide open - the bells had been taken down and put on the table, which must have been done by some one in the house; Fell was given into custody, and when we went to make his bed, at eight o'clock, we found a hat under his bed, which had not been there the night before, as I had cleaned out the room that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. No; Fell had slept there almost all the time the family was away; I went into his room that night with my night-gown on over my clothes, and so did the cook - she went in because some of her things were in that room; she had pulled her gown off and slipped her night-gown on - I did not lay on his bed; I sat in a chair by the side of the bed - I know nothing about the cook; I had all my things on but my gown, and I put on my night-gown - I never said that we two ghosts intended to sleep with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Fell go out in the course of the evening? A. Yes, to get some tobacco; one of the three pairs of trousers which were missing from the house, was found in the garden, by the officers.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of November I saw the prisoner near the Merlin's Cave public-house - he went in, and had nothing, but he came out again with a brass candlestick wrapped up in a pocket handkerchief; I stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said something he was going to sell to get something to eat; I took it from him - he ran off, but I took him; I gave the candlestick to Mr. Edwards' servant, who is not here, but I know this is the same that I gave her.</p>

             (Police-constable F 152.) On the evening of the 25th of October I was on duty in Holborn - I saw the prisoner with three or four others; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take out his handkerchief with his left hand, and pass it to the other - they made off, and I secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing, and he told you to search me, which you did, and could not find any thing, but you said you would lock me up at all events. Witness. I told the gentleman his handkerchief was gone, and I saw it pass to the other.</p>
               <p>MR. LOW. He asked me if I had lost any thing, and I said, Yes, a handkerchief; and I think he said he saw the prisoner take it, and pass it to an accomplice, who run away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not lay hold of my arm, and ask if I saw any body take any thing from you? A. I felt the tug, and saw you immediately behind me - I seized your arm; I believe there were some others about, but my attention was directed to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Just as I got past Chancery-lane, the prosecutor stopped me, and asked if I saw any body take his handkerchief; I said, No; I stood talking to him, and the officer came up, and he said he saw my hand in his pocket, and afterwards he said; he saw me take the handkerchief out.</p>
               <p>JURY to TIPPER. Q. How far were you from the prosecutor? A. About a yard - I could not take the prisoner with the property, as it was done so quick; I had been watching them some distance, but I had a plain coat on, and they did not know me.</p>

The prisoner lodges in the next room to us - I kept my clotheslines on the landing-place; the cord the officer found in the basket was mine; there were several in the basket -I had had the cord several months; I do not know where I got it - there were several pieces tied together - it was a drying line.</p>

Spalding and Hodge; he replied, "I am very sorry for it;" I said,"What are you sorry for?" his answer was, "That I should have done it, or that I should do it;" I produce the cheque which I received from Blount.</p>

On the following day I went out at three o'clock in the afternoon; I have no family - nobody lives in my house - it is a small house; my rabbits and poultry are kept in the room I live in; I have one window and two or three doors to my house, I made them all safe before I went out; I returned at near six o'clock; I found my front door locked, but on going in I found the wall pulled down near the back door - it is a mud and timber wall - it was pulled down sufficient for a person to get in, and on looking about, I missed two doe rabbits; I went with a Policeman to Shillitoe, who we found lived at Dalston; we got there at nearly six o'clock, and saw Shillitoe in his shed, where there were some rabbits; among them was a white doe, which was mine - I had had her about six months; she had kindled four days before, and her young ones were in my hutch - we took it to the station-house; the Inspector put a mark on her ear, and allowed me to take her home to the young ones; I have it here - this is it; on taking her back, she went into the inner hutch to the young ones, and suckled them; Mason, a Policeman, brought me a smut rabbit, a black and white one, the same evening - it was one of the two I had lost - she was with young; Mason took it away for some time, and gave it up to me, when it was about kindling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How large was the hole in the wall? A. Large enough for a man to get through easily; there are small air-holes in my walls - a fowl could not get out of them; the prisoner told me Shillitoe lived at Dalston; he said nothing about taking them to show him, but said he would call again about some ducks' eggs, at nine o'clock in the morning; I have forty or fifty hutches; my cottage is at the corner of a field; I never knew my rabbits to stray into the field.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are there small openings to give air? A. Yes; they are in the upper part of the wall.</p>

               <p>Q. If the driver had driven as he ought, in a cautions manner, could the accident have taken place? A. Certainly not; the lady appeared to be walking very well -I do not think there was any body in the cab.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Are you attorney for this prosecution? A. No; it was nearer six o'clock than five; it was twi-light - there were two gaslights opposite Sir Claude Scott's, which gave a great light - I was near Prince's-street; I saw the cab just at the corner of Cavendish-square - the accident happened fifty or sixty yards from the corner; I do not exactly know when the lady began to cross, but think it must have been when the cab was coming round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there not be abundant time for her to cross before it came that distance? A. Not at the rate he was coming; he was gallopping, not trotting - I do not know how far across the lady had got; I was looking at the cab more than her, as I thought she must be run over - I did not call out to her; I did not think it would have any effect; the accident happened near Sir Claude Scott's, on the left-hand side coming from Cavendish-square; I was further from the square - the road may be seven or eight yards wide, or more; he was driving most furiously - it entirely happened from the manner he was driving; she might have seen the cab, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had seen it coming at this furious rate, she must have put herself in the way of it? A. She tried certainly to run to the pavement to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you walking along the pavement? A. Yes; I heard no cry of warning from the driver to her - when I first saw the horse it was gallopping - the driver whipped it after that; and after the accident, he whipped it again to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the lady on the side that the driver was sitting? A. Yes, she must have been - I do not know whether he came round the corner or not, but just at the corner he was gallopping; he was on the proper side of the road - the lady came from the right side, and the off shaft struck her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined Q. This was about the time the gas is lighted? A. Yes; it was between light and dark - I did not notice any dizziness - the gas was just lighted; I think it would be more difficult to see a person at that time than at any other; I was standing at the right-hand corner of Prince's-street, furthest from Cavendish-square - the cab was on the other side - I was about ten yards from it when the wheel went over her; if the driver had called out at all, I think I must have heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said you thought this happened accidentally? A. Yes, by negligence; I received 5s. for helping her ladyship - I had a deal of trouble in fetching a coach from Oxford-street, and complained that it was not sufficient, and got a friend to write to say I was not satisfied, as one of the young ladies said I should be handsomely rewarded - and after I had given my evidence at the office I received 20s. more for the trouble I had in picking her ladyship up - it was left at a shop for me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure her ladyship was not moving out of the way to avoid another carriage at the time? A. No, I saw no other carriage there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see or converse with any body about the 20s.? A. No, I was ten yards from the cab - her ladyship was crossing; the cab-driver could have seen her as well as I could, I saw her plainly - I did not notice whether she mended her pace as the cab came along.</p>

I went on the Saturday after the accident in search of the driver of the cab - I went to Kepple-mews, Russell-square, and saw the prisoner there; he was standing with his father - I told the father I wished to see the driver of the cab, No. 897; the father said, "This is my son who drove the cab" - I asked the prisoner if he remembered taking me up on the Wednesday, near Cavendish-square; I was then in plain clothes - he said No; I asked if he was sure he drove the cab on the Wednesday - he said Yes; I asked if he remembered running against a lady near Cavendish-square - he then hung down his head, and said, "Yes, I do;" I asked if he knocked her down, and run over her - he said, "Yes, I did;" I asked if he heard any body call after him: he said Yes; I asked why he did not stop - he said he did not like; I took him to the station-house.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on Saturday, the 20th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, and laid on the counter a very handsome silver snuff-box, requesting to knw what it was, and what it was worth; I asked him who it belonged to - he said it belonged to the mate of an East Indiaman; I asked how the mate came by it - he said the mate's father left it him; I asked him where the mate lived - he said down at the east-end of the town, and if I disputed his word, he would leave the box, and go and fetch him - I said he must not go away till he had given some better account of it, and said it was very strange that he came from the east to the west, as there were so many shops between, and I did not believe his account - I came round the counter to look for a Policeman; I looked out at the door, but could not see one, and while my back was turned, the prisoner rushed by me out at the door, and run away; I followed, and overtook him about fifty yards off - we had rather a violent struggle, and at last got him back to my shop; I am sure the box is worth more than five guineas - I would give that for it myself, as a second-hand box.</p>

I did not see the prisoners till they were before the Magistrate; I was in the warehouse when the cases were packed, and when they were taken away; two cases and a truss were taken away - the truss was packed in canvas; it was about two feet and a half each way, and two feet deep - they were taken away in a cart; I cannot say whether I know the man that came into the warehouse to take them out- it was about three o'clock, or between three and four; Boucher gave me 6d. to give to the man who was with the cart - I went into the passage, and gave him 6d. for booking; the goods were then in the cart.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Dent and Co. I do not know either of the prisoners. On the 23rd of June I remember seeing a cart coming for the goods, between four and five o'clock; I was in the warehouse, and saw the person who came for the goods in the warehouse, but do not know him; I saw him remove two cases and a truss - one case was about four feet long and three high, and the other a smaller one - the truss was packed in canvas; they were to be sent to Dent and Co., at Worcester, from the Rose-inn, Farringdon-street; Robinson drove the cart - I only saw his back; the cases and truss were taken out of the warehouse and put into the cart - the prisoner Pedley generally called at our warehouse on Saturday morning, to know if there were any goods to go to Carron-wharf; and he would take goods to pitch as he passed by other wharfs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You only saw the back of the driver? A. No; I do not swear it was Robinson - I saw him in the same dress at the office; he wore a dark drab jacket.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long did you look at him? A. Only as I came down stairs; there was a cart there at the time; I saw Robinson when he was in custody - the Magistrate told him to turn round: I said, as far as I could tell from his back, he was the man; he was dressed the same as the man was.</p>

            . In June last I was in the employ of Mr. Thomas Elston, an owner of town-carts. On Saturday, the 23rd of June, I was out with one of the carts; coming through Dowgate-hill, between four and five o'clock, and I was hired by John Ellis, who took me to the corner of Friday-street - I was dressed as I am now; I went to the first house on the right-hand side of Cheapside - when I got there, Ellis put three packages into the cart, which he brought out of the warehouse; I did not go into the warehouse - I remained in the cart; the packages were two deal cases, and a small truss - one case was rather bigger than the other, the truss was covered with a kind of sackcloth; I did not see any body belonging to the warehouse - Ellis got into the cart, and by his direction, I turned round to the left, towards St. Paul's, and when I got twenty or thirty yards, he told me to turn round, and go back down Cheapside - Pedley and Wall were at a distance; they did not join the cart at all, till I got where I was desired to go by Ellis - I was ordered to go to Castle-alley, and they joined me there; I was ordered to go to Smith's, in Castle-alley, by Ellis - I had seen Pedley before; they joined the cart at Smith's, and each took a parcel out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Pedley when you first saw him after Ellis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290030"/>hired you? A. Pedley and Wall were both twenty or thirty yards from Ellis, walking on up Dowgate-hill, towards Cheapside, they passed by after I got to the warehouse, while the goods were loading into the cart; I had got about ten or twenty yards down Cheapside before I saw them again; they were following the cart down, going in the same direction as the cart, and about twenty yards from it; after seeing them then, I did not see them any more till I got to Castle-alley, which is in Whitechapel, near Wentworth-street - there is no thoroughfare in the alley for carts - it leads strait into Whitechapel; my cart drew up Castle-alley - Pedley and Wall were there by the time I got there, they were at the end of the court, ready to take the goods out when I drew up; they were up the alley - they each took a package, and went up the court with it; I did not see what house they went into - I was not there above ten minutes; Ellis paid me 10s. for the cart, in the evening, in Church-lane, Whitechapel, in the street; nobody was present when he paid me - I was afterwards apprehended, in consequence of this, by Lee, and made this statement to him after I was taken; I afterwards went with Lee to Castle-alley, and pointed out the place where the cart stood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a turning to the left in Castle-alley leading to Castle-place? A. At the bottom there is - there are five or six houses in Castle-place; I believe Castle-street is to the right - I never saw Smith at all; the cart stopped very near the bottom of Castle-alley - the horse's head stood towards Whitechapel; the cart stood at the turning that the goods went up - they were taken up the turning to the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come into Castle-alley out of Whitechapel? A. No, there is no thoroughfare there; I got into it by the brewhouse - I might be there ten minutes; I am positive I was not longer - I got into the cart, and delivered the goods to them; the cart stood still in the same place till I drove away - I am positive I did not back into any premises, if any body has said so, it is not true; master has four carts, three large and one smaller - the large ones may be eight feet wide; the one I drive was No. 152,884.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The first time you saw Pedley he was walking up Dowgate-hill? A. Yes, with Wall, and they passed as I was loading the cart; I saw them in Cheapside, and saw no more of them till I got to Castle-alley - I there delivered the goods to Ellis, Pedley, and Wall.</p>

            . I am married - my husband is abroad; I live now at No. 44, Russel-street, Mile-end-road. In June last I lived at No. 8, Castle-place, Whitechapel - I know the prisoner Smith; I was in his house about ten weeks, to take care of his children, three years ago - he then lived at No. 2, Castle-place; I went to live in Castle-place about a week or fortnight after last Christmas -Smith was not then living at No. 2, for he had had two rooms made at his shed, or warehouse, in Castle-alley; that was where his business was carried on - I cannot say what his business was, further than it was receiving stolen goods - while I lived with him he was receiving stolen property; the warehouse in Castle-alley, and his house, in all in the same place - it is not a stone's throw; we have to turn round from one to the other; the alley goes up towards Whitechapel; the warehouse is in Castle-alley. On Saturday, the 23rd of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a town cart driven down round Castle-alley, by the witness Robinson - the cart was backed into Smith's premises; I saw it back into Smith's premises - I saw it drive down - I could not see any thing taken from the cart, as it was backed into the premises -I saw two packing-cases, and a truss in it: the truss was covered with canvas; I saw the cart go away empty in about twenty minutes, and in about an hour and three-quarters I saw another cart, a brown cart - Smith, the prisoner, came out of his premises with it; it had the name of Dunn on it, with the same packing-cases apparently as had just before gone in in the town-cart, but not the truss - Smith was in the cart; nobody else - it was a light brown cart, with a seat in it, made more like a chaise-cart.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You lived at Smith's, as a servant at the time the cart came? A. No, I lived at Mrs. Morris', No. 3, Castle-place; that is in the same line of buildings as Smith lived in - I know his premises, and the way into his back yard, and the gateway into it - I saw the town cart back into his premises, through the gates, into the back yard - I saw Robinson drive the cart round the corner of Castle-alley, and he backed it into the yard - the gates were closed; I could not see any thing taken out of the cart; Robinson, the horse and cart, were all inclosed inside the gates, which were closed - I saw that; I saw nobody but him with the cart, neither taking it in nor out - it came out empty; I saw nobody else go into the yard; he backed it in, and somebody closed the gates inside - I could not see who was inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been looking into the yard before the cart came? A. No; I was standing close to my own place when the cart passed - there was nobody in it but Robinson; I saw nobody else pass; I know Mr. Allum, at No. 4, Castle-alley - I never lived with him - Mr. Morris has been a master-hackneyman, but now drives a cab; his wife lives with him - after leaving Smith's, I went to a house in Brathwaite's-buildings, Finsbury; Smith was a receiver of stolen goods when I lived with him - that was the reason I left, so many bad characters came backwards and forwards - I discovered it about six weeks after I went to live with him, but waited there till I could suit myself with a house; my husband lived with me at that time - he is now in America; he went last May - I never asked Smith for money after I left him; I know

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended Robinson on the 21st of September - he did not at first make a statement of the share he had in the transaction, but did afterwards - I took Pedley the same day (before I took Robinson), and told him it was for taking some goods from a warehouse in Friday-street; he said he knew nothing about it, and asked me when - I told him about June; he said it was very hard he should be taken, it was not him, for he was in confinement at the time - he did not say where; he said he had been tried and acquitted; I asked him what he had been - he said he had been a porter at the Carron wharf; I afterwards took Robinson - he went with me to Castle-alley: I pointed out where the cart stood - the prisoner Smith was in custody at the time, taken for another affair; I searched the premises, and found a tinplate there, with the name of William Dunn on it - I gave it to an officer here last Session; Smith's premises have a side door, which goes up a passage to his house, and then there are two folding gates leading to a shed; you can enter either by a side door or the gates - his premises go to the corner of the wall; I have been to the prosecutors' premises - they are the first house on the right-hand side from Cheapside.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. That was when she quarrelled with him? A. Yes, and before; I have heard her say it coolly, when nobody but me and Smith's children were present - I repeatedly heard her say it at Smith's house, and afterwards at the quarrel, about ten weeks ago, it might be twelve weeks, it was about fortnight before he was taken into custody, or not so long; Ramsay, Joseph Brown, Thomas and Miss Scruby, and Solomon and Thomas Cripps were present - it was at the bottom of Castle-place, in the open air, in the evening, just before dark; the lamps were not lighted - she did not address any one in particular - the whole heard it; they made no answer to it - I came away, and left the rest there; Scruby sometimes goes by the name of Litchfield; Groves always used those words.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You do not mean to say you have given us the exact words? A. Yes, I have, the very words; I have had no quarrel with her - she came in and out at Smith's, I thought, as a friend, and when he would not oblige her with money she was angry, and said if he did leave her money she would do for him, she would transport him.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street - my husband is a skin-dresser. About fourteen or sixteen weeks ago I heard a quarrel between Mrs. Groves and the prisoner; I heard her say she would transport him if he did not support her or her children, or words to that effect; this passed in Castle-place, between her landlord's window and the next house - it was late in the evening.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Quite dark? A. Yes, between nine and ten o'clock at night; Ville was there, and Scruby and Joseph Brown - Cripps was not there; it was about ten weeks previous to the last Session.</p>

I know Groves by sight - I heard her say she would do her best to transport Smith if he did not do his best to support her and her family; Ville and Ramsay were present - it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night, at the bottom of Castle-place; I did not see Miss Scruby there; I have heard this two or three times, but never attended to it more than once myself - I never spoke to Groves in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Ramsay and Ville were both present when the quarrel took place at the bottom of the court? A. Yes; I think it was nearer eleven o'clock than ten - I was coming home from work, and heard the disturbance; I left work about ten - I am not acquainted with Smith; I believe he is something of a wool sorter.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Castle-place. I heard Groves say she would do her best in transporting Smith if he did not do his best to support her children - it was twelve or fourteen weeks ago, or more; I have heard her say it both private and public - it was her common practice; she said she would certainly have her revenge on Smith, and all who took his part.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You think it was thirteen or fourteen weeks ago that you last heard it? A. The quarrel was thirteen or fourteen weeks ago - the last time I heard it might be a week or a fortnight after; I was at home on the night of the quarrel; the noise called me out - it might be about nine o'clock, or between nine and ten; I am sure it was before ten - I mended a pair of shoes for Smith about two years ago; I never dressed any leather for him, nor did he apply to me to dress some, which I refused; he never applied to me to do any thing which I refused - I knew Mrs. Morris, and Groves; I never told them Smith brought me stolen leather to work, and because I would not have it he took his work from me, nor any thing of the sort.</p>

            . I am in the wool business, but have been out of a situation some time - I lived in Castle-place, but now live in King-street, Spitalfields. When I lived at Hoxton I heard Groves say, at Smith's own place, that she would transport him unless he supported her and her children - I heard it at both places.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You heard it at Smith's place? A. Yes, the very morning Mr. and Mrs. Groves left the house(they ran away); they quarelled that morning, because Smith said he would not take her into his place - I was at work for Smith that morning, it was about nine o'clock, in the shop; Mr. Heather was there - he works in the same stable in Ropemaker-street; I get my living by portering - I have been out of a regular place since three weeks after Christmas; I was in the employ of Mr. Gooch, who houses wool - I never sold Smith any wool; I never took any to him - I have taken cotton to his place when he employed me; I was discharged from Gooch through Mrs. Groves - after Grove's, husband was discharged, Gooch said he could not keep me any longer, as he had such a piece of work at his house; it was nothing about wool.</p>

            . I am a carman in the employ of Mr. Elston. I went to Smith's premises last Friday, and tried to back one of our three large carts into his gateway; Robinson used to drive one of the large ones - they are all three the same size; I rather think this was the smallest of the three, if there is any difference - I could not back it into his premises; there was not room to turn it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you tell us the dimensions of the cart? A. I should think it is about five feet without the wheels, and six or seven feet, including the wheels.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Could you not back a cart that width, through a gateway eight feet two inches? A. No, the street is not wide enough to turn it; there is no footway on either side - I do not recollect any curb on either side; I did not go down to the bottom of the street - there is no curb by Smith's gate; the gates were open when I tried to back the cart - the gateway is up the street; I went inside his shed, and saw a four wheeled van there - I should not think that is longer than our cart, not shafts and all; it is a longer van, but they are very narrow compared to a town cart.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you get out of the alley with your cart? A. I backed it out all the way, because I could not turn it; Mr. Elston sent me to try it, by Smith's desire - Smith was with me, and saw me do it; I have been a carman eight or nine years, but only worked for Elston a few weeks.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I did not turn the cart round; it was not so high up as the gate - I backed into Castle-place, and turned round.</p>

On the 29th of October I was at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Shadwell - the prisoner was there - I had known her before; I gave her a glass of gin, and had a pint of porter myself: I changed a sovereign - I got 19s. in silver, and put it into my pocket; I left, and wanted to go on board, but the prisoner followed me; I ran from her, but she overtook me - I went home with her - she wanted me to stop, but I would not; I said,"I must away;" I sat down on the bed-side with her, and might have been ten minutes funning and joking; I then said, "I must away," and she was then very agreeable to let me go; when I had got a few yards from the door I missed 7s. - I had only 12s. left; I am sure I had the 19s. when I went into the house - I had not given her any money, nor promised her any; I had not put my hand into my pocket while I was in the house; no one else had an opportunity of taking it; I was never in any company but hers - I went to a house opposite, where I found her, with two or three more; I said to her, "If you don't return that money to me, I will call the Police;" she said I might, she did not care for me nor them - I strnggled with her, and one shilling dropped at her feet; I picked that up, and still asked her to be so good as to give me my money; she said she had taken no money, but I said she had; she then took something from her stocking, and put it into her month - I called in the Police, who overhauled her, and 1s. 6d. dropped from her; when the Policeman came in she took something from her mouth, and put it on the chair.</p>

I went to the house in a court in Bluegate-fields; I saw the prisoenr there - I asked what she had done with the man's money; she said he had given her no money, and she had no money - she was sitting on a chair, and one of her stockings was off; I searched her, and one shilling I received from the prosecutor - the prisoner said they had been to another room, but did not give any reason how the prosecutor could have lost his money; she was affected with liquor.</p>

I left town with my family about the end of May; the prisoner was in my service: I did not then know that she was married - she was with me about two years; I had occasionally come backwards and forwards to town, and my family returned to town on the 27th of October; while I was in the country I received information, and wrote to the prisoner, desiring that she would leave on my return, and on the 27th of October she left - I almost immediately missed some articles from the house; I obtained a warrant, and appointed for the prisoner to be at my chambers to receive her board wages, and any items due to her - she came there, and I asked her what could induce her to marry without letting me know of it, when she might be quite certain that if her husband was a man of good character, I should have been happy to have had the protection of a man sleeping in my house at night - she said she knew she had done wrong, and repented it as much as I could; I appointed for herto come again, and went to my chambers with an officer - she came there, and I said as she was now married, and in possession of a house, what would she think of leaving an individual in charge of that house, and to find that every bed in it, had been robbed of feathers to make one for themselves - she said, "You don't suppose that I have done that;" I said, "That is not the question, what would you do to such a person;" she said, "I should imprison them" - I said, "That is your case, you have stripped every bed in my house; this is the officer, and you will accompany us to your house to search:" we went there in a hackney-coach - in going along I asked her where she got the feathers of which she had made a new bed; she said she bought them of a woman in Wardour-street, in July - I asked what she knew of the person; she said nothing, but that in passing Wardour-street, she met a woman carrying a bed to a pawnbroker's, and that she purchased it; when we got to the house we found the things stated in the indictment, and I believe some more: I asked how she came to take them - she said she really did not know, and that she was the only person who was guilty of the feathers; I asked her how she came to do it - she said from having heard of it, and that other servants did it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe she had conducted herself well? A. Up to the time of my leaving town; I placed unlimited confidence in her - I heard she was married the Sunday after I left town; I searched her house again on a subsequent day, and found some other things which were not taken before, though they were there - I have indicted the husband separately; I believe some of the articles in this indictment are in the indictment against him - there were a quarter's wages due to her, and some board wages; there may be 13l. due to her.</p>

             (Police-constable S 20). On the 6th of November I received information that the trunk was lost- and on the following morning I went to the Stamp-office, to see if it had been left there, but it had not - I then went to Islington, and found Smith and Spiers; Smith was just going off with his coach; I saw Spiers run off - I brought him back to Smith, and asked Smith if he had taken a family to the Regent's-park - he said he had; I then asked if he knew any thing of a trunk which had been lost - he said No, he had taken two trunks, and he did not know of any other, I then asked if he knew the other coachman - he said No, but in a few minutes Spiers said, "It is Mousey," and Smith said, "Aye, it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290036"/>Mousey" - I asked who he drove for, and they said for Mr. Mayhew, in Great Ormond-yard; I took them there, but he was not at home - I then went to the prosecutor's, and on Thursday morning I went to the Stamp-office, and the trunk had just been left there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Smith gave you a correct account of where Stevens lived? A. Yes - Smith was going with a fare to Judd-street, and I followed him - he did not attempt to escape.</p>

Yes- there are by law four days allowed to bring any thing to the office; I believe Stevens has before brought articles there - one article in particular I know he brought; it was a blue cloth coat - the owner had it, and Stevens got a reward for his honesty.</p>

             (Police-constable N 34). About one o'clock on Saturday morning, the 10th of November, I apprehended the prisoner, from the prosecutor's description - I had seen her the same morning in the Vinegar-ground, with a brown purse - she emptied some money into her hand, and saw three sovereigns quite distinctly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Robin-hood, and asked the female to go home - she told me to go and shut the sutters; I went out, and was tying my pattens, when the prosecutor came and tapped me on the shoulder - he asked where I lived, and I told him; but he said it was too far to go, and bade me good night.</p>

On the 28th of November, between four and five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, with another woman - the prisoner asked for some ribbon, and some were shown her; they bought two yards, and the prisoner paid for it: they then left the shop - I suspected, and brought them back - I saw this piece of ribbon fall from the prisoner, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was your shop pretty full? A. Yes; there were others there; we do a good deal of business - I did not see her take this ribbon - when I brought her back she sat down in a chair, and I found the ribbon under the chair; I suppose it fell from her hand, which appeared to be under her apron - I did not see her hand; she might be half a yard from the counter - it could not have fallen from the counter, as there is a brass ledge, and the ribbon-drawers had been removed; I looked on the chair, and on the floor, before I brought her back.</p>

The door was shut, but the shutters were down; I waited about the greater part of the day, and no one came till the evening - none of the goods were ever offered to me back; I saw some horse-hair strewed about the warehouse, not more than would fill a hat, and some empty boxes: Tute seemed to be sorting the horse-hair; when I returned at eleven o'clock I made what noise I could, but could not get in.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of October, we went into the house; we purchased the good-will of the prisoner's father, and the fixtures; my husband gave 35l. for them, which was paid in sovereigns to Mr. Smith, by my husband; I saw him pay it on the 13th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning - he paid the money in the house; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, me, my husband, and a lady where we lived before were present when it was paid; we had not any furniture in the house at that time - the prisoner was also present when the money was paid; I think she saw it paid - she saw her father have the money afterwards; we brought our things in that evening- Smith did not leave the house; we wanted them to go, but we could not get them out - we used the front room second floor for our sleeping-room - our bed was there, and their bedstead was in the room, and some drawers and a table of theirs, and we had a trunk in the room; we carried on a school - the girl's school is on the same floor, as the bedroom, and the boys' school is on the first floor (the prisoner was to have carried on the school until the Friday, as we gave them all permission to stop in the house without paying rent.) On Monday, the 15th, about eleven o'clock, she and I were in the school-room, and there was a knock at the door - she said, "Shall I go into your room and look out of the window:" I did not object to it, and she went; she called me, and told me the knock was for me - I went into the room, looked out of window, and saw it was for me; I then went down stairs to speak to the person, leaving her there, and when I returned up stairs I missed a purse, containing two shillings and a foreign sixpence, off the mantel-piece - I had seen it when I went out of the room to speak to the person - I told the prisoner I had missed it- she said it was very strange, and she hoped I did not think she had got it; I said I should be sorry to think so- I then went into the school-room, and she also said, before the children, that she hoped I did not think she had got it; I said the same as before, that I should be sorry to think that she had got it; the person I went down to speak to was the broker - I went into my bed-room again, and she followed me into the room, and while the man was bringing the furniture up stairs I told her she had better go and look after the children - she went, and returned almost directly with a piece of work in her hand: I had some money in a box in the same room; I had eighty-two sovereigns in a bag, which I took out of the box - she was sitting in the room at the time; I put the bag on the bed, that she might not see it, but she did, because she came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290043"/>close to me - I opened the bag to pay nine sovereigns to the broker; she came close to me - she said she wished I would let her put her hand into that bag, and take out a thousand- I said nothing to that; I paid the broker, and put the bag into the box again - I know there were eighty-two sovereigns in the bag, because on Saturday, when we paid the thirty-five, my husband counted them - he counted them about two days before the Saturday, at No. 24, Chapel-street, Pentonville, where we lived before; the bag was never out of this box after that - I saw it put into the box: sometimes my husband had the key, and sometimes I had it; it was always in possession of one of us; the box was always in our bed-room at Pentonville, till we moved to Chapel-street, and then it was put into our bed-room; a porter brought it from Pentonville there on a truck - I did not see it delivered to the porter; my son accompanied the porter with it to Chad's-place, but I did not; when I paid the broker the 9l. I took out ten sovereigns; I kept the one sovereign, and put the bag into the box again, and locked it; when the broker was gone I and the prisoner were going into the school-room again, and as we came out of the bedroom door, she told me her mother was calling me - I did not hear her mother call me; I looked over the bannisters, and told her I could neither hear nor see her mother call me - she insisted that her mother was calling me; I went down one flight of stairs, as far as the boy's school-room, and then returned, as I did not think her mother was calling me - she looked over the bannisters, and told me her mother was in the kitchen, and that she was calling me; I went down stairs, and saw her mother in the parlour - she did not want me; I went up stairs - she was then standing just inside the school-room door - I told her her mother had not called me, that I had been down, and spoken to her - she made no reply to that, but said, in a very hurried manner, that she had thought of a key, which would fit my room door, and that the key of the school-room fitted it, (we had enquired for a key to the bed-room door) she put the key into the key-hole herself, and locked the door - she was trying to see if the key fitted it; she left the key in the door, and I tried it myself, to see if it was locked - the key was taken out of the door; I do not recollect which of us took it out, but if she took it out, she gave it to me, for it was in my hand directly; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the prisoner, my husband, and myself were in the house at this time; Mr. Smith was engaged down stairs in the boys' school-room - nobody was up stairs besides the prisoner and the man who brought the furniture in, and I was there the whole time with him - I should think this took place about eleven o'clock, as near as I can guess; the school hours are from nine till twelve - it was her duty to remain in the school the whole of the day; the moment she gave me the key, she went down stairs; she did not tell me she was going - she returned at ten minutes after twelve o'clock - I asked where she had been - she said she had been out with a friend; I had sent down stairs to inquire for her, but she could not be found - she then told me to dismiss the children, and they all went home - they ought to have gone at twelve o'clock, but I did not know the time; I remained in the school-room with her a few minutes; there was a desk in the room, which I told her was not the one we had bought with the fixtures - she said it was; I heard my husband coming up stairs, and I took the key she had given me off the school-room table, and unlocked the bed-room door - the school-room commands a view of the bed-room - when I sat in the room I could see any body who went into the bedroom - nobody had gone to it from the time she locked it, till I opened it for my husband; the school-room door was open the whole day; when I went into the bedroom, my husband sat down, and my attention was called to the trunk - I found it was shut, the bolt of the lock was turned, but it had not caught - it was like a desk lock; it was my husband called my attention to the box when he sat down - he said I had not locked it, and found the bolt was shot, but it did not go into the lid; I examined the bag, and found that it was open - I had twisted a string round it when I paid the broker, but did not tie it - I found the mouth of the bag open; we counted the sovereigns, and twenty-five were deficient - I found forty-seven in the bag - the prisoner was in the school-room; we went into the school-room, and told her we had been robbed, and that we should like to know where she had been while she was out - she said she would not tell us; we told her we would have a Policeman, and then she ran away down stairs - my husband ran after her, and I went down and found her at the front gate - she still said she would not tell us where she had been; my husband said, if she would, he would take her there himself, and not have a Policeman - she would not tell us, and we sent for a Policeman - she then ran into the kitchen, and fastened the door - we could not get in, we tried to get in repeatedly; I went to the front window of the kitchen, but could not see her; a Policeman came, but she would not let him in - he tried the door and window - she had fastened them both; he at last got in at the window, and let us in at the door - the prisoner slept in the kitchen - her bed was opposite the window, on chairs; she was examined at the office between one and two o'clock, I think, and after that the Magistrate ordered the house to he searched - I went with the Policeman; we searched the kitchen - Mrs. Smith was there, with the Policeman, and myself; both the Policeman and her mother searched the bedding, and I saw the mother find two purses under the bed, either between two beds, or between the bed and mattress - one was a brown purse, and the other a bead purse; I had seen the bead purse frequently in the prisoner's hands - she was in the habit of using it - neither of the purses were mine; there was about 4d. in the bead purse, and in the brown purse there were fifteen sovereigns, and 12s. 6d. in silver - the brown purse has two ends to it - the gold and silver were separate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you and and the family had any disagreement before this? A. No; we wanted them to leave the house, but after the money was paid, it was agreed they should stop till the 19th; I do not know that the prisoner's mother is weak in her intellect; when we paid the father, he handed the money over to the mother, who put it into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290044"/>her pocket - she did not hand it to the prisoner; we did not repent our bargain; I never said I would be revenged on them; I could not get the prisoner out of the bed-room - it would not have been polite to turn her out; she was absent from the house about an hour- it is a large wooden box, and locks like a desk - I thought I had locked it; it stood on another high box, and as my husband sat down he could see that the hasp had not caught; I was flurried at losing the purse, and must have shut it down in that way; I told the prisoner that morning that I missed some rings, but did not know whether I had brought them there or not - she went and found them; when we said we would have a Policeman, she said she defied twenty Policemen - I never wanted to compromise this; the mother said,"I would have given you 50l. if you had not taken my daughter;" I had not asked what she would give me not to appear - I never said I would be revenged about the school; I asked the prisoner about nine o'clock that morning, what she would stop with me for a week for - she said 6l. - I refused to give that - that conversation was in the kitchen; she and her mother were together; I had said before I took the school, that I was rather deficient in fancy work, and would she object to show me - she said she could do that in half an hour, but I found it was not necessary in that school; she gave me the names of fifteen scholars, some at 1s. 6d. a week, and some at 1s. - I found I had but three scholars, but the prisoner said they did not come on Monday morning - two new ones came that morning.</p>

I had a bag of money at Pentonville; I counted it three or four days before the 13th - there were a hundred and twenty sovereigns; I took out, I believe, two, but I will say three, in order to be within the mark; that would make it one hundred and seventeen, and on Saturday I took out thirty-five at Pentonville; I did not count the rest that day, but there were about eighty-two left - I tied the bag up, and put it into the box, locked the box, and corded it; the key was always in possession of either my wife or myself - the box was sent to Chad's-place, in a truck; my son accompanied the porter - he is not here; I did not go with it - I paid the 35l. on Monday; I believe I paid it into Mrs. Smith's hands, but they were all present - to the best of my recollection the prisoner never had it in her hands. On the Monday, I went up into my bed-room, a little after twelve o'clock, and after a little conversation with my wife on other subjects, I discovered that the lid of the box was not shut down - I found the bolt of the lock had been shot, but the staple rested on it; my wife handed me the bag, and previous to counting it, I knew from the weight a very large sum had been abstracted from it - I counted it, and found forty-seven sovereigns; I missed twenty-five - we went into the school-room, and I told the prisoner I had lost twenty-five sovereigns, and I should be much obliged to her if she could tell me where she had been - she refused to tell me; I said if she did not I would put her into the hands of a Policeman - she quite laughed at it, and said, "Do you suppose I am such a fool as to care for a Policeman," and then ran down stairs; I followed her to the front gate, brought her into the passage, and sent for a Policeman, who arrived, but I hesitated at giving her in charge at first, fearing she might bring an action for false imprisonment, but after having gone to the station-house, and got advice of the inspector, I returned and gave her in charge; she had previously threatened to stab the Policeman if he took her, and had barred herself into the kitchen; the Policeman attempted to break the door down with an axe, but not succeeding, he at last got in at the window - I had seen the prisoner before I discovered the lid of the box to be open, in the school-room - I had gone into the bed-room, and returned to the school-room before I discovered the loss, for some money, which she had received of the children for schooling that morning; I was rather in a passion about it, understanding she had spoken to my wife in an improper manner about it, and I said,"Miss Smith, I should thank you for the money you have received this morning;" she replied that she had nothing to do with money matters at all, that she had given the money to her papa, who had gone out - he had left the house about twelve o'clock; I asked her about the desk-there was a very good desk in the room, and that was removed, and another put into its place; she said it was the same desk - I remarked that she behaved very singularly, in fact, like one almost out of her mind or intoxicated; she capered and danced about the room in a manner I could not understand.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then there had been a dispute between her and your wife about money she had received? A. No, I understand something had been said about it; to the best of my recollection I paid the 35l. across the table to Mrs. Smith, because she said she always had the money matters to do, and her husband said so too; I said before I opened the bag, that I was sure a great sum had been taken out - I made a memorandum of what was left in it, in a journal which I keep, within two days of the robbery, but within a few hours I made a memorandum on paper, and transcribed it into my journal, and here is a copy which I took from the journal two or three days ago; the porter who took the box is not here - here is the original memorandum - it is a leaf of the journal.</p>

I was sent for on the 15th of October; as I entered the passage the prisoner was close to the back parlour door - the prosecutor said he was robbed of twenty-five sovereigns; the prisoner seemed very much flurried, and desired me to take her - she threatened to run a knife into me, or to any Policeman who offered to touch her - Mr. Humphries hesitated what to do - he went to the station-house, and returned to give her in charge - she was then in the kitchen, and had fastened the door; I wished her to open it; she refused - I got in at the window, and found her sitting in a chair, with a small dessert knife in her hand; I secured her - Mrs. Humphries searched her at the station-house, and 2s. were found on her - she was taken before a Magistrate, and by his direction I searched the house; her mother and Mr. Humphries were present-I searched the front kitchen; there are two beds there - it was before three o'clock - the beds appeared to have been slept on; I saw her mother find fifteen sovereigns in a purse, with four half-crowns and five sixpences under her bed - she found two purses in a small pocket handkerchief, rolled up, and put between the two beds, which laid one on the other - I mean there are two beds for two different people to sleep in - I could not say whose bed it was; there was 4d. in coppers in the bead purse, and in the other fifteen sovereigns in one end, and 12s. 6d. in the other - I have them here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My father received the money from Humphries, and handed it to my mother, who gave it to me, as was customary; my mother has not for some years had the care of money; the whole has devolved on me - my father gave me a sovereign the same day; I kept the whole together, and put it between the beds in which I slept, which I always did, in consequence of an attempt having been made to break into our house; for the same reason I slept in the same room as my parents; on Sunday I gave my father 18l. to pay the rent and taxes - the Policeman found 2s. on me, and 15l. 12s. in the bed, making 34l.; the remainder I spent in house expenses.</p>

            . I am a labourer to Mr. Flowers, at the Eel-pie house, Limehouse. On the 20th of September I went to Whitechapel, up Draper's yard; Dexter showed me the stable where the horse was, and then I saw the prisoner - I said, "Does this horse belong to you?" he said Yes - I asked the price; he said nine guineas - Johnson was in the stable: I said, "I can't sell it at that price, but if you will bring it to my master, at the Eel-pie house, I could sell it this afternoon for you;" he said he did not know the way - my brother said he would show him, and they came down together; I said to him, "Put the horse into the stable - I cannot go with you yet;" I afterwards went to Bow with them, and called at the Black Swan - they stopped there while I took the horse to Pepper's, and we went over to Mingay's; he offered 7l. - I returned to the prisoner, who refused to take it - I said, "Come along and make your own deal;" he went, and Mingay bought the horse for 7l. 15s.; I was to be paid for it at eight o'clock - the prisoner waited there till half-past eight, and by and by Pepper arrived, and it was paid for; the prisoner made his mark to the receipt, and Pepper said he would have"Warranted sound" written on it - as he could not write I wrote it, and the prisoner made his mark to it; I gave him the money - he gave me 5s. for my trouble; we had four or five pots of hock beer there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you did not bargain about it as your own? A. I tried to sell it as my own - the Magistrate did not threaten to commit me; I generally sell in my own name - when Mingay said he would bring the money at eight o'clock, I said, "Don't disappoint us, for this man will want his money;" he knew before the money was paid that it did not belong to me; I sold it as one I had exchanged - I wrote "Warranted sound" on the receipt, as the prisoner directed me; I do not know who wrote the rest of the receipt.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended George about ten minutes before one o'clock on the morning of the 27th of October, in Albion-street, Commercial-road; I found a silver watch, six silver teaspoons, 9s., a 10l. note, and a 5l. note on him - all the property but the notes were in his pockets; he said the watch was his own, and that he found the spoons - he had something clenched in his left-hand; I asked what it was - he said only a piece of paper, but it turned out to be the two Bank notes; he afterwards said he had found all the property together in Finsbury-square, watch and all - there was a half-crown, and a sixpence among the silver.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Burton in Eagle-place - he is a chair-maker; I know Hamstead, but not the other. On Friday evening, the 26th of October, about five minutes to eight o'clock, I was there, and four persons came into the shop between five and six- our shop is about four doors from Robinson's; it was George, Hamstead, Buce, and Dennis - Buce and Dennis are neighbours; they generally came there to see us work; Buce and Dennis went back into the yard; the prisoners remained in the shop - master has only a yard behind the house; Dennis came out of the yard in about a quarter of an hour - I did not see Buce again; Dennis had something in his hand when he came back, I could not tell what it was; whatever he had, he must have left in the shop, for he took nothing out with him; he joined the prisoners, and they all three went out together: in about a quarter of an hour, master came in, and ordered them out, and as George went out, he threw a bundle of shoes under the bench, and left them there - they were translated shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked for your master? A. Three years; Hamstead lived about two minutes' walk from the shop - I saw them all four come in together; I saw nothing of Buce after he went into the yard - the prisoners did not go out till all three left together; I did not see Hamstead at our shop afterwards - I leave work at eight o'clock, leaving master there.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 23rd of November I saw the prisoner take one pair of shoes from one of the cases, and put them in his bag; I said nothing to him but told the street-keeper in about two minutes; he apprehended him and found three pair of shoes in his bag; I do not remember what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was you when you saw him take them? A. On the cellar stairs there is a door which was shut - it is bolted at the side; but I looked under the bottom, where the floor is worn away, there is a space of about an inch or half an inch; I stood down the stairs - the cases where about two yards from the door; he was standing up.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. Martin told me to stop the prisoner, and bring him back, when he came out of the shop, as he suspected he had robbed his master I stopped him, and asked what he had got in his bag; he said he had his work - I put my hand on his bag, and felt a pair of made up shoes; I said, "Have you got any made up shoes?" he said No - I said, "There is a pair here;" he said, "Yes, there is; I am going to take them to a customer in Tabernacle-square" - I then asked if he had got any more made shoes; he said No, and on feeling I found two more pairs - I took him into the shop, and he voluntarily said he had done it, but he did not know how he came to do it; I heard nobody say he had better confess; if it had been said I think I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say, if he confessed you would do all you could with his master not to hurt him? A. Not at the shop - in going to the Compter, I said the best thing he could do was to give his master information, as he had lost a deal of property; this was after he had said what he did.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAREN. I cannot say, in my confusion, whether I made him any threat or promise - I have no mark on these shoes; they were made for me, but I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Many shoes are bought from depots? A. If these are mine they came from a depot - I cannot swear to them, though I know they are mine.</p>

Yes; I did not see him go out, as I was down stairs - I only saw him take one pair; another young man was in the shop, but his back was turned - he was about a yard and a half from him, writing; the prisoner is an excellent workman - there is no jealousy between us.</p>

I went to show Mr. Maclaren a last, with part of my work fitted on it, for a lady I had a pair of shoes to make for; I had my bag under my arm; I remained in the shop a quarter of an hour, and brought the same things out in my bag as I had taken in - I got about seventy yards before Parker came to me; I told him I had shoes, and that I was going to take them to King's Head-court, White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAREN. He showed me a last for a lame foot; I had lost 230l. worth of property, and set a watch - I cannot say whether his bag was under his arm; I never suspected him.</p>

On the evening of the 27th of October the prisoner was at my shop; after she left I received information, and followed her - I found her in a street leading from her house towards the docks; I asked her what she had done with the gowns which she took away; she said she did not take any- I went with her to her house, but could not find them; I then gave charge of her - the four gowns were afterwards brought into my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you known her before? A. Yes; she is married, and has eight children; I did not know that her husband was ill in bed - I found nothing on her, nor in the way, but it was dark, and I could not see it.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Purser's shop on the 27th of October; I heard a noise, as if some hooks were breaking - I turned, and saw the prisoner pull some gowns down behind a sheet; I saw the sleeves of the gowns - she put them into her apron; I gave an alarm; she ran out, and went towards the West India-docks - I went after her with Mr. Purser; I am certain she is the person - I had seen her in the shop two or three times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there other persons in the shop? A. Yes, about a dozen; they were not near where the prisoner was - she was near the door; she did not return into the shop, and some persons said, "That is not the woman."</p>

In March last it was to let; on the 23rd of that month two ladies called about it, and in consequence of what they said I sent my son to the station-house - in the evening I went to the house in Richard-street, found the back shutter broken open, and eight sashes gone - I had seen them safe a few days before; on the 25th of March I went with Collins and King to the Hornsey-road, into a house belonging to the prisoner; the officer knew it to be his - I found two of my sashes in the first floor front room, near to the window - the house was nearly finished; it wanted sashes and painting only; we then went into a little back house, about twenty yards distant, and there I found two more sashes. concealed behind some wood - they were also mine, and were a portion of those stolen from my house in Richard-street; we then went to the prisoner's house, in Copenhagen-street - we found him at home -Collins asked for him, and he came out; Collins then asked him if he had any sashes; he said he had nothing of the kind, that he had nothing but some old lumber in the yard - the officer went into the yard, and I followed - he looked into the yard; there was nothing there, but on looking in at the kitchen window he saw some sashes; I looked at them, but did not know them then - we went into the kitchen, and I found them to be mine; they had been chopping at the tenons, as if to cut them off - one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290050"/>them is off, and the stile is taken off; there were some chips about - Mr. Smith came down into the kitchen, and the officer asked him how he came by the sashes - he said he could not tell what to say; the officer then said he had found four more sashes in his houses in the Hornsey-road; he still said he did not know what to say, and he said so several times on his road to the station-house; when he got there, he said to the officer who took it down that he had them of a man named Church, who lived at Bethnal-green; he had not mentioned that before - these are the sashes; I have no doubt they are mine; they were new when I bought the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know the prisoner? A. I knew him by having seen him in the next yard; I then thought him to be the father of the person who lived there - I have since heard he is a person of property; I went before Mr. Laing, the Magistrate, on the 26th of March - I did not state all that I have stated now - I was asked but very little; I did not state that the prisoner said he did not know what to say, but I belive it was stated by one of the officers - I will not swear it; I answered all the questions that were put to me; I cannot take upon me to swear that I did say that the prisoner could not tell what to say, but I think I did; the prisoner was discharged on giving his own security for 100l. - I think he appeared three times; I do not know that the Magistrate then discharged him altogether - orders were given to the officer to try and find the thief; I went before the Grand Jury last Session, as I found the thieves had not been discovered, and the house remained in a delapidated state - I had not been to the prisoner's house after the 25th of March; I went back to his house that day, as I did not know there was any one to tell his wife that he would not come back - I do not remember seeing his daughter there; I do not remember ordering his daughter out of the room, as I had something to say that I did not want any witnesses to- I have no recollection of the kind, but I will not swear that I did not; Mr. George Finch is a broker - he had lived for six months in the next house to mine, I never had any conversation with him; I did not know where he lived afterwards, but he came tampering with me; he did not say he had come in consequence of something I had said to the prisoner's wife - he called on me, and said he understood I particularly wished to see him; I swear I did not say I did not wish to see Mr. Smith, but I was surprised he should lay himself open to become the purchaser of such property; he did not say that the sashes should be replaced until the thief was taken - he came to me in the character of a house-agent, asked if my house was to let, and whether I was inclined to dispose of it - I said I had been very unfortunate with it, and that two tenants had gone away, and robbed me of nearly 50l. - I asked him what character he came in, for I was very doubtful of him, as I had seen him with the prisoner; I said I should have no objection to part with the house for 240l.; I did not say that I had a house to sell for 240l., and that he must understand what I meant, nor that people must expect to make sacrifices in the situation in which the prisoner was - I was too cautious, for I knew Finch's character too well; I did not say, if money was not quite convenient, there was plenty to be had on good security, at 5 per cent.; I told him if he found me a customer for the house, he should have his commission on it; I did not say I did not care who I sold it to, and of course all would end; I have no recollection of saying that I should trouble myself no more about the matter, as I was not bound over to prosecute, but I cannot take upon myself to say - I am seventy years of age, and my memory may not serve me - I have not been a prosecutor before; when Finch called on me the sashes were at Mr. Wormald's.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Finch came to you in the character of a house-agent? A. Yes; he said this was a very serious thing, and I said I wished to know what character he came in - he said he was a house-agent, and he understood I had a house to let; I did not send for him, nor did I send word that I wanted to see Smith; Finch said he understood my house was to let, or to be disposed of - I said I could not let it in that state, but if he could get me a customer for it, he would get his commission.</p>

             (Police-constable N 160). I went in company with the prosecutor to some premises in the Hornsey-road, which belong to the prisoner; we went into an unfinished house, and found some sashes in the first floor front room - the prosecutor identified them; we then went into another house at the back, which was also unfinished, and there found another pair of sashes behind some boards - the prosecutor identified them; we then proceeded to the prisoner's house in Copenhagen-street, about two miles from Hornsey-road; King, my brother officer, went into the house be fore me - when I went into the house, I asked Smith if he had any sashes - he said, No, he had none at all, he could assure me he had none, and he never kept any thing of the sort there, he kept them at his shed, or at his building; I then asked if he had a shed at the back of his house - he said No, but he had a yard with some old rubbish in it - I went immediately down into the yard - the prosecutor followed me - King was then gone; when I got into the yard I looked through the kitchen window, and saw some sashes standing in the middle of the room - Smith was then on the stairs; we proceeded to the kitchen, and found two sashes there, one of which was broken, and there were some chips on the ground; Puckeridge said he verily believed them to he his; I asked the prisoner how he came by them - he said he had bought them, and given 9d. or 9 1/2d. a foot for them; I told him I had found four others in the Hornsey-road - he said he had bought altogether seven or eight pairs; I took him to the station, and he there said he bought them of a man named John; he had before said he had bought them of a man named Church, and two or three of his men, and he afterwards said he bought them of Church's man, John.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you told us all that passed? A. Yes, to the best of my recollection; I was near to Mr. Puckeridge the whole time, and heard all that passed - the prisoner first said he had them of Church, and two or three of his men, and then he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290051"/>he had them of Church's man, John; he did say on the second occasion that he hardly knew what to say - this was when I found the two sashes in the kitchen; I do not know what he meant by it - I believe he is in a large way of business; I was before the Magistrate - there was but little stated there; I did not hear the prosecutor state what passed with the prisoner - I knew I could find the prisoner when I wanted him; the sashes were left at Mr. Wormald's - I told the prosecutor I would leave them there, and he made no answer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you seen the prisoner from the time he was discharged till the bill was found against him? A. Yes, twenty times, and I once asked him if he had found the man he had given a description of -I took two persons to him, and another person was pointed out to him, but he could not identify either of them; one of Church's men was taken to him, and Church was taken - he said that was not the person; he bought them of his man, John - John has not been taken; I cannot find him: I have been in the prisoner's house but once since he was taken.</p>

             (Police-constable N 248). I went with Collins, and the prosecutor to the Hornsey-road, and then to the prisoner's house; I saw the prisoner, and told him I had an unpleasant piece of business to state to him, and he asked me into the parlour - I then told him Mr. Puckeridge had lost a number of sashes from a house in Richard-street, and from information I had been to some houses belonging to him, in Hornsey-road, where I had found four sashes, and I asked how he became possessed of them - he said he bought them of a man named Church; I asked where he lived - he gave me a pen and ink, and a piece of paper, and I put down the address at Bethnal-green; in the mean time, Collins and the prosecutor came in; I had to be on duty at one o'clock, and left them: I went with

            . I live in Mount-row, Liverpool-road; I am a painter and glazier. I have had the care of these sashes; I have fitted them to the prosecutor's house in Richard-street, and they belong to it, to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose every house of the same size would require the same sized sashes? A. Yes, but here is one half-sash, I can swear to - it had been in the front parlour; I had seen it while it was in, and remarked it - I should think 9 1/2d. a foot, a fair price for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave a fair price for them, and bought them of Church's man; he told me he bought them from Church - I bought them on the 3rd of March, and had them till the 20th; I then sent them in the middle of the day up to the house at Hornsey.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLETT. I am chief clerk to the Magistrate at Hatton-garden. I took the examinations in this case on the 26th of March; I have no recollection of any statement being made, that the prisoner had given contrary accounts how he became possessed of them, or that he at first said he did not know what to say - the prisoner was discharged on his own recognizances to appear on the Saturday, which he did.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. May Collins have stated that the prisoner said he did not know what to say, and you not to take it down? A. He might, it was a very hasty examination, as the thief was not in custody.</p>

            . I am an appraiser, and live in George-place, Holloway. I know the prisoner; I called on Mr. Puckeridge, and had some conversation with him, in the course of which he said he did not particularly wish to see Mr. Smith, but he was surprised he should lay himself open to purchase such property - I told him the sashes should be replaced till the thief was taken; he said he had a house to sell for 240l., and I must understand what he meant - he said people must expect to make sacrifices in such cases as Mr. Smith's, and if money was not quite convenient, there were plenty to be had on good security at 5 per cent. - he said he did not care who he sold the house to, and of course all would end; he said he should have no house, nor trouble himself more about the matter, as he was not bound over to prosecute - I had before this been to Mr. Harmer, and told him what Mrs. Smith had said to me; he said it was a very delicate point, but there would be no impropriety in my going to Mr. Puckeridge, and telling him the sashes should be replaced till the thief was brought forward - I had only seen Mr. Puckeridge at the office when the case was brought forward; I was agent for Mr. Smith on several occasions: I know there was such a man as Church, and I had heard that Mr. Smith had dealt with him for sashes, and other things - I know Church had a servant named John or Jack; I have been to inquire for him, but cannot find him - we have offered a reward for any information about him; I went to inquire for Church about a fortnight or three weeks back - his house was shut, and I could get no account of him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you ever seen Jack? A. I saw him once with Church - I am in the service of Mr. Smith occasionally; he wished me to accompany him to the office - I had been once to a Police-office before, on a disputed levy; that was on Mr. Smith's account - I am agent for other persons, and for Mr. Williams, of Hatton-garden office - I swear most positively before God that I did not tell the prosecutor that the windows should be put in if he would forego the prosecution - I had retained Mr. Harmer as Mr. Smith's solicitor, at his request - then I went, by Mr. Harmer's advice, to the prosecutor, and proposed to replace the sashes - I knew they were at that time in possession of the officer; Mrs. Smith first requested me to go to Mr. Puckeridge, but I saw Mr. Smith about it before I went - I saw Church three or four weeks ago on some premises belonging to Mr. Smith, in George-yard, Islington; Mr. Smith said he must give him a job, that he might know where he was, and set him to solder a piece of iron - I lived next door to the house from which these sashes were taken, shortly before they were lost - I have to collect the rents of six houses in Pierpoint-rents for Mr. Sage, of Pimlico, and I have distrained on them twenty or thirty times - I live now in one of Mr. Smith's houses; I saw Jack in Liverpool-road with Church, and another man, about eight months ago - I have never seen him since; Church is a plumber, painter, and glazier.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you seen Church, Smith, and Jack together? A. Yes, and I heard Jack called by that name - I have not been retained by Smith as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290052"/>regular servant, but only to do such jobs as he desired me; I have been eight years an appraiser and broker - when Puckeridge said he had been at such considerable loss, I said I would undertake to replace the sashes as they were before, upon condition that if the thief was found, he should pay Mr. Smith any expence he had been at.</p>
               <p>JOHN STONE. I am a sawyer, and live in Sermon-lane, Liverpool-road. I know Church; he had two men in his employ who used to come to my house with him; one of the men was called Jack - I have not seen him since the beginning of March; he called at my house about that time, and brought two old sashes - he asked if Mr. Smith was at my house; I said No; he left the sashes about ten minutes, and then fetched them away.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What are you besides a sawyer? A. I keep a little beer shop, just at the back of the prosecutor's premises - Mr. Smith is in the habit of paying his men at my house very often; Smith knew Jack, and they have drank at my house frequently, but Church and his man were more frequently there than Smith was - I never saw Smith and Jack there without Church; I had no suspicion when these sashes were brought to my shop- I had worked for Mr. Smith - on the morning after the sashes were brought to my house a person named Davis told me they were improperly come by, and he believed he could point out the house from which they came - I have never seen Jack since the time he brought the sashes - Church and Smith came to my premises about a month ago; they had some beer, and talked together; I did not give any information when Davis told me what he did - I did not know Mr. Puckeridge; Davis showed me the place, but I did not go to the Police-station.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who is Davis? A. A shoemaker - he did not say he had seen them stolen, or knew who stole them, but he said he saw a man come into my house with them, and he thought something was wrong; I have seen Smith and Church since that time in company, but I have not seen Jack with them; I have never looked after Jack - I have seen Smith and Church together till within about a month; I have not looked for Church since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say to Davis, "I can tell you who was the man that stole them, it was Jack?" A. No - I had no idea that they were stolen.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you in the habit of buying sashes? A. Yes; I knew Church kept a new beer-shop next door to me, in the Hornsey-road, two years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are not these sashes worth a great deal more than 9d. a foot when fixed? A. Yes.</p>

On the night of the 4th of September my premises were on fire - I did not see the prisoner there at all; I had a great many pistols in bags - I have seen some which I believe to be the same as were in my counting-house.</p>

Perhaps about a week - I cannot swear that; I have only one young man in my employ who had the opportunity of selling goods; they are my own make - I keep a register of what I make; I have looked at it, and the number of these pistols is not down as being sold.</p>

             (Police-serjeant G 20). I saw the prisoner on the premises the night of the fire -I was in the counting-house; the prisoner produced some small bags that he was taking from some books - they were hanging round the counting-house; he passed them to me, and I said, "What are these?" he said, "Pistols;" I said,"What these little things?" he said, "They are, for I have seen them" - he handed several to me; I took care of what was handed to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known this man? A. Five or six months - he has borne a very good character and was in the Police.</p>

I bought these pistols of Hodges on the 14th of November, for 11s.; on the Wednesday night I went to buy some caps to try them at my leisure - I heard something from the person; I went to the prisoner, and asked how he came by them; he said he got them of a friend, a gentleman's servant - I asked if he was to be found, or where he was; he said he did not tell him, but his master's name was Stevens - I took him before my superintendent; he then said he got them of Mr. Barry, in King's-court - I then took Mr. Barry to the station, and he asked the prisoner if he got them of him, and he said, "No, I did not."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

In October last I returned to town, after a short absence: soon after I returned I missed these articles - I sleep at my chambers; she came at her usual time to remove my breakfast things - after the arrival of an officer, I inquired of her first what had become of the plate, which I missed from my chambers; she said she had removed it to her house for safety - I asked what she did that for, as I had told her not; I then asked what she had done with the two coal-scuttles - she said they were at her house; I then asked for the sheets: she said she had taken them to be washed - I said she had no right to remove them, as I had given her express directions not to do so, and insisted upon her accompanying the officer to her house, and giving them up - she became alarmed, and begged I would give her two or three days time, and they should be returned; I said I would not - she then said she had pawned part of them; I said she should go to her house, give up the duplicates of what she had pawned, and give up the other things, and they left for that purpose - they returned, and said they had not been to her house; there were sixteen or seventeen duplicates produced to me of my property, and some other property - I then went to the pawnbroker's, and found some of these things, but most of the property has since been produced at my house.</p>

On the 17th of October I was in the yard, where the poor of the parish of Shoreditch were breaking stones; Church was there, breaking stones - he took up a hammer and threw over the railings, and shortly afterwards I saw Green go over the bridge with it in his hand, putting it under his waistcoat.</p>

On the night of the 12th of November I fastened up my shop before I went to bed; I was alarmed in the night by some person getting down the shutters; I got up, and found one of the shutters down- I went out at the private door, and saw the prisoner crossing the road; I pursued, and gave an alarm, but I did not see him taken - I found one of the panes of glass in my shop window broken, and I saw a pair of boots at the watch-house, which are mine, and had been in my shop the night before; they had slipped the shutter down, without taking down the bar, then broken the glass, and taken out the boots, which stood on a shelf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were you the last person up that night? A. Yes - I saw the shop was fastened; the pins were in the bolts of the shutters, and the glass safe.</p>

            . I am an officer. These parcels were delivered to me - Mr. Mottram's name is on one of them; I went the next day where I understood the parcels were found, and found this other parcel, with Mr. Edenborough's name and address on it; on the 13th I went and saw the prisoner at the office; I asked him what he had done with the goods he had not pawned - he said he had thrown them into the canal; I questioned him further, and he said he had left them by the side of the canal - I asked where he lodged; he said, "At a public-house near Islington-gate;" I went there, and in a bed-room, which I had understood he had occupied, I found these marks, which had been on the goods.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. This is the paper in which one of the parcels was wrapped; some of these tickets have our marks on them, and were attached to the veils.</p>
               <p>MR. STONE. This is one of Mr. Edenborough's wrappers, and I believe it inclosed the parcel I gave to Carpenter - some of these tickets were on the goods - they have my writing on them; this veil is ours.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of November, I came home about twenty-five minutes before six o'clock, I was induced to go to Messrs. Marsden's office - I found the door shut - I went for the key to unlock it, but I found it was unlocked; I opened it, and went in to see if things were safe - I saw the prisoner in a little private room belonging to Mr. Marsden, standing with his back to the bureau, hiding the part which had been broken; he immediately rushed at me, and knocked the candle out of my hand - he did not succeed in getting by me, for I stopped him in the room, and called out Stop thief! and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290058"/>wife locked us into the room; he begged and prayed for mercy - he said I was a much older man than himself, and he would give me all the money he had, and for God's sake to let him go; when I found the room door was locked, I loosed him - he said, "O good God!" he ran to the window, and tore the blind up - I ran and seized him, and never let him go; he put his hand into his pocket, and dropped some picklock-keys, which the officer afterwards took up in my presence, and a clasp knife was found, which did not belong there; the drawer of the bureau was open, and a bundle of papers was afterwards brought in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know how these papers got out? A. No - if the prisoner had taken them out, he might have gone off; I did not try whether any of these keys would open the drawers - I think they are too large; I do not know who opened the drawers or the doors - the bureau had been forced open, and the lock off; the prisoner said before the Lord Mayor, that a person sent him to the place; I do not know whether I frightened him, but I did my best to keep him, and cried out Thieves!</p>

            . I was visiting Ilfracombe, in Devonshire - I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. -On the 9th of October I wrote a letter to Miss Hetherington, of No. 56, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, and enclosed in it a 5l. Bank note and a sixpence; I took the number of the note, but not the date - I delivered the letter with my own hands at the Post-office at Ilfracombe; I saw the post-master, and told him it contained a 5l. note -I saw him mark it as a money-letter: on my arriving in town on the 26th or 27th of October, I learnt from my friend that the letter had not arrived - I had written my name on the Bank note - (looking at one) this is my name and the Bank note I sent, and the number is the same, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You made a memorandum of the number? A. Yes, but I have lost it; I cannot recollect the number, but the writing on the note is mine - I had been at Ilfracombe about a month, and received the 5l. note there, from Mrs. Willis; I generally write my name on notes which I pay away - I had no other 5l. Bank note at Ilfracombe, nor for the last six months, and can positively say I have not written my name on a 5l. Bank note for the last twelve months; I may have been in possession of one since July, 1830; the date of the note, and have written my name on it, but do not remember; I only swear to this note by its having my name on it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You miss your memorandum, had you shown it to any body? A. Yes, I sent it to the General Post-office by Miss Hetherington; it was the memorandum I made at Ilfracombe - the name of Parminter on the note is my hand-writing; I have not put my Christian name - I remember omitting to do so, and writing the name on the note diagonally, as this is.</p>

            . In October last I lived at No. 56, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square - I did not receive any letter on the 12th from Miss Parminter, containing a 5l. note - I expected one, and attended for the postman that day. but he did not come; Miss Parminter some time afterwards gave me a paper with a number on it; I took it to the General Post-office, by her direction, and showed it to a clerk in the Secretary's-office - he took the number down on a paper, and returned me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290059"/>original paper; I do not recollect what I did with it - it is lost: I have looked for it - I do not recollect the number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep the house? A. No, I am in a situation there - seven or eight persons live in the house; there are two females and only one servant; the letters are delivered usually about half-past nine o'clock, except on Mondays; this was on Friday - I gave up expecting it about half-past ten, and paid no further attention to it; I afterwards went to the Post-office with the memorandum - I showed it to a person there; I gave it him to copy - he gave it to me back again immediately; I was not aware that it was the original memorandum, and do not know what I did with it; I did not return it to Miss Parminter - I have searched my writing-desk for it.</p>

            . In October last I was clerk of the money-book, in the Inland-office. On that morning I remember receiving some money-letters from Rollo; the addresses were entered in the money-book by my assistant - I signed my initials to the bill; (looking at it) here are my initials which I signed; I was assisted that morning by Mr. Hinton, as it was a heavy morning(Monday) - I gave the letters to Hinton to be entered in the book, and after he had entered them, I received them back from him; they were directed to different parties: he had about fifty of them - here is one money-letter entered in the book, in the name of Miss Hetherington, No. 56, Margaret-street, London - this was on the 12th of October; the entry is dated Friday, the 12th of October - I keep the letters till I deliver them to the letter-carrier, who produces receipts for them, corresponding with the directions; I cannot remember who the carrier was - I am not acquainted with their names; before or shortly after the addresses are entered, receipts are made out corresponding with the addresses, and delivered over to be sorted in the different divisions; after the letters are sorted in the different divisions, the amount of postage is counted up - the amount is first entered in a docket, and afterwards copied into a charge-book; the letter-carrier who tells it up with the officer, signs his initials to the paper - the carrier then has the letters not containing money, and receipts for the money-letters; he brings those receipts to me, and I deliver money-letters corresponding with the receipts - he enters his name in the book opposite the address, as an acknowledgment that he has received it; the name signed against the letter in question, appears to be J. Moulden; I know him by sight, but do not know his hand-writing - I cannot recollect who received the letters that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Hinton always assist in the office? A. No; it was a heavy morning: Saturday is almost as heavy a morning as Monday - Hinton is a clerk in the establishment; there are fifty or sixty letter-sorters: they all know they can get letters by producing the receipts, but they must sort them out of the regular course to get them - we only look to see that the receipt corresponds with the letters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a man whose name you knew brought a receipt in another name, would you deliver the letters to him? A. He must put his initials to it; any lettercarrier producing a receipt would have the letters - I do not know the men; there are two hundred and twenty carriers.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. The carrier's name is not on the receipt? A. No, if a carrier brings a receipt, I conclude it is in his division, and give him the letter on his signing the book - I knew the prisoner as a carrier, but did not know his name; he would know the manner of obtaining letters as well as the others.</p>

T. on it, I believe to be in the prisoner's handwriting; this is the docket for 1l. 8s. - here is G. T. in pencil; we take the initials in pencil from the carriers -I was afterwards present with Mr. Peacock and the prisoner; Mr. Peacock, the solicitor, showed him the initials in my presence, and said to him, "Did you tell this charge?" he said he did, and that the initials were his: Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, is in the walk of a man named Hazell, who is assistant to Moulden, they were the only two on the walk - it is not at all irregular for one letter-carrier to tell up a charge for another; it is done daily, for expedition sake - the prisoner's seat is in the first division of the letter-carrier's seat, No. 1; Moulden's seat is next to the prisoner - eight, ten, or twelve sit in that division; there is a small partition, about two inches high, between them: last October I remember the prisoner asking for leave of absence - I think it was about the 15th or 20th; he said he was going to Chichester, because he was unwell, and wished to go there, as his friends lived there- leave was granted him for about ten days; he had told me before that Chichester was his native place - I have often seen him write - (looking at the 5l. note) I believe this " G. Simes, 17, Spital-street, Guilford," on the front of the note to be his writing, but do not positively swear to it - here is the same name and address on the back; I believe that also to be his writing - there is no letter d in the word Guildford; I think both addresses are in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Carriers sometimes tell up the amount of postage for each other? A. They do if one is engaged at the moment the charge is called - they occasionally charge their seats in the division; while he was in that walk he would sit in that seat - I am present while they are engaged; the prisoner generally sat in the next seat to Moulden - I do not know that I can be positive he sat in that particular seat that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they each a desk? A. No, a small table - he could not occupy a seat in another division; each man has a table about two feet six inches wide, enclosed by a small partition - I have no doubt these two pencil letters are the prisoner's hand-writing; also the address on the front and back of the note - I have not a doubt of either of them being the prisoner's writing; I will swear the pencil letters are his - I do not consider it a disguised hand; the endorsement is not so natural as that on the front of the note, but still it is his - I consider it a little disguised; the note was first shown to me about the 25th of October - I am not certain who showed it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you told the particulars of the charge, and asked whose hand-writing you thought it? A. I believe the idea of it being the prisoner's hand-writing arose in my own office - there was no charge against the prisoner then: he was absent on leave at the time, and I wrote to him at Chichester to attend the office a certain day; I knew the note was supposed to be stolen when I was asked about the hand-writing - he admitted at once that he had told up the charge, and the initials were his; I am not quite certain whether he knew he was suspected at that time - he was told so at that meeting.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell whether the addresses were both put on the note at the same time? A. I cannot; I took a day or two to consider before I discovered the similarity of the prisoner's hand-writing; we referred to other carrier's hand-writings, the letter not being in his delivery - my assistant selected out the book, and then we made up our minds that it was his writing: my assistant (Hoskins) may have said to me "This is very like George Tucker's hand-writing" - I agreed with him; nobody desired me to say it was his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen the note before the assistant pointed it out to you? A. Yes; when it was first put into my hands I did not form an opinion of it - I had my opinion that it was his hand-writing without reference to any document, but it is usual in the office to refer to documents; directly my assistant told me his opinion I formed mine, without reference to any document.</p>

In October last I was a letter-carrier to the General Post-office; my walk was the Cavendish-square district - Margaret-street is in that walk; the letters there would be delivered by Hazel, my assistant. On the 12th of October I was on duty in the morning at the Post-office; if a letter had come directed to Miss Hetherington, it ought to have come into my possession - if it was a money-letter, the receipt of it would come into my hands first; I should have given Hazel the receipt for letters for delivery in Margaret-street, and he would take it to the clerk to get the letter; (looking at the book) here is the entry of Miss Hetherington's letter; I do not make the name signed against it to be "Moulden" - I do not know what to make of it; I am sure it is not my hand-writing: no such money-letter came into my possession on the 12th of October - I know the prisoner very well; he sat by my side in the office on the 12th of October; when I deliver letters to Hazel, I tell the postage up; Tucker has been in the habit of telling the letters up for me almost every morning; I do not recollect whether he did so that morning or not - he brought in the second charges for me that morning: some letters were sorted for Hazel from this charge; if there had been a receipt for a money-letter in that charge, he would have an opportunity of taking it; the letters delivered to Hazel corresponded with the charge of 1l. 8s. - I cannot say whether I told them up that day or not, but if the prisoner had told them up, and told me, I should have put it down; when the prisoner told them up, I put down the amount, without looking to see if it is right; I always trusted to Tucker - on that morning he brought out the second charge; when I deliver over the letters to Hazel, I do not check them to see that he has the letters named in it - I trusted to Tucker's word; I do not know whether Hazel has them.</p>

               <p>Q. On that morning did you deliver the other charge? A. Yes, and such of this charge as had the letters which were for my part of the delivery I delivered; I have seen Tucker write several times; "

            Simes," &amp;c. on the front of this note, I believe to be Tucker's writing; I do not know whose this is on the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290061"/>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner brought out the second charge, amounting to 28s.? A. Yes - I mean he brought it out from the office, which is about a dozen yards from where I received it - he had to go into another office for it; I did not see him tell over the charge - he does that in another office, not the one I was in; he has to cross another office to bring the letters to me - receipts are not so bulky as letters, merely slips of paper mixed with the letters; if he dropped a receipt the charge would be wrong when retold; if he told me it was correct, I should take his word, without retelling it; I have seen him write almost every morning for the last six or seven months - I first saw the Bank note last Tuesday week; when I was asked if I knew the hand-writing I knew the object of the question; I believe the writing in front to be his - I can say nothing of the back; I think they are written by different persons - I was not shown any of the prisoner's writing to compare with it; but last Tuesday I looked at the mail-cart book, with his writing in it, to see if it corresponded with his writing or not; I did not ask for it - it was shown to me: the signature was 
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1124">G. </persName>
            Tucker: I looked at it to see if it agreed with the name of Moulden, not with the name on the note - Mr. Critchett never gave his opinion of it before me; the prisoner always sat next to me, and in one place in the division: he did not change his seat while with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 12th of October there were two charges? A. Yes; Hazel brought out the first charge, which was 2l. 5s. 8d. - I checked that with him, to see if it was right; Tucker brought out the second, and I trusted to him to tell me the amount - I received the letters from him, which I delivered; I checked with Hazel those I delivered; I have several Members of Parliament on my beat- they have gone out of town, and I have got Tucker to write me their directions, to send their letters on; I have seen him write a great many directions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive the letters you delivered from Moulden himself? A. I believe not; I received part of them from Tucker; I do not examine the letters to see if they agree with the bill; I saw that my letters were the same as they were charged to me, which I could tell by reference to my own books, I found mine were 13s. 5d. - I ascertained that was correct; I believe I received the letters from Tucker - I looked them over before I left the office, to see that the 13s. 5d. was correct; I knew nothing of the other part of the charge.</p>

            . I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers at the Post-office. I have known the prisoner eighteen months - I have received letters from him, and am acquainted with his hand-writing - he is assistant carrier to the Bedford and Fitzroy-square walk; the letters in that walk are generally all delivered by eleven, or between eleven and twelve o'clock on common days - I believe this "
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1130">G. </persName>
            Simes," &amp;c. on the front of this note to be the prisoner's handwriting - I never corresponded with him; I received two letters from him on official business, stating that he was too ill to attend his duty, and have seen him sign his name to the dockets - he only signed "
               <persName id="t18321129-118-person1131">G. </persName>
            Tucker." I have also seen him write his name when he entered the returned letters; that entry contained in his handwriting the address on the letters, and his signature; I have no knowledge of the character of his handwriting but by comparison; I saw this note first about a fortnight ago; the suspicion on my mind when I first saw the note was, that it was the prisoner's independent of any comparison - it was previous to my comparing it; my mind was chiefly made up when I first saw it - I believed it then to he his; the writing on the back of this note seem to me precisely the same, and I believe it is the same hand-writing - I believe it to be the prisoner's; I remember giving an order last November, for all the carriers to be on duty in the evening - it was in the morning I gave the order, it was the day before the prisoner was apprehended - he was present when I gave the order - I was close to his seat when I gave the order - I gave it aloud to every one who went out - he must have heard it, they were to attend that evening - he did not attend in the evening; I have reason to believe all the others were there, all that could possibly be there - I am sure the prisoner was not; I cannot be positive whether all the others did attend; I had heard of the charge against the prisoner - they were merely called together, as two clerks were to come to recognize a person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told the whole party as they went out to attend? A. They were all told of it round their several divisions - and as they went out, I told them individually; nothing was said about the cause of their attending - the prisoner had returned from Chichester on the Monday previous, in consequence of a letter sent to him - the note was first shown to me by one of (Mr. Stow's) the president's clerk; I did not then know the prisoner was suspected, and had no reason to suspect it, not till about a fortnight after - two other persons have been suspected, but not of this identical act; the writing both on the back and front of the note, I believe to be the prisoner's, and his natural writing - I afterwards compared it with the book to convince my mind further of it; my opinion was more confirmed by the comparison - the prisoner's district<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290062"/>is not a very large one; he might be engaged on a heavy day, till about twelve o'clock or a little after.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. Was it in consequence of seeing the hand-writing on the note that you first suspected the prisoner? Yes, I had heard nobody say they conceived it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day did the prisoner come from Chichester, in consequence of being written to? A. On the Monday; he was on duty that day, and was taken up on the Tuesday - it was on the Monday I told him to attend in the evening.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Though he did not attend in the evening, did he come to duty as usual next morning? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he stopped to speak to a person whom he knew? A. No, he was asked that question by Mr. Peacock, and he said he did not; that he only stopped while the horses were changed - not, that he stopped at a house; after denying knowing any body at Guildford, Mr. Peacock asked if he knew a person named Simes there - he said he did not; I asked him no questions till I took him to Mr. Peacock - I afterwards asked him the same questions as Mr. Peacock, and he told me he knew nobody at Guildford; that was after I took him to the office.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Although some circumstances may appear to place my conduct in a suspicious light, yet do I solemnly assure you that I am innocent. I never knew any person of the name of Simes in my life; nor did I know there was such a street as Spital-street in Guildford, for I have only called on Mr. Pink there a few times, merely in passing to and from Chichester, where my friends reside; but, if the fact, as it now appears that Mr. Pink lives in Spital-street, shall, from its unfortunate coincidence with the address upon the note, appear to press against me, does it not also furnish a strong argument in favour of my innocence, furnishing, as it was likely to do, a certain clue to detection: if, indeed, I were guilty, (the serious consequences of which every person in the post-office is well aware of) is it probable I should have obeyed, as I instantly did, the summons to attend at that establishment, or would not a natural impulse have induced me to seek for safety in flight; I attended at the Post-office, and was there informed of the charge against me, yet I voluntarily remained to meet it - gave readily and candidly every explanation in my power, nor did I hesitate to write the name and address required by the Post-office solicitor, although if I had really committed this offence I must have well known I was thereby promoting my own condemnation: I need hardly observe that nothing is more fallacious than the opinions which are formed upon hand-writing, nor would any person he safe if such a test were for a moment to be depended upon by a Jury.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint. The shilling produced is counterfeit - this is part of a mould for the obverse side of a shilling; I have examined it, and it appears the counterfeit shilling has been cast in this mould - there are two scratches across the nose which are in the mould, as well as on the shilling - the mould is made of plaster of Paris; here is also the broken part of a mould, having a portion of the reverse side of a shilling; it is also made of plaster of Paris, and appears to be a portion of the same mould - here is a bag of plaster of Paris; I cannot say whether the reverse side of the shilling has been cast in the mould, but the two parts of the mould fit together - these spoons are Britannia metal, the same as the shilling is made of; the metal which fell from the pipkin is the same metal - the files are used to remove any roughness from the shilling after it is cast - here is white metal in the teeth of these files; the shilling bears a fac-simile impression of a genuine one.</p>

               <p>MR. LAZARUS. This comb is mine, and was taken from a cupboard - I had seventy dozen of them; the stockings are marked with my warehouse mark on them - the shifts are also marked with the warehouse mark; they never were sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the things before I lived with the prosecutor, and have had them two years.</p>
               <p>LEWIS LAZARUS. I had four or five hundred of these shifts; I sometimes sell goods with the shop-mark on them, but at times I cross them off - my sister sells in my absence; these stockings I bought since the prisoner has been in my employ.</p>

            . I am a City-officer. On Sunday morning, the 18th of November, I was on the approach to London-bridge, on the City side, about a quarter to eight o'clock - I saw the prisoner Shipps with a bag<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290065"/>over his shoulder, between some new buildings in Miles-lane; I crossed over to ask what he had got, and missed him - I walked towards Cannon-street, and when I got to the top of the lane I saw him and Cain together; Cain had a parcel under his arm and a bag - Skipps still had his bag over his shoulder; I followed them till I saw Evans - I spoke to him; we followed them - he went after Skipps, and I went after Cain, and asked what he had got - he said,"Only a piece of wood;" I opened the bag, and found it was a dial - while I was doing so he ran away; there was nobody to leave the dial with or to stop him, and he got away; I got information, and found him in a house in Fryingpan-alley - I took a pair of shoes off his feet, which the prosecutor identified; I passed down Cannon-street, and met Wilckes with a bag over his shoulder - I stopped him, and asked what he had got; he said I might look - I took him to the watch-house, and found six coats in it, and some boots and shoes; he was dressed in a coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes, and hat, which are identified by the prosecutors - in his pocket were various articles, which are claimed also.</p>
               <p>JOSIAH EVANS. I am a street-keeper. I have heard Parish's evidence - it is correct; I secured Skipps, and asked him what he had got - he said some plums; I asked what else - he said nothing else; I said, "I shall look in your bag;" he said I had better, if I was not satisfied: I found he had got figs, plums, and nutmegs, in the bag - I took a pair of shoes off him at the watch-house, and he had got some bad coins in his shoes.</p>

             (City Policeman No. 71). On Friday, the 16th of November, I met Eveson on Holborn-hill with this bundle - I asked what he had got there; he said he would not tell me, and dared me to stop him in the street, for he was going on business - it was twelve o'clock in the day; I said I had some suspicion that the bundle was stolen, and he must go to the watch-house - he went a little way, then said he would not go, but I made him go; on getting there, before I opened the bundle, I asked him what was in it - he said shawls; I asked how many: he said he believed there were ten - I asked where he got them from; he said he brought them from a person named Hawkins, at No. 39, London-wall - I asked if they belonged to Hawkins; he said No - I asked if they belonged to himself; he said No - I asked where he was going to take them: he said no where - I asked if he hawked them about; he said No - I said, "Whose are they then?" he waited a few minutes, then said they were a person's named Harris, but he did not know the young man, nor his Christain name, nor where he was to be found; I asked what he was himself - he said he was a plumber and glazier out of employ; I then gave him into custody of a brother officer - I went to No. 39, London-wall, and saw Mrs. Hawkins, I went to the first floor room, and there found two small bits of paper, which I produce; I have kept them ever since - I brought the shawls to the prosecutor, and marked them before I parted with them at all; these are the same shawls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. He first mentioned Hawkins? A. Yes; he afterwards said he did not have them from him.</p>

On the 1st of November I saw a handkerchief of ours on her; I spoke to her about it; she put her hand to her bosom - I insisted upon seeing what it was - she at first refused, but afterwards produced a duplicate; she said it was for her own shawl, which she had pawned - I looked at it, and found it was for a shawl and a boa; I gave it to my husband - I went to her bed-room, which was open, and found a fur tippet, a scarf, and a pair of black silk hose - these articles were kept in the shop; at the office two combs were produced from her hair, which are ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not promise if she would confess, you would not be severe with her? A. I said if she had not taken any thing else- she told me about the boa after a long time.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of November I went with Mr. Humphreys to No. 60, Snowhill - the house was to let; I saw Mury McCarty, and asked if she had a daughter living in Oxford-street, with Mr. Humphreys; she said she had a daughter living in Oxford-street, but she could not tell the person's name; I said I came to search the place; she said I was welcome, that her daughter brought a bundle of things the day before to wash, and they were in the wash - I found some stockings and other things; I went a little higher, and broke open a box, where I found the goods, some glasses, two china dogs, an India handkerchief, a cambric handkerchief, a waiter, a scarf, two crape handkerchiefs, two pairs of slippers, and other things - I asked

            , I observed Brown driving a waggon in Wigmore-street; I lifted up the tarpauling, and saw the leg of a man - I followed the waggon, which went up Edward-street, into Portman-square - the horses were stopped in Baker-street, by the prisoner Brown; I did not hear him speak, but thought he did -I observed his lips moving; he immediately drove the horses on, and I saw Brotheridge come from under the tarpauling in his shirt-sleeves; I told Brown to stop the horses, which he did - I got up into the waggon, and Brotheridge said, "So help me God, master, all is right;" I found the bung of the hogshead of sugar half way up, and found this bag; he said, it was only a little he had got for his own use - they said they were going to deliver it; I asked Brotheridge what he had been doing there - he said he had been asleep; I said it was strange to go to sleep without his jacket and hat - the waggon went to Mr. Salter's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any person present at this conversation? A. Yes, Sayers and my brother officer, who was not bound over - Sayers is not here; I did not ask Brown whose servant he was, but I asked if Brotheridge was regularly employed, and he said No.</p>

On the 28th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, Brown came into the shop, and said he had brought two hogsheads of sugar, that a very unpleasant circumstance had occurred, for he had brought a man to assist him, and the Policeman had discovered that he had been taking sugar out of the hogshead; I thought it was a trifling circumstance, and desired the waggon to be brought to the door; I then saw several Policeman, and one in the waggon, who was examining the nose-bags; they then showed me the hogshead - the tin was off the drawing-hole, and some lumps of moist sugar were in the waggon - the tin had been forcibly removed, but was not entirely taken off; I took a sample from the bag and the hogshead - there were 22 1/2 lbs. of sugar in the bag; we did not weigh the hogshead, but it was nearly full, and as full as many hogsheads - we found it was a rocky hogshead, being in large lumps, so that if the tin had been removed, this quantity of sugar could not have got out without some hand - I received the hogsheads from Clark, the carman; I had paid 72l. for them, but he was answerable for the safe delivery.</p>

            . I am the regular driver of Mr. Thomas Clark's waggon - I was employed on his account to remove this sugar; on the 15th of November; I took in one hogshead at the East London-docks, and one at the West India-dock - they were in a perfect state, and the tin safe over the bung; I met with an accident, from a pully falling on me, and employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290068"/>Brown to drive the waggon, and gave my papers to the foreman to deliver my load - they were quite safe when I received them, and I do not think the tins could have been chafed off - I should have gone alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not the custom sometimes for a carman to ask another to give him a lift? A. Yes, I could not have taken out the hogsheads myself, but there are men standing about in the trade, and sometimes the grocers men would do it; the tins will chafe off at times in going along; I have known Brown three years - he bore an honest character; I know Mr. Clark's name is Thomas, by his bills, and his name is on the waggon - he has no partner.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer and house-agent -I live in Seymour-place. In July the prisoner Jones called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290070"/>on me; I had seen him before - he told me he was about a house at 200l. a year in Connaught-terrace, and he wished me to go over the inventory, to see if it was correct; he did not take that house; but I afterwards arranged to let him Mrs. De Windt's house - he said he was a respectable person, and could give me the best of references; that when he was at home he resided at Carno, North Wales - he afterwards said he was connected with an extensive mining concern in North Wales; he called on me afterwards, said he had seen Mrs. De Windt, that all was settled, and he was to have possession; I forget whether I sent a man with him or not, but he said he expected his housekeeper in town, and she would be ready there to take possession - I saw him after that, when he said he had taken possession, and found every thing quite correct; he afterwards appointed me his secretary for his mining concerns; and I must confess, I looked upon him as a very wealthy individual.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Was it you who recommended him to Mrs. De Windt, as an eligible person? A. Certainly not - they became known to each other by some other means.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Is the inventory in your possession? A. Yes; Jones had altered the windows by taking out old sashes and putting in new ones - Mr. Watts, who put them in, told me they were not paid for; Jones talked of making other alterations - the locks which were put on appeared to me to be a sort of lock I had never seen before; he paid me very few attentions - he did not give me time to receive them; from July till the 17th of September, I never saw him at all - it was about three weeks after he had been in the house, that I called and heard his wife was ill; I did not accept him as my future husband, unless he could prove himself to be what he had stated - I never wrote letters to him in tender terms; I think I wrote one note to him signed with my Christian name only - I went with him in a carriage to

I do not know what entered his mind, I never authorized him to manage and deal with my temporal affairs; I said just now I would not swear I had not, because you confused me - there was no jealousy on his part from my having received the visits of a younger man; Mr. Cole called on me one evening, when Jones was with me - I left the keys of other locks in the house - I could not swear to a key - I do not think either of these keys would unlock the bookcase.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D 11.) I went to No. 2, Bryanstone-street, on the 8th of November - we found Hicks at the attic door; the inspector asked if she had been in Mr. Jones' employ; she said Yes - we asked where he was; she said she did not know; we began to search her, and I saw this duplicate drop from her - I picked it up; it is for some furniture, pawned the night before for 1l. 1s.; we found nine keys, eight cups and saucers, a slop-basin, sugar-basin, and three egg-cups, which the prosecutrix claims - we went into the next attic, and found Boone in bed; we found Jones on the top of the house, on the tiles - he was not dressed; he had only a frock coat on, and a pair of light trousers - I found some men's clothes in Boone's bed-room, and Jones put them on - he said, "What I have done I must answer for; the things are all pawned, not sold - these women you have no occasion to take into custody; what they have done is by my orders, and I exonerate them."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Were not the duplicates given up? A. Yes; I did not hear him say he did it from temporary distress.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police. I went with the officer; what he has stated is correct: on searching Jones I found this pocket-book, containing some mining shares - he said it was no use looking in his pockets for duplicates; if I would go with him, he would produce them - we went to the Delaware Arms, and asked the servant for a parcel he left there, and gave me sixty-four duplicates, saying they belonged to Mrs. De Windt's property - part of it has been given up.</p>
               <p>MRS. DE WINDT. This letter is in Jones' writing - I received it - (read.)</p>
               <p>MADAM, - I hope that that religion, and that God whom you so devoulty worship, will incline you to adopt towards my truly sorrowful mind a degree of mercy. I never had the slightest thought of doing wrong towards you, whom I really did, I may say worship - but this I must only now think of in my repentant mind, for having pledged your goods. In your religion you will find the noble happiness to be derived from compassion and mercy. There is still a chair and glass to be restored to you, which I had forgot, but shall not be so on Wednesday; also six cups and saucers, three or four plates, and part of a glass there, I am taking means to obtain and deliver. O spare me the continuance of a further agony, most mental agony, but sincere penitent.</p>

            . I am a dealer in potatoes, and live in Oxford-street. There was a large quantity of potatoes consigned to me by Mr. Rogers, and on the Sunday he directed me to search the barges after they were unloaded - they were unloaded on the 31st of October; Brandram then had the care of the barges - his master and I went and examined them; we went into the cabin of one barge, and found a quantity of potatoes in a drawer - they were similar to those I had received; there were about 2 cwt. or 2 1/2 cwt. found altogether, and about 2 cwt. of them I can swear to - Mr. Gore lifted up a seat in the cabin, which formed a sort of locker, and found a quantity of potatoes in a sack, marked with Mr. Rogers' name, and Iver on it; we found in the forehold about 1 1/2cwt. in a sack, marked Lovegrove, of Reading - I have no doubt that they were all of the same sort and quality as mine, and the soil which clung to them appeared the same- there was another man in the other boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Do you know which boat Brandram went in? A. He was on board the one in which the potatoes were found.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he say any thing about them? A. He said he bought them of a man; Mr. Gore and myself both asked whose man it was - he said one of Mr. Rogers' men.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were you sober? A. Yes, I was pretty near; I had been working in the fields sometimes, and sometimes in the barges - I did not go to the cabin, nor carry any potatoes; I did not attend before the Magistrate, but a person did who is not here.</p>

I said Yes - he said he knew all about it; we went to a public-house, and drank two or three pints of porter - he then said if he was prepared with means he could produce the papers at nine o'clock in the morning; I said, "What means?" he said about 12s. - I went out, and told the Policemen to meet me in disguise; I then went and told Hutton to meet me at the Black Jack at seven o'clock - I went there, and he then said he would go to a person who had the papers; I advanced him 10s., and he was to bring them at nine o'clock in the morning - I went, but he was not there; a young woman said, "Are you the person who is waiting for William?" I said Yes; she said, "Come with me, and I will put you into the place where he is:" she took me to a room, where I found him in bed - he said he could not succeed, for a person had offered a sovereign for them; I told him not to let any person have them, and to meet me at the Black Jack at four o'clock; I went there with the officers - Hutton came and sat down by me, and said he had not succeeded; I began to think he knew nothing about it, but he said, to convince me that he did, there was the duplicate of the coat - he put it into my hand, and the officer seized him.</p>
               <p>Hutton. Q. Were you not in the habit of coming to the room I live in? A. I do not know where you live - I never saw you at the room but once; there was an old lady, who told me she would do all in her power to get the papers; I might have given her liquor - I did not say I had a 5l. note that was got queer; I said I had a 5l. note but no silver - I had a man with me, to see how you acted- I did not borrow money of that man; I had the 10s. from the prosecutor; I said I had been to the house two or three times myself, and was afraid to go again, but if you could get the papers - I would reward you for your trouble - I certainly believed there were persons in the house who knew of the robbery; when I returned the duplicate you were taken immediately - I did not see any persons pulling you about.</p>

The prosecutor met me, and asked if he could go home with me; I said Yes, and we went home - Reeves was in bed; I asked her to get up - he asked for no other place; he sent for some liquor, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290074"/>I fetched - he went to sleep, and I went to meet Reeves; on my return - I heard there was an alarm - I said I was guilty of taking the things, but I would not make my escape; I went out, and met Honest Bill - he took me to a place, and searched the coat; then he went back, and searched the man; I then met Condy, and told him all that was passed - he said it was very wrong; I gave him the coat to mind till the next morning, and then he said what money could be made of it I should have; we then went to Douglass', and left the boots - we then met Honest Bill again; I was going to give him something to drink, and he snatched the whole of the money from my hand, and ran away.</p>

               <p>Hearn's Defence. The young man who had the coat and boots used to live with this girl - I know nothing of it, but having the piece of paper, I cannot read, and I tore it up.</p>

             (Police-constable H 91.) I received information, and took the prisoner, from Haggatt's description, in George-yard; I had been in search of him for a week - he strictly denied it - he said a small boy took it; I said,"Yes, a small boy took it, gave it to you, and you run away with it;" the Magistrate thought there was not sufficient evidence to commit the other boy.</p>

             (Police-constable N 221). On the evening of the 30th of October, I stopped the prisoner in a field behind the Caledonian-school, at Holloway - he had a female with him; he had a truck, in which were two deals, and two were on his shoulder - I asked what he was going to do with them - he said to take them to the owner, but he did not know his name, nor where he lived; I took him to the station, and then he said he brought them from his own home; on the following morning, I traced the mark of the truck-wheels from the place where I stopped him, to Mr. Haswell's premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not tell you where he worked; and ask you to accompany him to the place where the man who had brought them to him to cut, was? A. No, he said he had cut twenty-one flats for the man before, and had a farthing a foot for them, but he did not know his name; and about an hour after he was locked up, the woman brought a man with her to own the deals - I asked him what he was; he said a carpenter, and he was building a small hut at the back of the Caledonian school, that he gave the prisoner the deals to cut, and he bought them in Little Coram-place; he said the prisoner had never cut any deals for him before - I did not detain him, as he promised to attend in the morning, but he did not come; I went to Coram-place, but could find no timber yard there - I afterwards found the residence of the man who came to own the deals, and found he was a sawyer out of work; I took him, and he was reprimnnded - when I took him he said, "My God! I know nothing about the deals - the woman who was represented as the prisoner's wife came and begged me to own them."</p>

            . I am a mason, and live at the corner of Park-lane. I was employed at the stable where the prosecutor's timber stood - I went to the prosecutor for the key of it; I fastened the door and put the key in the place where we usually put it - the next morning I found the stable locked, and the key gone; I climbed up, and got a sight of the place - the position of the deals was altered, and there appeared to be some gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many men had access to those premises? A. Only myself; I had not counted the deals.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. I received a load of deals from Mr. Loraine - there were three tiers of twelve feet deals, fifteen pine planks, and some others; the Policeman applied to me - I looked and missed four planks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had those been what you received? A. No. I received twelve feet deals, and I missed four pine planks - these are pine planks.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor allowed him to saw planks for other people when not fully employed; that a man had brought those in question to him to saw; and after laying in the yard three days, he was taking them to Copenhagen-street to be cut, as he was fully occupied with work. - He received a good character.</p>

            . I am a sawyer and worked with the prisoner. I recollect his being taken; a few days before that, a man came to the pit, and asked him to cut some deals for him into planks, and the prisoner said Yes he would; the next day the prisoner showed me four of these pine planks near the pit; this is one of them - they were there two days, and he asked me to help him cut them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see these? A. In Mr. Haswell's stable - there were some deals there; I did not assist the prisoner, because it was dark - I am not the man who went to the station-house.</p>

On the 23rd of September I was at the desk, and the prisoner saw me; there was a considerable sum of money before me; on Friday, the 2nd of November, I had above 123l. in the desk, and several small sums besides, belonging to a particular charity, and wrapped in different papers - I cannot be certain of the amount - and there were some Bank notes which were not taken - I saw my money safe at a quarter before four o'clock - I was to have handed the money over to the treasurer that day, but the Sabbath set in, and it was too late - I intended to take it to him on Saturday night - on the Friday evening, about half-past five o'clock, after I came home, I went up stairs to look for a letter, and found my desk broken open - I had been away about an hour and three-quarters; all this money was gone - the Bank notes were left - my wife's drawer was broken open, and a watch, a pair of ear-rings, a gold neck chain, and 16l. in money, taken - my wife keeps the key of the drawer - I made an alarm, and in consequence of what passed between my boy and I, I got an officer - I saw the prisoner at the office next morning; I have not been able to find any of my property - there was an empty house next door to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons had you in family? A. Seven; myself and wife, my son, his wife, a servant, and two young men: one who attends to the confectionary, and the other is my son's foreman, who is a printer - we occupy two houses; there is an internal communication between them - about six young men are employed in the printing-office; my desk, and my wife's drawer were locked.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it dark between a quarter to four o'clock and half-past six? A. Yes; only one workman was left in the printing-office: the others had left at half-past three - I made the money good to the charity out of my own pocket.</p>

            . I live in Leman-street, next door to the prosecutor, in the house which was to let. The prisoner applied to me on the 31st of October, to look at the house for a beer-shop; he went over the house - I went up to the first floor, and left him to go up higher himself; I heard him up stairs, and when he came down, he asked me if the cellar door opened into the street - I said No; he went into the cellar, put up the flap, and asked me about the fastenings - I told him the rent was 44l.; he said it was 40l., and that he should bring his old woman, or his wife to look at it - he came again on the Friday following, but I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A coachman; I have lived in the house about two months; only my wife lived in the house with me - I drove for Mr. Hill, a stagecoach master, of Highgate; I left him twelve or fourteen years ago - I have been with my son since that, not as a coachman; he is a coach-spring maker, and lives in Mortimer-market.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday, the 2nd of November, I was at home when the prisoner and his mother came together, about four or five o'clock: I was at tea; the prisoner said he had been there before, and he knew the way up stairs, and did not wish me to go up - I said I should go too, and went up with them to the top of the house; he came down just before us: the front of the house being shut up, he went forward to the street door to give us some light, as the passage was dark; he went out, and I saw no more of him - his mother and I stopped talking together some time at the street door - I did not see him go out; he could not get up stairs without my seeing him.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On Tuesday morning, at two o'clock, I was passing up Wych-street, on the right-hand side of the way, towards the Olympic theatre; I saw four or five men scuffling or fighting on the right-hand side, and on the left-hand side I saw two men, who proved to be the prisoner and the deceased - I saw Read push or strike James in the chest - he instantly fell; I ran, and took the prisoner into custody, and sprung my rattle for assistance; Lewin came up - I told him to look to James, and said I believed he was dead; I directed Lewin to bring him to the station-house if he got better, to give charge of the prisoner; I took the prisoner to the station - James was brought to the station, and Spencer followed; James did not seem much hurt at the station-house - he said, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had lost his handkerchief, and that the prisoner was not the man who struck him; I said, "If you choose to give charge of him I will answer to his being the man who struck you;" James was the worse for liquor - there is no doubt of the prisoner being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290078"/>the man who struck him; there was an oyster-shop open on the right-hand side of the way, which threw a light on them, and I seized him immediately - I was within ten yards of them when the blow was given; after James was brought to the station I turned his head back to the gas, and saw on the back of his head the cut he had received by the fall - it did not appear very serious.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were assembled? A. About five on the right-hand side, and two on the left - it was in a narrow part, near Newcastle-street, but still it is the widest part of the street; I was coming from the Strand towards Newcastle-street - the light was nearer to me than the prisoner - it threw a reflection on the two on the opposite side; what took place might have been seen by the persons in the oyster-shop - the deceased would be as likely to see the person who struck him as I; I did not tell the Magistrate I had locked him up because he would not give the prisoner in charge; they were all three taken before the Magistrate, and fined 1s. each - Spencer did not request me to send for a medical man to the deceased; it happened near Lyon's-inn, under the dead wall - there was a general fight on the right-hand side, but on the left I did not see James strike at all.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the deceased and the prisoner separated from the others? A. Yes; the light from the oyster-shop reflected on the dead wall - I took the prisoner at the deceased's feet, as he fell; there was no other person so near - the inspector locked them up for being intoxicated; after the prisoner was discharged from Bow-street, he said that it was perfectly right, and that he had struck James; and when I took him on the Corner's warrant, he said he did push him down, but did not think any thing serious would happen to him - I saw his hands go against the deceased's chest, and he instantly fell.</p>

            . I am a nurse to the Middlesex-hospital. I remember Charles James being brought there on the evening of the 1st of November - Spencer called two or three times to see him; he seemed rather in an insensible state when he was brought to the hospital - he was attended by Mr. Pagson, the house-surgeon; he died on Thursday, the 8th of November.</p>
               <p>MILWOOD PAGSON. I am house-surgeon at Middlesex-hospital. Charles James was brought there; I attended him - his death was occasioned by the injury done to his brain; there was a slight would on the back of his head, but which was not connected with the fracture: on the post mortem examination an extensive fracture of the skull was found, and the bone slightly depressed; I do not think the fracture to be produced by a fall - it must have been from a blow, or by falling on the head, and coming in contact with some hard substance; the fracture began on the right side of the head - there was a concussion of the brain, which would be produced by a violent fall against a hard substance; the only external appearance was the wound on the back part.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the pressure of the skullbone on the brain produce death? A. No - there was a clot of coagulated blood on the brain, and a fracture opposite it, on the other side; I should say the two together produced death, but not the wound on the back of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the concussion and fracture arise from the same act as produced the mark on the head? A. I should say they were different - I do not think the fall on the pavement produced the mark on the back of the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The fracture on one side, and the concussion on the other, would arise from the same cause? A. Yes, that is very common; the wound on the back of the head was very slight, and might be occasioned by a fall or blow.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose the fall to have produced the fracture and concussion, would he be likely to be insensible from it at the time? A. He might or might not- it is probable.</p>

            . I am a working-jeweller. I saw the whole transaction; I was perfectly sober - I was standing at my door at two o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner's party forced the deceased and Spencer against Ruthven's shutters; Spencer lifted up his hands to resent it, and he was immediately bit between his eyes, and knocked down, and likewise James - they had not given the slightest provocation; they were coming along quietly, arm-in-arm - the deceased retreated across the road, on the defensive - and about the curb-stone the prisoner hit him on the bottom of the throat, and knocked him down on his back, against the curb-stone; the prisoner appeared one of the party who first attacked them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was a late hour to be at your door? A. I am later than that sometimes - I have two shops; there were four or five in the prisoner's party - the pavement is narrow; Spencer and James were arm-in-arm, and would be likely to force persons off the pavement.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they attempt to force any body off? A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say whether that deep penetration arose from putridity after death, or would it have been so if you had examined it immediately after death? A. It could not have arisen from putridity; in my opinion, if I had taken the plaister off previous to death, the same appearances as to depth would have been exhibited - it appeared to me that the injury of the head had been produced by some irritating application - and there was no other cause to account for death; I attribute the death to the injury done to the head by some external application - I attribute it to the sloughing; it was impossible, from the state of the plaister, to form a judgment of what it was composed, it was in that state of filth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you left the child, on the 4th of November, it was in a general state of disease? A. Yes; it had a scald-head, and the humour showed itself in various parts of the body; scaldhead is extremely prevalent now - I have several under my care; the scalp was thicker than a shilling; the part which was penetrated may be as thick as half a crown, or thicker - the flesh was swollen; it might be thicker than half a crown; when the child was alive it was getting rapidly well under my care; I expected it would have been well in five or six weeks; I had stated to the parents the improvement in its health.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a very innocent plaister, kept on too long, cause ulceration, by becoming dry? A. A plaster of an adhesive quality, by being taken off after being kept on too long, might break the skin - if I directed a plaister to be kept on two days, and it was kept on five, I should think that was neglect.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you first saw the child had it a plaister? A. No; it was then under Dr. Sims; I applied no plaister to it - the mother told me it had been under the care of many medical men.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger and live near Manchester-square. The deceased was my child - her name was Mary Elizabeth; my wife took her to Highgate on the 7th of November - I did not go with her; I saw the child when she brought her home - when she went out she was in bodily health; she had a few sores, on her head and a few blotches and sores in different parts of the body - when she returned she had a plaister, which covered the whole of her head, except her temples and face; the child was at home on the 4th of November, and Mr. Carter saw it - she gradually grew worse from the day the plaister was applied to her head; the 10th of November was appointed for her to go to Mrs. Spiller's again, as I understood, but it being a very wet morning, I did not take her till the morning of the 11th, (Sunday) I saw Mrs. Spiller; she took the plaister off the head, and applied another plaister to it; I told her the day being very wet, and the child being very ill, I deferred coming till then, and she said it was of no consequence - I took the child home again; that plaister remained on till Tuesday afternoon, when I took her again, by appointment - I saw the prisoner; the child had been very ill between Sunday and Tuesday, she was lightheaded and not on her legs all day, and she had eat nothing from the time the plaister was applied - except one small bit of bread; on Friday after the first plaister was applied she got light-headed at night - when I went to Mrs. Spiller's on Sunday, I said she had been light-headed, and her appetite quite failed; she told me to give her a little gin and water, or brandy and water, or beer, or ale - that any thing nourishing would keep her alive - and she said the same on Tuesday; I asked her if any other medical assistance was wanted, telling her the state she was in - she said, "No, have patience and your child will be better, you will see her better in a day or two;" but the second day after she expired: after the Saturday night, Mrs. Spiller desired a few drops of laudanum might be given her, as my wife said, and on that Saturday night she had laudanum given to her, and on the Sunday night - five or six drops each night; on the Tuesday she applied a fresh plaister, and gave me a box of ointment, and some lint for my wife to apply a plaister on the Thursday morning, which was done - she put it on on the Thursday morning; after it was put on, the child screamed dreadfully, and was very light-headed indeed -I was obliged to shut my shop door, for she screamed so dreadfully until between one and two o'clock; it began directly after the plaister was applied, which was between nine and ten - she died on that Thursday (the 15th of November,) between 4 and 5 in the afternoon; she seemed a little easier on Thursday morning, before the plaister was put on, and took some barley in water - my wife gave her some sago and beef-tea; I was recommended to the prisoner by Mr. Beckley, a grocer, in David-street, Oxford-street - I paid the prisoner on Sunday, the 11th of November, 1s. 6d. for the plaister, and 1s. for the box of ointment, which my wife had to rub the various parts which were affected.</p>

I told her why - she said it was of no consequence; Sunday was a very fine morning - I carried the child to Camden-town; I then put her into a cab. I got there about ten minutes to six o'clock on the Tuesday evening - it was a foggy day, but warm, and she was properly wrapped up; I took her in a cart - she was not exposed to the air, but had a cloak and blankets over her; she got light-headed and feverish on Friday, and got worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of taking her in the open air, why not get Mrs. Spiller to come to her? A. I understood she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290080"/>never came to see patients - I did not ask her to come; she had been under three doctors before I went to the prisoner; I was perfectly satisfied with Mr. Carter as to the head, but there were blotches and sores in different parts of her body; I was anxious to try for the best - it is nearly eighteen months since she first had the disease - she was two years and eight months old.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any of the medical gentlemen express, in your hearing, that the complaint was incurable? A. No.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I assisted Mr. Carter in the post mortem examination; the general appearances of the body were healthy, except a few spots on the joints - the body did not appear at all reduced - it was not at all emaciated; the interior appeared perfectly healthy - there was no organic disease; there were a few eruptions of the joints, I could scarcely give them a name - there was a plaister on the head, spread on lint, I think, but will not swear it was not leather - I could not tell what it was composed of; it was removed in my presence, and the head washed with soap and water - it appeared at first sight quite pulpy, and disorganized; on a closer examination, I found a deep ulcer at the back of the head, extending nearly to the bone; on the left temple there was another ulcer, but not so large; I removed the scalp - the inner surface of it was highly inflamed, and in some parts ulcerated; the dura maler very firmly adhered to the inner surface of the skull, which is very common with infants, and I do not consider it a cause of death; the adhesion was greater than natural at that age; I will not say it arose from any topical application, but rather from long-continued irritation of the surface of the head, during the eighteen months it had been ill; I can say confidently, that could not cause death; we carefully examined the brain, and found little or no effusion - there was nothing in the brain to cause death; my opinion is, that the child died from irritation produced by the extensive disease of the scalp, excited by some irritating cause, and that from a recent period - I could not say how recent.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the father's account, and that of Dr. Carter - might not the irritation and excitement, and the inflammation it would produce, have commenced long before the child was placed under the prisoner's hands? A. I should think not; I think the irritation proceeded from the same exciting application.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What depth was the wound on the back of the head? A. It extended from the surface to the skull; it might be an eighth or a quarter of an inch; the part the plaister covered was ulcerated through, and I should think the other wound was under the plaister - the plaister was over the ulceration on the temple, I am sure; it might be rather above the temple; there were three or four lacerations, and the whole surface pulpulated - I consider the whole irritation of the scalp to have caused the death; that disease could not be going on while it was under the doctors - I presume the cause of death occurred from the period she was under the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you take on yourself to say that? A. I will not - I only know from the evidence of the child being apparently in good health.</p>

            . I am the child's mother, It was two years and eight months old; it had been afflicted with this scorbutic attack for nearly eighteen months - it came out at first, I think, about six months before I applied to any medical man; it made its appearance first at the ears, and extended afterwards to the body - it had not made its appearance on the body when I applied to a medical man; Dr. Sims was the first gentleman I applied to - he wrote for it; I only took it to him twice - he said it was very simple, and gave me an ointment to apply; I used that about six months - she continued getting a little worse, and I then took her into the country; that brought it out a great deal worse on the head, but not on the body: I had a doctor while I was in the country, and he gave her two or three powders - she seemed better; I brought her home, and after some time went to Dr. Mclntyre - she was under him for a month or five weeks, and the breaking out came on her joints when I took her to him - she was much the same when I left him; I continued by his prescriptions until Mr. Carter saw her; she got much better under him- I first applied to the prisoner on the 7th of November; I went to her in the Archway-road, and saw her - that was on Wednesday; I showed her the child's head, and asked if she could make a cure of it - she said she could; she said it was a scald-head, and affected the body all over, it must have its head shaved - she sent her servant with me to have it shaved, and when done I washed it with soap and water there; she then put a plaister on it: she did not tell me what it was; it was spread on lint - it was a light chesnut brown plaister; after putting it on she said she generally did these things by contract - that I was to give her a sovereign down, and two more when the child was cured; I said she should have told me so, for I had not the money with me - I did not pay her then; she said the plaister would make her very ill, and make her head all sore, for the humour must be all drawn out in the head - that the places which were healed up were bad flesh, and it must be all drawn out; I asked if there was any medicine required - she said I might give her a little cooling magnesia, if required; I asked if I need be particular in her diet - she said No, I might give her any thing, I might give her a little weak brandy and water, or gin and water, and she offered to give it a little gin and water then - I refused that, and she said I might give her a little laudanum; I said it was dangerous to give landanum to a baby: she asked its age, and said I might give it from five to six drops - she did not say how often; she said it was to lull the pain, and make her sleep - she said she must see it two or three times a week; I asked if she could not come and see it, as I had got a young baby, and could not come so far - she said No, she never went out; I was to let her see her again on Saturday - her appetite failed her directly, and on Friday she was taken with a giddiness in her head; she was very giddy, and continued getting very ill: Saturday was very wet, and on Sunday my husband took her again; the plaister remained on her head till she went to Highgate - I never saw the prisoner afterwards; when my husband brought her home on Sunday she was taken with a violent reteching, almost directly that she returned - I had given her nothing; the retching continued the whole day - she brought off her stomach all that she had drank, and then it went off; I had given her arrow-root,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290081"/>made with water - I got it at the grocer's opposite where I live; I gave it her in the morning, before she went to Mrs. Spiller's - I gave her nothing when she returned; she continued ill all day, and on Monday she was worse; she had no appetite, and seemed quite exhausted and faint from fatigue - she complained of her head, and wished me to take the plaister off, but I did not: on Monday she was quite light-headed all night, and all day on Tuesday, and on Tuesday night she went to Mrs. Spiller's again with her father - I did not think that she was in a fit state to go out, but Mrs. Spiller telling me she did not go out, we were obliged to take her; I wrapped her up in several things, put her into my great cloak, and covered her over, head and all - no evening air could get to her; she returned at a quarter or nearly half-past six o'clock at night - they left home about five: she was very bad indeed on her return, and on Wednesday still continued worse - she was very bad on Thursday indeed, and at five o'clock that day died: she had a different plaister on her head on her return from the prisoner's, and some lint and ointment was brought for me to spread another, and to apply on the Thursday morning, which I did; she seemed exhausted at her return from Highgate, and slept for an hour or two that night, at intervals - the vomiting did not come on again, but she could not bear any thing with milk in it; I gave her a little beef-tea, barley-water, gruel, and sago; after the plaister had been on on Thursday morning about half an hour, she was taken in a screaming way, from pain - she complained of pain, and told me to take the plaister off, and it would make her well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Your child was thirty-two months old? A. Yes; it got worse after I took her out of town; it spread over her body - I had not shaved the head then - I cut away the hair as the sore places spread; the doctor in the country attended her for a week; she then got better, and I removed her to town - she then got worse, and I took her to Dr. Mclntyre, and while under him it broke out in her joints - she was under Dr. Carter for six or seven weeks; I had no doubt she would get better under him, but I took her to the prisoner by my husband's advice; I put on one plaister myself from the ointment he sent; I have kept none of the ointment; she lost her appetite from the first day she went to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. She had nothing to eat while she was under the prisoner's care? A. Only a bit of bread and butter which Mrs. Spiller gave her; she lived upon drinks, but got very thin - she had arrow-root, gruel, and beef-tea every day - she could not take food - I put on the last plaister about ten o'clock in the morning, and she died at five in the evening - I did not think it right to call in a medical gentleman while the prisoner was attending her, as she said she would be better in a day or two, and she kept saying so to the last - when I went to her she said she would be ill - I naturally thought that she was doing right - I had heard she had performed such wonderful cures - I sent a message to Dr. Carter on Sunday to say she was gone to Highgate; my husband expected the horse and cart to take her in the day-time on Tuesday, but the horse was engaged till the evening - I gave her two spoonsful of brandy and water on Sunday, which stopped the sickness - when I put on the last plaster she was very bad - I did not send for any body to look at her - I have not spoken to Mr. Carter since the inquest.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). No one can regret more than myself the death of the poor child, but my conscience acquits me of all blame; I used the same remedy I had successfully used to many others, and had hoped the same result, but for the inattention to, and neglect of, my directions. Upon the first occasion, when the child was brought to me, it was in a very black and emaciated state, and as I understood had been under medical advice, without relief for a considerable time; it was on a Wednesday when the child was first brought to me, and I desired that I might again see it on the Friday, instead of which it was not brought until the Sunday, and the plaister I had put on had got hard; I told the father he ought to have come on the Friday, he excused himself by saying he was busy on that day, and as Saturday was wet, his wife would not allow him to bring the child out; I then dressed the child's head, and particularly desired the father to come again to me on the Tuesday morning, but my directions were again unattended to, for the child was not brought until near eight o'clock at night, which was cold and foggy; and as I afterwards heard taken to the father's house in Marylebone, from my house in the Archway, road Highgate, in an open cart, and on the Thursday morning following it died. I shall call before you many persons who have been relieved and cured by me, and who will tell you how incapable I am of an unkind act.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses who had been under the prisoner's care for scrofula disorders, deposed to her skilful, humane, and kind treatment.</p>

            . I am a publican. I have known the prisoner some years; he came to my house last Saturday week at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and called for a glass of ale - he gave me a sovereign in payment; I had no change - he then gave me eight more sovereigns, and asked me to take charge of them for a short time; he went out, and returned in a short time with Mr. Quicksley, a tailor, and asked me for three sovereigns, which I gave him, and he paid Quicksley 3l. 9s.; he took four half-crowns out of his pocket - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290083"/>returned again in half an hour with Quicksley, and got the six sovereigns; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, for many years as a respectable man; he bore an honest character, and was a milkman - he has six children.</p>

            . I am a tailor: I have known the prisoner twenty years; he was formerly a cooper. On Saturday morning he came to me for a suit of clothes which I sold him; he bought things which came to 3l. 9s. 6d. - he said he had money next door, at Mrs. Bargeman's; he took me there; I got 3l. from Mrs. Bargeman, and he gave me the silver - he wished me to go afterwards, and fetch the 6l. from Bargeman's, and give it to my wife, as he did not like to leave it there, for fear of spending it in drink - I did so; I went into the country, and during my absence he had 3l. 19s; I have 1l. 9s. left - I have known him twenty years; he has been three times in Bethlem to my knowledge: liquor has that effect on him.</p>

I had seen this 50l. note in my possession, on the Tuesday or Wednesday previous to Thursday, the 25th of October, when I missed it; it was in a bag in an iron safe, in my counting-house: the iron chest was locked part of the day - I opened it, when I wanted a book, and I might have left the counting-house, leaving the key in the chest; it must have been taken out of the iron chest - I stopped it at the Bank, and advertised it; it was No. 9295, dated September the 1st, 1832 - I have not seen it since; I never saw the prisoner before, the Bank note was lost - I received information from Jones, and went to his house on the Monday following; I went to the prisoner's house twice, but did not see him - I then applied to Prendergrass, and he went with me to a street in which was the court, the prisoner lived in; I waited in the street while he went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe you first considered the note was accidentally lost? A. My confidence in my servants was so great, I could not make up my mind that it was stolen, and having had it in my pocket a day or two after I received it, I thought I must have lost it, and advertised it accordingly, offering 10l. reward, and stating the number, date, and amount - it was to be brought to Mr. Biggs, No. 41, Hounsditch (looking at a newspaper, dated 27th of October) this is the advertisement; I afterwards had reason to alter my opinion; I missed the note late on the night of the 25th; I called at the prisoner's house on the Monday after the advertisement, in consequence of a communication from Mr. Jones and Mr. Biggs; I found Levy was not at home; I left word for the prisoner that I called about the 50l. note, and he called at my house the following day - I had called on him twice, but had not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state to you that he knew nothing about the 50l. note? A. He did not - my memory will not enable me to recollect what was said; he said something about a porter who formerly lived with me; he merely said, "I have come about this 50l. note; have you a porter in your employ named

            . I live with my uncle in Raven row, Spitalfields - he is a grocer. On Friday, the 26th of October, Mrs. Battye came to the shop about three or four o'clock in the afternoon with a 50l. note in her hand, and asked our young man to give her change - I gave her change for it - I knew her before perfectly well; I did not know of the prosecutor's loss then - she bought nothing - I gave her the full change; on Saturday morning, I saw an advertisement in the Times respecting the note; I sent for Mr. Levy, who I knew before - Battye had said she had come from Levy; the prisoner came into the shop - I asked him to walk into the counting-house, which he did; I said to him "I gave you the change for a 50l. note on Saturday, which I hope you will give me back;" he said, "What is the matter? is it a forged one?" I said,"No, but I hope and trust you will give it me back;" he said, "I will give you 20l. which I have in my pocket-book, and will go and fetch you the rest directly;" this was about nine o'clock in the morning; he gave me the 20l. and then asked me what was the matter - I said, "It is a lost note, and you will get something by it now, for there is 10l. reward offered for it;" he went and brought me the 30l. and I returned him the note; I am certain it was the same number and date as the note advertised - I compared them before I delivered it to him - he said he should take it back to the person; I said, "You will get the 10l. reward;" he said he wanted to get nothing by it -(he is a master boot and shoemaker) I said to him,"How did you come by it;" he said, that he and another picked it up in Houndsditch on the Thursday morning - he did not say who the other person was - I did not ask him; when I gave him the note, he followed it up, and pointed out where it had been trod den upon - it had either been trod on, or got dirty in a person's pocket - I have never seen the note since; my uncle was out of town - he returned late on the Saturday evening; I mentioned this to him on the Sunday - I went to Levy on the Monday morning, and said, "Well Mr. Levy, have you taken back the note" - he said,"Yes, I gave it to the person I took it of;" he did not say who that was; I said, "I thought you meant to take it back to the person who lost it" he said he did not mean any such thing as that, but meant to give it to the person he had it from - and said he would give me the person's address from whom he had it, but he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290084"/>should like to see the person first himself - he said he could not see him till after nine o'clock at night, as he was out to work, and after that he would call on me at half-past nine - he did not call; I did not receive from him any address or description of the other person, till I was at the Police-office - he was taken up the next day; I went twice on the Monday with Mr. Chidwick, but he was not at home; Mr. Levy called on me on Tuesday morning, about ten o'clock, and said,"What do you want with me, Mr. Jones?" I said,"I do not want you," hut said that Mr. Biggs or Mr Chidwick wanted to see him respecting the note; he went away, saying he would go there - I did not see him again till he was at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said he would go to Mr. Biggs? A. To him or Mr. Chidwick; I cannot say which he meant - I did not think myself entitled to any of the reward; had I not known him to be a respectable man I should not have given change - he lives in a private house; he came to me with the change - and afterwards on the Tuesday - I believe he went to the Police-office of his own accord - he went with Biggs and Chidwick; I had known Mrs. Battye some years - there was no concealment where she brought the note from; I stated at the second examination about his saying he had picked the note up - I did not think it necessary to state it before, but at the second examination the Magistrate asked what he said; I did not go to Mr. Biggs when I saw the advertisement, because I gave 
               <persName id="t18321129-158-person1480">Levy</persName>
             the opportunity - I should have thought it very unhandsome to have gone without seeing Levy; I had a right to the 50l. back - there was nothing to prevent his absconding if he thought proper; the Magistrate admitted him to bail at the third examination, and he has surrendered here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the 50l. note after you returned it to the prisoner? A. Never.</p>

             a long time; I got change for it, and took it home to my own room - I gave it to Levy; he did not pay me the 10s. 6d. - I did not speak to him about it; he has not paid it, to my knowledge - I did not ask how he came by the note, nor did he tell me; he went out of the room, and I did not see any thing more of him till Prendergrass fetched me; I went to the office, and was examined there; I do not know how he got the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe he is in a large way of business? A. Yes - he employs a good many people; I work for him - he came to my room on this occasion; I did not go to him - he did not tell me to go to Jones, nor ask me to get change; he held the note in his hand, and said if he had change for it he would pay my husband - I took it out of his hand, and got change; he did not desire me to conceal it - I am well known in the neighbourhood to be in his employ; I brought him forty sovereigns and two 5l. notes - I did not ask where he got the note; I should consider him too respectable for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his saying, "This is not mine?" A. Yes - I remember his saying those words when he took the change out of my hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say whose it was? A. No; I should have gone for the change if he had asked me, if he had said nothing about paying my husband; I am in the habit of going to Jones for change.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 30th of October, the prisoner surrendered himself to me at Lambeth-street office; I told him there was information laid at the office about his having a 50l. note, and questioned him - he said he should not state any thing to me, but before the Magistrate he would state the particulars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Perhaps you know the character of the prisoner? A. I have made inquiry, and find he bears a very honest industrious character - he surrendered at the office; I did not see the prosecutor with him then, but I did almost immediately after; he made a statement at the office - I had been to his house with Mr. Chidwick about half-past ten o'clock on Tuesday morning; he was not at home - I saw his brother, and left a message for him, that I had called about the note, and he surrendered in about two hours.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and live in Raven-row, Spitalfields. On Saturday, the 27th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, Mr. Jones brought the Times newspaper to me, and desired me to step into the house, which I did; while I was there Levy came in - I went into the counting-house with him and Jones; Levy put down 30l. in gold, which made 50l. altogether on the table, as there were two 5l. notes and 10l. in gold laying on the table previous to my going in -I took a 50l. note in my hands which laid on the table, and said to Levy, "This note is advertised - of course you know who you took it of;" he said, "I found it;" he took the note in his hands, and doubled it twice, putting a soiled part to the back of it - and said that to ascertain whether it was good, he had sent to Mr. Jones for change; I held the newspaper in my hand, and said, "If you found this note you have the claim for the reward;" I put the newspaper before him, and showed him the address where it was to be taken to, and with that we separated - he said he had found it; I have not seen the note since - he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290085"/>not say when he had found it, nor whether he was alone at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean to say the questions were put to him by you, and not Jones? A. I put them as I have stated; I do not recollect Jones putting any questions - I am certain my questions and answers are correct; I made no memorandum of them, but am sure I am correct - I am certain he said he found the note: I was there the whole time - I was not precisely attending to all that passed, but what I have said is correct; I attended to no other part of the conversation - the whole might occupy fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The only remark that will fall from me is simply this - Mr. Lee called on me on Friday afternoon, and asked me to obtain for him change for a 50l. note, which I did, and on Saturday morning Jones told me it was advertised; I immediately returned him the change, and told him I should take the note and return it to Lee, who I had it from.</p>
               <p>RHIMA LEVY. I am the prisoner's mother. I remember Lee being at my son's house on the last Sunday in October, and I myself gave Lee the 50l. note which I fetched down from my drawer; my son had given it to me the day before, when he received it from Jones; I cannot say at what time I gave it to Lee - it was between light and dark; I got the 50l. note from a drawer, where I put it when my son gave it to me, when he came back from Mr. Jones'; when I gave the note to Lee I told him he should go and receive the reward - he then left the house; Moses Levy and Catherine Abrahams were present.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first get the 50l. note? A. On the Saturday, the day before; I cannot read, nor can I read writing at all - I knew it was a 50l. note, because I knew the number; I cannot remember the number.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the number, if you cannot read? A. I cannot tell - I knew there was a reward offered, because my son had read the paper, and sent Lee to go and get it - my son was present when I gave the note to Lee - I had never seen the fellow before - my son was never acquainted with him I am certain; he knew his wife, by her binding shoes for him - I did not know he was her husband; my son said, "Get down the note mother, and give it to this man; it is his, and he found it." - I did not go to the office with my son on Tuesday; I cannot say when I first gave this account - I am so forgetful and aged - I have not seen Lee nor the note since -Abrahams is my niece - she and Mr. Levy were present when I gave the note to Lee, and told him to go and get the reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterward inquire if Lee had got the reward? A. Yes, when Mr. Jones came on Monday morning - I do not know where Lee lived - my son knew.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and live in the same house with him - I am a boot and shoemaker, but our business is separate. I do not know how the note came into his possession; I was at his house on Sunday, the 28th; I did not know Lee personally, but there came a knock at the door in the morning - I opened it, and a man was there - I asked what he wanted; he said, "It is of no great consequence, I wanted to see your brother;" - my brother was not at home; he did not go away - he did not see my brother; he went away, and returned again - my brother was not at home then - he came again in the evening part, and saw my brother between four and five o'clock - my brother had not come home the second time, but when he went out he met him, and they both returned together - my brother said,"Mother, you know the 50l. note I gave you yesterday morning - go up stairs and fetch it, and give it to Mr. Lee;" - my mother went up, fetched the note, and delivered it into Mr. Lee's hands; I had no opportunity of seeing what note it was, nor the amount; I could see it was a note; my brother said to Mr. Lee, "There is a reward for this note of 10l.; go to Mr. Biggs, No. 41, Houndsditch, and be sure to receive the reward" - I did not know Lee nor his wife, nor where they lived.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what time did your brother return with Lee on Sunday? A. Between four and five o'clock; I cannot say what sort of a day it was; it was between light and dark on the 28th; I did not ask to look at the note; my mother can read, but not well; she cannot read writing; she can read a plain book; I had a candle at that time to do my work; I was at work in the opposite room; the transaction took up about four or five minutes; it was on the ground floor - I did not learn from my brother where the Lee's lived; when the inquiry was made, I understood they lived at the Tenter-ground; my mother is rather infirm; I went with my brother to the office; I did not go with him, but I was at the office; he was there about half an hour before me - I cannot say at what time I went there; it was before dinner - we dine sometimes at three, and sometimes at two o'clock; I had no communication with the Justice - I was in the office when my brother was there, but not when he was held to bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your brother without seeing the end of it? A. I was rather too late; he had been held to bail before I got there; he did not walk home with me; Mr. Levy and Mr. Thomas were his bail - I gave no account of this at the office; I gave this account previously, when the brief was drawn up; I was not present when the brief was drawn up, but I was when it was finished - that was last Thursday; I did not mention this to any body from the Tuesday, when my brother surrendered, down to the 28th of November; my brother did not show me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Mr. Jones or Mr. Chidwick they were very wrong in thinking your brother had received the note, knowing it to be stolen, because he had returned it to Lee? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever see Jones or Chidwick after the Sunday? A. I saw Jones on Monday evening, and told him the note was delivered to Lee then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said before that you had not mentioned it till the brief was drawn, last Thursday? A. I mean I did not speak to any body about the concern till the brief was made out - I mentioned it to nobody but Jones: I did not understand you before.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. After your brother was held to bail, was there any further hearing, or was the whole business finished that day? A. He was twice before the Magistrate: first on Wednesday, and again on the Thursday - he was only at the office once.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290086"/>Q. Was it on the Tuesday after the Sunday that you went to the office, found you were too late, and that your brother was held to bail? A. Yes; there was an examination on the Saturday following - he was held to bail on the Thursday; I was not present when he was bailed, and cannot exactly say when it was; I was there only on the Tuesday - he did not come home then, but was detained: he was not bailed that day - I mentioned nothing at the office, as I did not hear any thing about it then; I knew he was in custody on suspicion of having the note, but said nothing at the office of what I knew.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Levy's house on Saturday, the 28th of October - I was present when Mrs. Levy delivered the 50l. note into Mr. Lee's hands, by desire of her son; I did not know Lee before; I was sitting with the prisoner's mother, and saw the prisoner come in - nothing passed then; a man came in, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, and Levy said to his mother, "Mother, this is the man the 50l. note belongs to; fetch it down, and give it to him, and he will go and receive the reward;" the name of Lee was mentioned, or else I did not know him - Lee went away, but Levy told him to deliver the note to Biggs, and he would get the 10l. reward.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Levy was at home - is he your brother? A. No, my cousin - he had been at home, as near as I can guess, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before Lee came in; it was a little before five o'clock - I am quite sure Levy had been at home ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before Lee came - it was about that, not above ten minutes; nobody came into the house with Lee - I am certain Levy did not come in with him; I am positive of it - I saw the note in Mrs. Levy's hands when she brought it down stairs; I saw a 50l. note in her hands - she said it was 50l.; I had not the note in my hands - I saw it near enough to know it was a 50l. note, but not to see the number; I am certain it was a 50l. note; I did not read the note, but when Lee took it in his hand, he said, "Oh, this is the 50l. note," and Levy said, "Mind you go and receive the reward of 10l.;" I could see the mark of 50l. on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it marked? A. The same as notes are - in figures, I think, but I did not notice it.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not notice it how can you tell it was a 50l. note? A. Because at the time I saw it I could explain it, but I did not know I should be called on about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see "fifty" in words or figures? A. I do not exactly recollect; Mr. Lee looked over it twice, and repeated that it was 50l.</p>
               <p>Q. He might tell you a falsehood? A. That is not my fault; the prisoner said, "Here is the 50l. note - mind you take it, and receive the 10l.;" he said, "I will certainly take it where you tell me, and come back and let you know;" I was not living at the prisoner's at the time, but am more there than at home - I did not go to the office; I knew nothing of it till he was bailed - I was then very angry, and said, "Why did not you send to me in Leman-street, and I would have come?" I did not know he was in trouble at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Levy come into the house or into the room? A. I saw him come into the room where I was, through the street door, and in ten minutes after Lee came - I am certain Levy came in ten minutes before Lee.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Levy in the room with you ten minutes before Lee? A. He was - he might have gone into another room for a minute or two, but there was nobody in the house but Mr. Levy, me, his mother, and brother; I am certain he must have been in the house ten minutes before Lee came.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I found these feet between the bed and the sacking, in the front room - the prisoner's wife and I were present, and I believe no one else; I asked the prisoner how he could account for the feet being between the bed and the sacking - he said he could not account for it, but his wife said, "This is his first offence - I hope he will be forgiven;" he told her to say nothing - some time after he said they were left there by some man, and he would produce that man at the office, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not add that the man called in his absence, and left the feet? A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You first of all went into the back room? A. Yes, my Lord - the prisoner's wife was there, and in consequence of her leaving the room I went into the front room, and found these things; I did not perceive her carry any thing out of the back room - there was not time for her to have put these things under the bed; there were two children sleeping on the bed, and they must have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290087"/>disturbed - these feet were right under the middle of the bed, wrapped up in two pinafores; she resisted my searching the bed repeatedly.</p>

            . I am a printer; I work at No. 16, Chiswell-street. I was there between half-past six and seven o'clock on this evening; I saw the prosecutor's gig there, about a quarter of an hour before the robbery, and a boy in care of it; I left the office to get some bills which the prosecutor was waiting for, and as I returned, I saw the prisoner take the coats from the gig; I at first thought him to be the prosecutor, and I went up to him to give him the bills, but just as I was going to speak to him, he gave them to another man, who ran off with them - I swear the prisoner took them - he walked off; I left my bills at Mr. Hawkins's; I followed, and gave him into custody in Type-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not notice the coats at first? A. No - I first saw the prisoner about six yards from the gate; I only lost sight of him while I left the bills at the shop - I followed him a hundred yards or more - he made no attempt to escape, but expressed his surprise.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor; I went to the watch-house, and received intelligence that the prisoner was at Bow-street, with the cloak on her shoulders; I went there, and found her the same evening - I asked her where she bought the cloak; she said, "I did not buy it at all, I borrowed it of my mother."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, and a man named Haynes, early in the morning of the 27th of February, 1830; they had this ass, and a great quantity of lead, which it was carrying - they both said the ass belonged to them, and they had come from Harrow; they were remanded three times, and then discharged - on the Friday following the prosecutor applied to me, and the prisoner was taken again; but he broke out of Uxbridge gaol on Sunday, the 20th of March, 1830; the other day he was in custody on another charge, and I stated this - Haynes was brought here, and pleaded guilty.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you no more partners?

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 2nd of November Elizabeth Rodway told me a person wanted me - I went to her, but she did not; I then suspected her, and on looking I missed six sovereigns out of a writing-desk, which I had left locked, and which had been unlocked, not broken open - the sovereigns had been wrapped in a piece of blue paper; the officer came and took her - she denied stealing them, but when my husband came home she acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you fell on your knees before her, and said, provided she would confess that she took the sovereigns, nothing should happen to her? A. I said if she produced the money - I did not say that God might strike me dead if she did not go harmless; she said that her brother George told her to steal the money from me, and she had given it to her brother Joseph - I did not show her some trinkets and gold, and ask her if she had ever seen so much.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Is not the prisoner your landlady's daughter? A. Yes; we do not sleep together - we had gone out between twelve and one o'clock, to see the Lord Mayor's show - we had walked about all the time; she had not complained of being tired or hungry - she went to a pawnbroker's to pawn her bracelets, to buy some boots, to put on, but they would not take them in - we had been to a friends's to tea - we had a glass of gin each, but were not drunk.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Martin's-lane. I saw a crowd, and went to clear it away; I saw the prisoner pulling the prosecutrix about, and endeavouring to get her to go home; the prisoner said some woman had robbed her friend of her finger-rings, earrings, and an eye-glass; I asked her why she did not secure the party - she then said it was some man; I then began to have some suspicion of her, and said,"I shall take your friend to the station," and when we got there, I said to the prisoner, "I don't like this, I shall search you;" the prisoner then turned to a gentleman there, and said,"Will you fasten this bracelet on my wrist;" the gentleman did so, and while he did it, she dropped this glove, and its contents; I took it up, and found in it the ear-rings and finger-rings - she tried to put her foot on the glove, but I prevented her.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with the prosecutrix, and a gentleman and lady were going through St. Martin's-court - the lady was jealous of the prosecutrix, and struck her; I turned back, and found her beating my frined - I asked her where her ear-rings were, and a gentleman took them up and gave them into her hand; she pulled off her glove to put them into her ears, but was too tipsy to do it - she was then taken to the watch-house, and there the glove and ear-rings were found, but I had not touched them.</p>

I said, "The bag of money you took from my till;" she said had I lost a bag of money - I said,"Yes, and you have got it;" I asked her if any one had been at the bar while she was there - she said No; I said,"Then you have got it;" I sent for an officer, who took her - there was a 6d. in it, which I knew; the head was white, and it was black all round it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. She dealt in poultry, I believe? A. Yes - I had bought things of her; she expressed her astonishment when I charged her with it - she stripped herself, but nothing was found but 2s. 6d. in her pocket; I never told a servant girl that I thought one of Newton's dust-women had it - there was myself and the pot-boy at home, but the pot-boy was not at the bar.</p>

             (Police-constable K 66). I was called to the Wellington, and the prisoner was given in charge - she said she was innocent; but in going to the watch-house she seemed flurried, and asked for my hand; I gave it her, and she put half a crown in it, told me to do what I could for her, and she would make it all right.</p>
               <p>MRS. DWYER. This sixpence was among the money that was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dirty sixpences are not very uncommon? A. I have had it three or four months - it has been repeatedly offered in change, and refused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went for change for a shilling, and asked her to warm me half a pint of beer, which she did - I then came out with the two sixpences she had given me; I then went to a lady's, and received half a crown - I went across Cowdery's field in my way home, but did not go where the money was found - I then returned to the witness, to offer her a goose I had to sell, and she said the boy from the Wellington was looking for me; I went there- I gave the half-crown to the officer to get some beer for us to drink.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any confusion or quarrel? A. No; I found nothing on the prisoner, but in a cap on the mantel-piece I found a half-crown, two penny-pieces, and one halfpenny.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live in the Canal-road. On the 24th of August I went to Mr. Evans' wharf, and asked the price of the plank - he asked 17s.; on the 27th I went there again - I saw the prisoner and another man; the prisoner asked what I wanted - I said I had looked at the plank, and asked if the governor was in the way; he said No, but he could do as well - I said it was all right, and I would send for a truck - he said there was no occasion for it; he would bring it home for half a gallon of beer - he brought it, and I saw my wife pay him for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You asked if you had not given too much for the plank? A. No, you asked what I wanted, and I told you what the price was - I said it was 1s. a foot; I did not ask if there was a truck in the yard - I proposed to go for one, and then you said you and your mate would take it home; I suppose it was five or six o'clock- I did not see you at the Bricklayer's Arms; it was a very wet day - you received the money.</p>

Just as my customers may require it; I know this piece by a hole, about half an inch from the top of it, where a branch has been broken off; there are frequently holes, but not like this; I know it from its being an odd drop - I had tried to match it, and could not; it is the largest piece that was left in the box; it weighs about 4 dwts. 16 grains.</p>

            . I deal in birds and rabbits, and live in Pancras-place, Pancras. On the 26th of November, at a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Smith and another boy brought me two pigeons, and asked a shilling for them; and seeing me not anxious to take them they said they were dissolving partnership, and had more to sell - I then bought them for 2s., and in a few minutes a Policeman brought the two prisoners in: I said Smith was one of them that had sold me the pigeons - Deeley selected the two I had bought.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STEWART. I am an officer. I stopped the prisoners with each a pigeon; Jenkins' brother was with them - I asked where they got them; Jenkins said he had bought them at Fletcher's, a pigeon-fancier - I asked them where they got the money to buy them; he said he had held a horse for a gentleman - I was taking them to Fletcher's, and Smith said, "We did not buy them there, we bought them here," pointing to Jones' - I took them there, and from what he said, took them to the station.</p>

            . I was coming up Great St. Andrew-street on the 17th of November; I saw the prisoner and another man opposite Biggs' shop, looking in at the window; I watched them, and saw the prisoner go in - he came out in a minute, and joined the other; he had nothing then - the other then went in, came out, and went in a second time - I saw him give a box of segars to the prisoner - I ran and spoke to a Policeman - we run in pursuit of them; the prisoner turned up a gateway, and I took him with the box in his possession - it had thirty-seven segars in it; I should have had the other man taken afterwards, but could not identify his face.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are a solicitor? A. Yes, I was clerk to Silvester and Walter, but left them in August - I am on the roll of attorneys; it might be about five o'clock in the morning when this happened - I have two or three times a week to get up at half-past two o'clock; I had had a glass of ale, and a glass of gin and water at the Yorkshire Gray, in Brydges-street, and it was there I met Smith - I had 2l. 2s. in my pocket when I went out, and a few halfpence; I was robbed of 1l. 15s. - I had 3s. 6d. left in my pocket and some halfpence; I am not in the habit of going to houses of this sort - I did not object to the man being in the room; I did not say "I will have two any how," and then catch hold of Martin - I did not after I lost my money go into the room for half an hour with Smith.</p>

I heard the cry, and found the prosecutor at the house - he charged the persons there with stealing from him a sovereign and a half, and two half-crowns; he had his senses, and described all the circumstances as he has now - I found the prisoner Martin and Smith there; I took them all, and went in search of the man, but could not find him - there was a passage through the house, so that a person could go through; Cooper denied the charge, but in going to the station she said if we would go back we should find the money under the chair, but it has not been found - she offered the prosecutor 5l. to let her go, and offered me the same; the other two were remanded three times and then discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said I would sooner have given 5l. than such a thing should have happened - when the prosecutor went into the back parlour, Smith said to him,"Will you come into the bed-room, for the sofa is not fit to sit down on;" when they were in the bed-room there was some quarrel and Smith called me - I went to the door; I found it locked - Smith said, "This man is quarrelling with me and using me very ill;" I said, "I am sure you should not, if you are tipsy you should not ill use her;" she then took his coat and waistcoat from the nail - the prosecutor and her stopped for the money which fell down; the prosecutor said, "It is my money."</p>

I saw a person come out of the shop with this blind - he ran, and placed it six doors off against a door-post; a woman said, "I think that man has been stealing something;" I went upto him - the Policeman came, and took me; I never touched the blind, and was not near it - I said, "You are mistaken;" he said," It does not matter, you will do quite as well," and then the woman who saw it followed us, making a noise, and kept saying, "That is not the man;" the officer threatened that if she followed him he would take her, or I should have had a witness here.</p>

This is my property; I have brought the frames here - they are all broken to pieces by the person who took the glass out; they were taken from the back parlour of my house, which the prisoner had the care of - the frames were hidden under the floor; I have no doubt this is my glass - I had seen it safe about three weeks before.</p>
