               <p>JONATHAN KIRBY sworn. - I am a patrole; I was at the taking of Ranton; I found him in a hay-lost, lying upon two trusses of hay; I told him he was the man that had done the robbery, and he said he was asleep there; Davies immediately charged him as being one of the men.</p>
               <p>Ranton's defence. I am innocent of the fact; I was standing at the corner of my own yard when the watchman came up to me, and I went to lay down to sleep in my father's hay-lost.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The copper was not cut up till it came to Mr. Myatt's? - A. No; it was bent double.</p>

               <p>Q. And what did you give him for it? - A.Eight-pence halfpenny for the copper, and one-penny farthing for the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a fair price, and not such a price as persons that have stolen things would sell them at? - A. I never bought stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Myatt never charged with any thing of this sort before? - A. Not since I have been servant to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The lead you never saw at all; do you usually buy lead without ever having seen it? - A. Yes; it is a very common thing.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave three-pence a pound? - A. Or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is this? - A. The 22d of last month, I believe it was eight-pence halfpenny that we agreed for.</p>

               <p>Q. That was something about a similar job with this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You got through that, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you will get through this, if you can six it upon the prisoner, and save yourself? - A. If I had not had it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that little accident that happened to you before was about three or four hundred weight of copper? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that about? - A. Mr. Rogers can tell you very well; he took some iron from me, and I had it all back again, because I proved that I had it fairly.</p>

He asked the other woman that was with me, whether she had got any blacking; she said, no: the prisoner then gave her a bit of blacking, and she gave it to me in the presence of the prisoner: there was one sixpence that I objected to, it looked very yellow, he changed it and gave me another. On the Tuesday following I went again, with the same woman, and the officers, Armstrong, Ray, Ferris, and Peach; we knocked at the door, and the prisoner said he should not be ready for two hours; the officers did not go within sight of the door; I went to the officers and told them, and they went into the house and took them into custody. Armstrong has got the money and the blacking that I had of the prisoner; I gave them to him that same day, in the presence of Mr. Colquhoun.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to the Police office, in Worship street, in consequence of information, I went, on Tuesday the 26th of September in the morning, to the prisoner's house in Bridgewater-gardens, in company with Clark, one of the Marshalmen, and the other officers; with a warrant from my Lord Mayor; they refused to let us in, we pushed very hard at the door, and the bolts or something gave way, and we went in; I saw the prisoner in bed, we took the prisoner in custody, and proceeded to search the house. This money I had of the last witness, on the 23d of September, and this blacking, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. Is that good money or bad? - A. It is counterfeit; there are six sixpences and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what particular use is blacking in the process of coining? - A.This blacking is used upon the money, to take the white off, to make it appear as if it had been in circulation.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK sworn. - I am one of the City-Marshalmen: I was in company with Armstrong and the other officers, at the house of the prisoner; Armstrong and myself searched the house, it is in a court, just by Brackley-street, Bridgwater-gardens, a place called the Wooden-world; there was a man and his wife in bed; the woman made a terrible piece of work; I held the man, and we searched the house, and on the mantle-piece, we found two bad sixpences; I searched his pockets, and in his breeches-pockets, I found two that I cannot tell whether they are good or bad, and two shillings, one of which is a bad one; I found this pot with some blacking in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250013"/>Court. Q. Is that common blacking for shoes, or blacking for any particular purpose? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Armstrong). Is that the sort of blacking that is used for blacking shoes? - A. It is the sort of blacking used by coiners.</p>

               <p>Q.Where was the waggon at the time he left you? - A. At Colnbrook; I missed it about half an hour afterwards; I got upon my horse, and the landlord and I went after him; we overtook him at the Magpie, Hounslow-heath; I asked him if he had got the cheese, and he made me no answer; I put my hand to the sack, and pulled out the cheese, and I swore to it; it had the mark of a B upon it, and had been squeezed, which I observed before I put it into the waggon; I sent for a constable, and he offered me a guinea and a watch to let him go; I delivered the cheese to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner is an old acquaintance of your's? - A. Yes; I used to carry money to his daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you took it in your head to be entertained with a boxing-match on the road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you did not desire him to drive your waggon on for six or seven miles, while you went to look at a boxing-match? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.It was his own sack that he took out of the waggon? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say to you, if you had lost a cheese, the man, who was in the waggon. might have put it into the sack? - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not two men ride in the waggon to town? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you supposed you had lost the cheese, did you count them? - A. No; I did not then, only from the appearance of the waggon, I knew there was one gone.</p>

Yes; the first house, to the bar of those which are now standing, I do not know the number of the house; I went upon suspicion that there was somebody upon the house getting the lead; a person of the name of Smith was with me; I heard a rattling among the tiles, upon the top of the house, and searched every room as we went up; we went up to the top of the house; as we were getting out, I saw some lead tied up, about four or five hundred weight of pieces cut, it had the appearance of being cut with a knife; we went down stairs through the next house, and when we had got to the bottom room, we found the two prisoners concealed in a closet; they begged us not to hurt them, and we took them to the watch-house; we found two knives lying in the place where the lead was cut up; the door of that house stood upon the jar; the door of the other house they could not get out at, because it was boarded up; I had been at work there; I quitted the house at six o'clock, there was a fence round the two houses, I found the door of the fence open; what lead was not cut up was marked across, as if it was ready to cut up (produces the two knives and a piece of the lead;) the cutting appeared very bright.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get into the house, when you went to work? - A. We had no business in that house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH STEVENS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I left this house safe at six o'clock in the evening; I am employed, under the City of London, to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The keys are left at the Surveyor's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And any body going to the Surveyor's office, having an authority from the City of London, might go in there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who went in after six o'clock at night, you do not know? - A. Nobody has the key but the Surveyor.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the house surrounded with a horde? - A. Behind it was, but not in front.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. As to the keys you took no trouble at all about them? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. They hang up in the office, do they not? - A. No; they are put in drawers, and not locked up; Mr. Constable not having been paid, I do not think we ever received them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he give you a right direction? - A. I do not know; he said first, it was the last house but one, and then said, it was the house on this side of it, and at that time I felt the money go.</p>

             for two or three yards before they came to him; they were all three together; I saw them beckoning and winking at one another; Norbury had got a direction to the banking-house in his hand, Bond came up and stood close by his left side, shewing him where he was to go; I had seen them all before about the city. Taylor and Mackey came close behind him, and Mackey picked his pocket; I then went up to the young man and asked him what he had lost; he had, in the mean time, missed his money, and was returning and speaking to Bond; I told him the two principal ones were run up the passage that leads through into St. Michael's-court; we pursued them, and in St. Michael's-court I called out, stop thief; there were some ticket-porters standing at the tavern, and they directed us into Gracerhurch-street, we pursued them there, and were informed they went up the butter passage into Leadenhall-market; I went into the market, and we were informed by a butcher, that they were gone up the left hand side of the market; I very soon then saw Taylor and Mackey together in a dark passage; Bond we left behind in Birchin lane; I called out that they were there, upon which Mackey threw down some money into a cellar, two guineas rebounded from the bars, which I picked up; a constable then came up and secured them, and took them to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. The young man has told us he applied to Bond first, to enquire something? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Bond did not run away? - A. We left him; we followed the bag.</p>

               <p>Q.When Taylor was taken, I believe you found nothing at all upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say you saw him speak at all to Mackey or to Bond? - A. I saw them very close together, and in company together.</p>

               <p>Q. How far were you from him at that time? - A. As near as I am to you; the prisoner, Osland, then passed between me and Coleman with a pistol in his hand, and directly after that I heard the report of a pistol, but do not know who fired it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Osland before he came between you and Coleman? - A. I cannot say, to my knowledge, that I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.When you apprehended Staggers, was any body along with him? - A. Yes, several.</p>
               <p>Q. But neither of the prisoners? - A. Yes, I believe Coleman was one.</p>
               <p>Q. After the deserter had escaped, you went into a public-house to get some drink, and clean your clothes, and it was neither of the prisoners that knocked you down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out, you had a bayonet in your hand? - A. No, I had not; corporal Pearce had.</p>
               <p>Q. A naked bayonet? - A. No, in a sheath; it was not unsheathed before I was wounded; I never knew he had one at all till after I got to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. A scuffle ensued? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Was no person struck by either you or any of your company? - A. Not that I know of, I struck nobody; I am sure there was nobody struck before the shot was fired.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, were you not attacking a stranger who had been passing by, before these persons came up at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the prisoners cry out to you not to hurt the man? - A. No, I did not hear any thing of the sort; nor I did not see an attempt to strike a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present? - A. Yes; I am sorry I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sorry for your accident; but if there had been a blow struck before that, you must have seen it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How came Pearce by the bayonet? - A. I do not know, I took none; I had a pistol, and so had he.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Pearce never produce a pistol? - A.Serjeant Pearce, as I understand, fired one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did serjeant Pearce, or the prisoner at the bar, fire first? - A. The prisoner; serjeant Pearce did not fire his pistol till a considerable time after I was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any warrant that day? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you ever before a Magistrate to see Staggers attested? - A. I saw him examined by the doctor, and saw him go into the committee-room to be attested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any bounty-money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to arrest him for the sake of the reward, or merely in consequence of his being a soldier? - A. I entered, myself, as a volunteer; and I expect every man to do his duty, as I do and will, as long as I have breath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you sure there was no scuffle at the public-house door before Coleman struck the hat out of your hand? - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you ever seen Coleman before? - A. Yes; I knew him three years ago.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was there ever any quarrel subsisting between you? - A. Never; I never had a word with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEARCE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went, in company with corporal Webb, after a deserter of the name of Cooper, we could not find him; going along, we met Staggers; Webb said, he was very much like a deferter from our regiment; we laid hold of him, he went to the public-house with us to have some gin; we were going to hand-cuff him, and he said he would go quietly with Webb; when he had got out, he sprung from Webb, and got away; going down Chick-lane, Webb was knocked down, and we went into a public-house to get some porter, and get him cleaned; I had a brace of pistols, Webb had a pistol which he knocked the prime out of, and delivered to me; my brother was with us, he had a bayonet, in a sheath, under his great coat; when we came out of the public-house, we had got about five or six yards distance, when the two prisoner's came down, and said, you have not got the man, and d-n your eyes you shall not have his hat; upon that, the prisoner Coleman, with a stick, knocked it out of his hand; Webb said, do not use us ill, if you do we will take you to Hatton-Garden; they immediately said, d-n you, we are armed as well as you; they had seen my pistol when I had Staggers in the public-house; I think Coleman was one of the persons that drank with us; Coleman drew out a pistol and fired, I cannot say at whom; the other prisoner fired a second pistol; I was at the distance of about as far as from here to that window when the first pistol was fired, which wounded Webb; when Osland fired his pistol, he was on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fired the third pistol? - A. I cannot be positive which it was; I then said, my lads, take care of yourselves, for it is now fire to fire; I might be six, seven, eight, or ten yards off; I saw my brother wounded, I saw the blood running<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250018"/>down, I saw Webb fainting, and then there were two or three pistols fired at us, after I had gone to their assistance; and then they went away. I took Webb to Bartholomew's-hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they apprehended? - A. I cannot say; the Police-officers apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the men; have you any doubt they are the men? - A. I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had an opportunity of taking Staggers since? - A. Yes, he is now in the Savoy prison, as a deserter. I saw the ball extracted from Webb's arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You won't undertake to swear that Coleman was in your company at the public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen him before that day? - A. No, I had not seen either of the prisoners before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. All the opportunity you had of seeing the men, was during the time of the scuffle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many people were present? - A. There was not a person in the street but the three people that fired, and us three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no outcry? - A. None at all; I did not observe any other person in the street, till after we were wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever attempt to offer any violence till Webb said he would take him to Hatton-garden? - A. No, only knocking the hat out of his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not endeavour to take him into custody? - A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not endeavour to take him into custody before he fired? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you did intend to take him to Hatton-garden, for striking the hat? - A. Webb talked of taking him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Webb make this observation-don't use us ill, or we will take you to Hatton-garden, before the pistol was fired? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that that was his expression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think he said himself, that at the moment the hat was struck out of his hand, he said, we will take you to Hatton-garden? - A. He said, don't use us ill, or we will take you to Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There were several pistols fired after, you say; Webb did not say a word about that? - A. I say it, and swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the bayonet was not unsheathed, for the purpose of taking these men into custody? - A. Not till after the pistols were fired.</p>

               <p>Q.After Webb was knocked down, did you go to a public-house to clean him? - A. Yes; when he came out, he went across the right hand side of the road; the prisoner Colman said to Webb, d-n your eyes, you have not got the man, nor you shall not have his hat; he then with a stick knocked the hat out of Webb's hand; then Webb made answer, and said, do not molest us, if you use us ill we will have you to Hatton-garden: he took his pistol out directly, and shot Webb through the arm; after that the other prisoner went past on the left side of the road, and fired, but I cannot say at whom; after that I went to Webb's assistance, who was fainting with loss of blood; I heard three or four pistols more fired afterwards; but I cannot tell who fired them, I had a bayonet which I unsheathed after the second pistol was fired off.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you ever seen either of the prisoners before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said that the man who fired the first pistol was a tall man in a blue coat, six feet high? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know a person of the name of Brown, a publican? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.What time in the evening? - A. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that these are the persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was five or six weeks before they were apprehended? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undertake to say they were the men before Webb told you so? - A. Yes, I remembered Colman immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that if these men had not been in custody, you would have known them if you had met them in the street? - A. Yes, I should; if I was to see you again I should know you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no attempt to take this man into custody? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to say that without any provocation they fired these pistols? - A. Yes.</p>

I got a constable, and delivered her and the things to him; we found the other two aprons and the shawl in a room in the house where she lives, not her own room.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. He has set up a very good defence, if it was proved; I will make enquiry as to the ground of it, and if I find it has any colour, he shall have the benefit of it.</p>
               <p> - KIRBY sworn. - When I took him on board the tender, he was in favour with the regulating officer, and got to belong to a press-gang, and went about, I saw him several times with the gang, it is upwards of a year since I saw him in the gang. <rs id="t17971025-33-verdict170" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>JOHN WOOD sworn. - I apprehended the people of the house; I met the prisoner, and he said he found the things facing the Well-street Play-house; he said a man put them down, and stopped to make water, and then ran away, and he thought it was requisite they should be taken care of; and he said he was coming up to the watch-house, and he walked along with me.</p>

               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you not say any thing like this-you know you are before the Magistrate, and it is of no use to conceal any thing? - A. I did not tell him any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not offer him any money, if he would confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person interested in the business, besides those you have named? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it that it is impossible for you to swear to seeds? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you sell seeds in your shop, do you send them in sacks with marks upon them? - A. Yes; if Mr. Knapp were to order any mark to be put upon the sacks, I should mark "Mr. Knapp" upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had happened to be a customer, there would have been nothing strange in finding a sack at my house marked in the same way that other sacks are marked, that are sent to your customers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dealings with a person of the name of Lee, at Ware? - A. There is an occurrence upon our file of that kind.</p>

Yes; he lived with Mr. Wrench, and afterwards, at Ware, in Hertfordshire, by the name of Lee; the prisoner has been in the habit of sending me parcels to send with things that I have bought for Griffiths's private use down to Ware, in Hertfordshire.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never examined the contents of the parcels? - A. No, only the India corn.</p>
               <p>Q. You come here in custody now, don't you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you not believe now that you should have been tried for this offence, if you had not turned King's evidence? - A. I don't doubt but I might have been tried, but it would have been innocently done. I took the Indian corn down to Ware myself.</p>
               <p>Q.In point of fact, had not Lee left a sum of money in your hands for the purchase of different things? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever made any purchase for him at Mr. Wrench's? - A.None; I had money for the purpose of that and other things.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wrench. This parcel of sage seed and this of endive seed have the hand-writing of the prisoner upon them, who was our servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Every thing that the prisoner sold would have such sort of memorandums upon them? - A. I never remember an instance of putting a memorandum inside the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. You appear in one instance to have had a customer of the name of Lee, whom you did not know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe it is regular to mark the parcels outside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not have dealt with this Lee if you had known who he was? - A.Certainly not; he was a runaway apprentice of mine.</p>

               <p>Q.Then there was something in the sack? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. This ought to shew you the carelessness to say nothing more of the manner in which you give your evidence; you swore, till the moment the gentleman told you the peril in which you stood, you swore most positively you did not see her go away; now you swear that you saw her go away, and saw the sack go away, neither full nor half full; I must beg of you to recollect, you know what I said to you at Hertford, and I did hope to have found you a very different sort of man now; it is really shocking? - A. I say nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is impossible; you were either perjured at Hertford, or you are perjured now; you know all that passed between you and me, when I tried that cause? - A. I cannot recollect; I have never been well since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see two sacks after Mrs. Gibbons went away? - A. I did not look for them; I did not see them at all, for I never went into the room after.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, do you not know what was in the sack? - A.Upon my oath, I never saw any thing put into it.</p>

               <p>Q. Now I caution you again - Upon your oath, do you know what was in that sack? - A. I do not know what was in the sack, not as to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never heard what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250030"/>was in that sack, in Mrs. Gibbons's presence and hearing? - A.Never in her hearing in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the pieces of muslin that were in your house, and the size of them - I ask you, would those boxes that were sent to Gipsey Tom hold half of the muslins in your house? - A. I do not think they would, they might hold half.</p>

               <p>Q. These men, I believe, have got a great deal of business lately? - A. That has not affected me any.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have they not been increasing in business? - A. It is a business I do but little of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you may as well give us a plain answer to a plain question? - A. I have not troubled my head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not their business been increasing? - A. They had a great deal of business the very first week they did begin.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, was it not in July? - A. I could not say if it was the last day I had to live, I believe it was three weeks, or a month, before they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in July; just a little before the July Sessions? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate, I believe, admitted them to bail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you walked home pretty nearly together, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were bound over to prosecute at the next Sessions? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, were you not bound over to prosecute at the July Sessions? - A. We did it as soon as it could be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you preferred a bill of indictment as soon as possible? - A.According to the rule of the Court at the Sessions-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you prefer your bill of indictment? - A. I never understood that we were to take a particular account of that time, only the time that we were robbed, and therefore I did not take an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know that you did not prefer a bill against him in the July Sessions? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never took them up a second time? - A.Upon my life I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you indict them before September Sessions? - A. I do not know whether I did or not; I have not been well, nor have not had my recollection about me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take your witnesses before the Grand Jury; is it a week, or a fortnight, or a month? - A. It is a great deal more than a month, I believe.</p>

               <p>Court. They must prove that these identical fans were stolen by the wife; here is no evidence to shew that they were not stolen by the husband; this is a very distinct offence from that; it is true she was convicted, but there were three fans found upon her person, and therefore it was a proper conviction.</p>

             AUSTIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am in the employ of the Post-office, the prisoner was in the situation that has just been described; in consequence of his absenting himself from the office, we sent a messenger after him on the Friday, he was not to be found, but on Saturday morning the 9th, his mother came with him, and she said she supposed as her son had not been at the office, he had been doing what he ought not to have been doing, and she searched his box.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Be so good as tell me what passed in his hearing? - A. I told him we had heard various reports, we had heard that he had kept a horse, he said that he saw the horse in Newgate-street, it was a very unruly one, and the man offered him the horse, if he would undertake to break it, and the man said he should have the horse for a trifle; I asked his mother if she knew any thing of his conduct out of the office, as we had reason to suspect he was not doing as he ought to do, and, she unrequested, took out these 5l. notes, which she said she had taken out of his box, (produces them); he began to cry, and wished her not to produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were produced, did he acknowledge that his mother had taken them from his box? - A.Not in words; I asked him how he came by those notes; he said, that on Tuesday he met Davis in Oxford-road, that Davis owed him twelve shillings, which he desired he would pay; Davis said, he had not twelve shillings, but put his hand into his pocket, and said, take these, and that then Davis left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was the Tuesday, that he said he had met Davis? - A. The 5th; there were two other notes produced by his mother for single pounds; the boy said, he had received those two pound notes from a man to whom he had sold some rabbits.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was kept in custody; was any enquiry made? - A. Yes; a clerk of Messrs. Williams brought the particulars of the notes that were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that unhappy lad's father is living? - A. No, he is dead.</p>

I am a waggoner, I drive the Wendover waggon: I saw the prisoner on a Wednesday morning in September, I believe it was during Bartholomew fair; I was sitting in the Bell tap-room, in Warwick-lane, and the ostler had got a little poney, that I had had with the team, watering it, and that lad came in, and asked whose property it was; I told him it was mine; he asked me if I would fell it; I told him I did not care whether I did or not; at last I agreed to fell it him for three guineas; provided I would let him have it to shew his father, he said, if he was not back in twenty minutes he would forfeit a shillingsworth of punch; I told him he must leave something then, and he gave me a five pound note; he came back, and said his father thought it too dear; we agreed at last, and I gave him one pound seventeen shillings out of the five pound note.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp I am one of the Bow-street officers: On Friday, the 15th of September, I went to the prisoner in the Cold-bath-fields House of Correction, he gave me these papers, and said, that was all he could say about it; I went by the direction of Mr. Parkins, the Solicitor; it is his own voluntary consession. (It is read, dated September 14, 1797.)</p>
               <p>"GENTLEMEN,"About six months ago, Mr. Davis asked me"to deliver his quarterly letters at twelve shillings"per quarter, which I agreed to; one morning he"called me in one corner of the yard, and said,"he would give me sixpence to go to Alderman"Curtis, to get change for some bills, which I"refused to do; then Mr. Sibbert said, he would"give me a shilling to do the same for him, but I"would not; for that reason, Davis said, he would"tell Mr. Sparke, our Inspector, that I would"not deliver his letters; I told Mr. Sparke, that"he had borrowed a great deal of money on his"walk, and he was ashamed to go for his money"for the letters which I did take, and he was short"in the Treasury; one morning he told me, after"I had done delivering my letters, I was to call"on him, at the Green-man, in Bucklersbury, to"help him to deliver, which I did; I perceived"him put a letter in his pocket, which I spoke to"him about; and he said, if I told the office, he"would have me murdered, and then made me a"present of a dollar, and told me not to mention"it; soon after this, Mr. Sibbert absconded; Da"vis told me, if I told of their proceedings I should"get killed, and such like threats; Davis then"used to give me a sum of money not to tell of"him, when I said I would not tell; at last, he"persuaded me to do the same, and then he ran"away; and one morning I met him, and asked"him for twelve shillings, which he owed me;"and he said, he had not got it, but if I would"bring him another letter to the corner of New"man-street he would give it me, which I did;"he gave me the twelve shillings, and desired me"to meet him in a field near Copenhagen-house,"where he opened a letter containing a bill, value"400l. he desired me to meet him again, which"I did; he desired me to mind what I was"after, or else he would kill me, because I had"brought him a letter with nothing in it but taylor's"patterns, and promised to meet me again, and"to buy him a horse, which I did, and never met"him from eight o'clock till two o'clock, and"tore the letter in pieces, and other bills, and went"home to my Godmother's house, and put the"notes in my box, and locked it, with two one"pound notes, which he gave me, I gave them"to my mother; and, on Friday night last, my"mother searched my pockets, and took the key"of my box out, and opened the box, and took"out the notes; in the morning she called me up"to go to the office to work; she took me to Mr."Stowe's room, when, after some conversation,"my mother produced the notes to Mr. Stowe;"and then he ordered me to be kept in custody till"Wednesday, to go before a Magistrate.</p>
