               <p>When you went up stairs did you examine that chest? - I saw it examined; the woman to whom this property belonged, was brought, the chest was not locked, and the things were gone out, and the chest was clear; the blanket dragged on his heels; I saw the things in the chest, that very day; I produce a boy's little green skirt, I have nothing else, the other things are all at sea.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray when you returned to your house, did you make any observation on your door? - It had been broke open by force, there were two little bits of wood chipped away; the thing which the lock shuts into was copper, and that was quite out on the floor.</p>

               <p>Did you leave a good fire when you went out? - Not a very good one, but a middleing one; for as I went out, I had a candle in my right hand, and I saw them at the door, and I shut to the door for a minute, because I was afraid; then I had my candle in my hand, by which I had been working, the door is but just by; as I came back I had no light but the fire.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you much fire? - It was middling, there was not a great fire, nor a very small fire; it was a moon-light night.</p>

               <p>I have done business for the Mint upwards of twenty years; this is what we call cecil, it is flatted down to the size, and cut into round blanks, and afterwards filed round the edges, and scoured with paper, cork and several things that are here, and put into aqua fortis, which produces the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Are those the instruments used for counterfeiting coin? - Yes, this is aqua fortis, when it is put into aqua fortis and water, which leaves it black, it is rubbed with sand, or salt, and then it is white, and it is afterwards rubbed with something to make it black; every thing here is compleat: (looks at the sixpence, in the nutmeg grater) the shillings were fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parker. Are they like the Tower shillings? - The Tower shillings, when they come out of the Tower, are all milled, these are made to imitate old shillings.</p>

               <p>Court. It was not out of your pocket? - It was not quite out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you able to ascertain who was the person that was then drawing it out of your pocket? - He singly was drawing it out, but was in company with; two others; who were not further than an arm's length from him; he immediately struck me, with a bludgeon, on the temple, which mark I now bear.</p>
               <p>Can you be quite positive, Sir, that the handkerchief was not quite out of your pocket when you received that blow? - If it was out of my pocket it was as much as it was.</p>
               <p>You cannot be certain? - I cannot positively swear; in the vehemence of passion I swore I would not quit the prisoner; the prisoner then had the handkerchief in his hand, I had hold of the handkerchief; it was then quite out of my pocket; it was held in the prisoners's hand, with violence from me.</p>
               <p>You are sure he had it entirely out of your pocket? - I am sure of it; I said I would not quit him, and he dropped the handkerchief at his feet; in stooping to regain the handkerchief, to pick it up, I saw the prisoner levelling a blow at my head; I had the presence of mind to raise this arm, to save that blow; and from one of the other two, I positively swear, I received a violent blow at the back of my head; by this time a crowd began to gather round, and my friend cried out, for God's sake, will no man assist in taking this thief; I then, by main force, dragged him across the way, and he was secured; I never lost hold of him.</p>

               <p>Did you perceive it taken out of your pocket? - I felt the watch taking out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - It was, as near as I can recollect, about four in the afternoon; there was a crowd; it was the Queen's birth day; I was passing to the Thatched House Tavern, to dine with some others; they are tradesmen; I looked at my watch coming up King-street, St. James's-square, very near the narrow passage that crosses St. James's-street; and I felt my watch in my fob in St. James's-street, but very shortly after I felt it going from me; I saw the prisoner standing close to my right side, his left side was to my right side; I never saw my watch again; I missed my watch; I felt it going, and concluded I was robbed; I instantly put down my eyes, and saw my watch in the prisoner's left hand; he was then in the act of drawing himself from me; I charged him with the robbery, and laid hold of him, and to my astonishment he denied, though I saw it in his left hand; there appeared to be accomplices of his present, for they pressed upon me; he struggled to get from me, which he effected, by their assistance; the prisoner got from me a short distance; I was endeavouring to apprehend him; I saw two young men that are in Court; I desired them to stop him: that was Hoddle and Taylor; which they did; I never lost sight of him from the time he robbed me till they took him, nor was he more than three or four yards from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The prisoner was taken to the Brown Bear before you arrived there? - He was, perhaps ten minutes.</p>
               <p>When you came to Bow-street, did you, or did you not, point to some other man as having had your watch? - There was a young man; two of them that were at the fire side, one on the left hand; the prisoner was on the right hand, the two constables sat between him and me; there was one candle burning, that was some distance, and I could not immediately judge one person from another; I believe there was something passed of that kind; there was a young man sat at the left hand; says I, that is the man, in consequence of which the prisoner started up, and said, so you have pointed him out, instead of me; then says I, I could never say that, for thou art the man.</p>
               <p>At the time you pointed to the other man, as the man that took your watch, you had not seen the prisoner at the Brown Bear? - He had not caught my eye, for the constables were between him and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240123"/>What did you point out the other man as? - I did say that is the man that took my watch.</p>
               <p>Did you mean so then, at the time you said so? - Why, certainly I meant so.</p>
               <p>Did you think so, at the time you said so? - I thought so, or else I would not have said it; says the prisoner, you have said this moment, that is the man that robbed you; I did not see him before then; says I, my friend, I was under a mistake, for thou art the man.</p>
               <p>How long was this mistake of yours after you saw the watch drawn from your pocket? - About half an hour, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you day-light in St. James's-street, to see the man by? - I had day-light; I believe it was about four, when I was robbed by the prisoner; I enquired of Sir

               <p>Do not you remember saying at Bow-street, if he is the man he must have my watch about him? - I never said so; the prisoner was searched at a publick-house in St. James's-street, very shortly after.</p>
               <p>Was your watch found upon him? - I did not see my watch.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it was not? - I certainly do.</p>
               <p>You know it was not found upon him in St. James's-street? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - I was present; but there were several people round; and it was not found; I did not search him; I believe it was not found.</p>

               <p>Court. At what distance were you from the man you had pointed out at Bow-street; the wrong man? - I believe it might be as far as from your lordship; something there or thereabouts; a little more.</p>
               <p>How large was the room? - It was a pretty large room; and as I entered into the door, at the side nigh the fire there were two young men sat, one of them had a brown coat on, the same colour as the prisoner, that made me conclude he was the same man; but I did not see his face at the time clearly; I judged it in a hasty manner, from seeing him in the same coat; when he stood up he was rather shorter, but he did not stand at the time I made the remark; I did not see the prisoner's face at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wheeler. I did not miss the table till the Saturday; and on the Saturday, about three o'clock, I received a letter. The table was advertised two or three times: I saw it at Guild-hall about four or five days afterwards; the constable produced it; he has had it ever since: I am sure this is my table: the green cloth did not stick tight, and my servant put an iron on it to keep it flat down, and made a mark on it with the iron.</p>

             went up stairs along with her, and came down again to the bed-side to me; I did not go up stairs till the morning: on the Saturday morning I went up stairs about seven: when I came into the room, I turned down the bed clothes to look at the infant; and I saw it sadly bruised in every part; I said, how comes the baby to be served so? she said it was the convulsions; I said I never saw a child with the convulsions in this manner.</p>
               <p>What appearance had the child? - It was bruised from the very two ends, to the fingers ends, and all up the body; and on the right side of her body, there was a sad bruise indeed, by the side of her belly: when I came down stairs, I said to Mrs. Lovedon, certainly that man has murdered the child: I found the child dead, bruised in that manner: I never saw the man till after he was taken, on the Monday after; I never saw him at the house after.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the child on the Thursday, when the father called it up? - I did; likewise the child was down at play with my children all the day.</p>
               <p>Did it appear in good health? - In very good health; for its mother had it to Guild-hall that day.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had these people lodged with you? - About a week before Christmas, to the 13th of March.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing how they behaved to this child? - I never saw either of them ill-use the child.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any degree of tenderness and good usage? - Always with great tenderness and good usage.</p>
               <p>Was it a healthy child? - It was of a very delicate constitution; but I never saw it fail from its victuals while I was in the house.</p>

               <p>I slept in the same room with Mrs. Tate. On Friday night, March the 12th, about twelve, the mother of the child came home: Mrs. Tate got out of bed, and let her in; when the woman came in, they had some discourse, but what I do not know: Mrs. Tate had just got into bed, when the woman came down stairs, and said, O Lord! O Lord! my child is dead! my child is dead! I let her in, and went up stairs, and saw the child laid out on the bed; it seemingly to me, was properly laid out; I saw many marks about the child; I did not touch it: the woman and me came out together; she said something; I cannot remember what: I put down my arm, and shook my head at Mrs. Tate; I desired her not to go up, because I thought it might frighten her: the woman walked up and down; at last, I took a book in my hand, and read a little; the woman sat on the side of the bed; and all of a sudden, she jumped up, and ran up stairs; I followed her; when she got in the room, she ran round the room till she came to the side of the bed, where there was a little hammock; she pulled out some petticoats, and looked at them again; the woman seemed to be much reconciled; then she looked upon the bed, and cried; I forced her out of the room; I made the woman some tea, and sat up with her: Mrs. Tate was in bed; the woman drank two dishes I believe, and eat a very little bit of bread and butter; I sat up with her till half past seven; I was too much frightened to take notice of what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any concealment of the child: the child was laid out? - No, there was not; there was a wound in the side, that I did not see in the morning; there were bruises all over, but a particular wound in the hip: I did not examine whether the skin was broke.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the prisoners treat this child while alive? - They always used it with as tender usage as any parents could use a child with; to outside appearance, more so than most parents: I never saw them strike the child, or even heard the child cry, without it was playing with the children.</p>
               <p>You never heard the child cry up stairs? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon: I was sent for to see this child on Monday, the 15th of March.</p>
               <p>Now describe, not technically, but in the plain common way, the situation of the child? - I found the head, the neck, the body, and extremities, marked with a considerable number of bruises, that appeared to have been given from blows at different periods of time, by some kind of blunt weapon: upon opening the body, I found the cawl, which is that membrane which covers the bowels, in a state of laceration; and from a division of some of its vessels, a large quantity of blood had fallen into the belly; the bowels were much inflamed, in some parts more than others, sufficiently so as to cause death: there was an external bruise on the right side of the belly; and that bruise had been given by some kind of iron.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the head? - Yes; that had suffered much injury from severe blows, being covered with bruises; and upon opening the skull, there was extravasated blood on the brain, in a considerable quantity, on the left side in particular; in short, the whole scalp was one continued act of violence; it could not be done at one time: all the superior part of the head had been beat: there were a considerable number of bruises in all parts; the arms, the breast, and the lower part of the belly, seemed to carry the greatest marks of violence: there was a grazing of the skin, but no kind of perforation; it might be done with the heel, but it must be done with violence: the brain and the bowels were, in my opinion, mortally affected; the brain must have suffered much from the rupture of vessels that were broke, to cause that extravasated blood.</p>
               <p>Court. How long do you think these deadly wounds, on the head and in the bowels, might have been given before the death? - Why, I apprehend that the wounds on the head were recenter than those on the bowels.</p>
               <p>How long might that have been given before, do you think? - Why, I should imagine immediately, almost; it might be so; I cannot speak positively to that.</p>
               <p>Had they been given twelve hours before the death? - I cannot speak with any certainty upon that; it was three days after the decease of the child, that I saw it.</p>
               <p>Court. I have been looking at the account you gave before the coroner; I see nothing of this wound in the head? - I did not examine the head till a more leisure time, which was the day after.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of a bruise on the hip? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Was that a cut or a bruise? - It was a bruise; there was a division of the parts.</p>
               <p>Now, could any of those appearances which you have mentioned and stated here, arise from convulsions, if the child had died in convulsions? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Would the cawl have been lacerated by convulsions? - By no means; by no spasmodic symptom whatever.</p>
               <p>You think the wound on the head might have been given very soon before the death; do you think it might be twelve hours before the death? - It might possibly be so; there was a number of bruises, by turning the scalp back; there were a dozen; the head being round, spherical, it must take a number of blows to bruise it in every part; the right and left side had more blows than any other part.</p>
               <p>How long do you think these bruises of the body might have been given before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240131"/>the death? - The injury or bruises that were in the hip, might have been given two or three, or four, or five days.</p>

               <p>Court to Surgeon. Did you attend to what was read just now: that he gave the child a blow, and struck it against the bedstead; does that account for all these marks? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>You see, the child was struck, and fell against the bedstead, and from thence to the ground; that accounts for three blows? - That does not account for the whole by any means; I can positively speak to a dozen distinct blows. I will not particularize the number, but a great number.</p>
               <p>Do you think by any possible supposition, this account satisfies the number of blows? - By no means; I cannot consider it so.</p>
               <p>How many blows do you think were mortal? - The injury done to the bowels was certainly mortal; this injury, seemingly, must have had a fatal effect.</p>
               <p>I am talking of the head; suppose a great number of blows given nearly the same time; as fast as they could, by one after another, what effect would it have? - It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240132"/>may produce a stupor, a convulsion, and many nervous affections; and violent nervous affections cause a death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord. With respect to the other confession, it does not seem to affect the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Masters. What I did, I did not do it with an intention to take the child's life away, but I am willing to resign myself to the laws of my country; this woman is innocent; she was not in the place when it was done.</p>
               <p>Court. Perhaps in your present situation it may have escaped you, what this witness has said; you, in your confession, have admitted you gave the child one blow, and she fell against the bedstead; but the account of the surgeon is, that upon examining the head of this child, it does not correspond at all with that confession, because it does not appear to be two bruises only, which would be the natural consequence, if your account was true; but there are at least a dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I struck it upon its temple, and it fell down against the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. But the surgeon says, that does not correspond to the account you gave, for there were at least a dozen blows on the child's head. Would you ask him any question, or offer any thing to the jury, by way of remark on that evidence? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury. The prisoner,

            , is indicted for wilful murder; it does not appear but that the woman has acted the part of an affectionate mother; and that if the child was murdered, she had no hand in it. (Here the learned judge summed up the evidence, and then added) The first probable cause of this child's death, is the wound on the belly, where the cawl was lacerated, and the extravasated blood introduced; if you were to believe Masters's account in his confession, as it is called, and if the blows on the head could in any degree correspond to that account, you ought to acquit him; because though this blow given to the child without any provocation, and the child accidentally falling against the bedstead, and dying, it would not amount to murder; it could only be manslaughter; but the appearances on the head of this child, I am very sorry to say, in no wise correspond with this account; the surgeon has told you, that he cannot possibly think that the appearances on the skull of this child at all correspond to this account; for he says, that there was at least a dozen blows on the head; the child's head was all over bruises, and it must necessarily occur to any one, that if a great number of blows are inflicted, if one singly would not occasion death, yet all being given at the same time, and one after another, they might have that effect; if so, I do not see how you can make it less than murder, if you believe that account: it can only be manslaughter; on the other hand: if you believe the surgeon, it certainly does amount to murder: to be sure, in cases like this, where persons stand charged with the murder of infant children, there generally appears to have been a series of ill usage; in this case, on the contrary, it appears there has been the greatest good usage and tenderness; the child was never heard to cry up stairs, as if it received any correction, but always was treated in the gentlest manner possible; so much is in favour of the prisoner; it appears also that this woman, affected with all the affection of a mother, and shewed all that distress which was expected in a mother; that was the reason why I did not call upon her for her defence: the evidence only affects the prisoner Masters, and it is for you to give your verdict on all the circumstances of the case.</p>

               <p>I live in the Hay-market. I have seen the prisoner Martignon but once, but the prisoner Villoni several times, because he used to visit a lady that lived with me: at half past nine at night Villoni brought Martignon to my lodgings; about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>What passed between the two prisoners at that time, in your hearing? - Martignon told her he was going to leave Mr. and Mrs. Daubigny; that they were very much dissatisfied with him: Villoni said he had nothing to complain of, against Mr. Daubigny, that he behaved very civil to him, and had every thing he could wish; Martignon made answer, that he was not in the same case, for whatever he did did not give satisfaction. When Martignon and Villoni were sitting together, Martignon says to Villoni, I wish to be avenged of Daubigny; and Villoni said to him, there is no way to be avenged of him, than by doing what you know: Martignon sat about a quarter of an hour at the house, and then went away; they both went away.</p>
               <p>Did they, either of them say any thing more on that subject? - They said nothing more; and Martignon said, to-morrow at breakfast we shall meet one another.</p>
               <p>Did either of them say where they were to meet at breakfast? - He said, we shall find one another at breakfast, where you know very well; and we shall see one another about that locksmith that we were talking of; I asked what is the matter? oh, says he, that is not the business of the women; they have not discretion enough to keep a secret; he came the Sunday before he was guilty of that felony, to ask me whether I had heard any news from Paris; and said, he was going to Ireland, that he had taken a place to Ireland, and was going there.</p>
               <p>Did you see them afterwards at the Hay-market? - At half after seven the same night of the robbery Villoni came to her.</p>

               <p>I was on a visit to Mrs. Daubigny. I remember the time when this chest was missing; it was the third of April; I saw it on the third of April; and a few days before I saw it in the parlour, on the sofa; Villoni was in the house, a servant at that time; Villoni asked me how much there was in that chest? to which I answered, I did not know; says he, well, how much do you think there is? he took it up in his hands, and tried it, and said, oh, d - n it, it is very heavy, and if any body wanted to take it away it would be a very hard matter to do it. On the Saturday, the 3d of April, I was up stairs, in the evening, between four and five, in Mrs. Daubigny's room; it was the room where the chest was kept; the chest was safe then; I sat down upon it; Villoni came up stairs while I was in Mrs. Daubigny's room, and went into his own room; I believe it was about five o'clock; after he had locked his door he called me two or three times; I did not answer; my door was shut; then he opened the door, and asked me what business I had in the room by myself; I said, what is that to you? then he told me to come down to tea, that Mr. and Mrs. Daubigny were gone out; I said, by and by; a few minutes after Mrs. Daubigny sent for me to tea; I went down, and found this Villoni drinking tea in the parlour, with a cup of tea in his hand; I sat down to drink tea; after he had drank that cup of tea he got up, and asked for a drop or two of Marraskeen to make sweetmeats; then he went out; I know nothing more; I saw him no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240136"/>more; in about five or six minutes I went to Mrs. Daubigny's room; I observed the door was shut and locked; then I came down and told Mrs. Daubigny that the door was locked; Mrs. Daubigny answered me I was a fool; I went up again and found it locked, and asked the maid for the key; the house maid came up stairs and found it locked; she tried to open it, and could not; then I got a key and opened it, and went in, and the chest was open; the hasp was not down; we went and informed Mrs. Daubigny; she came up with me; we looked into the chest, and the small iron chest was gone; I observed marks of force on the iron chest; it appeared to be opened by force; after that we went up stairs, all over the house, to look for Villoni; we did not find his clothes there; and likewise in his own room, nothing was there; it was all taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Do you say that there was nobody up stairs but Villoni? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You do not pretend to say that nobody was up stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it a large chest? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose any body could open it without a hammer, or some great noise? - They could not have opened it without force.</p>
               <p>You heard no noise? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Villoni go up stairs? - No; when I sat down upon the chest I am sure it was safe locked.</p>

               <p>I was house maid to Mrs. Daubigny. I remember being up stairs a short time before, in the evening, about candle-light; it might be twenty minutes or half an hour before the box was missing; I was in the room where the box was; as I was coming out of the room, from turning down the bed, I met Villoni at the top of the stairs, in the dark.</p>
               <p>How near did you meet Villoni to the bed chamber of your master? - Close by the door; he was in the dark; I had a candle; he had something in his left hand, but what I cannot say; I said nothing to him, but went into another room, to turn down the beds; he went into the confectioner's room, and opened it; there are three rooms together; I says to him, here Monsieur, here is a candle for you; and he said, in broken English, no, tank you, no, tank you; I went down stairs and told my mistress I had turned down the beds; she desired I would get the tea: I went up stairs in about twenty minutes after; when I went up stairs I found the door locked; I left it shut, not locked; I unlocked the door, and found the box of the lock broke, and the clasps were gone of the latch, like, so as you might put your hands in; I found the box also had been broke open, and the small chest had been taken away; Villoni was gone, and all his things were gone; he had not left my master's service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Best, another of Prisoners Counsel. Was this a very bulky parcel that Villoni had in his hand? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Was not the confectioner's room his place? - No, he was mostly in the kitchen, and did his work mostly in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was not the confectioner's room chiefly his apartment? - Yes; but he liked to be in the kitchen for company.</p>
               <p>Did not he spend much more time there, than in the kitchen? - No; he never was up there in the dark; he never worked there.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose this large chest could have been opened without a large hammer, or something to make a noise? - The chest is abused very much; the rooms lay very backward, and we could not hear it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the small chest? - Yes; I carried it up stairs once, and put it into the box, but it is a good bit ago.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Daubigny. The great chest was in my own room; Mr. Daubigny had the key at that time; it is a chest that we keep our property in, in general; I was alarmed about this door being locked; the two servants came down and told me that their master's chest was open; I went up stairs with a candle; when I came up the chest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240137"/>was upon the hasp; there is a hasp to the chest; it locks with a padlock, as well as a substantial lock to it; that hasp was fallen on the side of the chest; I saw the lock broke; I conceived some depredation had been committed; I said, good God! I am robbed, the iron chest is gone; all the servants came round; every one was at home, except Villoni: I looked round my own room to see that every thing was safe; nothing else was missing; I searched every room; and Villoni's was the last; and when I came to his room, I found every thing that he had, was gone; he had not left the least thing in the world; I said Villoni must have robbed me; and then we pursued him: I went up stairs about one; I met Villoni at the door; he went to the confectionary room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You do not know what was in the iron chest? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Had not your husband and Villoni fallen out? - They had no words; I never heard he was to leave us; when I saw Martignon, his countenance was cast down, before Sir Sampson; he denied every thing: Villoni said he would confess every thing; Sir Sampson took it down; I was with him.</p>
               <p>There were no promises or threats to induce him to confess? - I said before Sir Sampson, if you do not confess, you will be hanged; but he did not confess after that.</p>

               <p>I keep the Subscription-house in St. James's-street: this small chest was lodged in my care; and placed by me or my wife, in the plate chest, of which one of us kept the key; I saw it there two or three days before, when I was writing; I had not taken it out for any purpose: when I locked the plate chest about the Wednesday before it was lost, I remember I saw it there; when I came home, I found the house all in confusion: on Monday I pursued Villoni down the river, to Greenwich; and from there I took a post-chaise to Gravesend; from there to Sheerness; and from there I took a ship to Harwich-harbour, where I took the man. I went on board the Good Intent, Captain Cook, bound for Helvetsluys; I was down in the cabin; and I looked down, and found him laying on a bed in the cabin, in his great coat; I desired him directly to deliver me the money; I first of all said to him, give me the money you have robbed me of? his answer was, Sir, I have got but twenty-two guineas and a half; and he gave me twenty-two guineas and an half directly, and four shillings with it: I promised to intercede for him, if he would make a confession: the constable took seven guineas out of one pocket, and eight out of another; I then told him that was far from the sum he had robbed me of; and if he would give it me, if there was any deficiency, if I could intercede with the gentlemen or the Court, I would; he gave me a ten pound note, and a certain number of fifty guinea notes of Hammersley, upon which I made memorandums: he put his hand into bed, and brought out a bundle wrapped in a handkerchief; I opened it, and there was a powder bag with four hundred and forty-eight guineas in gold: Villoni was then in my service; I had a great respect for him; I wished to keep him; I know nothing to affect Martignon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did you know there was any money in the chest? - Yes, I did; I was present the last time it was opened; (I can certainly say there was money in it) which was the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>Do you know that there were not brass or copper, or some metal counters in that chest? - I never saw any but gold and roleaus, notes, and some gold: this money belongs to several gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At your club they do not play, as the gentleman supposes, for brass and counters, but for gold and notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of March, you saw there were cash and notes in the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As far as you know, it never was opened again? - No.</p>

               <p>To Mrs. Daubigny. Do you know the last time it was used in the club? - It has has never been opened since the time it was put in, since the 10th of March; I am very sure it has never been to any gentleman since that; I was asked for it once; and I did not deliver it, because I had not the key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Was not it in your parlour sometimes? - Only when it was called for.</p>

               <p>Did you feel the hand that robbed you, at the time you was robbed? - No; I discovered my pocket half turned out, afterwards; that was when I was got out of the crowd; and I said to the gentleman that was with me, that I had had my pocket picked, upon which

               <p>Was the prisoner under any restraint at the time he shewed him to you? - No, not at all; he appeared to be indisposed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240139"/>from having a top coat on, and a silk handkerchief about his neck: from that circumstance I could hardly suppose that was the man that had robbed me: the money was produced to me by Allen.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear positively that this money and the piece of the watch key had been in your pocket that day? - No not as to the money; but as to the watch-key, I can.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the quantity of money produced, and the kind of pieces, corresponded? - As to that, I cannot positively say only for the sum; the sum was the very sum I lost.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect of what particular pieces of money the sum which you lost, consisted? - No; I was wrong in specifying the pieces before; but that was merely from the strong evidence that appeared in this being found along with the broken watch key in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You seem a very fair man: if I understand you, you wish to correct that part of your evidence about the number of pieces? - Yes, Sir; I was sorry I had said it.</p>
               <p>Describe the condition of this man when he was taken into custody? - He appeared to be very much indisposed.</p>
               <p>Did he walk with a couple of sticks? - I did not observe that; I observed he had one stick; and one stick he had buttoned up in his top coat.</p>
               <p>This was a loose great coat, and outside pocket, that the man had on? - I did not observe that.</p>
               <p>Where was your money taken from? - from my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>There was a great crowd? - Yes; I could not have lost it more than half a minute before I missed it.</p>
               <p>You have no idea of force, or violence, or highway robbery? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner very well: I saw him and Mr. Myers together, on Sunday, the 14th of February, within the Palace-yard, St. James's, going just after the soldiers were relieved; the crowd were going by the Duke of Marlborough's; Mr. Myers was in the crowd; the prisoner was behind him: there was a great crowd and a pushing; just as he came to the end of the passage, where it was wider, Mr. Myers said, God bless me! I have lost my money, I am robbed; as soon as he said so, I said this is the man that robbed you; I saw him pushing up behind him in the crowd; and being the nearest to him, I caught hold of the prisoner; he had on then a blue great coat; there was a bit of a tussle; and I brought him down to the Cock at the Rotation-office; we searched him; and in his right hand great coat pocket, I found five guineas in gold, three half guineas, two half crowns, a new shilling, and a broken watch key: Mr. Myers followed us down to the public house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What way of life are you in? - I am constable.</p>
               <p>We see you very frequently every where? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>You are a constable? - Yes, belonging to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street: I was employed as a witness against lottery-office keepers, by the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>So nothing had been said to Mr. Myers, before his property was taken, by any body in the crowd? - Not as I know of; I never saw the man in my life.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, this is under your advice, that this is laid to be a highway robbery? - It is under the direction of Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>You know it makes the difference of forty pounds, that you are to have your share? - That I am to have my share.</p>
               <p>Do not you understand that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a loose great coat? - Yes, and a right hand outside pocket.</p>
               <p>Now I am going to ask you a question: Do not you know that it frequently has happened, both at the theatre and other public places, that after an alarm has been given, the thief very often puts the money into an honest man's pocket? - I do not know it.</p>

On the 21st of March I had a few friends to dine with me; and we went up to Islington after dinner: the prisoner Mason was our <rs id="t17900424-18-deflabel112" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Where were those goods when you went out in the morning? - In the shop window; they were goods for sale; we had her boxes brought down into my parlour; and there were a variety of articles, the greatest part of them had my shop marks; they consist of linen handkerchiefs, aprons, cotton stockings, &amp;c. the things are all in Court; I was present when her boxes were searched; and I can say with certainty that every article we have here is mine: the prisoner was taken to New Prison: I suspected the prisoner Perry, and I got a search warrant, and went to his master; the prisoner Perry was in the yard; he went up stairs before I did; we desired to see his box; he brought it immediately nearer to the door than it had been, and he opened the box; I do not believe the box was then locked, though the key was in it; in opening the box there were several articles that I laid my hands on; and he said these articles were given him by the prisoner Mason; these things had been lost prior to the 21st of March.</p>
               <p>What was the value of each of those articles? - They were some pocket handkerchiefs, and half a neck handkerchief; the neck handkerchief was worth one shilling, and the pocket handkerchiefs worth one shilling a piece; the boy was examined, and very frankly told us, that all these articles were given him by the prisoner Mason: having further information against Mason, I went to Islington, to

               <p>Do you recollect the faces of the other three? - Yes; one of them, Denby, he had not so good a coat on as he has now; I cannot be sure, because by moon-light one cannot so well see the colour.</p>
               <p>Had you more than a momentary view of his face? - Yes; I can undertake to swear to him: I had been on the top of the buildings about six in the evening; I saw the state of the buildings then; and when I went up again, I examined, and found a great deal of lead was gone, which, when weighed, weighed four hundred and fifty-eight pounds; that was during the time these boys were on the top of the house: I found all the lead moved inside the roof, upon the cieling; I matched it, and it corresponded: it was from the gutter.</p>

On Thursday night, the 4th of March, me and the three prisoners, all four went up a-top of the house in Hyde-street, and ripped off a great quantity of lead, and moved it out of the gutter: the three prisoners were all with me; they were inside when I was taken; I had just settled the lead.</p>

               <p>(Prosecutor deposes to the spoons by the cypher R. A. I.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Look at the blond lace? - I know this to be my property by the corresponding numbers in my book.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - There are particular numbers on the cards; they are not my writing.</p>
               <p>Had you lace of that sort which you missed? - I had; and particularly done up in one parcel, to put by, which I not immediately wanted; they would not have been wanted till next Midsummer.</p>
               <p>Do you think it a hard bargain to lend a guinea on them? - I suppose, to speak within compass, they cost me above forty shillings: the lawn probably is worth three guineas; I would not so particularly swear to the lawn, as they were all wrapped up together; and the pawn-broker's boy confessed he had taken them all.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him? - There was no promise or threat.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he had been a very bad wicked boy, and had taken the spoon, but confessed to nothing more: I repeated the question, I believe, fifty times: when these things were produced, he then owned he had taken them; I believe he confessed all the things that Carpmeal has; I recollect seeing Mrs. Tate wear this ring very frequently.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

Mr. Young came in on Monday, the 15th of March, and had a glass of gin and water, and sat down where there was a prisoner in the house; by and by he came to me, and said I am robbed? I said that cannot be; I accused the soldier; the other man was with him; he seemed very much flurried; they had taken this prisoner that was in the box; to the watch-house: I took the soldier into custody; I searched him, and found a shilling and some halfpence: Sir Sampson committed the soldier, and discharged the other.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hood, the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a shoe-maker, I believe; he comes to my house sometimes: the serjeant and corporal talked together; and they went to search a room by his direction; they found nothing: he said, search the room, under the bed; there I found two guineas, and a particular bad shilling, which the man had offered me before; a very remarkable shilling; I am positive this was the shilling he offered me before.</p>
               <p>(The shilling deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury: I have been quartered in the house since the 25th of last August always when I came off duty, I was in the tap-room: I never saw the man sleep, nor even saw him to my knowledge before, till this day: I am innocent of the crime: my witnesses waited till last night.</p>

               <p>Were there any such strong leading marks of neglect and abuse of this child, that you can state to the Court? - The child was so neglected, that the bones were through the skin; and there were holes through the skin.</p>
               <p>That was the observation you made, that the child was so thin, that the bones came through the skin? - I had not an opportunity of seeing, it was so still; I took it down stairs that morning: I had it a fortnight and one day; it appeared a little better; but when it had any thing that was nourishing, it was worse.</p>
               <p>Did you consult any medical person upon it? - I took it to Doctor Vaux the first morning; he is here.</p>
               <p>The child died the fifteenth day after you had it? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240149"/>How long had this woman had it? - I do not recollect how long; she had it the day before the mother was buried; the first day she had it, she went out at twelve, and did not return till four o'clock; and the child was crying then for victuals; the child's head was very bad; I was obliged to set up with it all night, to get it clean enough to take it into bed; she had never taken it into bed.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I have only her own words for it; she laid it in a drawer.</p>
               <p>That was like a cradle? - It was a drawer; it was only three feet and a quarter long; the child could not lay in a drawer after I had it two or three days; I frequently saw it in that drawer; she had no where else to lay it, that her husband would permit her to lay it in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You say the first day she had the child, she went out; that was two or three months before the child died? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the mother? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the disorder of which she died? - No, I do not know either father or mother.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that this infant had the misfortune to be born with a consumptive complaint? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>This woman had no cradle of her own? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was not this a safe thing, to put it in this drawer? - No, I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>How many children had this woman, herself? - I do not know, Sir; she has three now; and one she has buried.</p>
               <p>This was a nurse child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many beds had she and her husband, and her children? - Two.</p>
               <p>How often did the father come to see it? - Two or three times in a week.</p>

               <p>I visited at the house of Mrs. Cass. I had opportunities of seeing this infant child: I have seen it twice in the prisoner's apartments; the first time I saw it, was within about three weeks after she had it; at the time I saw it in her own apartment, it laid on the outside of the sacking of the bed, on an old stuffed pillow-case (what was in it I cannot tell), with a pair of old blue breeches covered over; and I went to it, and it smelt very disagreeable; I told her it wanted nursing; and she said the child was ill, and would not bear nursing: between the next time that I saw it, I have heard her go out, and leave it, frequently, without any person to take care of it, except three times: she has three children now living; she had four, but buried one; the eldest is about nine years; the children were always together; the last time I saw the child in her apartment, it was in a drawer, on the same stuffed pillow-case, and the same covering; I only saw its face; I did not examine it: I saw it afterwards in Mrs. Cass's room; then it was in a most dreadful situation; I helped to clean the child's head, and the cap was eat into the head; I was forced to cut it with the scissars; it was very disagreeable, and quite devoured with vermin: I cleaned and dressed it according to Dr. Vaux's directions.</p>
               <p>Dr. VAUX sworn.</p>
               <p>I attended this child; I think it was the 26th of February; if I am not mistaken, it died within a fortnight. Mrs. Cass brought the child to me, observing it to be in the last stage, as they conceived, of a consumption; and that the child could not hold out many days. I thought the sickly state of the child required some better care and attention than what the woman who had the care of it seemed to extend to it; medical advice was out of the question; I desired her to carry the child to the churchwarden, that he might see the woman, to charge her to take care of it, or put it into the care of some other person; in consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240150"/>of this, a message came to me, to request I would attend the child in Mrs. Cass's care; accordingly I went down to see the child: but the child was in that weak state, and indeed so far gone, that it was quite unnecessary for me to do any thing for it; the child had a bad complaint indeed; I conceived the child to have been born of diseased parents; and as such the child's constitution partook of it; and I have not the least doubt but that was the case.</p>
               <p>Then upon your view of the child, you rather place the death of the child to the constitution with which it was born, than to any thing else.</p>

On the Monday following, a person came and asked me if I had lost something? I said I would go up stairs and look; I saw the box in the dining-room was wrenched open; it is a Shakesperian society; and I found several of the medals were gone, and a picture: I was informed it was at Bow-street; the picture was my property: I went to Bow-street with Morant, and saw these things; they are here; I saw the medals on the Wednesday before; I do not recollect when I saw the picture: I will not swear to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you been drinking much? - I was as sober as I am now. I was going along <placeName id="t17900424-41-crimeloc228">Holborn, opposite the French Horn gateway</placeName>

               <p>How came you to go into Holborn? - I lost my way.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in London? - Four years. I do not know my direct road in the night.</p>
               <p>What happened to you then? - The night was cold; I had my hands in my breeches pocket: I saw the prisoners about six poles off me, and a woman in company; I could distinguish them by the light of the lamps; seeing them stand I took my hands out of my pockets, and buttoned them up, and walked up towards them; as I passed, I gave them the wall; I walked along the curb; as I was passing, Buchanan came with all his force, and shoved me off the curb; he did not push me down; but at the same time, he followed me, and took my hat off, and threw it into a passage just by, and struck me, and knocked me down, after he had taken my hat: Bathurst came to his assistance, and the woman, at the time they knocked me down: I called the watch, and got hold of them both, and strove to hold them; Bathurst clapped his foot upon my breast, and broke away from me; I was down at that time; I endeavoured to keep Buchanan; the patrol came up, and the patrol took hold of him: Bathurst stepped to the gateway; Wright, the patrol came up; I asked him if he was a watchman? he said, yes: I kept Buchanan; they took Bathurst; in the scuffle I lost my money; my pockets were turned inside-out.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you lose the money? - When I was upon the ground, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was you stunned by the blow? - No: my hat was picked up by the watchman; and he has it here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have mentioned all you have lost? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You are certain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You lost nothing else? - Yes, some papers.</p>
               <p>What were they? - Duplicates of things I had in pledge.</p>
               <p>How long had you lodged in Dyot-street? - Five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>A private house? - No, a public house.</p>
               <p>What sort of a house? - I looked upon it to be a good house.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it? - No.</p>
               <p>So you had lost your way? - I had.</p>
               <p>How soon did you find yourself lost? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How far had you got before you found you had overshot Dyot-street? - Into Lincolns-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>What did the woman do? - She secured me by the hair of my head.</p>
               <p>What became of the woman? - She made her escape.</p>
               <p>Did not these men give charge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - I do not know what the charge was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240159"/>What became of you? - I was sent to prison with them, and continued till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Where was it you offered, if they would give you one pound six and three-pence, they might go about their business? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>You will swear that? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you, or not? - I might make an offer of that kind.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. Will you swear it did not happen? - I do not recollect; they were searched.</p>
               <p>Was your money or duplicates found: was any copper, silver, or gold found upon them? - I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Was not there four shillings found on each of them? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard there is a reward of forty pounds, for the apprehension of a foot-pad robber? - I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you not? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Tell me, yes or no?</p>
               <p>Court. That is a plain question; you must give an answer? - For foot-pads I never did; for out-laws, and the like, I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you or did you not hear of it? - For out-laws, and the like, not for foot-pads.</p>
               <p>You was sober, and the prisoners were? - I heard the constable say they were a little infatuate with liquor.</p>
               <p>Did he not say you were all drunk? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long had you been with your friend? - I had been in Rosemary-lane; and went with him to St. James's; and from thence I got into Lincoln's-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>Where had you been at in Rosemary-lane? - A public house; the Crooked-billet.</p>
               <p>I dare say you have a precious acquaintance; you live in Dyot-street, and visit in Rosemary-lane: how came you to live in Dyot-street? - A young man who works with me, lives there.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Sollum, a japanner? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never say they molested a woman you was with? - I never said they molested a woman I was in company with.</p>
               <p>How long have you worked with Gibson and Gisborne? - Six weeks: when I came to London, I could not get employment in my own business; I trafficked in the country, from Lydd in Kent.</p>
               <p>What did you deal in, moon-shine and tobacco? - No.</p>
               <p>You was a smuggler? - No; I was employed by a man.</p>
               <p>What trafficking, upon your oath? - In smuggling, if I must tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, it is one of the great blessings of the constitution of this country, that no man can be put upon a trial for his life, without evidence, and the party being produced who gives that evidence: these men are upon trial for their lives; and one is sorry to hear a man give this sort of evidence on such an occasion: upon my word, I think it affronting to you, and every man, to hear such evidence as this: if you think it proper these men should stand in jeopardy of their lives any longer, I am willing to go on.</p>

               <p>What becomes usually of these old stones? - They are taken to the mason's yard.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of that stone? - About one shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. Did that stone belong to them? - It did belong to them; I saw them take it off the ground, and put it on the boy's knot.</p>
               <p>Were there any stones there to your knowledge, that were not taken from the pavement? - None had any business there.</p>

               <p>Court. Then there is an end of it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Harrison called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Davis, junior, called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Davis, senior, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Burnell, junior. Was it a loose stone? - I saw Harrison take the hammer, and knock it up, and put it upon the boy's knot.</p>
               <p>At the time he took it, was it fixed as part of the pavement? - It must be, certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. This case does not come within the statute; the stone was part of the freehold.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship, and you, gentlemen of the jury. I am under the necessity of troubling the Court with a written defence, not being capable of telling my story otherwise, to be so well understood. I lived as servant with the prosecutor at the time of the pretended felony being committed. I happened, accidentally, one day, to scald a favourite dog of the prosecutor's, and was most severely reprimanded by him and his wife for so doing: about three or four days afterwards, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, my mistress called me out of the kitchen, and asked me if I knew of a piece of edging which was on a card? which I denied, not knowing any thing of it; but she insisted that I had taken it, and at that time of night sent for a watchman, and gave charge of me, and I was taken to the watch-house. There not being any alderman sitting next day, I was taken to Wood-street Compter, where I remained two nights before I had a hearing. I was at length taken before an alderman; and the prosecutor attended, and made a charge against me, of having stolen two bits of edging; this charge he had ready framed in writing, prepared for the purpose, which was sworn by his wife; and the alderman, thereupon, thought himself bound to commit me: this was during the last session. The prosecutor desired I might be committed to take my trial this session, but the alderman refused, saying there was plenty of time at the then sessions: the prosecutor, however, did not think proper to prefer a bill of indictment that sessions; but on the last day of it, when I was brought up to be discharged by proclamation, he attended with an affidavit; and I was thereupon remanded; so that I have now been upwards of two months in confinement. I must solemnly declare my innocence of the charge, and beg leave to suggest that the present prosecution originated in my having (unfortunately for me) scalded the dog before mentioned; and if the prosecutor is asked, I trust it will appear that he has repeatedly declared, in the presence of Mr. Wade of Fleet-street, and Mr. Hodgson, and Mr. Evans, both attornies, in Clifford's-inn, that if I had not scalded his dog's back, he never should have thought of prosecuting me; and that it was more to punish me on that account, than for the supposed theft. These gentlemen I have procured a friend to subpoena, to prove this fact. When before the alderman, the prosecutor stated that he expected to find more of his property in my box; in consequence of which, he had an order granted him to search it, where he found nothing but an exceeding old pair of leather gloves, which were given me by my mistress to scour in. I never was charged with a crime of the sort before, and have always preserved a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Downes. Did you go by order of the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Cutting. Did you go into that room? - Not before the lace was found: when Mrs. Cutting and the prisoner were there, I was there.</p>
               <p>You did not put the lace in the box? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner was a witness to several instruments of yours; and if she was convicted, she would be no witness? - Yes. The master said if he had not detected her in the barbarity of scalding a dog, he would not have prosecuted her.</p>
               <p>The witness also gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I said, yes; Lyon came and spoke to her; and Brown came; and I went for some liquor: a person of the name of Armsby, who lodges in my house, said it is almost seven o'clock: Wigmore pulled a watch out, and said it was seven; I believe it was a gold one: I went out of some errands, and when I came back, Wigmore said she had lost her watch; I asked Armsby what was become of it? she said she did not know? and Lyon said, do not be afraid, mother Hanagan, here it is; and gave it me; and I went and asked advice about it: Brown and Lyon said it was stolen; I wanted to find the owner; and I went to some neighbours, and they told me where to find the owner; I did not part with it, till I found Mr. Rowles, the owner.</p>

               <p>I was shopman to the prosecutors at that time: on Wednesday, the 25th of March, about half past eleven, the prisoners came in, and asked to look at some Irish cloth, the same they had on the Tuesday before; they came together, and both asked for two yards of Irish cloth; accordingly I pulled down a piece, and cut them two yards of it; afterwards they asked to look at some muslins; they did not pay for the cloth; I put it on one side; there was another young man in the shop shewing the muslins; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Court. Is he alive and well; that young man? - Yes; but he has nothing to do with this business; I shewed them the muslins; the young man was shewing muslins to another lady: they asked the price of the top piece of muslin? I told them five shillings and six-pence; the woman desired me to cut a yard; they came together, the same as man and wife; I knew nothing to the contrary; turning myself round I perceived the woman fumbling with her hands under her apron; the man prisoner asked her what she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240177"/>doing; she said, she was feeling for her handkerchief; Phillips asked her if she wanted any thing else? she said, yes; Phillips desired me to shew her some more; but I took no notice of what he said, but took the wrapper, and put it on one side, being of opinion she had stolen some: I sent for my master; I immediately came back to the linen shop, where I left the prisoners, and found Trotter was gone; I had still stronger suspicions that she had stolen something; and I enquired of Phillips, who was in the shop, where she was gone? he said, he knew nothing about her, the prosecutor and I pursued her; we took her in Bowyer's court, a very small distance from our house; we brought her back, and found the property upon her, which is here; it has been in my custody ever since; it is the property of

R. it is my own writing; there is seventeen yards of it; it is muslin; it cost fifty shillings; it was under her cloak; I saw Mr. Worthy take it from under her cloak, after she was brought back to the silk shop: this piece was in the same wrapper with that I cut the yard from.</p>
               <p>When you saw her hand under her apron was she stooping? - Rather so; I was behind the counter; the wrapper was on one side of me; the movement of her hands was the first thing that induced me to think she had taken something: the prisoners were taken before a magistrate, and committed: they conversed together as man and wife; he purchased a gown for her at our shop, which she had on.</p>

               <p>Another man and me were straightening it, and the man went down and helped me; and then my master came down, and insisted on searching me, and he pulled some silk out of my pockets; I knew nothing at all about them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know of any quarrel between him and the man? - No, Sir, that was not possible; he was not nine hours in my house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>I recollect coming home the 14th of March: and I sent for the constable, and desired him to break open the prisoner's door; I did not go up the second pair of stairs; I missed my money: the constable brought the prisoner down to the one pair of stairs, where I was; the prisoner, and me, and the constable went into the bedroom; the constable went out; and as soon as he went out, the prisoner said he was the man that had robbed me; he asked me not to hurt him? I told him I did not wish to hurt him; I thought it very odd I should be robbed, and he in the house; he said, he had been asleep on the bed: I discovered before I went for the constable, that I had been robbed, by opening the drawer, where I had put my money in the morning, and missing it: when we went into the room the constable left me and the prisoner together; and he took hold of my left hand, says he, Mrs. Maxwell, I am the man that has robbed you, and do send the people away, and do not hurt me; and I came out of the room, to endeavour to send the people away; and I said, have you got Charles's buckles? (which was a young lad I had the care of); and the prisoner said, he had; then I sent for a neighbour, who is not here; nothing else material passed that I remember; there was seven guineas and a half, and twenty shillings and six pence in silver; I saw it there that morning; I counted it, and put it into the drawer; I cannot say whether I locked the drawer; but my keys hung up in the room; I was going to walk, and I thought they would be heavy.</p>

On the 12th of April instant, as near as I can guess, about six in the afternoon, the child was playing about the Strand; it ran all about the market; it pays its visits all round; about half an hour after Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Ashmore brought the child, and asked me if it was mine; I had not missed it; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240180"/>seen it three quarters of an hour before, at furthest; the child had its frock and pinafore on, without its cap; then I was desired to attend at Bow-street; Mr. Addington was there; the child said the woman put the cap into her bubbies; that was the prisoner; she was searched; Mrs. Johnson pulled out the cap before the justice and me, from the prisoner's bosom.</p>

               <p>I am one of the headborough's of St. Catherine's. I received information on the 27th of February, from a neighbour; I went over, and saw the prisoner; he said, he brought it from Leadenhall, and was taking it to sell; I sent for a butcher, three doors off, to ask him the value; he first said five-pence, then a groat; I told him I believed he had not come honestly by it; I asked him where he lived; he hesitated a good while, and then he told me Ratcliffe-highway; he went with me, and carried the pork; when we came to the King's Arms, East Smithfield, facing the Rotation-office,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240187"/>I took him in there; he was detained on suspicion; one of the officers belonging to that office stuck up notice: the prisoner was much in liquor.</p>

            , and they both went off together.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any window break? - No.</p>
               <p>Could you, at the distance you was, see whether the pane of glass was broke? - It was broke when I came by; I observed it when Smith first spoke to me; I never saw Smith before; but I am sure it was him; I passed Berry two or three times that evening, at the post; I am sure of him also: I went home and told my mistress; I came out for some candles about half an hour after, about eight, and I saw Smith and Berry walking up the Hay-market; and I told Mr. Butler, and we both went after them; and Mr. Butler took them to St. Ann's watch-house; it was about seven, or half after seven, when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did you see me put my hand in the window? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Berry. Did you see me break this man's window? - No; I saw you do nothing but lean against the post.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How did you fasten the door; I pulled it too; it was a common latch; the glass was very badly cracked; but there was no hole.</p>
               <p>What time did you take the prisoners? Just when the watch was going nine; there were several together: (the knives deposed to:) I can very safely swear to them, particularly that one that is stamped with my own name; I missed all the things in the indictment; but I recovered nothing but these two knives.</p>
               <p>Were these knives in each of the windows? - Yes; they were tied up in small parcels; one is a clasp-knife, with a horn handle; the other is a pen-knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is never a clasp-knife with a horn handle, in the indictment; what is the other knife? - This is what we call a penknife.</p>
               <p>Is that with a bone handle? - No, it is with a horn handle.</p>
               <p>Is that a tortoiseshell handle? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. There are no horn handles in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, gentlemen, we are in another difficulty: but the only articles which are traced in the possession of the prisoners, are not in this indictment; and it certainly is material; for though the man was seen at the distance across the street, to put his hand in the shop, he does not know what he took out.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Newton deposes to the gown and piece of cotton. I know it by the old fashioned make; I had it made last year; and I had it made that old fashioned way, because I thought it suited me best; the piece of cotton is the same as the gown; it was in the drawer.</p>

               <p>The petticoat was pledged pretty near four months before I left the lodging, by the consent of that gentlewoman; I asked her for some cash? she told me she had none; the next was the sheets, nigh three months before I left the lodging; and according to agreement, I was to have clean sheets every month; she told me she had no cash to lend me; she said I might take the sheets if I pleased; my wife was continually pledging her things, backwards and forwards; and that same gown once before; the last thing that was pledged, was near two months before I left the lodging; when I asked for my bill, I thought it was very large; we made it up to the 13th of March; we put in the interest; I said, look over the bill, and see if it is right? says she, I never kept any account; oh, says I, I will make affidavit I kept a just account; to the best of my knowledge, she looked on the bill, and said she was very well satisfied; and she signed it: the magistrates said they could not make it felony; they said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240196"/>you have signed your husband's property away: every word as I shall answer before your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, before heaven; and they gave me that copy; Mr. Green kept the bill which he has; I thought that if a person was indebted to a creditor, that they should have the bill by them; but I am deprived of it; it is the first Court that ever I was before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Newton. He says this petticoat was pledged by your consent, and the sheets and the cloak; is that true, or is it not? - It is not true.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give him leave to pledge any of these things which were pledged, which were missing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is all that false which he says? - That, Sir, is very false.</p>
               <p>At the time he was a lodger to you, did you ever desire him to pawn any thing for you? - What I begged his wife to do, I always had the paper and the bill; but as to these articles, I never saw any; those things she carried for me, I have got again; I have taken them out myself.</p>
               <p>Then you are very sure that none of these things that are missing, were at your request pawned by him? - None of them: we were settling money that I lent him; he was to pay me sixteen shillings a week for his and his wife's board; I did put my hand to that, for the debt he owed me, and for nothing else but the debt; this has been added afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing in that account about pledges? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have one favour to beg (she says she knows nothing of the things lent to pledge) which is, to ask her what the whole debt is.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Newton. Can you tell me what was the whole amount of the debt? - Upon my word I cannot; for I thought of receiving the money; he pretended he had a one hundred pounds draft in his pocket; and that he was put off from time to time receiving it.</p>
               <p>And was that the reason that you settled the account in this way? - Yes.</p>

             was before me; he was face to face to me; I saw his hand up to my fob; I knocked it down; a second time I thought I saw his hand in the same place.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you not a great coat on at that time? - I had, just as I have now, buttoned in the same manner; I saw his hand a second time at my fob, and knocked it down; I was going to make an attempt to get into a small recess, where I thought I might be in safety, among some ironmongery; I believe they were grates: the moment I was going to make the attempt, the prisoner saw me attempt, and forced himself with great violence into an avenue that led to this recess; then we were face to face again; I turned a little to the left, to get into this recess; then I concluded I should be robbed, and prepared myself accordingly; the first thing that was done, my hat was knocked off.</p>
               <p>By whom? - I cannot tell; the people on each side pressed in, and kept my arms down; I did not remove them to recover my hat.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you did not, or could not? - I do not know whether I could; but I did not; my arms were then pressed in with great violence, that I was not able to move them; the next thing was, I felt a hand at my fob, taking out my watch.</p>
               <p>Do you mean you felt a hand at your fob, or that you felt your watch going; because they are two very different things? - I mean both; at the time my watch was going, I felt a hand touch my left hand, as if it came from between the legs of my left hand neighbour; it seemed like a man groping in the dark; I thought that a man behind my next neighbour, had put his hands between the legs of my next neighbour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is all mere circumstances? - It is guess.</p>
               <p>Do not let us try men for their lives by guesses; pray do not tell us your guesses nor your dreams, nor any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Jury. We will be much obliged to you if you will speak from a fact, and not from what you guess.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edminston. I felt a hand upon mine some time; immediately afterwards, I heard a voice, which appeared to me to be near the pavement, saying, I have got it; I was immediately released upon that; and I kept my eye upon the prisoner Connelly; he stooped to the side of the foot-way; I then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240198"/>went up to him, and took him by the hand, and said, Sir, you have taken my watch; he replied, I am very sorry you think so; and immediately a constable took him by the other arm; Connelly then said, says he, if you will go into a shop with me, I will shew you that I have not got your watch; we went into the shop, and he pulled out a red pocket-book with a fifteen pounds bank note in it; and he pulled out six guineas in money; I afterwards committed him to the care of the constable, and he took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Did you ever recover your watch? - The watch was recovered; I did not see it till I saw it before Sir

               <p>Upon that occasion, I believe, he produced some witnesses, in order to satisfy the magistrate what manner of man he was? - He produced witnesses on Tuesday; he had a hearing on Wednesday again.</p>

               <p>Re-committed and re-examined, when? - I really do not know that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was Thursday, at least, I observe, when that respectable and worthy magistrate committed him on suspicion of being concerned in taking your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of the prisoner Connelly before? - Never; I never saw him before that day, in my life.</p>
               <p>He immediately went with you into a shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was searched, and your watch was not found? - Not found.</p>
               <p>Though he was searched instantly? - He was searched instantly.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long it was after Connelly was actually in custody, and after he had been searched before the other prisoner, Dodd, was taken into custody? - That I do not know.</p>

               <p>I observe, that with the propriety and caution that becomes a man in your character in life, and your education, and your cloth, you said that you verily believed, that from all the circumstances together, that he was the man that took your watch? - I verily believe it; I did not see him take the watch from me.</p>
               <p>How long time had elapsed, from the time you felt your watch go, to the time you said to Connelly, Sir, you have got my watch? - I suppose, not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>This was at noon day? - A little after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>You had had with this man in the court, some conversation; some altercation passed? - Not a word; it was with another man behind me; a tall stout man.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner Connelly thoroughly searched; and had you any idea, that he, at that time, after he was searched, had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240199"/>watch in his possession? - I do not believe he had.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean they had never been used at all? - They had been laid on the table twice, but no more.</p>
               <p>Then they had not been washed? - No.</p>
               <p>Were they clean, or dirty? - They were clean.</p>
               <p>Were they your master's property? - Yes; because I know they were what was belonging to two dozen.</p>
               <p>How do you know they were the same? - Because I had the care of them.</p>
               <p>Are they the same figure as the others? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were your dealings with the prisoner to a considerable amount? - They are to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>To what amount in a year? - I cannot recollect; they may be two or three hundreds a year.</p>
               <p>What was the nature of your transactions? - He purchased goods of us; linen and cotton.</p>
               <p>Had you any regular stated time of credit? - Yes; we gave him four months upon some; and on others, six.</p>
               <p>In the course of two years, of course the time of payment came round more than once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he ever made you a payment by bills before? - Yes, Sir, repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you before, to have an acceptance of Mr. Syratt's? - I have searched our bill-book, and I do not find we have.</p>
               <p>Did you know Syratt at all? - No, Sir; I never saw him before this business.</p>
               <p>When the first bill came into your possession, which is dated the 14th of January; and the letter, in which it is inclosed as the 26th; and at three months date; and had about ten weeks to run, did you on receiving it, make any enquiry who the acceptor was? - We did not.</p>
               <p>You took it upon the credit of Mr. Baert, relying on it, that it was a good bill, and that it would be paid in course? - Relying on the prisoner: as to the acceptor, we knew there was such a person.</p>
               <p>At what distance of time, after the 20th of January, did the prisoner become a bankrupt? - I believe, about a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>At that time, did the prisoner owe you any money besides thirty-six pounds eleven shillings? - Yes, about four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240207"/>Did you hold any other securities besides this bill? - No other.</p>
               <p>After that time, it was, I take it for granted, you then set yourselves to enquire into the solvency of the acceptor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On your enquiry as to the solvency of Syratt, I believe your hopes of payment were not increased? - No, Sir, not from what we learnt concerning that bill.</p>
               <p>As to the general credit of Syratt, did it stand high, or otherwise? - High.</p>
               <p>Did your house purchase some goods of Syratt? - Some person by my order.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - Hamilton.</p>
               <p>You never had any dealings with Syratt before? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>To what amount was Hamilton directed to buy goods? - To about the amount of the thirty-six pounds bill.</p>
               <p>Then you did not make application to Syratt, to know whether it was his acceptance, or not? - No, Sir, because we had no doubt at that time, but it was his acceptance.</p>
               <p>You did not tell Syratt that your house had a bill for such a sum, and that you wanted to take goods for that sum? - No.</p>
               <p>You never questioned him as to its being his acceptance? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Syratt, like all other insolvent men, did not like to be paid in his own coin? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>He then denied the acceptance for the first time, as far as you know? - He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Syratt is not yet a bankrupt, that you know? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner and Syratt were in the habit of accomodating one another with their acceptance? - I do not know; I never gave any accommodation before.</p>

            ; we are linen-drapers in Whitechapel: I know the prisoner perfectly well; this letter Mr. Tapp gave me; it is the prisoner's hand writing; the conversation mentioned in it, was on Sunday, the 24th of January; the prisoner came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240208"/>house; I told him I would not give him any farther credit, unless he paid some of the old account, or gave some further security; I went from home on the Monday morning, and returned in a week or ten days; I received this (the second) letter; it is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Baert? - Two or three years; he has paid us four or five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you give him considerable credit, to the amount of four or five hundred pounds; did not you view him in the light of an honest man? - At first we did, or we should not have trusted him to that amount.</p>
               <p>Do you remember sending Mr. Hamilton to apply at Syratt's for some stockings? - Certainly; I sent him myself; I desired him to purchase to the amount nearly, or something more, of the bill appearing to be Syratt's acceptance, which I held of his.</p>
               <p>Where did you wait till Hamilton came to you? - At the Queen's Head in St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>And when Hamilton came, was there any goods brought? - Yes; Mr. Syratt's shopwoman, and a young man, came down with the goods; I know the young man.</p>
               <p>What passed? - I offered the acceptance, to the best of my knowledge; whether Mr. Hamilton did it, or me, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>When the acceptance was offered, what did the maid say? - She said she should not leave the goods for that acceptance; and Mr. Syratt was sent for.</p>
               <p>Did she want the cash? - She said she would not leave the goods without the money.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire Mr. Hamilton to offer cash for them, in the shop? - Not to offer cash; because he was not to pay for them till they came; I certainly meant to offer the bill for payment; the young man who came down with her, was dispatched back again for Mr. Syratt; and he took the bill with him; and Mr. Syratt came down, and denied the acceptance.</p>
               <p>Was you afraid Syratt would not stand his ground? - My reason was; I certainly wished to get the amount of my bill, when it was doubtful; I did not know it was good.</p>
               <p>Did not you consider it as a doubtful bill? - I did not know whether Mr. Syratt's affairs would turn out good or bad; I was not satisfied with Mr. Syratt's acceptance, certainly.</p>
               <p>Do you know that Syratt is gone out of the way since that time? - Yes, he told me so; that he was at a lodging within the neighbourhood of Charing-cross.</p>

               <p>I have been servant to Mr. Syratt, three years almost; I have often seen him write: (looks at the acceptance:) I do not believe this to be his hand writing; I said so the first time I saw it: Mr. Aldred shewed it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Aldred shewed it to you at the Queen's Head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that the R. S. is not his, or that the whole is not his? - There is no part of his writing on the face of the bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not at all like his writing, I dare say? - It must resemble it a little, or else it could not pass.</p>
               <p>You was at Mr. Syratt's shop, perhaps, when Mr. Hamilton came for some stockings? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton did not tell you he had any bill of your master's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Syratt at home, himself? - No.</p>
               <p>Who dealt with Mr. Hamilton? - I reached down some of the goods; and Mrs. Syratt served him.</p>
               <p>So you was to go with the goods, and take the money? - Yes, Sir; I was to take a bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Syratt was sent for on this? - Yes.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Baert? - Yes; I have seen him at his house, and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Do you know much of your master's dealings in trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had Mr. Baert been acquainted with him; can you tell me? - Indeed, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Where does your master live now? - In Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>And always continued to live there ever since? - Yes, always lived at home for the last three years, unless his business called into the country.</p>
               <p>Had he ever a country lodging at Charing-cross; it is a rare atmosphere, especially when the fogs from the Thames arise; how long is it since he had that lodging? - I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Try, try; at the time, I suppose, when every body goes into the country, in the middle of winter? - Every body is liable to go into the country.</p>
               <p>Now, did not your master go into the country in dog days, in January last? - I cannot recollect that he was in the country in January.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, has he not had a lodging some time since, at Charing-cross? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happens it now, that your memory was so frail, as to fancy that he had lived at home always, the last three years? - I did not know what you said; I believe he was down at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>How long had he that lodging? - Indeed I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>How many weeks was he absent from home; from Berkeley-square? - I am sure I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Try, try; I would not hurry you for the world; but I must have an answer; why you used to go backwards and forwards to him? - I am sure I cannot tell how many weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240211"/>When did he first take that lodging? - Indeed I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after last Christmas? - It was after last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Mr. Baert became a bankrupt? - I believe it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - I am sure I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it before, or after these stockings were bought at your master's shop? - I believe it was before.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after the 14th of January? - I believe it was afterwards; I think so.</p>
               <p>How long was he there? - I cannot recollect how long.</p>
               <p>How long was it after he was arrested, that he went to live there? - He went there directly after he was arrested.</p>
               <p>In the verge of the court? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Who arrested him? - I am sure I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - I have heard, but I do not remember.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the debt? - I have heard, but I forgot; it was not a large sum.</p>
               <p>Do you know how that debt arose; whether it was upon his acceptance, or not? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>After your master had been arrested, he went into the verge of the court: how long did he continue there? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>He used to come home of a Sunday, did not he? - Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>And go back on a Sunday night? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many Sundays did he come to his family, and go home at night? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>About how many? - I believe it was not more than a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Had he any reason for going there, but for the benefit of the air? I believe this is the gentleman that took the action out? - He was not arrested.</p>
               <p>Then he smelt powder, and went away without being shot; does your master live at home now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he been returned to Berkeley-square? - I cannot recollect how long.</p>
               <p>Have any of his bills been presented, that have not been paid? - Yes, I believe they have.</p>
               <p>When, for the first time, did he begin to have his acceptances refused? - Soon after Mr. Baert became a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>How often, think you, have you been obliged to deny the payment of your master's bills, since Mr. Baert could lend him no longer his acceptance? - I can't tell how many; but Mr. Baert was the cause of it; because Mr. Syratt has lost a great deal of money by him.</p>
               <p>What bills were refused payment? - I cannot tell; nor to whom given; or for what sums; he has had no more but these two.</p>
               <p>Let us hope not: how long has he been come home? - Indeed I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>How long is it since he got a letter of licence from his creditors? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long is that to last after he has hanged Mr. Baert? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Baert accepted any bills for your master? - I believe so; I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he accepted several bills without money being paid to him? - I do not know; but I heard so; I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he accepted to a great amount for Baert; and that Baert accepted for him? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>How long has your master left the verge of the court, to come home? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You have been a witness before? - It is a new thing.</p>
               <p>Was you never a witness before? - I once was a witness; only once (a man bought a pair of gloves) to prove a stamp was not in, before a justice: I cannot recollect any other time.</p>
               <p>Try; within these three years? - I do not recollect; I never was a witness to any thing but that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - To the best of my knowledge, I think I was once<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240212"/>a witness for Mr. Syratt; that was about these glove stamps.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - I cannot recollect; I believe it is more than a year ago; I am sure I never was but twice a witness before.</p>
               <p>Positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Do not you know? - Yes: one, I think, was due the 18th of this month.</p>
               <p>Any of them earlier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the earliest? - There is another last month.</p>
               <p>None in January? - I cannot tell, without I look; the first is the 18th of February, for forty pounds; I paid it away; it came back to me, and I was obliged to take it up; the next is the 18th of March, for forty pounds; that has been through a good many hands; the next is April, for forty-three pounds, seven shillings, and threepence.</p>
               <p>That you was obliged to take up? - I had not paid it away.</p>

            ; it is to Mr. Syratt, of all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240213"/>claims that these two persons have, and ever had, down to the 17th of April, against Mr. Syratt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I was to follow the instructions I have received, in the hand writing of the unfortunate foreigner at the bar, containing a great number of very important subjects of cross-examination of Mr. Syratt, undoubtedly I should wave the objection I am about to state; but standing here in any case, but peculiarly in a case of a man unacquainted with the jurisprudence of this country, it seems to me, I should very much disgrace the situation to which I belong, if I did not object to Syratt's testimony. The page of the law of England speaks it in every line; he is the acceptor; he is, and he always must remain, liable to pay the whole: his being prepared with a release, in order to establish the competency, marks that he was not before, a witness; how then can this release alter the objection? first, on the face of the release I insist on my objection; then supposing it to have contained any thing that the ingenuity of man can devise, and to be couched in any form of words; I say, that without other parties, and particularly without the prisoner at the bar, it is impossible to make him a competent witness: first, Mr. Syratt has released all claims against him; but this bill still continues, and still has a binding force. The two parties, Tapp and Aldred, have released their claim; but the assignees have not; this bill appears to have been proved under the commission of the present prisoner; the acceptor remains always liable; and in the hands of the bankrupt's estate, is liable against Mr. Syratt; which as long as his name and his signature continues, is binding against Syratt: take the case to be (as I am bound to take it) that this is the genuine acceptance of Mr. Syratt; that this is a good and bona fide transaction: in the first place, the estate of the bankrupt has a right to recover, as against Mr. Syratt, where that estate should have released; but the prisoner has an interest superadded, which no power upon earth can force him to release; I should contend to day, he must release; you know the bankrupt is intitled to his share of the overplus; therefore, till he does receive his certificate, unless he has released that acceptance, this paper, for the benefit of the bankrupt, continues to be liable to Mr. Syratt. It may appear strange, that I, who am an advocate for the prisoner; and have to take care of his life; and that although mine is not a long experience, yet it has been a busy experience; and I have seen much of the practice of others much abler than myself; and I have practised a little here also; and I have had the good fortune, I thank God, to do it with some success: and I remember a case before one who is intitled to rank in the list of judges, of great experience; I mean your lordship's late predecessor. I remember a case, in which Mr. Jacques was the defendant, for forgery; it was imputed to him, that he had forged the acceptance of a bill of exchange; the name at full length, standing prominent in the face of the paper; I remember, in that case, there was no bankruptcy intervening; and he had the hardiness to deny, that that which was written at full length on the paper, was his hand writing: I know that very accurate and able judge put it to my learned friend and me, whether under all the circumstances of that case, we thought it decent and fit to ask for a verdict? My lord, shall it be said, in courts of justice, that upon the initial letters of an insolvent man, pressed and borne down by his own insolvency, obliged to abscond; shall it be said, to the disgrace of the laws of an English court of justice, that a foreigner shall be doomed to death on the testimony of a witness who can only say, I believe this was his hand writing; if so, those will be the safest, who are the poorest; poverty will be the only security; because, every man who has the acceptance of a bad man (if he will alter, flourish, or write the letter of his name differently) any man may be doomed to death on testimony like this: I know the jury are above it; I know their minds are superior to the taking in any such suspicion:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240214"/>but you, gentlemen, for the sake of this man, who is by and by to go abroad, though a bankrupt, not a forger, I know, will decide as the impression of your honest minds tells you, the law calls upon you to decide. If my learned friend has the means of telling you he shall be a witness, I have no objection; if my learned friend can in-trench upon me; if he can raise a doubt in your minds, I desire, against the ordinary course of proceedings, that the prosecutor may have the benefit of it. I know Syratt will swear that it is not his hand writing; and I know that jury believe he will: if I dealt in bills, I dare say there are people who would be willing enough to bring me into that place; I am not anxious for the decision.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I scarcely think that the Court will think it necessary to answer the position I contend for, which is, that the acceptor of a bill is a good and proper witness. As to the prejudice of the jury; no prejudice has appeared: as to observations, by way of inference to the jury, my learned friend is perfectly right in that, though not perfectly regular: the observation I mean, is, that it is argued, that no man can, or ought to be convicted on the testimony of the belief of mankind; that I take to be a fact to be left to the jury. In all cases of proof of hand writing, it can only be to the knowledge and belief of the party: if a person comes to swear it is no more than I have seen him write; and I believe it is not; but it must depend on the belief of the party, and the similitude it has to his usual way of writing. Now in regard to the objection which is made, that Mr. Syratt cannot be a witness; I should be glad to know how he is interested in this business: it is a bill of exchange drawn by Baert on Mr. Syratt; and accepted by him; but this is a bill paid by the prisoner into the hands of the prosecutor; he therefore parts with his whole title and right in it, by paying it over to the prosecutor of this indictment; he, therefore, has no claim whatever on any person; because he gives up all right and title to Mess. Aldred and Tapp, by paying it over to them; they being in possession of it, have a claim upon whom? upon the acceptor; that is his interest; because it is a promise by him to pay to the holders of this bill, Mess. Aldred and Tapp; these gentlemen say, knowing this to be a bad bill, we release you; we have no right, no title, no claim whatever on you, Mr. Syratt; then who can sue Syratt? would you apply to him? no person can; the holder of the bill has given a release to the person who is bound to pay it: having released the bill to the acceptor, he has discharged the bill to every other person; and another objection is, they, themselves have proved it under a commission of bankruptcy: say they, we admit this is evidence of a claim which Baert ought to pay. Mr. Jacques was tried here for forgery; and Mr. Griffin was produced here as a witness; but it turned out, that the ingenuity of Mr. Jacques had got another bill of the same date, of the same tenor and force; then it became a doubt which of the two bills were forged; and upon the witness saying also, that he would not say it was Mr. Griffin's hand writing, there cannot be a doubt in your minds, that this man is as clear and independent a man as can be produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, my learned friend has asked two or three questions which he thinks to be important; and which is the best way of argueing; he asked, how is Syratt to be interested? Is not he interested, if this is a genuine acceptance? is not he bound to pay it; he supposes that, which I press on the Court, as the foundation of my objection. We are entitled to say that this is a solvent estate; we are entitled to say that this gentleman may tomorrow receive his twenty shillings in the pound: there is no point more settled in the law of England; that as long as the bill continues in England, so long the acceptor of a bill of exchange must continue to be liable; though Baert's estate pays the bill, the assignees become intitled to receive the bill, to carry the produce of it to his estate; and he is interested in the surplus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240215"/>of that estate; if not, undoubtedly the assignees of the estate would have released it: therefore the prisoner has an interest which is to attach after every other interest is satisfied; and which attaches not only on twenty shillings, but fifteen shillings in the pound. My learned friend says, the release of the acceptor releases every body else; I agree to it; but he must attend to the date; as if the holder of a bill, before it becomes due, will give a release to his acceptor, I shall never be able to recover it: but if after it is due, Baert demands to have this against Syratt, can any man say he shall not have the opportunity; the liability is not altered, only removed to a greater distance: first, the creditors must have their shares out of this; the next liability will rise after the claims of these creditors have been satisfied. And now with respect to Mr. Griffin's case, I am sure my friend's memory has failed him in that respect; my learned friend's memory has failed him in the forgery of Jacques; I think it is extremely probable that his accurate memory may mistake. Old Mr. Griffin swore positively it was not his son's hand writing: but that learned judge said, it is possible that a bad man may now and then alter his signature, in order, if he foresees a storm coming, he may deny his signature wheneever it shall be convenient; therefore, it was, that accurate judge put it to us, whether there was evidence to go to a jury: in this case I agree there is evidence to go to a jury: but the only question is, whether Mr. Syratt can be examined.</p>
               <p>The Court was of opinion that the witness was competent.</p>

            , since July last; we have had dealings together, and acceptances, since November.</p>
               <p>When was it you left off accepting any bills? In December.</p>
               <p>Look at that bill and acceptance? - It is not my acceptance.</p>
               <p>Did you accept any bill of his on that day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What way of business are you in? - A hosier.</p>
               <p>In a very large way of business? - Not in a very large way.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - I was not acquainted with him till the beginning of July last.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a bill book? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have you got it with you? - No, I have not the regular bill book; I have an account of those bills.</p>
               <p>Have you a bill book? - Not a regular bill book.</p>
               <p>Have you a good many acceptances? - Yes, I have; I keep a small bill book, but not a regular bill book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This paper is all the hand writing of Mr. Baert? - That bill is not mentioned in this paper; he delivered it to me as his account.</p>
               <p>When did he deliver this to you? - I think it was about the 10th or 12th of January.</p>
               <p>Is the whole of it his hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before, or after you refused accepting any bills for him? - It was before.</p>
               <p>It was before this bill of the 14th of January? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the dates? - I think they were regular with my account; that account was delivered from the 10th, to the 14th or 15th, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And this closed all your transactions? - He had a parcel of goods on memorandums, which he fairly swindled me out of.</p>
               <p>Now, at the time he delivered you these papers, there were none of your acceptances out-standing? - Yes, there were; they are all in that account.</p>
               <p>I observe there are acceptances here, down to the 27th of April: is that so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you always give value for Mr. Baert's acceptance, or did you sometimes exchange your favour? - We never regularly exchanged: Baert had goods of me, but I never had any of him, except one parcel of candles.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240216"/>To what amount, in your whole transactions, did you lend Mr. Baert? - I do not know exactly; I know what I am now liable to.</p>
               <p>What is the extent of your transactions? - I cannot possibly tell.</p>
               <p>Nor about how much? - About one hundred and eighty pounds (I think I come within twenty pounds, when I name that sum) there were, but not bills fairly accepted by me: Baert has accepted for me as much as one hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Have you any other bill book at this time except this? - Yes, I have, but not with me; because Baert's bill nor any accommodation bills were entered in it.</p>
               <p>Were you never asked about it before the magistrate? - I was; that book is not here.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never say you had destroyed it? - Upon my oath, I never did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say you burnt it? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor that the children had destroyed it? - No, Sir. I said, that I apprehended that the book was mislaid, and the children had got it.</p>
               <p>Was it this book; when was this book made? - I cannot tell; in the course of the last year; I have the book.</p>
               <p>How long have you had the book? - Rather more than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>You began to enter into it, I suppose, as soon as you had it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You never entered any thing in it since Mr. Baert became a bankrupt? - Nothing but some bad debts.</p>
               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - This has been written very lately; that sum in 1784; I took them from another book.</p>
               <p>And I see you was so pinched for room, that at last you was obliged to write on the cover of it, though there are a great many blank pages. How came you to begin your account with Mr. Baert in the middle of the book? - I cannot tell exactly what reason I had for it then.</p>
               <p>You never make any mistakes in your accounts? - I might sometimes.</p>
               <p>Here is a bill, at the bottom, of the 29th of December, twenty-five pounds ten shillings. - I scratched it out afterwards, because it was never used.</p>
               <p>Whose bill was that of the 29th of December, for twenty-five pounds ten shillings, which was never used? - That I cannot tell, whether it was my acceptance or Baert's.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you to accept any other bills for him which were not used? - No, I do not recollect any other.</p>
               <p>You continue still to live in Berkeley-square, and have done ever since? - Not entirely without interruption.</p>
               <p>To what amount may your acceptances be in the world? - I cannot tell; there may be bills to the amount of five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>How long have you left your house, and lived at Charing-cross? - I lived there eight days; I went on the 12th of March.</p>
               <p>Was that after Messrs. Aldred and Tapp had got some stockings from you? - It was after Mr. Baert's bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know a person of the name of William O'Brien? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give him any writing for his master of any sort? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>The bills have been sent by

                  </persName>
             for acceptance to Mr. Baert, and you have sent them back to him? - None of my acceptances since the end of December. William was there one morning with two bills; I returned them by William, and said, I shall see your master in the course of a day or two.</p>
               <p>That was since the delivery of this account? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe that this forged bill is one of them? - I cannot say; I did not take any notice; I believe it might be one of those that Mr. Baert sent to me by his porter O'Brien: I was determined not to accept any more; I do not believe I did give O'Brien any answer to them.</p>
               <p>You did not send him a written answer by O'Brien? - No, I did not; I did not write any thing in his presence.</p>
               <p>You have seen the other bill on which the other indictment is? - I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240217"/>Was or was not that the other bill that was inclosed to Mr. Baert? - I cannot speak to a certainty; it is very probable it was one of the bills.</p>
               <p>It was some time after that before Baert became a bankrupt? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>When did you first see the bill in question? - On the 6th of March, when it was sent to me in payment by Messrs. Tapp and Aldred; at first sight of the bill I took very little notice, but judged it to be a bill of thirty-seven pounds six shillings; and if it had been that bill, I should certainly have given the goods for it.</p>
               <p>What did you first say about it? - I said I had been swindled out of a bill; I took very little notice of it; I had been very ill.</p>
               <p>When did you first say it was a forgery? - I did not say to any body that it was a forgery till I went down and saw Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Aldred; I just spoke to Mr. Walker, I cannot recollect the conversation; then I went back and compared it with Baert's account, and found it was not the bill I intended to pay; but when I looked closely at it, I found it was not my acceptance.</p>
               <p>At that time, upon your oath, had not you this bill in your hand? - I believe I had; I went back to my own house to compare it, and then I was well satisfied that it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Did not you add to it, that the only security you had for this bill was a dozen of candles? - I believe I told that to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Hebden of Ironmonger-lane? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you make any application to him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you not, in February last, apply to Mr. Hebden to accept a bill in which Baert was to be concerned? - I asked him if he would take Baert's acceptance; that was the 5th or 6th of February.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Hebden agree to accept it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did you or not apply to Mr. Baert to give you that acceptance? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did Baert accept a bill for you in February? - He refused to do it, saying, I had refused for him; Hebden was to take it as money to the amount of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>At the close of this account, how many bills were in Baert's hands unprovided for? - Three bills, to the amount of eighty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>At the time you talked about swindling, did you suppose it to be this bill in question? - I supposed it was the bill of thirty-seven pounds six shillings. This twenty-five pounds ten shillings was drawn upon Baert.</p>
               <p>(The bill read, and examined with the indictment.)</p>
               <p>"36 11 s. - London, Jan. 14, 1790.</p>
               <p>"Three months after date, please to pay</p>
               <p>"to my order thirty-six pounds eleven shillings,</p>

               <p>"Accepted, R. S."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This bill of thirty-seven pounds six shillings was drawn in Mr. Syratt's shop, the 8th of December, in exchange of his; I accepted one for him of forty pounds, due on the 10th of March; it was on account of that bill that Mr. Syratt insisted I should accept another bill, to have Manchester goods.</p>
               <p>So it could not be on his thirty-six pounds eleven shillings, for the other? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>To Syratt. Upon your oath, did that forty-pound bill, which he gave you, include that thirty-seven pounds six shillings? - I cannot say positively, I think not -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is in my books.</p>
               <p>Syratt. I believe it might be given in exchange of thirty-seven pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Look in that paper, you will find the forty pounds and the thirty-seven pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How could you conceive this thirty-seven pounds six shillings to be a swindling bill, when this forty pounds was set against it? - Baert was a bankrupt at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to tell the jury that you was swindled out of it because the man was a bankrupt? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Did he put what he wrote into the note? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I understand you can neither read nor write. - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>I live next door to Mr. Syratt: all I know of this business is, that on the 26th of March a servant of mine was called on by a servant of Mr. Syratt's, to carry some goods; and when my servant came in, he was telling me a story about that sum: I was working in my shop: I happened to look up, and saw Mr. Syratt pass; he saw that I saw him, and stepped back; says he, Mr. Walker, what shall I do with this affair? What affair? says I; I know nothing of it. Why, says he, it is a bill I am swindled out of.</p>
               <p>Had he the bill in his hands at that time? - No: says I, I thought you had been long enough in the world not to put your hand to a bill that you have not value for: says he, I have but a few pounds of candles for it.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time suggest any thing of the kind that it was a forgery? - Not in the least; I never learnt it from him at all; I heard it by mere accident: my man went into the shop, and they told him.</p>
               <p>Was that the bill? you have been looking at the bill that was offered for the stockings.</p>

               <p>I am in the service of Mr. Walker: I went with Mr. Syratt's servant to the Queen's-head with some goods.</p>
               <p>When you came there, there was some dispute about a bill, and you came back again? - Mr. Syratt said nothing to me; but he said, this is the man whom I have lost so much money by: he said no more to me then; he did not say it was a forgery. I remember Mr. Syratt's coming in while I was at my master's; before I could tell him he came in and said, What must I do in this case, Mr. Walker? Says Mr. Walker, I do not know any thing about it. He said, It is a bill I have been swindled out of. Mr. Walker said, I thought you had been too long in the world to set your hand to a bill, and not receive value for it. The answer he made was, I have only a few pounds of candles for it. He never pretended it was a forgery. I heard of it about two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You did not see Mr. Syratt after that to speak to him? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see that bill of thirty-six pounds eleven shillings? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you present it to Mr. Syratt? - Yes: he said nothing more than what I have said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Frith-street, Soho: I remember the time when the prisoner was committed: I heard Syratt say, after he was committed, (I stood at his back, and he was in conversation with a friend of his, whom I do not know; his friend said, it was a pity this business was brought to such a pitch as this, and that it had not been made up); he said, in return, if I can get rid of this, I can get rid of the whole. I did not know Mr. Syratt before that. That was the expression, as far as I can recollect, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing more about the prisoner? - I did not pay much attention; but that I heard (Mr. Vernon, a gentleman of Mr. Baert's acquaintance, who is a wax-chandler, whom I saw at the Office, and knew), I mentioned the circumstance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240219"/>to him: I did not know I was to be subpoena'd upon it till I read the subpoena.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - A refiner of spermaceti and wax.</p>
               <p>You did not know Mr. Baert at all? - I did not know him personally.</p>
               <p>What had you to do at the Office? - Mr. Freeman, a tallow-chandler, said he would go and hear an examination at the Office, and I went out of curiosity; I did not know Mr. Syratt, nor the person whom he was talking to; I did not hear any reply; the Office was in an uproar.</p>
               <p>Then you just heard those words? - I did hear those words: there had been a good deal said before that.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was the conversation before that? - The conversation that was between Mr. Syratt and his friend: there appeared much dissatisfaction about the magistrates, and the people seemed to think Mr. Syratt as much to blame as Mr. Baert.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation between Syratt and this person whom you do not know, and the words that passed previous to the words you have mentioned? - The conversation I did not pay attention to; but the beginning of it was,</p>
               <p>"it is a pity this business should come to this, that it was not made up."</p>
               <p>Then that was a friend of Baert's? - I do not know: they said, it was a pity this business should come to this, and that it was not made up before it came to this. Mr. Syratt's reply was, If I can get rid of this, I can get rid of the whole. I did not know what he meant by that. That is all I heard. I mentioned those words to Mr. Vernon immediately at coming out: says he, that is material. I said it was, certainly.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person besides you that heard this? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it after Baert was committed? - I will not positively say.</p>
               <p>Was not the examination over? - The Court was not cleared. I went into the Office with Mr. Freeman, and saw Mr. Vernon and some other friends, or I should not have staid. The magistrates were examining Baert: the bill was produced; I did not touch the bill, nor had any business with it; the sum was between thirty and forty pounds. Mr. Syratt was afterwards called, and he said, among other things, that the bill was forged. Mr. Syratt was blamed by the magistrates, that he did not produce before the magistrates an account of those things that he said the day before he had. They examined them alternately; they examined Mr. Baert, and they examined different persons: Mr. Baert was committed. This conversation was before the commitment, I think: I did not inform the magistrates of this; I informed my friend Mr. Vernon; I had not got twenty yards from the door before I informed Mr. Vernon of it: the prisoner was committed then.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Vernon go back to the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor you neither? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you say that Mr. Syratt was the man that used that expression positively? - I do swear that Mr. Syratt was the man.</p>
               <p>And not the other person speaking to Mr. Syratt? - Not the other person, I am sure of that; Syratt was standing with his back towards me.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Syratt's voice before? - Never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>As to the prisoner, you never saw him before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>At Mr. Vernon's, nor any where else? - I have heard of his name; his wife has been at my house once or twice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The magistrates had, after the examination was over, blamed Mr. Syratt very much, and that drew this observation? - The magistrate blamed Mr. Syratt, I thought much, as I said before, as being the worst gentleman of the two, but said they were under the necessity of committing him: I believe it was Mr. Bond said, that they could not try a case where there was a positive oath.</p>
               <p>My learned friend heard you say another thing, which he did not like the jury should hear, which was, that Mr. Syratt had been examined the preceding day? - Yes, they were angry because he did not produce the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240220"/>book: he said he had lost it, or burnt it, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about the children playing with it? - I recollect that, now you mention it.</p>
               <p>Was you there the preceding day? - I think I was the preceding day.</p>
               <p>One would think we had picked you up in the street; nobody had ever heard of you; where do you live? - In Compton-street: I have lived in that parish twenty years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Syratt. Did any such conversation pass between you and a friend of yours? - I was in conversation with the attorney; I said, Now, if I bill this, I must bill all the rest; and another thing I said, I am determined to make the bill-holders to come in for a composition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall be ashamed, after this, to keep it up any longer certainly.</p>
               <p>Jury. My lord, we cannot agree; we beg to withdraw.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for above half an hour, and returned with a verdict,</p>

            : I was at home: he said, I want a chimney-bar; I asked, who it was for? He said, it was for Mr. Poynder, a master bricklayer, who lives opposite the London-tavern in Bishopsgate-street, about a quarter of a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know him? - No. He said it was to go to the Red-cross in Barbican; there is a large building carrying on there: I told him I did not work for Mr. Poynder, and that Mr. Poynder did not do the brick-work for the Red-cross: he said he did the work for the next house, which was lately burnt down: I asked him, who had done the iron-work before? He said his master and the smith had fell out, and therefore he had sent him to me for a chimney-bar: one of my men made the bar, and he had it at the time; the value of it is five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to let him have it? - I thought it was safe, as I knew Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240110"/>Poynder lived in credit; and therefore I let him have it on that account. On the next day, he came again for another bar, in the name of Mr. Pindar, a stone-mason. I asked him, what Mr. Pindar it was? He said, he lived in the New Road, the other side of Moorfields; and he said I was to go and take a jack down. I made the bar whilst he staid, and I delivered it to him; Mr. Pindar I had known some time, and had done some business for him; and on that account I delivered it. He said he would go with my man, and shew him where the house was. When he came the second day, he said there was a mistake about the iron bar; it was not for Mr. Poynder, it was for Mr. Pindar. He had a hasp and two round staples; he said it was to fasten up a door. I let him have the bar, and hasp and staples, on account that I knew Mr. Pindar.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury; Having already heard the evidence that is produced against me, and even before the magistrate, I humbly submit to you a question of law, whether the uttering proved is complete, within the statute? and, after some little observation to you, Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope I shall meet with an acquittal from your justice. First, then, it appears, that I was in a state of intoxication; it may be the lot of any honest man to tender half-a-guinea, or a shilling, which he may have received in change for a guinea, without knowing it to be bad, and without intention of defrauding: again, Gentlemen, what company does it appear I was in? why with two common prostitutes, whom in the hour of sobriety I should detest. Perhaps the conduct of the prosecutrix is not altogether so proper, in not detaining these women as well as me. I have the painful reflection of my family wanting bread, whose sole dependance was on my labour. With respect to the silver found next morning, I hope you will consider the distance of time, and the number of people that come in and out. I humbly submit to you, to direct the Jury, that, unless I did it knowingly and intentionally, which alone constitutes the fact, I shall be entitled to an acquittal.</p>
