I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Juanpore,</hi> now lying in the London Docks—on 20th November, early in the morning, I was on deck—it was a very bad morning—I told the prisoner to haul a certain rope in—I told him at least three times—he came, and said he wished I would call him by name for the future—it was so dark before, I could not see who he was—later in the day I called the prisoner into the cabin, and gave direc<lb/>tions to put him in irons, and I told the mates to prepare themselves in the event of his using a knife—I asked him about his misconduct on the previous night, and he raised his voice very high and said he had not done anything; but he had committed himself on several occasions, and it was my intention to confine him for a time—as soon as I gave the orders to the mates, he drew the knife and said, "I will have some of your b—lives first"—my officers ran at him and got round him—this is the knife he had in his hand—I did not see him put the knife into the mate—I saw the blood.</p>

I wanted a knife, and I called a man named Plummer, as I was in the habit of using his knife when I had any heavy work to do. Plummer gave me the knife, The second mate came to me and said 'The captain wants to speak to you in the cabin.' I went down, and he said 'What is the meaning of your giving me abusive language?' I said "I did not do any<lb/>thing.' He jumped up, and said 'Put him in irons.' I was determined not to be put in irons. The second mate, third mate, steward, and car<lb/>penter, were on the stairs. When I saw the cowardly way I was trapped, I pulled out the knife, for I was afraid it would injure me as it was not in a sheath. They were all round me, and on top of me. I could not let go of the knife, because they held my hand. I did not know any person was cut in the struggle. I did not try to cut any one of them. I was kept in irons night and day till we got to England. I have been at sea seventeen years, and never had anything against me before. I wrote to the captain, to ask him for my wages, for I wanted to procure legal advice, and he would not answer me; and then I wrote to the Sailors' Home to know if he had deposited the wages there; and then I wrote this in my defence; and this is true, just as it happened."</p>

I keep the "Lord Stanley," Camden Park Road—on 6th March, about 8 o'clock, I served the prisoner with a half-pint of beer—he paid me with coppers—about 10.45 I served him with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of rum, warm—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the half-crown at the back of the bar, by itself—I commenced serving a servant-girl, and it then flashed across my mind that he had given me a bad half-crown, and as I took it up, he left—I ran round to the other door, but he got away—I found the half-crown was bad, marked it, and locked it up—on 14th March, about 10.10, I was in the bar-parlour, and recognized the prisoner, who was in the bar, as having been there on the Monday previous, and went to the till, to see what money he had passed—he saw me go to the till, and walked away, and I said "Stop that man!"—the barmaid said "He gave me this shilling"—I said "Can't you see at a glance that it is a bad one?—the prisoner said "If I have given you a bad one, I will give you another for it"—I said "No, you have had me before, and I intend to prosecute you"—he said "You are locking up an innocent man; do you know there is a God above, and you will have to meet me face to face with Him"—I said "I do not know about that, I know you will have to meet me before the Magistrate to-morrow morning," and gave him in charge with the half-crown and shilling.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This affidavit, sworn on</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th August,</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">was read at length.

Lloyd &amp; Ford's hands—after showing Mr. Lloyd the paper, I went back and found King—I told him he would not be wanted that day, I had left the paper with the lawyers, and next day I would see him—he was to come to the same place in Oxford Street to meet me—he went to his lodging then, at the coffee-shop, and slept there, and met me at the same spot in Oxford Street next day—when I came out of Mr. Lloyd's I stopped with King a hit, and went into a coffee-shop and had some coffee, in a little street off Oxford Street, and he then made a fuller confession to me; a further confession—I did not tell him to do so—I put it down and he signed it—I asked him if he remem<lb/>bered so and so, and he said "Yes"—he met me next day, and I went to Mr. Lloyd and told him that King was there, and he got some other solicitor to prepare the affidavit—I took him before some other solicitor to be sworn—there were two or three in the office to read it—I think I was to meet him after I came out—I was in an inner room, waiting for him—I think he then went home—that was on the Friday—he came up on the Wednesday, I think—he was here for a day or two—I think it cannot have been on the Thursday that he came up—I think it was on the Saturday that he signed the affidavit—he went home on the Saturday—I suppose he slept at the coffee-shop on Friday; I did not go with him—I gave him another pound in town to pay his expenses, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at another time—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—I went down to his house afterwards; I don't think I went on the following Saturday, the 25th, I don't remember it—I got his wife to make an affidavit also; I went down, I forget what day it was—I have been down many times since—I went down with the affidavit that was prepared for his wife by my solicitor—I had spoken to her before, when I was down there with her husband, and she told her tale—I went down with the affidavit, and it was read over to her; that was soon after I had sent King home—I am not sure of the day, but it was about 23rd March—I gave her some money then, I paid her expenses to Chatham, to have her affidavit sworn—I think only a shilling or two, it was not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I might have given her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that would be the extent—I don't remember whether I got her to make a further affidavit after that; oh, yes; on 10th April, King and her came together to London—my lawyer sent for them—I saw them at the station—Ward wrote to say they were coming, and I went to meet them—I did not know what they were coming for—I was not aware my solicitor had sent for them; he was not going to tell me, and I just happened to meet them—I went to meet them because Ward told me they were coming to London; neither King nor my solicitor told me—I did not take them to the same</p>

I am a grocer, at 249, Upper Street, Islington—on the 8th February, the prisoner came to my house and said he had called from Mr. Kendall, of 17, Armour Road, to pay an account that was owing—I had supplied goods to that house to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner gave me this cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him the change, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque was on the East London Bank, Limited, S.E. Branch, Tooley Street, dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th February,</hi> 1871, <hi rend="italic">and purported to be drawn by John Powell pay<lb/>able to Mr. W.

Kendall"—I supposed he was writing his own name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am timekeeper to the Midland Railway Company, at Falcoln Yard—on 2nd September, in consequence of what Parker said, I went to the prisoner, who was in the yard, employed as a ran guard to look after the goods, by Hawkins, a contractor—I said to the prisoner "Leave the yard, and do not attempt to re-enter it; if you do I shall have to give you in custody of the police"—he did not answer, but looked at me in a surly manner, and looked towards the gateway—he had some bread and cheese in his left hand, and an open pocket-knife in his right—as I followed him to the gateway Parker said "Can I not look him up for his abuse of me?"—I said "No, but you can summons him"—I saw that the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030028"/>
               <p>had not left the premises, and spoke to him sharply, and said "Why don't you go?"—he looked at me in a surly manner and replied "I will go pre<lb/>sently"—I put my right hand and pushed him by his neck—I had to push him about four feet to push him clear of the gateway—as soon as he recovered his balance he put his bread and cheese into his pocket, and came towards me to attack me—I stepped back into the gateway and said "If you come any of your nonsense with me I will punch your head"—he answered "You punch my head?"—I said "Yes"—he made a swinging blow at my chest which missed me, and I struck him with my fist on the side of his head—he then struck me, and I struck him again on his shoulder—he then struck me on the muscle of my right arm, and I felt myself injured, and saw blood running down from my fingers' ends—I said "Good God, I am stabbed!"—he shut up the knife, put it in his coat pocket, and ran away—I was taken to the hospital—I remained there five weeks, and have been two weeks ill at my own home—I have to act as a messenger, as I can do nothing else—I still feel pain.</p>

The prisoner and Parker both worked for the same contractor, but not in the same van—the prisoner was moving as if he was going; he was in the gateway when I went up to him, he had only about four feet to clear it when I pushed him—I used sufficient force to push him out at the gateway, and he just put his hand on a post to steady himself—I did not push him as hard as I could, or he would have gone down altogether—it is not a fact that if he had not touched the post he would have fallen—I then saw by his looks that he was going to attack me—he did not hold up the knife; I wish I had seen it—I struck him first—he struck me once, and I struck him twice in self defence—I stepped back and avoided his first blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, at 15, George Street—I have known the prisoner about nine or ten years—he is the son of a gentleman in Hamburgh, a respectable man—I am not acquainted with his family—my son knows more concerning him than myself—I know nothing about his brother but what my son has told me—I have known the prisoner up to the time he was given in custody—some time ago he came to me, and said that the object of his visit was to see if I could obtain the aid of a capitalist here, to unite with some parties in Hamburgh, to build a number of steamers to ply between Hamburgh and America, and he thought</p>

               <p>Mr. Chadwick would be a very likely person—Mr. Chadwick is a M.P.; his offices are in Moorgate Street, and he is well known—he inquired if I had any objection to accompany him to Mr. Chadwick—we had an interview, but his statements were so much at random that Mr. Chadwick looked at him, and then at me, and recommended him to walk outside while he con<lb/>ferred with me—he thought the prisoner was drunk, but he was not—the prisoner told him about this fleet of vessels, and Mr. Chadwick asked him some questions, which he answered; and he said that there was a port on the other side of the water, which he was not at liberty to name, because the water was not deep enough to receive them—he afterwards told me, in my office, that he was not at liberty to name the port, because the water was not deep enough; but it would astonish the world when they knew: that there would be a great revolution, and there would be a new heavens and a new earth, and the things mentioned in Isaiah would take place, and a great tidal wave would come and scour out this harbour, and then there would be plenty of room and plenty of water—he talked at random to Mr. Chadwick—this was about five months ago—about two months ago I went to pay him a visit at his lodgings, and he inquired which way I had come—I told him along the Strand, through Temple Bar and Fleet Street—he said "Did you look at the top of Temple Bar?"—I said "Not particularly"—he said "Did you look at the new timepiece?"—I said "What time-piece?"—he said "To indicate when the new globe is to appear"—I said "Don't talk nonsense"—he said "You have not faith; you have not spiritual discernment; you cannot comprehend it; how is it likely, when you are not born of the Spirit?"—I said "Don't talk nonsense"—he said "It is not nonsense. Did you not see that shop at the corner of Iron-monger Lane, where there is the first movement?"—I then began, not only to imagine, but to be satisfied that his mind was affected—he spoke about the French war, and about Paris being this and the other, as mentioned in the Bible, and Bismarck being <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> up by Providence to accomplish a certain work—I think he told my son what Bismarck was—he said that he had been to hear the Rev. Dr. Parker, of the Poultry Chapel, and liked him very much, and had seen him, and told him what he thought of a certain passage in the Bible—I saw him from time to time till he was im<lb/>prisoned—I have always been under the impression that he was not in his right mind since he introduced the steam packets to my notice; and what convinced me of it was, that he attempted to take some offices on a large scale, and referred to me—I saw at once that he was wandering—he had not the means of taking an establishment like that, and I wrote to the party and said that I could not be responsible for anything that he did—I inquired what kind of engines he proposed to put into the steamers—he said "That I shall not be able to communicate to you; but it is a new motive power which has been communicated to me by the Spirit; I shall want you to be the engineer; it is neither steam nor electricity; I have got all the plans before me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What has struck me as peculiar in the last two months is, that he had a very curious expression of face and staring of the eyes—he had called at my office, and attempted to occupy people with such topics as great revolutions which would astonish mankind—that might be the opinion of many—I may say, for your information, that his manner at the times of those visits was so entirely different to when I have seen him in London and in Hamburgh, when I have been over there, that I was con<lb/>vinced</p>

               <p>that his mind was wrong—I saw him last a few days before he was taken in custody; if persons were there he would chat to them, and on one occasion he began to sing—I communicated with Mr. Foster, but did not mention it to his father—my son wrote to his brother-in-law—I never com<lb/>municated with his friends, and suggested that he should be looked after, but my son did—he professed to be an agent for Mr. Foster, and had an impor<lb/>tant situation in Hamburgh, but he only paid this country periodical visits—I have known him both in London and Hamburgh; occasional visits in Hamburgh, and coming over to London in connection with business under<lb/>takings.</p>

Ellison, son of my mother, a name adopted on account of my spiritual inheritance"—I showed that letter to a gentleman, who said that he believed him to be quite mad—I sent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay his expenses; he was always able to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from me, I knew him so well—he said that Mr. Britton had mentioned his religious views; that Paris was the great whore sitting on seven mountains, and I was quite sure that he was quite off his mind—I saw him before he was given in custody—he was always the same as to religious subjects, but I could not detect anything else, except that he was wild.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman to Dean &amp; Co., ironmongers, of 3, Arthur Street, next door to Messrs, Bond, Forbes &amp; Cunningham, wine merchants, where the prisoner was employed—the prisoner has left parcels on our premises six or seven times this year—the first time he brought them he said that it was bottles of wine, which had been given to him, which he did not want to take into the stores, and I let them be there, among the ironmongery—on the day he was taken, he brought a basket con<lb/>taining three bottles, which he said contained catsup—I had communicated with Bond &amp; Co.—I saw Mr. Forbes passing, and knocked at the window—he came in and examined the basket, and took one of the bottles out—he then went into his own premises, and Mr. Freshwater came in, examined the bottles, and marked them—about ten minutes after he left, the prisoner came and took the basket away—that was before 11 o'clock—Mr. Fresh<lb/>water followed him and brought him back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Bond, Forbes &amp; Cunningham, wine merchants, of Arthur Street, West—the prisoner has been in their employ seven or eight years—he bore a good character—he was assistant to our dock clerk, and had access to the stock as much as myself—I had some conversation with Mr. Forbes, and on the morning of the 17th went to Messrs. Deane's, and found a basket containing three bottles, two of port, and one of brandy—I marked them with a cross on the corks—the basket was tied up tightly over the necks—I left them there, and went back to my master's premises—I heard the prisoner say that he was going to the Custom House—I saw him leave Dean's premises with the basket, followed him, stopped him, and said "Strong, what have you got here?"—he turned, round, and looked at me for a moment, and said "Cranberries," and there was a very small parcel at the top—I said "I do not mean that," and then he said "Catsup"—I said "You have made some mistake, I have seen the bottles"—he said "Well, it is wine"—I said "You must come and explain the matter to Mr. Forbes, he wants to know where they came from"—he turned to go up King William Street, but I said "Oh, no"—I put my arm through his, and we walked together to Mr. Forbes—I said "I wish Strong to explain, Sir, where he got these bottles from"—Mr. Forbes said "Strong, where did you get these bottles?"—he said "I brought them from home this morning"—Mr. Forbes said "Where did you get them, to take them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030048"/>
               <p>home?"—he said "They are part of two dozen I bought for a friend; he did not want the whole, and returned me some, and this is one of them"—Mr. Forbes said "Strong, I know you are a thief; you have been leaving parcels at Messrs. Deane's for some time past, and always told the same story about it being catsup"—he denied it, and again said that he could prove they were his property—I come to business about 8.30 or 8.45, and the prisoner comes about 9 o'clock—everyone employed there has access to the wine—the prisoner was taken to the station, and Mr. Forbes said to the policeman "Of course you will go and search his lodging?" the prisoner made no remark—I went with the officer, and searched the premises, and he made entries in my pocket-book of twenty-nine bottles, including brandy, and two ullage bottles, and twenty-five or twenty-six capsules and labels of our firm—I recognized the writing of a clerk in our establishment, on a sample bottle—those things were taken to the station, and shown to the prisoner, and the inspector told him he would be charged with stealing them—I was not near enough to hear what he said, but he claimed two or three of the bottles—the inspector said "What about the samples?"—he said "Well, I obtained them from the docks, they are country samples"—as to the capsules and labels, he said "I know I took them"—in December last he bought two dozen of brandy, which he said was for a Mr. Casey, and another dozen in January, for the same gentleman—that is all the brandy we have ever sold him—he has bought a bottle of sherry or claret once or twice, which is down in the book—I found, at his house, this long foolscap paper; part of it is in his writing, but one page I am rather doubtful about—I believe the bulk of it to be his—I have compared it with oar bin<lb/>book, and find it is a copy, with the numbers of the bins and all, and the date and name of the wine; also our private mark, which we were not aware he knew—he had no authority from us to make that out—I have tested the brandies, and find thorn all of the same strength, between 17 and 18 under proof, and similar in quality and strength to the brandy on our premises—these two bottles have not been drawn, but I can tell by the cork that it is old port—we have 300,000 or 400,000 bottles, and it is impossible to miss one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has borne a very excellent character—his duties were merely to take the re-gage papers to the docks, and pass them—he paid the duties in the docks by cheque—he only had crossed cheques entrusted to his care, and sometimes gold, but very limited—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a book in which I enter when I let the men have bottles at cost price—I have the name of the prisoner here, and several other members of the firm—the largest number sold here is three bottles, except at Christmas, for their friends, when one man had nine bottles at cost price—four dozen of brandy is all we have sold to the prisoner since July, 1870, and a bottle of sherry and a gallon of gin two days before this affair, and a bottle of claret—I did not enter what was sold before July, as that was before I took to that branch—the dock sample is a glass bottle which will hold nearly a pint. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He would not have authority to take the dock sample—it was only a month or six weeks before this that we commenced capsuling our brandy, so this must have passed through my hands—I am positive I did not sell him brandy before this book was in existence—another little book was found at his premises.</p>

I live at 12, Charles Street, Drury Lane—on the morning of 1st March, about 1 o'clock, I was coming down Charles Street, going home—Elliott was standing on the right hand side—he was coming out of a house, and George was on the left hand side—Elliott followed me about three steps, and took me by the arm—I turned round, and before I had time to speak he hit me in the mouth, and staggered me—he hit me again, which staggered me more; and the third time he hit me I fell down—when I was down on the ground he tried to put his hand in my pockets—he kicked me as well—I got hold of his arm, and raised myself up, and as I got up he called to George to come to his assistance—he said "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> come!"—George came up, and hit me twice on the head—I fell down, and they kicked me on the hip-bone when I was down—I felt Elliott's band in my pocket; George never touched my pocket at all—he stepped away on to the footpath, and kept saying "It is all right," during the time the other one was trying my pockets—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I got up again, and made a run in doors, to my house, and then Elliott hit me again—George called out "<hi rend="italic">Cheese it!"</hi> and Elliott picked up my hat and ran away—my hat was sent back the next day by his sister—the police came up, and I gave George in charge before he had time to get away—he was walking away when the police came up—Elliott got away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at 58, Francis Street, Limehouse—I knew the deceased two years—she was the prisoner's wife—I saw her several times before her death—Saturday, 11th February, was the first, when she came to my house after the ill-usage that caused her death—the prisoner came in while she was there—he asked her for the money he had given her, and he struck her in the face with his fist—she made no reply—she cried, and fainted away—the blow made a very bad mark on her face, and it was there when she was dead—I told him the money was in the vase on the chimney-piece, at their lodging; she had told me where she left it—he then went away, and in about three-quarters of an hour she went to Mrs. Payers, at 10, Pigot Street, where she remained till she died—I went there to see her several times—I saw her on Monday night, the 27th, as she died on the next morning—a lady came into the room while I was there—I had some conversation with her about her state—she told me she feared she could not live—she had frequently told me before how she was ill-used, and she told me she did not think she could live, she felt so ill—she told me that several times in the previous week, that the doctor did not give her any hopes—I took the prisoner into her room about 8 o'clock on the Sunday evening previous to her death—she was in bed—she said to him "You villain! you have killed me at last"—he cried, and was going to leave the room—I asked bun to come back and remain with her, as I thought she was dying; and I put a chair by the bedside, and asked him to sit there, and I left the room, and left them together—I did not hear him speak while I was in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw her on the Monday, the next day—she did not ask me to go to Dr. Giles—I heard her say that she should like to see Dr. Giles, and she was going to ask Mrs. McKenzie to fetch him to cure her; that she should like to live a little longer; she should like to see another doctor—that was on the Friday night—Dr. Nightingale had been attending her—she asked me what I thought of her—I told her I thought she was dying—that was on the Friday—she did not say much on the Monday night—she could scarcely breathe then—she asked me to come next morning at 7 o'clock, to see her, and she was dead then—she frequently told me she could not live, after the ill-usage she received from her husband—she always complained of his ill-usage—she told me, on the Monday night, that Dr. Giles was going to send her a sleeping draught, as she had had no sleep for many nights—she said she had no hope; she thought she was dying, and she feared she should not live till the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Mrs. Desmond during her illness—I was with her on Monday evening, the 27th February—I was there on the Sunday evening, when Dr. Giles was there—after he left, she asked if I thought she would get better; that was about 9 o'clock—I said no doubt she would—I did think so, I never thought it was death—I stopped with her till 10 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She did not tell me she feared she should not live till morning—I did not hear her say anything of the kind—I thought she was very bad—she said she had caught a very bad cold—I was present all the time Dr. Giles was there; he came about 9 o'clock—I went for him, and he came about five minutes after me—I heard what she said to the doctor—I did not hear her say "I know I shall die; will you see me righted?"—she never said that; it is untrue—she never named it; no such conversation took place—I have known the prisoner about two years—he is no friend of mine; I never spoke much with him—I knew his wife for years—she was no friend of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GILES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I know it was 6.30 on the Sunday evening that I went to see the deceased, because when I left the house, I let my wife out to go to church, and I then went and made up the medicine, and sent it round to the woman; the church bells were ringing when Mrs. Mackensie came to me—to show how little reliance is to be placed upon that witness, she told me that no other doctor had attended her, when she knew Dr. Nightingale had—she was in the room all the time—I remained eight or nine minutes—I have heard the woman Mackenzie's statement, it is untrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE LUSH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after hearing this evidence, held that the statement of the deceased was admissible; the expression made we of by her, according to the evidence of</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GILES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). When she said "I know I shall die; will you see me righted?" I made no reply, and she said "This night fortnight, at 1.5 in the morning, my husband threw me down and kicked me, And said he would <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> me out"—she then said to Mrs. Mackenzie "Help me to show my bruises"—Mackenzie lifted the clothes off her leg, and she showed me her thigh—there was a bruise on the lower third, and also one on the buttock; they were large black discolourations—they were of a severe character, and fifty hours after death, when I performed the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, they were still there, which is a very unusual thing—they were caused by some heavy instrument, a kick, or something of that kind;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030058"/>
               <p>besides those bruises, there were small green patches, evidently the result of previous injuries.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The witness proceeded to describe the postmortem appearances, and stated that death resulted from valvular disease of the heart, which the violence might possibly have accelerated.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Susannah Cottages, Mile End Road—the deceased boy, Thomas Henry Ridley, was my son—he would have been fifteen years of age next July—on Sunday evening, 6th March, he left home between 6 and 7 o'clock, to go to the Roman Catholic Chapel, with two more little boys—about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I heard a great noise in the street—I and my daughter ran to the door, and about thirty yards off I saw my boy on the ground, and the prisoner on the top of him, <hi rend="italic">punching</hi> him as hard as he was able—I went up and separated them—the prisoner was dragged off by somebody, and I got my boy indoors—next morning he went out about 9 o'clock, well and hearty—about 3.45 he was brought home on the witness Abbott's back—he seemed almost dead to this world—he did not seem to have any sense—I tried to bring him round, and I sent for the prisoner's mother, and she sent for a little brandy—I then took him to the hospital, but he died in my arms on the way.</p>

I am a painter, and live at 18, John Street, Stepney—on Monday afternoon, 7th March, about 2.30, I was in Watts' beer-shop, in South Grove, with the deceased boy—while we were in there, Payne and the other boys came holloaing round the window "Come out here, Ridley, and I will fight you"—I drank my beer, and Ridley came out with me—I said to him "Don't you fight"—they did fight, Payne and Ridley, in South</p>

               <p>Grove, and after the first round they went into Bow Fields to fight it out—I went with them—Payne struck Ridley three or four times; they struck one another—Ridley fell, and Payne fell on him several times—it was a regular fight—the prisoner did not strike him when he was down—Ridley said "I will give you best till I get down to Mr. Ford's*—that is a public-house at the corner of Regent Street—they were going to fight it out again there—the prisoner said "I want best for always," and he struck Ridley, and knocked him down insensible—he was not able to get up again—I carried him home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three boys there—it was about ten minutes' walk from South Grove to the field—I had never seen Ridley fight before that—they both said they would go to the field to fight it out; I don't know which said it first—it was a fair fight—the blow that knocked him down was in the forehead—it was grassy ground—the blow was not struck unexpectedly; Ridley was on his guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Crocker, of 5, Wellington Road, Bow—on Monday afternoon, 6th March, as I was crossing the field, I saw a group of boys; they had formed a ring to fight—Payne and Ridley commenced fighting, and during the time I stood there, Ridley fell three times from the blows he received from Payne; and each time he fell, Payne fell on him with his knees on his stomach—I then went away, and when I came back they were still fighting—I went for a policeman, but could not find one, and when I returned, Ridley was on the ground insensible. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the last blow struck.</p>

I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital—when Ridley was brought there on the Monday afternoon, he was dead—I afterwards assisted in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he had a black eye—on opening the skull, and removing the scalp, there was suffused blood between the scalp and the bone, caused, most probably, by a blow or fall—on removing the bone there was a large clot of blood on the left side of the brain—that was the cause of death—it was probably produced by a blow or fall.</p>

I live at Norfolk Square, Hyde Park, and am in the General Post Office—on 2nd September, I was on the Hampstead Heath side of the Seven Ponds' Field, and saw two cabs come up to the lower stile, Millfield Lane—eight or nine men got out, and went into a field, and there seemed to be a general assault on one man, who I after<lb/>wards discovered to be Fairweather—I saw him out about the head with a stick, knocked down, and dragged to the second pond, where Brown flung clay, or mud, in his face—I was within a few yards of them—the lumps of earth were hard, dry clay, on the slope of the pond—his face was covered with blood, and he seemed quite insensible, when they left him lying there—he was taken by two men to the "Duke of St. Albans'," where</p>

               <p>they sponged him—I could not interfere, I had two ladies with me, and there were eight or nine great ruffians; but I saw him to the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—I was assistant house-surgeon the whole of last year, and have been at the hospital five or six years—I have had a large experience of accidents during that time—on 27th December last the deceased, Edward Read, was brought in between 10.30 and 11.30—I was present at the examination—the man who had charge of the case is dead—I saw the deceased from the time he came in until his death—his right leg was fractured at the lower part—it was a clean break—there was a wound on the other leg, in a line with the other wound—those injuries would fairly be caused by a Hansom cab going over them—he seemed to be going on all right—his nervous system was not affected in any way—the fracture was treated as any other would be, and dressing applied to the wound—it was thought of very little importance—I saw him afterwards from day to day, up to 1st January—he was under my care most of the time—on the 29th he became rather incoherent, and said "Mind your own business," when some one spoke to him—that may have been the result of shook to the system by accident, but it may proceed from other causes—on the 30th he became rather more incoherent, and remained so all day—on 31st ha became comatose, and had a slight squint—that is usually a sign of pressure on the brain; coma was coming on gradually—he died at 6.50, on 1st. January, in the evening—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was not made till six days afterwards—we prefer making the examination immediately after death, but we can't do it without the Coroner's order, and we did not touch the body—there was not much indication of decomposition on the 6th day—it was cold weather—I made the examination—the organs were all healthy—there was a slight dampness about the brain, which might have come on after death—congestion of the brain was the cause of death—whether that was caused by shock to the system or not I can't positively say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-merchant, and live at 10, Vicarage Terrace—on the evening of the 9th February, about 8 o'clock, Miss Green came into my house, and made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went up stairs into my dressing-room, which opens on to the portico by a sash window—I examined the window, and found broken glass, some on the lead gutter, and some in the room; also the catch broken off, and the window lifted up some three inches—on the bottom of the sash, there was a mark where <hi rend="italic">jemmy,</hi> or chisel, or some instrument had been used to force the window up; it had left a deep impression under the sill, it is there now—I had not left that room more than twenty-five minutes; the window was then fast, the blind down, and the catch all right—I fastened it myself; there was no broken pane—the window had not been unfastened for a month or six weeks—the sash was very difficult to raise, it had got swollen from the damp weather—I have a small fire-place in the room, consequently we had sufficient air in the room, and that was why the window was not opened—the sash was swollen, and would not yield to the pressure of the instrument used—I afterwards pointed out the marks to Inspector Mason.</p>

I am a niece of the late Mr. Galloway—he lived at Oxford Villa, Bomford Road—I lived with him and Mrs. Galloway—it is a detached house—there are houses adjoining on each side—it is a row of houses, three on one side, and one on the other—there is no space between—on the evening of 9th February, about 8.30, as near as I can guess, I went from the breakfast-room, on the basement, to the drawing-room, which is on the ground-floor, above the breakfast-room—I left my uncle and aunt in the breakfast-room—I went to pull down the drawing-room blinds—there are two windows to the room, one at each end—one window faces the Romford Road—it is a bay window—the blinds were up when I went in—on looking through the window I saw two men standing by our garden-gate, in the road—there is a walk of about a half-dozen yards from the gate to the front, door, and some steps—the front door is on a level with the drawing-room—there is grass in the garden—the two men were standing by the gate when I first saw them, and they were moving away a few steps—I had no light—one stood on the footpath, by the middle pier dividing the two houses, the other came in at the gate, and walked on the grass, at the side of the path, towards the front steps—he lightly walked up the steps, and then tried to climb up the portico—he had on a black wideawake, and was dressed in</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Oxford Villa, Ilford Road—on 9th February I was living there with my husband, Samuel Galloway—he was forty-nine years of age, and was living on his means—my niece lived with us—my husband came home at a few minutes past 8 o'clock that evening—he went into the breakfast-room on the basement—he was there for a few minutes preparing to do some writing—my niece went up stairs—after she had been up stairs a short time she came down into the breakfast-room, and in con<lb/>sequence of what she said I ran up stairs with her, to the front door—my husband ran out at the back door, up the back steps, and round the entry—when I opened the street door my husband was at the front door, at the bottom of the steps—I saw a man wearing a cap jump the gate—as my husband was going towards the gate I said to him "That is not the man wearing the cap that was up the front steps, it was a man wearing a wide-awake;" the man wearing the wideawake was about three yards off the gate, outride; the one wearing the cap disappeared—my husband went up to the man wearing the wideawake, and accused him—he was standing about three yards off our gate—I heard high words between him and my husband—they were walking together in conversation, in the direction of Hamfrith Road, towards Ilford—by that time I had got outside the gate, and was following my husband, and when I had reached to where they were stand<lb/>ing, which was the middle of the Hamfrith Road, half-way across it, close to the lamp, my husband was holding the man at arm's length—I was standing opposite my husband, within a yard of him—as soon as I had reached my husband two men came running up from the direction of Ilford—they were both wearing dark clothes, one had a wideawake, and one a cap, with a peak—the man my husband was holding also had a wideawake—the two men came close up to my husband, the one wearing the cap came between me and the man my husband was holding, and the other one was at my husband's right side—one of the two that came up, I don't know which, said to the man my husband was holding, calling him by some name</p>

               <p>that I did not hear, "What do you think, this fellow says I have been trying to get into his house"—I turned to the one that was standing next to me, and said "Yes; and so you are the man that was trying to get into our house"—that was the one wearing the cap—I half turned my head—there was a man standing about a dozen yards off, and I appealed to him to go for a policeman—he is a witness—I believe he said "There are no police<lb/>men"—when I turned my eyes again to look on my husband, the man that was standing at his right side had one hand raised to his breast—I then saw him draw an instrument from his breast, very bright and pointed, which in my flurry I thought resembled a dagger—he drew back an inch or so, that he might aim the blow where he wished—my husband's head was slightly turned, and he raised the blow to the eye—the blow struck my husband under the eye-ball—Campbell is the mail that struck that blow—I do not recognize the other man by the face, but from the height and size I think Calbraith is the man who was wearing the cap—I believe him to be so from his height and size—I cannot distinguish him by his features—when my husband was struck he immediately let go of the man he was holding, and raised his hands to his eys—he cried "Oh!"—that was all he said—he staggered about six or eight yards, and then fell—the three men ran in the direction of Ilford; as they were running the man Campbell turned back and looked, as he got to the lamp-post, just at the corner of the Hamfrith Road; I saw his face as he looked round—I raised an alarm, and the neigh<lb/>bours came and assisted my husband into the house—a surgeon was sent for five minutes afterwards—he died on the 15th—I afterwards saw Camp<lb/>bell in custody at the station, with others; eight or nine, I should suppose—I identified him directly I saw him.</p>

               <p>other two men that came up—he is the right height and every description of one of the two; but there is something different about him since I saw him that evening—I believe he is one of the other two men—his features and dress are different, and the look of the man; I can't explain it, but there is something different—the other man, the one not in custody, came up to me in a striking attitude—a policeman then came up, and that stopped any fight—the three men were all together at that time; when the policeman came up Campbell jumped down off the fence—I went on towards Stratford, leaving the three men and the policeman—Campbell was talking to the policeman—I met another policeman, and I sent him to the other's assistance—I then went on to Stratford, and called upon the witness Knott, and came with him down the Romford Road again, about 8.10, or it might be a little later, on the right hand side, the opposite side to Mr. Galloway's—I saw the same three men standing opposite Mr. Galloway's house—that was very near 200 yards from where I had seen them before—we passed within two yards of them—I am quite sure they were the same three men—I walked past them six or seven yards, and then turned back and passed them again—they were still together as before—I did not see a woman, I believe there was one there—I went to Vine Cottage, opposite Mr. Galloway's house, and spoke to a woman there—that was about twenty yards from them—I rang the bell of Vine Cottage, and a woman came out, and I was speaking to her when I heard a scream—Kuott went on, and I followed behind him about a minute afterwards—I crossed the road towards Mr. Galloway's house, in the direction of the scream—that would be towards the Hamfrith Road—I saw Mr. Galloway lying on the ground—I saw some men running at the time, but I could not see that they were the same—I observed two men running, I did not observe the other—I stopped and assisted Mr. Galloway to his house—I afterwards saw Calbraith at the Police Court, Stratford, on the 21st—I saw Campbell before that, at the West Ham Station, on the 20th, with seven or eight other men, and I identified him—there were seven or eight other men with Calbraith when I saw him, and I identified him as one of the men.</p>

               <p>inquiries I made, on the afternoon of 20th February, I went with Inspector Mason to 18, Waterloo Court, Samuel Street, Cannon Street, St. George's-in-the-east—I went up stairs into the front room, and there found the prisoner Campbell, with two other men and a woman—Foster, an officer who was with me, said "That is Michael Campbell" who was sitting in the corner of the room—I ordered him to be brought down stairs, and took him into custody—he said "What is this fort"—I said "I will tell you when I get you out of the court"—on the way to the station, a short dis<lb/>tance from the house, I said "You will be charged with the murder of Mr. Galloway, of 2, Oxford Villas, Romford Road, on the 9th instant"—he said "Oh God! no; I have been guilty of almost every crime, but, thank God, not that"—I took him to the Leman Street Station—that was all that passed on the road—I searched him, but found nothing except a small knife—I asked him his name and address—he gave it as Michael Campbell, 18, Waterloo Court, the place I had taken him from—I again repeated the charge to him, and he said "God! no; I have been guilty of many crimes, but, thank God, not that"—I afterwards took him to the West Ham Station—I caused him to be placed with five other young men who I called out of the street, and he was spoken to by the witnesses—Mrs. Galloway went in first, and other witnesses went in, and spoke to his being one of the men.</p>

I think there were four officers altogether with me when I went to Campbell's room—that was not the first time I had been there that day; I had been in about ten minutes previously—I had seen him then—I don't think I asked him his name; I don't think I spoke to him at all—I made some remark about the room—I went to make observation, and I did not say anything to him with reference to this charge—I had some conversation with reference to the accommodation of the place, nothing else—I don't think I spoke to his brother, who was in the room; I am not sure—I said "This room is very close, and it is very unhealthy"—I think I asked if they all slept in the room, or something of that sort—I did not say who I was, or by what authority I went—I went with a gentleman who had some authority there, the Inspector of Nuisances of the district—I did not hear Campbell's brother say to him, "That is Mr. Clark, from Scotland Yard"—I went away for about ten minutes, or it might have been less; I had about 70 yards to go to fetch the officer that I believed knew Campbell—I found him there when I returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the corner of Vicarage Lane—the front garden fronts the Romford Road—on Thursday evening, 9th February, in conse<lb/>quence of a communication from Miss Green, I went up stairs to the room, the window of which is over the portico—I had been in that room within twenty-five minutes, and then left the window quite safe, and the blind down—when I examined it, I found the knob of the catch broken off, and a pane of glass broken, directly over the catch, in the top sash—it was smashed all to atoms, so that a person might put their hand in, or their head—the knob of the catch was broken off, and the catch pushed up, almost perpendicular—if a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> or chisel had been forced between the two sashes, against the centre of the catch, that would exactly account for the appearance—it was an ordinary catch—I did not see the marks of any instrument just there, the marks were on the bottom of the lower window-sill—the lower sash goes to the ground—it was forced up nearly three inches—there were very distinct marks there of an instrument having been used to force it—it had not been opened for some time, on account of the damp weather, and it had stuck fast, and would not yield to the pressure of an instrument without a longer leverage—the blind was a white one, not Venetian—Inspector Mason after<lb/>wards made a careful examination.</p>

I am a gardener, and live at 5, George Street, Deptford—on Sunday night, 19th March, about 11 o'clock, I was in High Street, Deptford—I met a woman there—I had never seen her before—I walked with her for about five minutes—when we got to the corner of a side street, five men ran out upon me and knocked me down—I was per<lb/>fectly sober—the prisoners are two of the men—Parker put his hand over my mouth, to keep me from calling out, and he kicked me on the legs very much—when I got up, my mouth was cut—a stone was thrown at me while I was on the ground—Rutherford was there—he helped to take my money—I had 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my trowsers' pockets—I missed that when I got up—I did not see what became of the woman—after the men had attacked me, they went into a house in Stanhope Street—I did not take the number of the house, but I looked at it, and marked it with a stone—I went away and got a constable, and went back with him to the house—we knocked, and a woman came to the door—we went in, and the men ran out the back way—they were in a back room, and I saw them come out at the door of the back room, and run into a back yard with a fence round it, 4ft. or 5ft. high—I saw Parker getting over the fence, and the constable caught him before he got over—Rutherford had a candle in his hand, which he blew out when the constable went into the yard—the constable and Parker struggled together—I tried to help him—Rutherford got over the fence—I saw him afterwards, because he threw several bricks at the constable—I saw him on the other side of the fence after he got over—he was 6 yds. or 6 yds. off, throwing tilings at the constable—the other men all got away Parker got away from the constable, and ran out of the house, and the constable after him—he caught him again in Stanhope Street.</p>

A little after 11 o'clock on 19th March, I was at the corner of Nicholson Street and Church Street, Greenwich—I heard a policeman's helmet fall, ran to the spot, and saw Robson on the ground, and the prisoner standing over him, belabouring his head with a truncheon—I was in uniform—I heard the blows, and saw him distinctly strike three blows—I did not know him before—when I got up to him I received a blow on the left side of my head from the prisoner, with a truncheon, but I cannot say whether he meant it for me—I got hold of the truncheon, and wrested it from him, and Robson staggered up—he appeared exhausted, and was bleeding very much—this happened all in a moment—some of the by-standers took Robson away, and I laid hold of the prisoner—two other constables came up, a great mob assembled, and a great many prostitutes—the prisoner kicked and plunged about, and kicked me—the other constables assisted me—the mob interfered, and ultimately rescued him—we were struggling about twenty minutes, during which time we did not. get more than fifty yards, and nearly 150 people assembled around us—the prisoner ran down Bridge Street—he was afterwards taken again, and eight or nine constables were engaged in taking him to the station—he said he should like to have any two b—y policemen in a field, and he would either settle or murder them.</p>

I am the wife of William Townsend, of 8, Vincent Row, Westminster—the prisoner is my son—my husband had an apoplectic fit, and could do no work on Valentine's Day, and the prisoner was working in his stead, over at the yard, not 100 yards from our house, where Mr. Lock is one master, and Mr. Ancell the other—he came in about 12 o'clock, or a little after, to dinner, and at a few minutes after 5 o'clock to tea, and he went out again before 6 o'clock, and returned about 9.30, or a few minuted more—he was in the house from 5 to 6 o'clock—other witnesses were here yesterday, one of them, Pitman, could not come to-day, because I could not afford to pay the witnesses.</p>

Biggs, 12, Neptune Street, Rotherhithe"—this occurred in the presence of my brother, Hand, Biggs, and myself.</p>
