               <p>Q. To Davis. Do both these flaps go into the same cellar? - A. No; they belong to two distinct cellars, which communicate with each other.</p>


               <p>Q. Which of the flaps was it that you observed the mark of the crow upon? - A. That nearest to the street-door.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe the fastening of that flap under which the prisoner was found? - A. There is a flap upon a frame, and the door shuts down upon it, and then it is fastened inside with a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any other part of the house afterwards, to see if there was any other person there? - A. Yes; every part that we could think of; I did not go to the watch-house with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it go off? - A. It did; I still kept hold of his horse's head, and he knocked me down with his pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Which end? - A. The thin end, I don't think he had time to turn it; he then rode off, and there was a cry of murder and stop thief; he galloped about one hundred yards and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220005"/>I heard he was taken; I don't think it could be more than two minutes the whole of the time that I was at the toll-gate and his being taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You had a good horse I take it for granted in your whiskey? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were determined to get before the carriage? - A. I made no effort whatever to overtake the carriage; I was going at the same pace that I was before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not swerve more into the track of the carriage than before? - A. I was in the middle of the road when the prisoner passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a sufficient light for you to observe the carriage that there was a coronet upon it; - A. No, it was not light enough to see that.</p>


               <p>Q. How long was it before you knew that this was Lord Lonsdale's carriage? - A. Not till after I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you himself he was Lord Lonsdale's servant? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did happen to know that it was Lord Lonsdale's carriage, do you recollect any thing you said upon the occasion? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. At the toll-gate all that happened was of your own seeking; you laid hold of the horse's head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect laying hold of the holster yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never happen to meet with any thing of this sort before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No scrape with a watchman? - A. That has happened to other people besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were indicted by a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave your wife the reins when you jumped out? - A. No; the horse walked on.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask any questions at the turnpike? - A. Only to know why he had struck my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You had called him rascal and scoundrel on the road, and again when you attacked him at the turnpike? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been sudden this snatching the pistol from the holster? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received no bodily harm? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had intended to shoot you he could not well have missed you? - A. I cannot say for his intention.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any observations made there by the people? - A. I cannot say I recollect any particular observations.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the observation, that it was impossible for the man to have intended to shoot you, because the slash was on the other side of the horse's neck. - A. I don't recollect it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man passed me the other side of Highgate, we stopped at the top of Highgate-hill to see that the breeching was tight, and he passed us while that was doing; we passed him afterwards; he whipped his horse violently, and tried every means in his power to run by the carriage; his intention was to beat the carriage; he made another attempt to do it, and ran against me very violently; if I did touch his horse, which I don't know that I did, my whole intention was to get clear of him; when I came to Tottenham-Court, I desired him repeatedly to let me go, he struck me many times, cut me very much in my arm, and several other places; I told him who I was, I pulled out my pistol to intimidate him, because I wanted to follow my Lord's carriage; he, still persevering, whether my horse pushed against him or what, I cannot say; I never saw him the whole time, it was so dark; I was abused by the people afterwards, that I don't know what I said.</p>

               <p>Q. You were, no doubt, irritated a great deal in that situation; can you take upon you to swear that you did not strike him? - A. I am very positive I did not.</p>
               <p>Court.(To Brough.) Q. You went in for change for the shilling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came out it was that Davis came up; did you, after that, see Davis attempt to pull the prisoner off his horse, or give a blow? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you satisfied that you should have seen it, if any such thing had passed, before the pistol was fired? - A. I am certain no such thing had passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Clarke.) Did you see any blow given by Davis to the prisoner? - A. No; I was not there half a moment.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live at Hampstead, I am a shoemaker; I was going to Hampstead at the time this happened; I was about twenty yards from the place where they were, they were on this side of the gate; when I came up, Davis had got hold of the horse, with either a stick or a whip in his hand, I am sure it was one or the other; and as he had got hold of the horse, he was striking at him; and the gentleman on the horse said, he lived with Lord Lonsdale; if he wanted any thing with him, to come there; upon which, he damned Lord Lonsdale, and said, he is as big a rascal as you are; he said, if you don't let go the horse I will shoot you; and he said, he might shoot and be damned; upon that, he fired the contrary way, when he might have put it into his mouth, and shot him dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him make any blow at Robinson? - A. No; the pistol went off, and the man fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Robinson strike him with the end of the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. How far might you be off? - A. It might be twenty yards, or not so much; but if you wish to know, I can measure it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night? - A. No; it was moonlight.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he hold both your arms with one hand? - A. Yes; I looked him full in the face; I went home and told my master, that he was so remarkable a man that I was sure I should know him again; it was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you? - A. No, he did not. On the King's birth-day, in Palace-yard, I saw the prisoner again, he stared me full in the face, and I knew him directly; he came up to me, and began to draw his hand across my breeches; I told him I had seen him before in Berkeley-square; I followed him into St. James's-square; there was such a crowd I was afraid to call to any body to assist me; I told him I would charge him with robbing me; and he begged I would go with him into Park-street, to his house, which I did; to Mr. Dodd's, a coach-maker, Mr. Dodd was in his office; I told him I would charge the prisoner, it was no matter what, I said, that the prisoner was the man who robbed me; Mr. Dodd begged I would not, because there were men at work that would hear me; he begged I would go up stairs, that the prisoner was a relation of his, and a man of fortune, that he had married a woman of fortune; and begged, as nobody knew it but us three, that I would not charge him; that he would bring forth the man or the watch, on Monday night, or whatever the watch was worth; he told me to rely upon him as a man in circumstances that he would not tell me a lie; and he went down and called up his clerk, who was a witness to this, and he brought up a tumbler of shrub to drink; the clerk was the witness to produce the man on Monday, or the price of the watch what ever it was; he gave the prisoner some shrub to drink; they wanted me to go into the next room, and I would not go with them; I told them I would stay in the passage; he said, he wanted to speak to the prisoner a minute, which he did, and then I went in again, and he offered me ten guineas, if that would satisfy me for the watch; I told him I could not say what it was worth till captain Gower came to town, he had given me the watch, and I did not know the price of it; if it was worth less than ten guineas I was to give him the overplus; or if it was more, he was to give me more. I left the prisoner there, and on Monday morning I went down to Mr. Dodd's house, and the prisoner came down stairs to me, and went with me to Marlborough-street, and I went with him to Mr. Moore's, the gentleman that sits there (the attorney for the prisoner); and then we came to an ale-house where there was a club, and a party of men waiting for them there; and they threatened to prove an alogy, and have me pillored, that was at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Moore present? - A. Yes; they called me a swindler, and that I had no watch; I went to the office, and the man was committed, and they abused me in the like manner at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not fully committed upon the first hearing? - A. I appeared the second time, and he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was about half past eleven on Easter-Sunday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your master live? - A. Russel-place, Fitzroy-square, he lodged then in Edward-street, Portman-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Lord Westmoreland live? - A. In Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master that night? - A. At home, in Edward-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late that night? - A. I was going to St. James's-place, from Berkeley-square to my cousin's, w...is servant at Mr. Johnston's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually go on visits at twelve o'clock at night to your fellow-servants? - A. No; I was going about business.</p>
               <p>Q. At near twelve o'clock at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you expect to get to your master's house? - A. I was not bound to any hour of coming in, I would have been in a little after twelve o'clock if it was not for the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. At very near twelve o'clock you were in Berkeley-square, that was going directly contrary to your master's house? - A. That was to Mr. Johnston's.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you were to do your business in St. James's-place? - A. I had no business to do, but to give a letter to go to Ireland to my cousin, who was going the next day to Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have done that before one o'clock? - A. I was in at half past twelve, because I did not go there, as I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it would have been one o'clock before you could have got home, if you had gone about that business? - A. No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never said a word to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220009"/>Q. It was a fine moonlight night? - A. It was a very clear night.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him with the flap of his breeches down, and the shirt hanging out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that surprise you very much to see a man coming towards you with his breeches down at that time of night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood upon your guard, I suppose? - A. No; he went on one side and I walked on the flags; he caught hold of me immediately as he came up to me by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. He put his arms round you and pinioned you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a much stronger man than you? - A. No; but there was another man just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that other man come up? - A. No; I strove to get my arm away and could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that man, do you mean to say that man with one hand could hold you by both arms? - A. Yes; he clasped me with both arms, and then took away my watch; he felt my breeches and then my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could not get your arms away when he had hold of you with one arm only? - A. No; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear positively? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, looking at the size of that man, you will swear it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the watchman from you? - A. I saw no watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath how far was the nearest watch-box to you? - A. I saw no watch-box nor watchman till I came out of Berkeley-square; it was no matter where the watch-box was when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give an alarm to any body? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run? - A. Not down Berkley-square, but across another small street that comes across, that goes into Piccadilly, Hay-hill I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to run after him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to any watchman you saw? - A. No; I saw no watchman at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not at all attempt to get out of his way? - A. I thought he would pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any thing of the flap of his breeches being down at Marlborough-street before the Magistrate? - No, I did not, for all the party abused me so much that I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say Mr. Conant would not hear what you had to say? - A. He desired them to hold their tongues; that there were people of that description in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all say to Mr. Conant that the flap of the man's breeches was down? - A. No. intended to say it, but the Justice said that two men standing so close together it was easy to know what they were about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any thing about his rubbing your breeches in Palace-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you upon good terms with the landlord of the house where your master lodged? - A. No; I kept my distance as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other servants in the house? - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention this extraordinary matter to any one person in that house? - A. No, I did not except to captain Gower.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner from that time till you saw him on the 4th of June? - A. I thought I saw him in Bond-street, but I was waiting upon my master and I could not go after him to take him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was him that you saw in Bond-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master, I believe, searched in the pawnbroker's shops after the watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to your master? - Yes, when I got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner? - A. I am sure he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any powder in his hair? - A. I cannot say; he was dressed in black, and a scarlet inside waistcoat on; he said at Mr. Dodd's that he was on board of a ship at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as any thing else that you have said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at St. James's you saw the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stared at him? - A. Yes, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He stared at you in return? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you? - A. No, he came close to me and rubbed up my breeches, with his hand in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know you were safe enough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you raise any alarm, or try to knock him down for using that indecency? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take that to be the greatest insult that can be offered from one man to another? - A. I did not know what it was; I put my hand upon my watch, and I thought it was to take my watch again, for I knew he was the man that had robbed me; I spoke to him, and told him I had seen him at such a place, and he made off through the crowd.</p>

               <p>Q. You made no alarm? - A. No, not till I went after him and took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220010"/>Q. Did you tell any body - See what a rascal this is? - A. No; there was a carriage coming, and he made off; I overtook him in King street, before he came into the square, and I took him by the coat, and told him he was the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to get away from you? - A. No, he told me to call a coach, and I told him I would not; he begged of me to come to his house, and I went with him to Mr. Dodd's.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you make an offer that, in case the man would raise the price of this watch, you never would come forward again? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not declare to Mr. Dodd, that if he could raise the price of the watch, and tell him it was a disagreeable thing to his relations, that you would not appear against him? - A. Not till captain Gower came to town, as I did not know the price of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Dodd, the moment you could know the price of the watch, you would take that price for the watch and would not appear against him? - A. They called three times at Mr. Gower's at Russel-place, to settle it, Mr. Dodd and his party; I told him I would not have any settlement till Mr. Gower came home.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the man there on the Monday? - A. Yes; he went with me to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner insist upon your taking him before a Magistrate, for he would not agree to any such terms? - A. No; that gentleman (Mr. Moore) has used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. How many minutes walk would it have been from this place where the robbery was committed, to St. James's place? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please you Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury: On Saturday the 4th of June, being the birth-day of his Majesty, I was standing to see the company go to the ball-room; I had not been there long, when being tapped on the shoulder, I turned round, and saw the prosecutor; he told me he saw me about three weeks before in Berkeley-square; I told him he was mistaken, and I thought no more about it; I staid three or four minutes, when Lord Westmoreland's carriage coming past, I took that opportunity of going to prevent the inconveniency of being hustled; the prosecutor came up to me and told me not to run to fast, he had a word with me; he said I had robbed him of his watch, and he would have satisfaction for it; I told him he was very much mistaken, and if he would accompany me home I would convince him of his error; he said if I would make satisfaction for the watch, as I appeared a decent man, he would not say any more about it; I told him I was not to be frightened in that way, I lodged over Blackfriars-bridge, and I thought it best to go to Park-street to Mr. Dodd's; I then turned up St. Alban's-street, and he went with me to Mr. Dodd's; what passed there Mr. Dodd will be able to inform you, Gentlemen. It is very happy for me that on Easter Sunday, which is a remarkable day, I can prove by the most respectable witnesses, that I was not out of the house all that day; that I was in their company from six that night till two the next morning, and that at the instant the man charges me with robbing him, I was at supper with my friends.(The prisoner called

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. It does seem to me that there must be some sort of mistake on the part of the prosecutor in this case. Here are four witnesses whose character and respectability are totally unimpeached, who positively swear he was never out of their company any part of that evening. Gentlemen, they have been cross-examined, and very properly by the Counsel for the prosecution, to collateral circumstances, because when witnesses come here with a fabricated story, it generally happens that upon little collateral circumstances, which the witnesses have not settled between themselves, they contradict one another in a way that shews they don't deserve any credit; but in this case, in all the collateral points they tell you the same thing; it seems to me therefore that there is some mistake in the case, and the weight of evidence is such that I think you will have no difficulty in saying he is mistaken, and that it could not be the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Before the Magistrate, I believe, you were at first a little incorrect? - A. The Magistrate was deaf, and took down my evidence wrong, I put him to rights directly.</p>
               <p>Q. In which pocket do you usually keep your purse? - A. The left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the young woman did you sit? - A. On the left hand of the prisoner.</p>

The butler came to my assistance and released me from the prisoner; he was then secured, and the bag examined; it contained eight forks, ten spoons, half a dozen desert spoons, a silver fish-trowel, a sauce-spoon, two silver-handled knives, three butter-ladles silver, a silver soup-ladle, a silver butter-trowel, and a pair of silver asparagus-tongs; I have no idea of the value of them, I had seen them in the cupboard just before I went out for the water.</p>

He said let me go, I have got nothing; my fellow-servant as soon as he could speak said, I have got the rascal; and I saw the bag with the things at the side of the bedstead.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you strip the body? - A. I did not; the only mark of any injury that I could perceive about him was, a wound on the side of the neck of nearly an inch and an half, the depth of it was very inconsiderable indeed; I then waited the directions of the Coroner's Jury, I think the body was in as high a putrefaction as ever I saw a body in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a corpulent man, or otherwise? - A. He appeared exceedingly bloated, which I attributed in a great degree to the putrefaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound was the cause of his death? - A. I don't think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when other wounds were discovered when the body was stripped? - A. Yes; it was after I had been before the Coroner's Jury, they sent a message for me to return to them again; when I got to them again, they told me the undertaker's man, in stripping this gentleman, had discovered a wound in his side, near his ribs, but that was nothing more than the skin having peeled off in consequence of putrefaction, there was not the least wound whatever; the foreman of the Coroner's Jury went with me, I perfectly convinced him that there was no other wound but that in the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blood over the bed, or bolster? - A. I saw some blood upon the floor under the bed, and some about the sleeves of his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing that could account for that blood? - A. I have no doubt but that blood might proceed from the wound in his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any opinion what was the probable cause of his death? - A. I cannot say whether it was an act of suicide, or whether it was by any other hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that wound you do not think was the cause of his death? - A. No; I cannot think it was.</p>

No, not in the house; I observed some kind of very comical noise between one and two o'clock in the day; there was one kind of scream I thought was by a man, and when I went to look I could not see any thing; I thought it was like a man falling down, as if a chair was drawn from under him; it was almost facing where this business happened across the yard; they come smoaking their pipes there some times of a Sunday evening at the top of the stables; I was very near the yard of the prisoner's house, only the yard parts between the stables and the house; and when I went up two pair of stairs of my own house to see the roof of the stables, it was no such thing, the noise was over and I came down stairs again.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell any thing of that but what he told you? - A. No; he exclaimed that there was a person in the bed; when he mentioned that circumstance,

               <p>Q. Did he say that the person in the room was dead? - A. I don't recollect whether her did or not; Oakhurst went into the room, and I went to the church-warden, and the beadle of the parish came and sent for a smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner say any thing else? - A. No; it appeared to me an exclamation of surprise, what a person would naturally have said; I think I should have said so myself.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker, No. 35, St. Martin's-lane; on the 2d of June Mr. Brunn came to my place about eleven o'clock as nigh as I can guess, and employed me to get a ladder, and I got a ladder to look through the window where the body lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to get in at the door? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not? - A. I was not employed to do that; I went up the ladder and looked in at the window, and perceived a body lie across the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window open or shut? - A. Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at that time? - A. Mr. Brunn was at the foot of the ladder, and Mrs. Nott was standing upon the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know what you were about? - A. Yes. she knew I was going up to lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her before you went up the ladder? - A. I asked her if I should go up the ladder, and she said, yes; she told me to do it; when I got up the ladder I perceived a body lying with a blanket and sheet over its head, and bloody; I asked Brunn if I should open the window, which I did, and when I opened the window there was such a terrible smell as I never smelt in my life before; I asked him if I should get in at the window, and he told me, yes, and I got in; I told him I could not go in the smell was so great, I came down the ladder directly, and Mr. Brunn went and fetched the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing? - A. She screamed out and alarmed the court, when I gave the alarm of a person lying across the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You said so from the ladder; yes, the screamed and alarmed the court, and the people came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say any thing? - A. No. I did not take notice of what she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that she would not have slept in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220014"/>the house? - A. Yes; I heard her say that had she known any body was dead in the house she would not have slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by alarming the court? - A. She ran out of doors and brought the people to come in with her, and saw no more till Mr. Humphries the beadle came in, which was in about five minutes; he went up the ladder first, and he asked if nobody would go up in the room, and I said I would: I went up along with him and got into the room, and the first thing I perceived in the room, on the left side of the window, was a washhand bason.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the bed? - A. I cannot say how many yards, it was on the window seat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it? - A. It appeared to me to be almost half full of blood and water; there was a portmanteau lying upon the floor with a chain to the staples locked, cut open length ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it? - A. No. it appeared to be three-parts full of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether it was recently cut or not? - A. No, I did not; it appeared to be cut with a knife; I did not examine what was in it; I looked about the room for a key and could not find one, except an old rusty key that was hanging up by the door; the door was fast, it appeared to be locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try if it was the key of the door? - A. Mr. Humphries did, I did not; he sent for a blacksmith to pick the lock, he could not pick it outside, and he came up the ladder and picked it inside; and when the blacksmith was gone, he undid the sheets and blankets from the man's face, and said his face was like a blackamoor; I quitted the room, and do not know any more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any knife about the room? - A. Yes; a round pointed case-knife, it lay close to a portmantean about three yards from him; I did not take it in my hand, but I perceived that there was no blood upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was with this poor woman's consent that you went up the ladder first of all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you gave notice to Mr. Brunn, she screamed and immediately went for somebody, and brought somebody to her assistance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a case-knife which had no blood upon it? - A. None at all.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger in this house in Monmouth-court, Whitcomb-street: Eight months I ceased to lodge there that very night that the murder was discovered on the 7th of June; my room was the very next to the deceased, there was only a wainscot partition between.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the deceased? - A. I knew him by sight: he could not speak English, nor I could not speak French, but I knew his person; I missed him on the Monday morning, I had not slept in the house ten weeks till that night; I observed that I had not heard him, and asked the prisoner if she had seen him come in, or something to that purpose, which was about nine or ten in the morning about breakfast time; she said he had not come down to take his milk, and that he was not in, because his key was not in the door which he always used to leave in the door; nothing further passed that morning; on the Tuesday morning I made nearly the same observation, and asked if she had seen him, she said no he had not been in, for she observed the key was not in the door; she had peeped or looked through the key-hole, and she could observe nothing about the room, his clothes or any thing to disturb it since he went out; she was convinced by that that he was not in the room, or something to that effect; that she was sure he was not come home; I asked if she could form any idea where he was, or to that purpose, and she said she thought he was gone into the country with a tall young Frenchman and woman that had called upon him every day, and they had not called since he had been away, and she conjectured from that that he was gone into the country with them: I made similar observations on the Wednesday morning; I asked if he had been at home, and she said she thought he must have gone into the country with this tall Frenchman and woman; she made the same observations on the Thursday, or to that effect, that they had never called upon him since he had been missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lodged in the house at the time? - A. A Mr. Baker, author of a Picturesque Guide through Wales, he went out of town on the Saturday; I went into his room which I had given up to him first; I came into the room on the Sunday night to sleep, he left the house on the Saturday; there was another gentleman lodged in the room over the deceased, a Mr. Kiplin, a performer belonging to the Richmond Theatre, and the prisoner, us three inhabited the house at the time this accident happened, Mr.Baker was gone; I know nothing more of the matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you happen to know whether this poor Marquis was visited by any French people? - A. I have seen a great many Frenchmen there during the winter, when Mrs. Hutchins, the real landlady of the house, was there, but she is now deranged.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of mind was this unhappy man? - A. He appeared very chearful always.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand any thing of his circumstances? - A. I believe he was an Emigrant, and had the pay from the Committee.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman told you she had looked through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220015"/>the key-hole, and said, she thought the room was in the state in which he left it, for she could see nothing disturbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she supposed he must have been gone in to the country with these French people? - A. Yes; with a tall young Frenchman, and woman, who had never called since he was missing.</p>

Yes; I was at home all day on the Sunday, I came to my window on Sunday, I cannot be positive whether it was a little before two or a little after; after I had sat a little while, I observed the prisoner come up stairs into the dining-room, open the window, look out for about one minute, then shut it down, and put to the shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many windows are there to this room? - A. Two; she then took a long hair-broom and went to the other window, and dusted it; then went into a closet adjoining the room with this said broom, and knocked very loud against the sash of that window a great while, I should suppose I heard her in there near ten minutes; I did not see any thing more in that room; I still sat at the window, and I heard her reading very loud in the parlour with gentlemen all the afternoon; I heard more than one man.</p>

               <p>Q. Till what time in the afternoon? - A. Till five o'clock, or after five o'clock; then a man came up the court crying curds and whey, and a gentleman came out of the house and called to the prisoner to take him in some milk; she answered, it is not milk, it is curds and whey; he said, very well, and went in, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased who lodged there? - A. Yes; perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it him? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation in English, by English persons? - A. Yes; I did not observe any thing more that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this window-shutter remain shut? - A. All the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever observed that before? - A. Yes; I have seen the shutters shut in the day, but I never saw her open the window and shut it again directly; for if that window was open I could see to the deceased's door; and could see every person that went up and down; I observed the window-shutter open again the next day; I did not observe any thing more that day.</p>

               <p>I knew the deceased perfectly well; I live opposite the house where the deceased lodged: On the 31st of May, in the morning, I enquired of the prisoner to know whether she had heard any thing of the French gentleman; she said, no; I said, it was very odd, being a person that seldom staid from his lodgings; I asked her if she did not think some accident had happened to him in his room; she answered, no; she said, she had peeped in at the keyhole, and could not see any thing of him there; she supposed him to be gone into the country with a tall French gentleman, and a young woman. On the Thursday following, being in my front parlour, the prisoner came running in to me, screaming, Mrs. Lathwaite, Mrs. Lathwaite, the Frenchman has been murdered in his bed! I did not go near the premisses, I only spoke to some of the lodgers that came into the house; I asked Mr. Webb where he was when this melancholy affair happened; he said, he went out in the morning, and was not at home till eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make so much observation of the house as to say, whether there was a tall French gentleman went in and out of the house? - A. Never; he was a very regular man; and, I believe, kept very little company.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Webb.) You were there but recently before the 29th of May? - A. I had been eight months in the house as a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, while you were lodging there, observe a French tall gentleman, and a lady, come to this gentleman? - A. I cannot say I ever did observe any body of that description, for I went out always at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Innis.) Did you observe a tall French gentleman, and a lady, frequent this house? - A. Never in my life; I am very much by myself, being a single woman; and I had been accustomed to sit at my window and read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brunn. My Lord, I have seen such a gentleman and lady come to the house, I have opened the door once or twice to people of that description; the last time I saw them was one rainy morning, and they had an umbrella with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately have you seen this gentleman and lady? - A. It may be two months since I saw them last; I have not opened the door since Mrs. Hutchins left the house; I seldom was in the parlour but at breakfast, and she would frequently ask me to open the door for her.</p>

               <p>I was perfectly well acquainted with the deceased; on Sunday, the 31st of May, about the hour of two o'clock, I called at No. 9, in Monmouth-court, Whitcomb-street, where my deceased friend lived; I rapped at the door, and the prisoner at the bar was coming in from Whitcomb-street into the court; she took the key of the hall door from her pocket and unlocked the door; I stood on the steps of the hall door, and I asked her whether the Marquis de-Moncroc, the French gentleman, was at home; the reply was, that the gentleman went our early<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220016"/>that morning; he would not be at home till late that night; I then told her to let the gentleman know that Mr. Andoe had called. On the Thursday following, the 2d of June, I came to town from Chelsea, where I lived, and about one o'clock went to Compton-street to see an intimate friend of mine there; I was rather struck with his countenance; when I went into the room the gentleman says, you don't know what has happened; why, says he, our friend, de Moncroe is dead; I said, it was impossible; I then went and demanded admittance into the house; I knocked but nobody answered: I then determined to go to Bow-street, and Mr. Addington was not then at the office; I then went to Vine-street, to Mr. Addington's house, who gave me assistance; I returned to the house, the door was opened by the beadle, who had the key of the padlock, and I saw my friend in a horrid condition; he was covered up entirely with blankets, and the cloaths of the bed; the pillows were over his forehead, and covered his face as far as the nose; the hat of the deceased lay over the top of the bed where the pillows should lay, and one of the leaves of the hat was bloody; I then observed a vast quantity of blood that went through and through the bed on the left side, it did not seem to proceed from the wound given in the neck, which was on the left side of the neck; on that day I discovered nothing further; however, I beg leave to observe, that I made some questions to the lodgers of the house, particularly Mr. Webb.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not hear any conversation with them.</p>
               <p>On Thursday, when the Inquest was sitting, I had him entirely stripped in the position in which he lay across the bed; and when he was stripped, the waistcoat was obliged to be cut off of him entirely, and then I observed a wound on the breast of the deceased, nearly opposite the heart; I immediately returned to the Jury, and requested the surgeon should be sent for. I observed the blood and water in the wash-hand-bason, which seemed as it somebody had been rincing their hands; I made every search possible about the bed and floor, whether any weapon whatever could be found, I perceived none; when the small cloaths were taken off of the deceased, I had them shook, and out of the pocket that laid on the left side, there was a long knife, just such as the French wear, a long knife double, and a pen-knife at the end of it; a pair of scissars, a foot-rule, a pencil, and a small key at the bottom of the pocket; I observed the knife exceedingly clean, not any way stained with the least blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a knife as French gentlemen use at table? - A. Yes; I then met the beadle, and requested one of the small drawers was open, and I desired him to put it into the next drawer, and see if it would sit; I would not touch the key myself, I left it in the hands of the parish officers, he opened the drawer, and found some foreign coin, French half-crowns, and one louis-d'or, I believe, I cannot tell the amount; it is now deposited with the church wardens of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this gentleman's natural temper of mind? - A. A very chearful man, and a very strong stout man for his age; he was between fifty-eight and sixty years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you frequent him much? - A. I never was at that house before, he was seldom at home in the day-time; I have been very often in his company with his friends. On Whitsunday, we were coming together from chapel, and he said, he would be glad if I would go with him to dine; I made a frivolous excuse, because I knew his circumstances would not admit of it; but I begged his address, in case it should be in my power to be of any service to him; and when governor Mills came from Martinico, I went to him, in hopes of getting to go over there, where I knew the deceased had considerable property to the amount of 250,000l. and offered me letters when I was going out last October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find this gentleman's spirits depressed with his misfortunes? - A. Not particularly so; he was a man excessively resigned to his fate; he felt his misfortunes as every man must, but not particularly so.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen him before this unfortunate affair? - A. On Whitsunday in the same month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear composed at that time as much as a man could be in his situation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was this wound in the neck of any material consequence in your judgement? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You seemed to have conceived a real friendship for this gentleman? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And would not dine with this gentleman because you thought his finances were not sufficient? - A. Yes; I beg leave to observe that what proves that true, the Wednesday before the unfortunate man's death there was four guineas lent to him by a most intimate friend.</p>
               <p>Q. He was so distressed that he borrowed four guineas? - A. I did not say he asked for the money, but they forced him to take that trifling sum, seeing that he had but one pair of breeches, one waistcoat, and one coat.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe it is natural to your nation not to ask for money at all; your nation has a spirit above it? - A. I cannot say such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he behaved himself very resigned to situation? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220017"/>Q. He must have felt a considerable change? - A. So has every body else in his situation; but I beg to observe one thing to the Court; about six months ago a correspondent in the city allowed the Marquis from 15l. to 20l. a month on his estates in the West-Indies, but when they found the total disaster that was likely to accrue in that country, they stopped those resources.</p>
               <p>Q. Formerly, though his finances were in such a state as to make him comfortable, it was withheld from him, and he was left in the state you now describe? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am beadle of St. Martin's in the Fields: On the 2d of June I was coming along Orange-street, I met Mr. Brunn and another man; he asked me where the church-warden lived, he said there was a person laid dead in his room; I said I was beadle, and it was some part of my duty to look into that business; he took me into Monmouth-court, and into a back yard, where there was a ladder; when I got to the top of the ladder, I called Oakhurst to follow me; with that I entered the room, he was at the top of the ladder, and I made him enter the room too; as soon as we had entered the room I found the door was locked and I could not find a key about the room; he was wrapped up in blankets in such a manner that I thought I must uncover him to see if could find the key; I turned the blanket round, and then I found his breeches pocket hanging inside out; I then searched the other pocket of the left side which was not turned out, but there was nothing in it; I searched the right-hand waistcoat pocket to see if I could find the key; I could not find the key, and I went to the window in the yard and called to somebody to fetch a smith, Mr. Cousins, in Whitcomb-street; he sent his boy to fetch a smith to get some picklock-keys, he tried to pick the lock and could not, and he mounted the ladder and came up outside and picked it; I thought it most proper to get him to go back and get a padlock to fasten the door; the room was so offensive I thought it most prudent to go to the Coroner immediately, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular that was in the room? - A. There was a wash-hand bason of water and blood in the window, as if somebody had washed their hands from blood in it?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of a knife? - A. I did upon the table, a case knife, it was not bloody; the portmanteau was cut very near a foot in length, it was locked and chained, and every thing very well secured; we had the Jury the next day, and I was frequently there, but somebody always with me; I had the care of the room, as he had some effects; the Jury sat at the Highlander, the corner of Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next go to the lodgings of the deceased? - A. I do not recollect that I went at all by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the corpse wrapped up in these bed-clothes? - A. He lay across the bed very near the top, his heels touched the ground; he lay rather upon his left side, and I was obliged to unwrap him to look for the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the clothes folded round him? - A. Yes, with blankets; I could not see any thing of his body till I unwrapped him.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the pillows? - A. There were some pillows, and I believe some blood about the pillows.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the pillows about his head? - A. They were very near his head; I said he was as black as a blackamoor, but I think I never saw his face till I uncovered him from the pillows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive a hat near the pillows? - A. There was a hat.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you perceive any blood upon it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the second time you went there after the 2d of June? - A. I cannot tell whether I I was there after or not; I did not see the prisoner at all till she was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see her when you went up the ladder? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You attended the Coroner's Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the verdict of the Jury was? - A. Wilful murder by a person or persons unknown.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Webb.) What was the occupation of the prisoner in this house? - A. She was a person taken in to clean the house and make the beds and wait upon the lodgers, after the derangement of the real landlady; she had been there, I think, about a month before, it might be more or less; she always had the opening and shutting of the doors and making of the beds and so on; Mrs. Hutchins's mother would sometimes come and stay for a night perhaps; I saw the Marquis go out on the 29th, and I went out myself soon after and returned about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any stranger in the house at that time? - A. I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to observe if any body was in the parlour? - A. I did not observe any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know persons assemble in the parlour for the purpose of reading loud? - A. Yes; Mr. Baker and I have read loud, reciting parts of plays, but never on a Sunday; and Mr. Baker, the author, has read his works to me frequently, but not on a Sunday; Mr. Baker went away on Saturday the 28th of May.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Innes. I saw the deceased when it was first found out; I waited at the door while they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220018"/>Picking the lock; the prisoner went up stairs with me, and the first thing I saw was the deceased with his breeches pocket turned out; I said he has certainly been robbed, the prisoner immediately said he did it himself; I made no reply; I then looked a little further, and saw about as much as my hand of the deceased's face, and it was as black as ink, that I should not have known it to be the same person; I observed a sheet rolled about his neck, and a great quantity of blood about it; I said, dear me, see the quantity of blood; sure the man has been murdered; the prisoner answered he has cut his own throat, or how should he cut his portmanteau; I had not observed the portmanteau, nor I believe had any one in the room; I then said it was very strange, he had all his clothes on but his coat, for I did not then perceive that his cravat was off; she said he had been just at prayers before he did it, he always prayed, she said, three times a-day, morning, noon, and night; there was a lady with me observed the wash-hand bason; I then looked at the window, and saw a wash-hand bason stand with about a pint of water in it; I looked at it, and it appeared as if somebody had washed their hands in it and just tinged it with blood; I then came down stairs, the room was so offensive, and went into the front parlour with this lady and the prisoner, and this lady said it is very odd that wash-hand bason should be in the window with blood and water; the prisoner immediately said, who dare to come here to create suspicion? Not odd at all, not odd at all, he did it himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You live opposite to this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live by yourself? - A. Yes; there are other lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of any profession? - A. I take in needle-work.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in Court during the whole examination of the other witnesses, since you were examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the beadle examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard what he said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As well as every other witness who has been examined? - A. I don't know that I heard every one.</p>
               <p>Q. Every one since you have been examined yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to give the account you now give when you stood up before? - A. My Lord only asked me as to what I saw on the Sunday, and therefore I did not go on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go on? - A. I expected to be called up again; I have been three times examined, and I am sure no gentleman as ever heard me deviate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear the oath administered to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you were to tell the whole truth? - A. Yes; and when I was before the Grand Jury, I said it was all I observed upon the Sunday; then I was asked what I had observed on the Thursday, and I told what I had observed on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say what you have now stood up to say before the Magistrate? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been speaking with any of the witnesses since you were examined? - A. No; I am sure there is no one thing that I have here said but what I said before Mr. Justice Addington.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said there taken down? - A. Part of it was.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 4, Little Suffolk-street; I was standing at my door about a quarter after one o'clock on Sunday the 29th of May, the Marquis came by; he said, how do you do, Madam; I said, very well, thank you, Sir; I asked him how Mrs. Hutchins was; he put his hand to his head, and said, very bad, Madam; and he shook hands with me; he went towards home, and I watched him to the end of the court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. On that day, the Sunday, he pointed to his head? - A. Yes; to tell me that Mrs. Hutchins was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be disturbed in his mind? - A. No; he appeared exceedingly chearful, and merry.</p>

               <p>I am a journeyman upholsterer and undertaker; I know no further than getting orders to take measure of this body; I was stopped by the gentlemen of the Jury sitting, and I went into the public-house, and stopped till I could get measure of the body; I went up into the room with intention to take measure of him, and was stopped by the beadle; he told me, I could not till the Jury had done their business; I measured it afterwards, and perceived something on the left side, I perceived there was a wound, but I will not be positive the gentleman lost his life by that; it was a wound about the size of a middling size penknife; I did not examine it particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the depth of this wound; did you probe it? - A. No; there was a great deal of blood upon the bed.</p>

               <p>Upon the undertaker coming to strip the body, he said, there was a little wound upon the left side, that went to the heart; I then sent for the surgeon to come again, and examine the body; in consequence of that, he examined the body when naked, and said, there was no wound there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220019"/>Q. But did he search it with his fingers, and probe it properly? - A. He told the Jury he had examined it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Simmons.) What degree of examination did you make of this wound in the side? - A. I examined it very minutely, indeed, and do most positively aver, there was not the least wound whatever; I attempted to probe it both with my silver probe and my finger, and I can speak in the most confident manner, that no wound existed there; it was mere putrefaction.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you account for that quantity of blood? - A. I did not see any great quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, in your original examination, you did not know whether he had not killed himself; how could a person kill himself if the wound was not sufficient to kill a man? - A. He might have laid his head in an unfavourable situation, that he might have been strangled by it; but the wound in the side, I am perfectly clear, is imaginary.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Humphries.) Was it you that spoke to the bed being wetted through to the floor? - A. There was a vast deal of blood on the floor, it had gone through the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the Count but when he came down in the morning to boil his milk, and the same in the evening, and then he went up stairs, and I saw no more of him; he never talked to me, he could not speak English; and when he wanted me to make his bed, he beckoned me; and he was always in the room when I made his bed, and emptied his chamber-pot; and when I had done I made him a curtsey, and I never saw any more of him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Innes.) Q. Your room was a front room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at the farther end you could see his door and if any body went into it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other door led into his bedroom besides that? - A. Yes; but that I could not see.</p>

I gave him a sixpence to get some beer, and he said it was a bad sixpence; I then gave him half a guinea to change, and he gave me four half crowns and a sixpence; I gave him sixpence to pay for the beer, and he gave me 2s. 6d. for one of, the half crowns; I went into a chandler's shop in the goal, which I understood belonged to the prisoner; when the beer came they handed it to me, and I tasted it; there was a person in the chandler's shop knew me; I did not know him; he enquired if I knew some people in my neighbourhood; I said I did, very well; when the beer was drank, I said I must go home; I had been there about half an hour; I went through a hatch in the inside gate of the prison; when I was at the hatch the prisoner laid hold of my coat with both hands, and said, I could not go yet, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220020"/>pulled me in at the door, and some persons pushed me behind the door; I tried to get into the shop again, but the prisoner ordered the people inside to shut the door, and I laid hold of the spikes at the top of the door; I then felt some people take my money, there might be seven or eight people struck me at once; the prisoner at that time was hauling me in at the door; it is a door that goes up a staircase on the master's-side, between the hatch and the chandler's-shop; I saw the man take my money, but I should not know him again if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any reason for pulling you violently in at the door? - A. None at all; several of them beat me till I could scarcely see, I was all over blood; I cried murder! the prisoner had left the door while they were beating me; he came up again and laid hold of me as he did before, and said damn you if you don't come out they will murder you; I told them I would not let go the iron-spike till I saw the place clear; the prisoner then ordered the people to leave off; when they did, I let go the bar; he led me to the door; as I was going out I received a blow on my head which rendered me senseless; I was brought into the wine-room; Owen and Pitt were in the wine-room; when I got out into the wine-room, I examined, and my money was all gone; I made a complaint of the manner in which I had been used; I was bleeding very much.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever happen to have been in Newgate before? A. Yes; twice before, once to speak to a waterman, who was in for stealing some copper; my father sent me with some money for him to give to counsel to defend him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take a man to Newgate? - A. I took a man once to New Prison, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person that accosted you in the room? - A. I think I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of the persons you had taken up? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you know it was not the man you apprehended before? - A. No, it was not; the man murdered his wife that I took to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever apprehend the man that accosted you in Newgate? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had this money in your pocket? - A. From the time I went from home; I saw it in Newgate, when I paid the money to the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been twice to Newgate before, once to see a waterman; when did you go the second time? - A. In the time of the riots, I went then out of curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not through Price you got to speak to this Coleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was leading you to the hatch when you were struck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you they would murder you if you did not get out? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he endeavoured to save you from being murdered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You fixed on the person that robbed you? - A. No, never.</p>

               <p>Q. Some persons were shewn you that you might fix on the person who robbed you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody shewn you at all? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the next day? - A. No, nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the Sheriff there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Kirby there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not some persons called out to you for you to name the person that robbed you? - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fix upon any body? - A. No, I did not fix upon any body, only Mr. Price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you fix upon a person of the name of Bateman, as the person that robbed you? - A. No; I said there was a person I knew was there; I did not say he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say Bateman was the person who robbed you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you fix upon Bateman; and was it not answered that he could not be the man, for he was one of the quietest men in the gaol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say if he was not the man, he was very much like him? - A. No; I said the person that robbed me was in a blue coat and white waistcoat; I went that night to Newgate again, and asked Owen to bring him out.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you fixed on the prisoner as one of the persons? - A. I went that night, and Owen brought him into the wine-room, and I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you acknowledge that Price was the person that saved your life against the other prisoners? - A. Certainly; and I say so now.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I know the prisoner, he was confined under a judgment of misdemeanor, in February 1794.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of good behaviour you appointed him one of your gate-men? - A. He is one of the gate-men; he has conducted himself extremely well, no man better; a very good servant as ever man had, there has never been any complaint of dishonesty during the time he has been in my custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220021"/>Q. Was he a man that conducted himself quietly in your gaol? - A. Wonderfully so; he is a sober man; I saw the prosecutor there the next day; he said, that the prisoner saved his life before Mr. Sheriff Liptrap; I would have shewn him the man that robbed him; he said, no, no, that is the man; he said, it was Price; he would not look at any other man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Price dressed on that day? - A. He generally wears a blue jacket, I don't know whether he was so dressed that day; and the last sessions I would have shewn him the man; Wybrow was the man, he is since gone pursuant to his sentence; Price is a man that I would trust with any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man you saw the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to doubt his account of his being very much hurt, from his appearance the next day? - A. He was very much so, I wonder he was not killed; we never let a constable go among the prisoners. You know an attorney would not go into the King's-Bench among the debtors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the prisoner was the man who, with his own hand, took the money out of his pocket? - A. He always said he was the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say there were a number of people that robbed him? - A. I suppose there were forty men about him; he said six or seven; I say there were nearer forty.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever pretend that this was the man who, with his own hand, took the money out of his pocket? - A. No; I think he said he held him whilst the others robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, or did he not, say to you, the prisoner was the man who held him while the others took away his money? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the turnkeys; I know the prisoner, Price; I let the prosecutor into Newgate, I cannot recollect the day; I heard the bell ring very violently, Price had him at the gate, he was very bloody; and he said, thank God, you have saved my life! my life is your's and not mine; he said, he was robbed of some silver, I cannot say how much; he said, he had been robbed of his money; Mr. Sheriff Liptrap was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The man was bleeding, and in a very bad state? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all attempt to enter into particulars at that time? - A. I don't know what you mean; because he never accused Price at the time; Price brought him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he at all entered into the particulars of the manner in which he had been robbed then? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he came the next day? - A. Yes; I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then charge the prisoner? - A. He did, before Mr. Liptrap.</p>
               <p>Q. And then entered into the particulars of the business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did he charge the prisoner the next day? - A. I cannot say much about that; he said, Price held him while he was robbed; and Price was the man that protected him, and brought him out. He swore to Bateman, a transport with us, as the man that robbed him, before he swore to Price; Price was present at the same time; he said Bateman was the man that robbed him. I told him, he might as well charge my daughter with robbing him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Bateman dressed? - A. In a blue jacket, I believe, I am not positive to the dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he not say, that Bateman was there at the time the fact took place? - A. That I will not say; he might as well accuse you of it as Bateman, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not speak of Bateman as being present at the time? - A. It was one Wybrow that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, did he say any thing more of Bateman than saying he was one of the men there? - A. He accused Bateman first, that Bateman was the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In those words? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say, that he said, that Bateman was the man that actually took the money out of his pocket, or with only being one amongst them? - A. Upon my word and credit, I cannot say; I look upon it, that this man is as innocent as I am; but there was so great a confusion at the time; that, upon my soul, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it might be, that he was one amongst them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>At the time this man was robbed, I and Pitt were together in the room, we had but just left that man, who had the care of the gate; I heard a great noise of ringing the bell, he and I ran in a great hurry to see what was the matter; Price brought Thompson out, his head had been cut by something or other; he turned round to Price, and thanked him for being his preserver; that his life was his, and that he should have been murdered. I knew Thompson; I asked him how he could think of going in there; and he said, he had been in to speak to a man to relieve him; and I asked him, how he came to be served so; he did not mention the robbery at that time; I sent for the doctor to come and dress his wounds: he had a glass of wine; he put his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220022"/>in his pocket, and said he had been robbed, he had lost half-a-guinea, two or three half-crowns, and a bad sixpence; I asked him if he could describe the man who robbed him; he said, yes; it was a man in blue cloaths; I said, come here to the gate, and see if you can see him; there was Price, and several others, in the yard, the place was all in confusion; he said, that is the man, and pointed out Bateman; I called Bateman to the gate, he said, Bateman was the man that held him while the others robbed him; Pitt made answer to him, for God's sake, says he, don't charge that man with it; you may as well charge my daughter with it, I am sure he is no such man, there is not a quieter man in the place than Bateman. In a little time after he charged Price with it; he asked me his name, and I told him his name was John Price.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was Price dressed? - A. He had a blue jacket on, to the best of my recollection; and so had Bateman a blue jacket, or coat, I will not be certain which.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you recollect the words he expressed respecting Bateman? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether it is a right thing for a man to trust himself among prisoners in a gaol? - A. If I was a constable, I would not trust myself in a gaol for five hundred pounds. Price has been in the habit of receiving money from me, five and six pounds of a week; and he is a man I can perfectly place confidence in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was searched? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say he described Bateman as being a person there helping those who did rob him? - A. No; he said, that man in blue, pointing to Bateman, was the person that held him while the others robbed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said of Price? - A. When he was more reconciled, when Pitt expostulated, and said, he might as well charge his daughter, he turned it to Price.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same day that he was wounded? - A. It was; I don't believe I had left Price a couple of minutes at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear him say, that Price likewise held him while the others robbed him? - A. No; not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I ask you whether you recollect the prosecutor acknowledging that the prisoner, Price, saved his life? - A. He did; and thanked him.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I don't recollect any thing of the time, I believe it was early in the month of May, the prosecutor came to my house, and I went with him to Newgate; when we came there, he said, he had been robbed, and very much beaten, he was in a very bad state; I asked him, who robbed him; he said, he could not possibly tell, there were so many; we sent out for six or seven of them, and he fixed upon a man of the name of Bateman; I asked him if he knew who robbed him; he said, certainly not; I asked him if he knew who gave him those violent blows; and he fixed upon Bateman, and being told it was very improbable that Bateman should do it, he then fixed upon Price, after a great deal of hesitation; that Price was holding him while the rest were beating him; he said, Price rescued him out of the gaol, he believed they would have killed him, that he saved his life; I told him, I thought he was under great obligation to him; he said, he should prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the fixing upon Price as having done any thing, was not till after he had fixed upon Bateman, and after an hesitation? - A. Certainly; he thanked Price for saving him, and said he should prosecute.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is my duty, as Counsel for the prosecution, to beg your most serious and anxious attention to the case which I have to lay before you in support of the indictment, which charges the four prisoners at the bar with the crime of murder, Against that crime the laws of God and of men have denounced the punishment of death; and the law of England holding it, and justly holding it, in especial abhorrence, has decreed that that punishment of death shall be inflicted without delay. It is therefore a case which calls upon you to do that which I am sure you will do, to apply your minds closely to the investigation of the facts which will be proved, because you will consider that upon your verdict will depend whether the four prisoners at the bar shall or not remain more than two days longer in this world.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, such is the nature of the crime of murder, that it is perhaps more than any other perpetrated in secret, and in the dark. It is therefore but seldom that the direct testimony of eye-witnesses can be obtained, another species of evidence is of course necessarily resorted to, in general, which is in many cases not less satisfactory, in some unquestionably still more satisfactory than the positive testimony of eye-witnesses. Evidence of a number of circumstances, which like so many links of a chain each in itself, perhaps but of little importance, yet when combined together forming such a regular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220023"/> and unbroken series as conduct the human mind to an unerring conclusion. The case which I have to lay before you is certainly, in the first instance at least, a case entirely of circumstances, and you will have to consider whether the existence of those circumstances is or is not compatible with the innocence of all or any of the prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you must have perceived from the reading of the indictment, and from the statement of the Coroner's Inquisition by the officer of the Court, that the name of the deceased is described in one to be 
               <persName id="t17960622-8-person142">

            : That variation arose from a misapprehension at the time Coroner's Inquisition was taken, he was at that time conceived to be a person of the name of John Brown; however I shall establish by evidence that his name was George Hebner.</p>

               <p>The deceased was a native of Russia, had resided in this country some time, had married in this country, and carried on the business of a <rs id="t17960622-8-viclabel43" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

The next information we have of him is, that late on that night he was enquiring for a bed in East-Smithfield, and being unhappily recommended by a watchman to the house of the prisoner, Hughes, in <placeName id="t17960622-8-crimeloc44">Dean-street, East-Smithfield</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17960622-8-crimeloc44" type="placeName"

                        targets="t17960622-8-off41 t17960622-8-crimeloc44"/>, to that house he went; there he was seen part of the day on Thursday, on Thursday night, on Friday, and on Saturday; and I should state to you by what means he was seen. Two witness, whom I shall produce, of the names of Darby and Johnson, lived in the house adjoining; the persons who had inhabited that house before them had bored holes with a gimblet, in the wainscoat, by which their house is separated from the house of Hughes which holes were imperfecly stopped up with paper, and through which they could see what was passing in every part of Hughes's house; through those gimbles holes it was, that they saw this unfortunate man on the days I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday evening, one of these witnesses heard Mrs. Hughes say to some person, "Strike me, you dog, strike me, it is all I want;" upon which she removed the paper from one of the gimblet holes, and, looking through, saw the person of the deceased. Possibly, I shall not be able to lay before you direct proof of any thing else that passed that night; but the next morning between seven and eight, the attention of Mrs. Darby was called to some words which she heard from Mrs. Hughes in the adjoining house, which induced her to suspect that some mischief had been practised: upon this she got up, she called Mrs. Johnson, and they together listened, and looked through the holes. They saw the four prisoners at the bar, in evident confusion; they heard them talk in dark and ambiguous language, they heard one of them (which they cannot precisely ascertain) say, "At ten o'clock, we will take it and lay it down so," describing with their hands, the laying something upon the ground; they saw Mrs. Hughes and another go out, and heard Ludman cry out, "Mother Hughes, don't shut the door, and then they won't have any suspicion." This very naturally alarmed them, and one of them directly went to the house of a neighbour, informed him of what they had observed; and begged some assistance; upon this, several persons came to the house, one or two of them went up stairs, and there they found the body of the deceased hanging to the bed post; the corpse was stiff and cold, and, Gentlemen; you will particularly attend to the precise situation in which the body was found, the head was hanging, I understand, within about four or five inches of the top of the bed, the feet touched the ground, and the hands of the deceased were tied behind him in a very particular manner, the backs of the hands were close together, and the wrists tied as tight as they possibly could be; the stuff with which they were tied, was of the nature of window line, twisted with great care to make it strong enough, and what is most remarkable, it was tied in a sailor's knot, which is, I understand, a knot of a peculiar construction, partaking so much of the nature of a running knot, that the harder it is pulled, the tighter it draws. Gentlemen, (the prisoner Ludman is a 
sailor, the deceased was no sailor).</p>


               <p>As soon as the first person who discovered this, saw the body of the deceased in this position, he, with very commendable caution, ran down, secured the street door, and enquired who was the owner of that house. Ludman came towards him, and said, he slept there last night, then said Howell, the witness I shall produce-" You shall not go out, no man shall go out from here till the officers come;" upon which Ludman uttered these remarkable expressions,"Damn your eyes, you can but hang me," and down he sat; at this time, the other three prisoners were present, they were all four secured and taken to prison; in their way to prison, either on that or a subsequent day, some material conversation took place between them, of which I am not particularly informed, it will be stated to you, by the officer, in whose custody they were, and you will draw the conclusion which you ought to draw from that conversation.</p>


               <p>Gentlemen, these being the circumstances in which the body of the deceased was found, you will perceive that his death was unquestionably violent (there is no possibility of supposing it could be an accidental death), being violent, it could only have happened from his own hands, or from the hands of others; that he could not have come by it from his own hands, is evident, his head being so high, as to be near the top of the bed post, and his feet touching the ground; but what is most important is, his hands being tied behind him so tight as they were, with the backs of the hands together, and the line being tied in a knot of a peculiar description. These circumstances therefore called upon the prisoners, who were the only persons in the house (except a child), to explain their conduct, they called upon them to shew that all these facts, suspicious as they were, were never the less consistent with their innocence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, they did attempt this explanation in their examinations before the magistrate, which were calculated to impress a belief, that this unhappy man was the cause of his own death. I am not at liberty to state those examinations particularly, or to-offer them in evidence, because I am not intitled by law to give the declaration of one prisoner in evidence against another; but I think I ought not to omit stating some part of the examination of Ludman; Ludman first of all denied before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220024"/> the Magistrate, having said that the deceased could not have hang himself, that he must have been hung, yet he afterwards admitted. in the hearing of the Magistrates, that he had so said; and in another part of Ludman's examination, he says, that the child which slept with Mrs. Hughes (a child of eight years old), upon being waked in the morning said, and they were the first words he uttered; "Mammy, is the man dead?"</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, what that child had seen, in the course of the preceding night, to lead to that question, I shall forbear to state, because I think I should transgress the duty I am now performing, if I were to raise any prejudice in your minds, by stating any circumstances, which, by posibility, might not come out in proof; the child is of but tender years, I shall present him to you, and if it appears that he has a sufficient knowledge of the sanction of the oath, under which he must speak, then, and not till then, you will hear his testimony. But without this, I fear, that the circumstances which I shall have to lay before you, will be found to be utterly irreconcilable with the innocence of any one of the prisoners at the bar. If upon the most patient investigation of this case, that should be your clear and decided opinion, however painful the duty will be to consign four of your fellow creatures to a speedy and ignominious death, it is a duty, nevertheless, which you owe to the oath you have taken, and to that country which you represent.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe the cloaths? - A. The coat was a dark mixture, a buss marcella waistcoat, with blue pink and while stripes, and olive worsted stocking breeches; his stockings were grey cotton, and strings in his shoes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it tied in running knots? - A. A very particular kind of knot; it was not a common knot; there were no marks of business about the head at all, there was a slight bruise or two on the side given by something not very hard; I did not strip him then on account of leaving the hands in the state in which they were; the face was in an extreme turgid state; the brains were extremely full and turgid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as usual in a case of strangling? - A. Yes; the cord had been applied in a very tight manner to produce a very deep mark; we divided the scalp, and opened the head; the brains appeared in a very full state indeed, preternaturally so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say from your examination what was the cause of his death? - A. Undoubtedly from the cord having been applied so very tight round the neck, by preventing the return of blood from the brains to the heart.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me when you saw a person first come to Mrs. Hughes's? - A. Last Thursday was five weeks I saw the deceased about ten o'clock in the morning, being shaved by a barber, through a little hole in the wainscoat in my room which looks into the little parlour in Mrs. Hughes's house; I saw him again the same night on Saturday between eight and nine at night; he came down to light his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the same room that he had been in before? - A. Yes; he came down out of the one pair of stairs to light his pipe; we have gimblet-holes in the wainscoat up one pair of stairs, and in the two pair of stairs there is a great crack in the wainscoat through which we can see every thing that passes in Mrs. Hughes's house; the next time I saw him was when he lay dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing that attracted your attention on Sunday morning? - A. On Sunday morning between seven and eight, I was in bed, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220025"/>heard Mrs. Hughes come down stairs, and say O Lord, I cannot go up no more; with that I got up and went to the hole that looks into the parlour; there was a piece of paper in it; I took out the paper, and there I saw Mrs. Hughes and

               <p>Q. Dressed or undressed? - A. Dressed, and looking down like a corpse; her face looked the colour of a corpse; Mrs. Johnson lodges in the same house with me, and she saw the same; I came back into Mrs. Johnson's room; I looked through the holes there, but I saw nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mrs. Johnson's room look into that in which you afterwards saw the deceased? - A. Yes; but I could not see the bed because it stood in a corner; then I went down stairs into my own entry, and looked through the holes again; and there I saw Mrs. Hughes and Mary Baker coming in; then there was Richard Ludman and

             came out of the two pair of stairs; I never heard her come down, but she was then sitting in the lower room by a closet; they were all together then, Rhodes was sitting down, Baker was standing, Ludman was standing, and Mrs. Hughes was lading her stays; they were whispering together very fast, I could see their mouths going, but could not hear a word they said; one of them said, but I cannot tell which, at ten o'clock they were to take it, and lay it in that manner; they made motions with their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any thing more at that time? - A. No; I went into my own room, Mrs. Hughes went out by herself first, and then Mary Baker with her; and Richard Ludman said, mother Hughes don't shut the door, and then they will have no suspicion; then I went to Mr. Dibble's and gave an alarm; I went after he was cut down and saw the body of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the same person you had seen in Mrs. Hughes's house on the Thursday and on the Saturday? - A. Yes, the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man you had seen twice before this accident happened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed to be very much at case, and lighting his pipe; perfectly contented with his situation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had gone to bed late on Saturday night, had not you? - A. The clock struck twelve as I got into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Johnson sleeps very close to where the deceased lay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If any noise, or struggle, had taken place, she must have heard it? - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope she did not go out after twelve that night? - A. She supped at home, and went to see a gentlewoman a little way home, and I waited for her coming home; and she was in bed by twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never discovered the chink in the upper room till that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a narrow chink? - A. A crevice, with a splinter gone out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that through so narrow a chink as that, you could see what that person's complexion was through a chink only? - A. Yes; Mrs. Hughes was standing with her back to the window.</p>

               <p>Q. The light did not fall upon her face, and yet you could discern the alteration in her complexion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when you came down, these people appeared to be whispering? - A. Yes; their mouths were going very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet Ludman said, very loudly, mother Hughes, don't shut the door, and then they will have no suspicion; he made no secret of that at all? - A. I don't suppose he thought I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in? - A. A very good way of life; my husband is at sea, and I have nothing to support me but from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a person of the name of Dodd? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes; I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a person of the name of Payne? - A. I did, years back.</p>
               <p>Q. You were pretty intimate with him, were not you? - A. I was, one time back; when he was a young man, an apprentice, I suppose about twenty years back; we were children, and went to school together.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived in the same house together? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he die? - A. He died for the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the dollars choak him? - A. No; he suffered for that.</p>
               <p>Q. He was hanged, you mean? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband at home at that time? - A. No; he had been gone to sea about a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Johnson; an unfortunate woman, is not she? - A. No; I know nothing of that</p>
               <p>Q. Does not she pass in the neighbourhood as an unfortunate woman? - A. No, she does not as I know of; I never saw an indecent thing by her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the colour of his waistcoat? - A. A washing waistcoat; and, I believe, there was some yellow amongst it, but I will not be sure; he had stocking-net breeches, a kind of a brown, a corderoy colour; a kind of blue stockings, and his shoes tied with strings.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman belonging to the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday morning, did you hear any thing that induced you to go to Mrs. Hughes's house? - A. I heard that there was a man hanged, at No. 1, Dean-street; then I went into the house, and went up stairs, and I saw the man hanging. I directly turned myself down stairs, and shut the street-door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the street-door open when you went in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you the first person that went in? - A. No; I believe Mr. Dibble was the first person; and I asked who belonged to the house, and the prisoner Ludman said, I slept in the house last night; he was then standing by the inside door in the kitchen; he told me, says he, I slept in the house last night; says I, then you must stop till there are proper officers come to take care of you; and with that Mr. Dibble came down stairs, and desired me to take care of the door, and let nobody out nor in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ludman say any thing more to you after that? - A. He wanted to go out by me just as Mr. Dibble came down; I told him he should not go, nor nobody else should go out of the house till there were proper officers to take care of them; upon that, he takes a stool and goes and sits himself down, and says, damn my eyes, I may as well sit down, for you can but hang me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the other prisoners at that time? - A. They were all in the same room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the hearing of that expression? - A. They were; and I desired of somebody to search Mrs. Hughes, to see if she had got any papers, or any thing that would lead to a discovery of who the man was; in about ten minutes after, I went up to see the dead body, he was then hanging to the foot-post of the bedstead, and his hands were tied behind him back to back.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have any tape with you, describe how his hands were tied? - (The witness ties a man's hands in the same way in which he found the hands of the deceased).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know if that is what is called a sailor's knot? - A. Some call it a sailor's knot, and some a timber hitch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a sort of knot that sailors use? - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you acquainted with the sea yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the wrists close together? - A. Yes; rather strained.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it tied in a manner that a man could have tied his own hands in? - A. It is impossible; a man may tie his hands together, but I think it impossible for him to tie them in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the head of the body to the top of the bedstead? - A. About four inches; and he was on tip-toe.</p>
               <p>Q. With what were his hands tied? - A. Tape. twisted like that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. His wrists were not quite close, I think? - A. Not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not tried the experiment, whether you could tie your hands behind you in that manner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest, I take it, was leaning forward? - A. No, quite upright.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the head leaning from the noose? - A. No, leaning to the bed-post; and the noose the same side, next the bed-post.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There must have been some considerable struggle to have secured a man in that way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And must have taken some time? - A. It? must.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed at that time? - A. No; he had every thing on but his coat and hat; he had his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220028"/>waistcoat and breeches, and stockings and shoes on; he had no handkerchief, I believe, upon his neck; he had a neck handkerchief round his face, tied upon the forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not appear as if he was at all undressed to go to bed? - A. No; his breeches knees were tight, and all tight.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not appear like a man disturbed in his sleep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how that handkerchief was placed? - A. Tied on the forehead, and hung down to cover his face just to the tip of his chin.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you see there first? - A. Dick Ludman and Nance Rhodes, and the two men that were stopped from going up stairs, one a sea-faring man, and the other that is at our house now, they were being stopped from going up stairs when I went in, they were a-head of me, and Dick Ludman and Nance Rhodes said, what do you want here, you have no business here; says Davis, I want to go up stairs to see our friends; and I said, likewise, I do; and then they stopped us from going up stairs, and Davis gave Ludman a shove on one side, he was next the door; says I, the devil won't stop me from going up stairs; Davis was rather a-head of me, and pushed the door open, and saw the body hanging up, with his hands tied behind him, and his fingers Black, and I just touched him on the arm; when I came down stairs, says Dick Ludman, a man has hung himself in this house last night; says I, you scoundrel, the more shame for you; and the first person I met was my landlord, Mr. Dibble; and I informed him of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know Ludman before? - A. Yes; I have seen him at different times before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what he was? - A. No; I have seen him about there all last winter; I don't know what he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you take notice enough of the manner in which it was tied, of the sort of knot, that if you should see two hands tied you should know it? - A. No; I was so frightened I did not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was Ludman and Rhodes endeavoured to prevent you from going up stairs? - A. There were nobody else in the house at that time that I saw.</p>

               <p>I keep the Black-horse, East-Smithfield: On Sunday morning, the 22d of May, between eight and nine o'clock, Mrs. Durby came to my bar for a, quartern of gin; in consequence of what she said, I sent my lodgers to her house, and I went there myself a little before nine; I went up one pair of stairs, and at the bed post I saw the man hanging; the cord he was hung by to the bed post, was about twelve inches, from the neck to the top of the bed post, and he had a white handkerchief tied very neatly over his face; I could not discern his face at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it tied round his head? - A. It was a long white handkerchief, tied two or three times. round his head, and then drawn over his face; his hands were tied behind him with a tape (produces a piece of it), it was twisted different times round; the backs of the hands were close together, drawn very tight; the cord had sunk very deep into his hand, the hand was swelled as much over the tape, as the neck was swelled over the rope; I first went and examined the body, and then called the officers; I got one Mr. Anderson; I thought it proper to secure the prisoners, and I saw three of the prisoners, not Mrs. Hughes, but the other three in the lower part of the house; I said to Ludman, did you sleep. here last night? he said, yes; I said to each of the girls likewise, did you, each of you, sleep here last night? and they said, yes; and do you know any thing about this man being hung? no, they did not know the man was hung.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said they did not know the man was hung? - A. Each of them; I asked them, do you know any thing at all about it? No; we know nothing at all about it; by that time Mrs. Hughes came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Mrs. Hughes came in, did Ludman say any thing about knowing whether he was dead or not? - A. He said, he knew nothing at all about his being hung, or being dead; when Mrs. Hughes came in, I asked her likewise, and she said, she did not know how it was, but she supposed the man hung himself; I said, Mrs. Hughes, that is impossible, and under that I must stop you all as prisoners; I stopped them all, and desired Mr. Howell to stand at the door, and see that none of them went out, and Ludman says, Mr. Dibble, can I have bail for this nonsense? no, Dick, says I, except you have King George for your bail; then, from that, the gentleman cut him down, and I went and saw him cut down, and a little after that, we searched Mrs. Hughes's pocket, she denied having any duplicates; we asked her where the duplicates of his cloaths were, and she said she did not know; we searched her and found a duplicate of a coat and waistcoat, and, I think, one or two handkerchiefs, I cannot be positive which, I only saw them in the officer's hands, it was by my desire that she was searched for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220029"/>Q. Do you know if Ludman had ever been at sea? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his way of life? - A. I cannot tell; I have been told he has been in that unfortunate way of kidnapping, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Hughes did not pretend to be ignorant that he was dead, but supposed that he had hanged himself? - A. She did not.</p>

               <p>Q. The other did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Hughes at that time recovered the intoxication she had been in over-night? - A. She appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you see her child? - A. Yes; a little boy, about seven years old; she delivered me the child, she wanted the child herself at the office, and I said, no, Mrs. Hughes, you must not, children often tell truth, and I delivered the child to the parish officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know any thing of Darby? - A. I never saw Mrs. Darby in my life, till that morning she came for a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. She was not in the habit of coming to your house for gin? - A. No; she only came by way of informing me of the circumstance, I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Darby). Q. When Mrs. Johnson returned home, did you observe any thing particular to attract your attention? - A. No, not at all; I heard somebody going up stairs about twenty minutes past eleven, but I did not take any particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who slept in the garret? - A. I saw Ann Rhodes sitting in the garret, and I suppose she slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Baker slept? - A. In the same room as Mrs. Hughes; in the lower room there are two bureau bedsteads, both open, close together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the last time you looked through the crevice, in the day time? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the poor man come down to light his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Johnson with you at this time? - A. No, she was out.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, how was he dressed? - A. He had no coat on.</p>

Yes; as we came along in the coach, Ludman asked me when he was to have another hearing before the Magistrates; I told him he was fully committed, he was to have no other hearing; he made answer to Mrs. Hughes, what a wicked woman you are, you brought us all into this murder, and why not tell the truth; she said, I have told all I knowed about it; he said, no you have not; you know you knocked the man twice on the head with a poker, as he lay asleep on the bed; she said they might all say as they pleased, the knowed nothing about it:

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; Mrs. Hughes pledged with me a coat, waistcoat, and two half muslin handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they pawned at different times, or at the same time? - A. On the 19th of May, one half handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. At what time of the day? - A. I don't recollect particularly, I know it was in the daytime; it might be about the middle of the day. On the 20th there was a waistcoat and another half handkerchief pledged in the morning together.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time do you shut up shop? - A. Ten in the evening; the waistcoat was pledged for 4s. 6d. and the half handkerchief for 9d. and on Saturday the 21st of May, the coat was pledged about four o'clock in the afternoon, for half a guinea,(produces them all.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have these things been shewn to Mrs. Hebner? - A. Yes; and they were sworn to before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Ludman's defence. On Saturday morning I got up between five and six o'clock to look for a job; I could not get any thing to do; I walked about in the middle of the day; my mother asked me to mend a wheelbarrow; I began to mend the wheelbarrow, and at three o'clock in the afternoon my mother and sister went to Bow-fair; she desired me to keep some fire till she came home at night; I went up to this public-house about ten at night, because they were not come home, and I sat down there; my mother came to me in the public-house, and asked, have you seen your father? I told her, no; and she gave me a clasp-knife; I sat in one box, and these girls sat in another; I offered this girl, Rhodes, a pint of beer; by that time the beer was out, she said, we will go to Mrs. Hughes's, and we did; Mrs. Hughes and Baker were there; Mrs. Hughes said, I must go up to bed in the dark; she had got no candle; I slept till between seven and eight in the morning; Mrs. Hughes came up to me and said, for God's sake come down, here is a man in the house hanged himself; she said, for God's sake do not make a noise; I came down, and the first word that Mrs. Hughes's little boy spoke was, mammy is the man dead? and she said, yes, my dear; when she found I would not stay in the lower apartment any longer, this woman kept me in talk till the mob came in; a man came in; says I, there is a man hanged himself; I had hardly spoke the word, when several more came in, and I went up stairs and saw the man hanging; I never saw the man before in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Rhodes's defence. I went to Mrs. Hughes's on Saturday night, I asked her if she had a bed to let; she said there was only a garret; the gentleman was sitting smoking a pipe without a coat or hat; there was a pot of beer sent for, but I never saw the man eat or drink in my life; I went away and left them, and when I came back I asked for a light, and she said she had no light; if I had a light I could not have been off seeing the man hanging, as I went by the door; I went to bed, and in the morning Mrs. Hughes came up, and said the man had hanged himself; she said she would not have the house alarmed till she had had her breakfast.</p>
               <p>Hughes's defence. The gentleman came to lodge at my house on Wednesday night; he was recommended there by the watchman; he asked what he should give me to lie by himself in a good bed; I told him 1s. I went up on Thursday night, I asked him what he would have to eat or drink; he said he would have a pint of milk; he got up on Thursday morning, I went to fetch the hair-dresser to shave him; he washed his hands and was shaved, and went out; he came in again about ten o'clock; he waited for me some time, I was not at home; and when I came in he asked me if that bed was let; I told him it was not; I gave him a light, and he went up stairs; between nine and ten o'clock the next morning I asked him if he would choose any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220031"/>thing to eat or drink; he said he had no money; says he, I have got three neck handkerchiefs, if you will pawn them for me; I said, they will not bring much; I went to Mr. Murray's and pawned one of them for 8d.; he took the 8d. that I pawned it for, and went out; he never paid me for the bed that morning, and he came back again on the Friday morning, and said he was very much distressed, and desired me to take his waistcoat and sell it to the Jews; I refused to do that, and then he asked me to pawn it for him, which I did on the Friday; I got 4s. 6d. upon it, and he gave me 1s. of it for the bed; he came again at night, and asked if the bed was engaged; I told him no; I went up in the morning, and asked if he would have any thing to eat; he said he would have nothing at all to eat or drink, and was very faint; he said he had been defrauded by one man of 40l. and another of 30l. and he was ashamed to go home; he wanted me to pawn his coat; he said he would take it as a great favour; I endeavoured to persuade him against it, but he begged I would, and said he would go home without his coat in the evening; I went on Saturday afternoon and pawned his coat for half a guinea; I went to the Black Horse and got this change for half a guinea and some beer and tobacco; he sat two or three hours, and desired me to get him another pot of beer, which I did; he took in some milk at four o'clock, and wanted to give the milk man a pint of ale; he went up with his beer and pipe, and came down at seven o'clock and asked me if he could have any thing hot; I said nothing but sheep's head, which I supposed would not be agreeable to him; he said it would, and I sent out for two or three, I am not certain which, and he had another pot of beer and sat smoking his pipe till about nine o'clock, and then he went up stairs with a candle and his pot of beer and pipe, and I saw no more of him till the next morning, when I went up to ask him if he would have any thing, and saw him hanging to the bed-post.</p>
               <p>Baker's defence. I was recommended to Mrs. Hughes's house on Friday night; I never was there before in my life; I went out, and as I was coming down Dean-street back again, Hughes asked me to fetch her some eggs; she was very drunk; I saw the deceased come down and light his pipe, and two more young women were in the house; she gave me one of the eggs, and carried the rest up stairs; I went out, and came in again about nine o'clock; Rhodes came in just-after me; I went out, and Rhodes went out, and left this gentleman drinking with Mrs. Hughes by the fire-side, I dare say it was very high twelve o'clock; I knocked against the door, she got up and opened the door; all three went to bed together, and about two o'clock the watchman called at the window and asked if she had a bed to let; and it was a Dutchman, and he made me a small compliment, and I went to bed with him; Mrs. Hughes came down stairs on the Sunday morning, and said, the gentleman has hung himself; I screamed out, Lord have mercy upon us; she begged I would not make any noise, that Mrs. Darby should not hear us; I desired her to call

               <p>Q. Where had you seen them before? - A. They were in the brazier's shop in a kettle, they were taken there that day, the iron anvil was under his bench, removed out of the copper snop, into the tin shop; having a search warrant, I went with the officer to his lodgings, and there I found a tobacco-box, which I believe to be the property of my father, he was taken before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had not seen these things for some time? - A. Not the anvil nor copper.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the rivets? - A. I cannot say I saw these, I saw a quantity of rivets in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that the tobacco-box is your father's property? - A. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Between the hours of one and two the prisoner came into the brazier's shop; I was in the warehouse along side the shop, he came in to boil potatoes for his dinner; there was a hole made in the partition on purpose for me to look through; my master directed me to watch; he put the saucepan on the forge, and looked about the shop to see that all was clear; finding nobody there, he went to the kettle under the work-bench, and took the rivets out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the rivets there any time before? - A. Yes; I saw them there the same morning; before he laid them on the forge, he put a few in his pocket at the time; I went and informed my master of it, he put me there again, and I saw him take some more, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you lived in this place? - A. About two years and a half.</p>

None at all: About eight o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 4th of May, I came down stairs and found my son engaged, showing the prisoner some coloured patent silk stockings; as he seemed to look them it largely, I thought it adviseable to attend him myself; he looked out a quantity of the coloured ones,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220034"/>he desired to look at some white, saying, they were not all for himself, some were for his relations in the country; after he had looked out a quantity of the white ones, he asked if Mr. Hoole, the haberdasher, lived near, he wanted to buy some ribbons, and I directed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he given you directions before this, to pack up any hose? - A. Yes; he had desired me to pack these things up with great care, that they might go to the country in safety, that he would go to Mr. Hoole's, and buy the articles he wanted there, and would return and pay for those he had picked out; I observed him open the door very quick; immediately upon his opening the door, or rather his going out of the door, my warehouseman,

               <p>Q. You must not tell us what he said? - A. I came to the top of the stairs, and looked some time, and saw the prisoner looking out some stockings; Mr. Shute was there at the time; I saw the prisoner take some stockings from the counter, and put them into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they loose stockings on the counter? - A. They were; I called the porter, and desired him to stand by him, and seize the prisoner the instant he went out of the shop; I waited a few minutes longer, and saw him take some more, and put into his pocket; I told the porter what I had seen; he said, he had better go down stairs, and seen employed at the bottom of the stairs, to be nearer the prisoner; immediately after, I saw him go out, and run away, and we pursued him down Gutter-lane, and Wood-street, and cried, stop-thief, and he threw his great coat off; I passed the great coat, and followed him down Wood-street, crying, stop-thief, the whole time; the prisoner turned into Lad-lane, where he was stopped by a man; I did not see him stopped, he was stopped the instant he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken back to Mr. Shute's? - A. I brought him back, and met Fitzpatrick with the great coat, and we went with him to Mr. Shute's; when we returned, some stockings were taken out of the great coat pocket, by the porter, and some by Mr. Hart, there were nine pair of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which side pocket it was? - A. No; I looked at two of them, and found my own mark upon them, I had put it some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt they were Mr. Shute's property? - A. Not the least in the world; Mr. Shute desired Fitzpatrick to go for a Mr. Wathen, a hosier, at Snow-hill; the prisoner said, it was unnecessary, there were sufficient evidence against him, he threw himself entirely upon Mr. Shute's mercy; he said, it was his first offence, and when he heard his safe, he would pity him, and not be severe against him.</p>

               <p>Q. He had been some time in the shop before you ran out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Bargaining with Mr. Shute's son? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a city constable: on the 4th of May, I met the prisoner in Wood-street, in custody of Harris and Fitzpatrick; I went with them to Mr. Shute's house; I have a great coat I received from Fitzpatrick; I have had it ever since; there were nine pair of silk stockings in the pocket, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Harris. (Looks at them.) There are four pair which are marked by myself, those I speak positively to; the others have no mark that I can swear to; those that I can swear to are worth about two guineas.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You put them at the price you would sell them at? - A. No; the price they cost us.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, though they cost you two guineas, the manufacturer could manufacture them at thirty-six shillings? - A. They might cost the manufacturer less than two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shute. (Looks at them.) I am able to speak to those that are marked, the rest I believe to be my property; the whole cost me four pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am perfectly satisfied with the conduct of my Counsel; I only beg that your Lordship, and the Jury will divest yourselves of every prejudice from my name being Jaques, and my being brother to a man of a very infamous character; it would be extremely hard if my character were hurt through him, for he has been my greatest enemy; I have been distressed and ruined by my brother; I believe the Court are in possession of it; I shall leave myself to the mercy of the Court and Jury.(The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character). GUILTY, (Aged 30.)</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen it in your house before you missed it? - A. I saw it that morning after it had been washed; the prisoner said, just before he was going to the Justice, "consider me;" I said, I could not consider any thing but justice; he said,"well then, you can but have my life;" I said, I don't want your life, I want nothing but justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this mug? - A. About three pounds; it cost me three guineas, or three pounds five shillings; I bought it as old silver, about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You never saw the pot in the prisoner's hands? - A. No.</p>

I refreshed myself and my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220036"/>horses, and was coming away at twelve, and never was out of the Crown yard till I came away; the landlord came up, and desired me to stop; he got into my chaise, and the ostler upon the bar, and desired me to take him to the Red-lion at Hillingdon, and I should have a pint of beer; he said, he had lost a silver mug; and then he desired me to carry him to Hayes, and drive pretty quick over the common, he said, the man could not be got much farther; he gave me two sixpences to drink, and described the man to me, and told me, if I would take him and the pint mug, he would give me five guineas; I came about a mile and a half farther, and the prisoner called to me, and asked if I was going to town; and I said, yes; he jumped upon the bar, and, in about four miles, he said he was cold, and he would get inside; and I said, so would I; and then I saw the pint, there was a handkerchief lapped over it; and as he laid it down, the handkerchief dropped from it, and he fell back in the chaise and went to sleep; when we got into St. Giles's, I stopped, and let him out, and asked him for the money for driving him, and he gave it me; and when I let him out, I catched him by the collar, and said, Sir, I believe I must stop you, for a robbery that was done at Uxbridge lak night; he says, do you think I am a thief? I said, I have not the least doubt but you are the thief; and in scuffling, his hat fell off, and there was a silver pint in the lining of his hat; says he, you don't know me, nor I you; and he offered me a silver watch, which he said cost him five guineas, and a gold seal to it, to let him go; and I said, I would not have any bribery, and he shoved it into my breast; I said I would not have his watch, and holloaed out watch three or four times, and a watchman did not come for some time; and when he saw the watchman, he threw the pint behind him, and I told him to pick it up again, which he did; and I desired a watchman to look after my horses while I gave charge of him to the watchman, which I did, and sent express off to the landlord that I had taken the man; the prisoner laid it upon the bench before the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the mug again? - A. Yes, particularly well; the watchman bid me mark it, and I marked it with the snuffers with a cross upon the bottom.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear the pot was in the lining of the hat? - A. Yes. (The prisoner produces his hat).</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220037"/>Q. (To Brown.) Look at that pot, and see if it is your property? - A. If it is mine, there is my name engraved upon the front of it, E. M. B. This is my pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Knowlys. That pot you bought a year and a half ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been well scowered since? - A. It is most days in use.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what weight of silver there is in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that it would be worth 40s.? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went from London upon business to Oxford; when I got into Uxbridge it was late; I had some beer and bespoke a bed; at half past ten I heard of a returned chaise for London; accordingly I made an enquiry for this postboy, which might be five minutes before eleven; I enquired for him in the Crown-yard, which is next door to Mr. Brown's; I asked him what I should give him to take me to London, and he said 1s. and a pint; I told him he should have it; I asked him to go with me to Mr. Brown's, and he would not, because he had got his horses to rub down, and I went and fetched the mug out to him to drink, and he told me if I would walk on he would overtake me in ten minutes; that he durst not take me up there because his master William was up; he rode outside, and a soldier on the bar; when I got to Ealing I moved the saddle, and there I saw the pot, and I called to him and asked him how he came not to return the pot; I charged him with the watch in Plumb-tree-street, St. Giles's, and he collared me; he threw the pint down, he would not pick it up, and when the watchman came he gave charge of me; I gave the pint pot to the post-boy between Mr. Brown's and the Crown-yard; if Mr. Brown gave him a caution about my taking the pot, why did not he stop me going through the turnpike? or why did not he take me with me the soldier? two of them were enough to take me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ailadine.) Was there any soldier upon the bar? - A. No; I never saw any soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what he has said is false? - A. Yes.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.)</p>

               <p>Q. He keeps an open yard? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220038"/>Q. What particular mark is there by which you know her again? - A. No particular mark except a few hairs of a different colour at the end of the tail; I bred her myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were those hairs? - A. A rusty colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Many other pigs have rusty hairs at the end of the tail? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen 10,000 pigs with rusty hairs at the end of their tails? - A. I never saw a pig like my own; I know her by her size and make.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you could not swear to it; upon further consideration, but that you could only swear it was your's, because the tail was a little longer than other pigs? - A. No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body should swear that, he would swear that which is false? - A. I cannot help what they swear.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Ally. I work in the India-House, I have known the prisoner these sixteen years; I was at the door, at the same time that the prisoner, and Lewis, and the boy, were coming out of Lewis's house with the pig.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive it is the pig in question? - A. I went from there to his father's house in Eyre-street, and saw this pig in the stye, which I know to be the same sow he had from Lewis, and no other.</p>
               <p>Q. Lewis was present at the time? - A. He was just behind the prisoner and the boy; as they were coming out, I asked the prisoner if he had been buying that sow, and he said, yes; I have seen the pig since at Mr. Ramsden's yard, and since that, I went to the prosecutor's house and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that Mr. Lewis was near enough to have heard this conversation? - A. I do think he must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. The pig, however, could not have come out of the possession of Lewis without his knowing it? - A. No, it could not.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take so much notice of this sow? - A. I have known Montague many years, ever since we were boys together; I happened to be coming past at the time they were coming out with the pig; I observed it as we went along Brick-lane at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. The 18th of May, which was my birth-day.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. How far was the first paling from your warehouse? - A. About 50 yards, and the second paling is about 150 yards; I went back to get one of our men of the name of Robertson; I went with him to see if we could trace it, and we found the trace of a six inch wheeled cart, which went up to a brick-kiln, and we concluded that it must have been taken away in that cart; we traced the cart up the road towards Islington, about thirty or forty yards; we could not find any further track, then we lost it; we enquired at Islington turnpike, and found that several carts had come through, but none had gone through; as we could get no information, we turned back again; at the meeting of the two roads, at the corner of the City-road, we found the track of the cart again, and traced it down to the City road turnpike, and enquired if any cart had gone through; the man said, there was a cart with two horses went through about two o'clock, but did not know what it was loaded with; we came to Old-street end, and could not find any track; we then turned back again to the corner of Hoxton, by the Three Crowns, and there we found it again, it had turned up a back lane to the left hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What hour was this? - A. Between four and five, near upon five; we traced the cart up the back lane, to a lane that goes up to the white lead mills, by the Rosemary-branch, and there was a six inch wheel waggon before us, and we were afraid of losing the track, and we ran on before the waggon, and caught the track again, and traced it into a dust yard, at the high end of Hoxton; we went up to the gate of the yard, but did not see any thing like a cart; we staid about a minute, and then we went down the road to Old-street gate, and enquired if any cart had gone through there, and they said, no; then we went back to call up Mr. Lee's clerk, and we went to the Police Office for Mr. Armstrong,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220040"/>and we went up with him to this dust-yard, in Hoxton; he went into the yard, and saw the man that it belongs to, I believe his name is Norris; he asked the man if he had any carts out that night, he said, he had lent one the night before; but what time it went out, or what time it came in, he could not tell, it was to go out in the night; Armstrong asked him who he had lent it to, he said, to the landlord at the King's arms, Mr. Bedell; he asked Armstrong to go with him to the King's-arms, which we did, the girl said, her master was come home, but what time she did not know; he then called Bedell up, he came in his shirt sleeves, Armstrong told him he must put his coat on and go with us; when he put his coat on, it was all covered with flax , but we did not find any there; Armstrong desired us to take care of the landlord while he went up stairs, he brought Chandler down with his coat covered with flax , of the same sort we had lost; after Chandler was brought down, Armstrong and Bedell went into a corner, and what conversation they had, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Do you know any thing of this Norris? - A. No; I did not know that I should if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some flax  hanging about some palings? - A. Yes; and some flax  hanging about the bar of Bedell's house.</p>
               <p>Q. So that yourself, or any body else, might brush it off upon their clothes by going past? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Norris said, he had lent his cart to the landlord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it tied in whisps, or what? - A. Yes; in whisps.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he mention the name of either of the other prisoner? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Norris? - A. A scavenger; a common carman.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as state what conversation you had with Bedell previous to his saying that is one of the men? - A. Bedell denied it at first; and after he was pressed hard, he said it; and then, I going up stairs, and seeing Chandler's coat in that condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Bedell was in custody at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took Brown, how was he employed? - A. He was walking along very near Bedell's house; but whether Brown had seen us with Bedell first, or not, he certainly passed Bedell's house; I cannot say whether he was going in or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Bedell pretty well, I believe, don't you? - A. No; I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other charge against him? - A. No; I know there is some tin he was good enough to inform the Magistrate of afterwards; but he informed the Magistrate of that, and not me; there are some people in custody for it.</p>

I keep the Kings-Arms, at Hoxton: On Friday evening, the 6th of May, all the prisoners came to my house; I had met Townsend before that about six o'clock in the evening; Townsend said, he understood I had carts and horses to let; I told him I did business for Mr. Norris; very well, says he, if I should want a cart you can let me have one; I said, yes; I went home about eight o'clock and had some tea, there were a great many people in the house; he said he should want it pretty soon; all the prisoners were there at that time; he said, he wanted to move the things before he went to work in the morning, he did not say what things; they went away then all four of them together; about half past eleven I shut up my house, and went to bed; and, about one o'clock in the morning, somebody came and called me, and I got up and went down to the door, and Chandler was at the door; he said, the men wanted me to move the things for them; why, says I, it is very early in the morning; I harnessed the two horses, it was a six-inch wheel cart, a brick cart; he told me to go to the end of Goswell-street road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to go for? - A. No; when I got there, Morris came up and laid hold of the fore-horse, and led him into the brick-field, and there I saw this quantity of tow; I said, in the name of God what have you got here; he said, never mind, turn your cart about, and take it up; they were all there then; when Chandler and I came with the cart, I found the other three there, and they were all present when it was put into the cart; I told them I would not take it up; Morris said, damn you, must take it up, there is no harm can come of it, and I did take it up; I took it home, and they all went with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did you go house? - A. Down the City-road, and up Mr. Scott's lane, that leads up to Mr. Scott's brick fields, by the Rosemarry-branch, and to the Lead Mills, I drove it into our own yard, Mr. Norris's; I took the horses out, and told them I should have no further to do with it, and put the horses in the stable, and they put it into a grain hole, and wished me a good morning; Chandler asked me if he could sleep at my house, I said, yes, he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the flax put into this grain hole? - A. No; I saw them carry it that way; I was very badly frightened.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. And when you were before the Magistrate, and the tin story came out, you thought it best to run away? - A. There was a man swore a very wrong thing against me, it was proved that he took a false oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Which so alarmed you that you run away? - A. I did not know but that man would swear my life away.</p>
               <p>Q. You were brought back and hand-cuffed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time, you have described you only worked for Mr. Norris; you had no suspicion of any thing going on wrong? - A. I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you let out carts and horses? - A. I transact Mr. Norris's business for him.</p>

               <p>Q. It was all the same to you what kind of goods they had to move? - A. I did not ask them.</p>
               <p>Q. But very innocently went and fetched the cart, without asking what they would give you for it, or what you were to fetch? - A. They said they would satisfy me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them happened to say they would satisfy you for your trouble? - A. Townsend.</p>
               <p>Q. Chandler was pretty merry at your house the night before? - A. They had been there, and were merry, and a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember Chandler being pretty drunk the night before, don't you? - A. I cannot say the man was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he so drunk that he was obliged go to-bed? - A. No, he was not; he did not go to-bed till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You let lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the flax put into the grain hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you said, I will have nothing to do with it, you had no suspicion then, I suppose? - A. I did not know what to make of it; I did not think it was come honestly by, and I was very badly frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing about the tin being hid under the dung? - A. It was not hid under the dung, it was under a manger, where any body that came into the stable might see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate, that it was hid under the dung, in your information? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. All you have been telling now is as true as that? - A. What I have said is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lee was so good as to intimate to you, that if you discovered other persons and cleared yourself, you would be safe? - A. I never saw Mr. Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. James intimated that to you, I believe? - A. He told me, now young man, do you tell who had your cart; you cannot be hurt in it; and I said, I would tell him who had my cart, and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you understood as the only means of saving yourself? - A. I did not know the dangers of it, till such time as I saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you were handcuffed you gave the account of the tin to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This tin four people were concerned in? - A. No; Chandler and Salmon were the two people I had the tin from.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been asked, whether you made any bargain? You made no particular bargain, but they told you they would satisfy you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What trade are these people? - A. They work at the water-side as coal-porters.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I know the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember them all coming to your house the night before this robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your husband and Chandler sleeping in your house? - A. I don't know that Chandler slept there; my husband was called up early in the morning; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I believe you know the gentlemen were so good as to say they would let your husband off if he would turn evidence? - A. I don't know any such thing. (The property was produced.)</p>
               <p>Robertson. This bundle was wrought by one Leach, and this by one Knowles; it is their manner of tying them up; I have not the smallest doubt they are Mr. Lee's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Different workmen work in the same way? - A. I examine all the work myself, and what is not done properly I return; and what is done properly I make up; there is but one other shop in town that lays down flax in this manner, of this sort of flax; this is only fit for sail-cloth and sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. If that was among half a dozen other bundles you would not have been able to pick it out? - A. Yes, I should; I know it by the lay down; I am sure it is Mr. Lee's property.</p>
               <p>Chandler's defence. I know nothing at all about the robbery; I slept at Bedell's that night; there were fises and drums and dancing, and I was pretty much in liquor, and slept there; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Townsend's defence. I know nothing at all of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Morris's defence. I know nothing at all of the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. What are their names? - A. Meriel, and Ann; the house belongs to them; they went out of town on the 17th of July, and I left town on the Monday following, the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went out of town, did you see that house secured? - A. I did it myself, I locked all the doors, and fastened the windows, every one with bars and bolts, as far as I possibly could; I was the last person in the house; I fastened the outer door; I locked it with two locks, a patent lock, and a common lock; I put all the keys on a string, and gave them to Mr. Slack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave every thing in its place? - A. Yes; every door was locked, and every box and drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had given the keys to Mr. Slack was it before you saw it again? - A. Not till the 21st of November; we came to town, on hearing that the house had been broke open, and found every thing turned upside down, every thing turned out of the drawers, and a great deal of property gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular part of the furniture in disorder? - A. Yes; every thing almost moved out of its place.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost any property yourself? - A. A great deal.</p>

               <p>I am a hatter in South Audley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the Miss Nevilles? - A. Yes; Mrs. Gibbs left the keys with me last July; as she always did when the Miss Nevilles went out of town; I had the care of the house prior to the 19th of November; there having been a high wind, I was apprehensive some tiles might have blown off the house; I went to see that it was safe between two and three-o'clock in the afternoon; I took my youngest son William with me; when we came to the door, we found it only on the single lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing done to the other lock? - A. Yes; the door ought to have been fastened with a patent lock, and a common spring-lock, the patent lock was forced off; the box that the lock goes into was forced off; when we got the door open, we saw a bed, a pillow, blankets, and bolsters, I believe, all packed up and laid in the hall, but I did not examine it particulary; I was a great deal surprised at that, and looked into the parlours, the parlour doors were both open, every thing was in confusion, and every paper and drawer opened, and thrown about, that was in the back parlour; in the front parlour there was a harpsichord, which was broke, and a bottle that had been emptied, and six glasses; I should suppose they had been drinking wine out of them; there was a looking-glass taken out of the frame, and a vast deal of dirt in the room, the cheek of the door had been forced off.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did the glasses appear to have been recently used? - A. I cannot tell when they had been used, it certainly had not been long.</p>
               <p>Court. It most likely was done at different times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Slack. We went up stairs; and found every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220045"/>thing in confusion, the doors were all forced open; we went up stairs, and under the garret stairs there was a cedar chest, and knowing that Miss Neville used to leave her household linen in that chest, I looked into it, and they had emptied and done their business in it; the second floor was in confusion, every bureau and drawer open; and wherever there was a curiosity, or a little box, or any thing, it was thrown about under foot; the papers were in such confusion you cannot conceive, they were thrown about so; some of the beds were gone out of the two pair of stairs; we went into the garret, and found every box, and every thing in the same confusion; the boxes emptied, and all the distress that could be, every thing was ransacked and gone; we went below stairs then, into the house-keeper's room, and found that in the same situation, every door opened; and under the kitchen stairs, where I knew the iron chest was deposited, I looked there, and found that removed, but not taken away; it was set on one side, it was not opened; then we went down into the cellar, and the cellar door was open, but not a bottle left with any thing in it; we went into the front kitchen, somebody had been in there, but there was nothing that I knew of gone; we examined every place, and there was nobody left in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into every room in the house? - A. Yes, and examined every room carefully.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you in the house? - A. About half an hour, or three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you leave it? - A. Double locked by the spring lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake positively to say, that nobody was in that house when you left it? - A. Yes; I can positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the exact hour when you left this door double-locked? - A. After three o'clock, but I cannot say how much, I went home; I understood a friend from Brentford was there, and I staid there about a quarter of an hour, and from there I went to Justice Addingtion; I went to Clarges-street first, knowing that he used to live there, and expected to find him there then; upon not finding him there, I heard where he lived, in Vine-street; and as I passed St. James's church, I observed that the clock was exactly four; I went to Vine-street, and told him my business, and he advised me to watch; I went home to my own house, and told my family; I did not stay at home more than four or five minutes, only to say where I was going; I went to the next door, and staid about the door till after the post-bell had rung.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time does the bell ring past your house? - A. It begins at five, and finishes about twenty minutes before six; the first bell was rung before I went home; I went from the next door back to my own house to see about a letter that my son was writing to Miss Neville, to acquaint her of the state of her house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say next door, do you mean next door to your own house? - A. No; next door to Miss Nevilles'; I went home and drank tea, I staid at home till near six o'clock. I then went into Portugal-street, and looked into Miss Nevilles' parlour window, where I saw a light; I went to collect a few neighbours together at the public-house, to come to my assistance; we collected several neighbours, twenty or thirty, but, I believe, there were about a dozen went in with me. I kneeled down, and looked through the key-hole, to see if I could see any body pass or repass in the passage, but I saw nobody; I asked the people about me if they were ready to go in with me, and they said they were; I opened the door myself, and found it only single locked, I had left it double-locked; we found two lights in the parlour, my son fetched one of them out, and immediately as he was coming out of the parlour, there was a cry above stairs</p>
               <p>"shoot them, damn them, shoot them;" there was a great stamping above stairs, that you might suppose there were a dozen people there; after that cry, and this stamping, I said, "oh, damn you, I'll shoot you;" we directly proceeded up stairs as fast as we could, and my son, and another young man that was there at the same time, being rather more active than myself, ran up past me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was possible for any person, besides your own party, your son, and these other persons, to have gone up stairs before you? - A. I am very sure it was impossible for any person whatever to go by me, for I stood at the foot of the stairs; when I came to the first landing-place they got by me; and when I came to the second landing-place, I saw the two prisoners go from the back drawing-room to the front drawing-room; when they found us so close, my son, or another person, I cannot say which, had a light in his hand, it was knocked out, and they called out for another light;

             was the first before my son, but I was directly behind him with a light, for I had a light in one hand, and a cutlass in the other; I went in with the light, and when they found they could not get the door closed, they looked for something to defend themselves with.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the closing of the door - A. It was a door between the two drawing-rooms, they open one into the other; after they were over-powered in that, they looked for something to defend themselves with; there was a flower-stand, which one of them took to the window, and jumped up for a window-bar, I think it was Vandercom, I am not sure, and my son cut him on the arm, and he dropped it; but it is so long ago, that I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220046"/>recollect whether it was my son or Harvey; I picked up the bar, and they desended themselves with chairs and tables till they were overpowered, and then they were secured, and taken to the watch-house; we did not search them, they were taken from the watch-house to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your return from Mr. Addington's to Miss Nevilles', you went to your own house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to Miss Nevilles', what fort of light was it? - A. It was day-light then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned the next time to the house, do you recollect what fort of light it was? - A. It was quite dark then; it was about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one else besides your party there, or thereabouts, during the whole of this time? - A. No; I believe, not a soul; I was there myself, from half past four till I went home about the letter to Miss Neville.</p>
               <p>Q. From half past four till when? - A. Till after five; because the bell had rung.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark then? - A. Dark.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you left Miss Nevilles' house it was quite dark? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you went into the house first, and examined into the state of the kitchen, there is a door that leads into a garden-ground, or something? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that was fast at the time you left the house? - A. I certainly will not swear that it was - no, it was not fastened.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Nor shut? - A. Yes; it was shut, but not fastened with the wooden bar that it ought to have been fastened with; it was fastened with a latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pledge your memory to say it was not open? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. You left it some time after three o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you went and saw your friend, went to Justice Addington's, and then returned to the house, it must have consumed more than an hour? - A. I can't say that; the only notice that I had of the time was, passing by St. James's church.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observation of the street-door, how did it appear to have been opened? - A. I left it double-locked and found it single-locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the back-door? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The house was left without any watch for above an hour in the day-time? - A. Yes, I believe, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, when you went the second time, any of the property brought down stairs? - A. I did not, except that the back drawing-room carpet had been cut up at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any of the things out of the back-parlour removed in the front, or out of the front into the back parlour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. My Learned Friend has asked you if there was not a whole hour when this house was left unguarded; was it not, during the whole of that hour, broad day-light? - A. It was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of November, I went to Miss Nevilles' at near three o'clock, I went with my father, to see if any damage was done to the house, occasioned by the high wind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the house? - A. I did; and found that it had been broke open and robbed; I went into all the rooms of the house, the doors were all forced, the cheeks split of some of them, and the locks broke off; I observed a bed lying in the hall tied up in a blanket, and a looking-glass taken out of its frame, and laid upon the harpsichord in the front parlour; I went with my father all over the house, but before we went over the house, I went to fetch my brother; I left the house nearly upon four, between three and four.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of the house, did you part company with your father? - A. Yes; he went to Justice Addington's; I went again with my father to Miss Nevilles', nearly upon six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it at all between the time you parted company with your father, and nearly upon six o'clock? - A. I had not; I had been home.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you returned to the house? - A. There was a person of the name of Birch there, and Bagley, and Lawless; my father was there before me, in Portugal-street; my father unlocked the door, and asked if we were all ready, and went in, I followed my father; I went into the parlour, and found two lights, I took one of them out, and went up stairs, my father stopped at the bottom of the stairs; I then heard a noise of stamping of feet, and crying out "damn them, shoot them, and fire upon them," and a few such words.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have ran up stairs between the time of your going in for a candle and your going up stairs? - A. I do not think they could; I went up stairs and followed the voices, and as I turned round the second landing-place of the drawing-room, they drew a table before them which I threw on one side; there was a bit of a scuffle ensued as they turned in at the door, between me and Harvey, and the two prisoners; one of them knocked out the light, which I had in my hand, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220047"/>cannot pretend to say which of them it was, and then ran into the front drawing-room and endeavoured to shut the door, but shut Harvey's arm into it; they pushed against the door; we pushed against it as hard as we could; we bollowed out for another light; we pushed again; as soon as we got a light and got in, the first I saw was Abbot, and then I saw Vandercom coming from the window, the same two men that I had seen before; Vandercom came round Abbot, and took up a table and thrust it at me; I then cut at him with a cutlass, and we fought a bit; and at last I cut him over the hand, and he dropped the table; then, my Lord, he made at me with his fist; I cut him once or twice again, at last he staggered and I collared him; he did not fall, and I secured him; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is this house of Miss Nevilles situated, is it at the corner of the street? - A. No; it is almost the middle house; I believe it is No. 3, there are five or six houses in the street, on that side of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it so situated that any body could go in at broad day-light, and could not be seen? - A. No; it is impossible, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You left this house between three and four? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not return again till near six? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You locked the door when you went out, between three and four? - A. No; my father locked it.</p>

               <p>Q. It was day light of course when you left it, between three and four? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the back-door that there is to this house? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon yourself to say, whether that was fastened? - A. Yes; there was a bar across it, that I can swear to positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, are you sure there was a bar put across the back-door? - A. I am quite positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the situation of the property when you returned again; did you observe any difference? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember particularly any alteration of the carpet? - A. No; I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any of the property being removed to a different situation than that in which you left it? - A. No; I do not recollect any thing being altered at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said any thing of that fort? - A. Some things I said had been moved, but not between my first being there and my going at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that nothing was removed? - A. I can only say, I did not observe it.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I heard a rustling of something like paper, under a broken wall of a warehouse, in the court, and immediately the prisoner came by with a handkerchief in his hand; I followed him down the court, and he crossed the way, in Mark-lane; I called, young man, come back, and let us see what you have got; he came quietly back up the court; my husband pulled me by the gown, and said, have nothing to do with it, it is a troublesome affair.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I produce twelve pounds of isinglass, which was delivered to me by Phillips; I have had it in my possession ever since; I have a sample (producing it), which I took out of a cask in the warehouse, which had been plundered; I went the next morning with Mr. Pearson to examine his warehouse, it is in Seething-lane, one part of it comes into Sugar-loaf-court, in Mark-lane; there was a cask, out of which a great quantity had been taken, and there was a hole made through the wall, into <placeName id="t17960622-23-crimeloc135">Sugar-loaf-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You won't swear that this hole is large enough for a man to get in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor could a man with a stick reach the isinglass? - A. No; he could not reach the cask.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Allen). Q. When you heard a noise at the end of the court, did you see the prisoner near the warehouse at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come in a direction from the warehouse? - A. I cannot answer that.</p>
               <p>Pearson. This isinglass is the same as the sample; I can swear it is our property; I know it by the string it is tied with; you may go to many casks of isinglass, and not find two tied with the same sort of string; the prisoner acknowledge before the Magistrate, that he and another man broke the hole in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You told my Lord, that this isinglass had a particular string about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There may be other persons in this metropolis, who have isinglass tied with the same kind of string? - A. It is very rare.</p>
               <p>Q. You only swear to it by the string? - A. By the string and the quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I stood at the top of the court making water, and saw a bundle lie in the court, and seeing nobody near the bundle, I took it up; Mrs. Allen called me back, and I followed her; her husband pulled her in; then I thought it was not her property, and went away with it; when they cried stop-thief, I thought I would have no more trouble with it and dropped it.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character). <rs id="t17960622-23-verdict136" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>I keep coaches at Kentish-Town: James Wilcox came to my house, on Saturday the 11th, at four in the afternoon, for change for two guineas, which I gave him; and he called me out into the the garden, and told me he had seven trusses of hay to dispose of on Monday; I asked him if it was good, for it must be if I had it; he did not say any thing about the price, nor I neither; I told him to send it on the Monday about ten o'clock, and I should be ready to take it in; I saw Wilcox again on the Sunday, and he told me he should send it in; but instead of seven trusses there were twelve; he told me he had bought them at two shillings a truss, and I should have them for half-a-crown; I told him I would have it; on the Monday morning, about five o'clock, when I got up, there was the hay upon my premisses.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you known him before? - A. Yes, four or five years; I did not see him again till he was taken up; I took a lump of it and patterned it with Mr. Stevenson's rick; there is not such hay within six miles of London, any where, it is so very fine, and full of clover, very nice brown hay; I could not find such a load of hay, I believe, for six pounds, if I was to go to market.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever buy any hay before of Wilcox? - A. Yes; if I wanted a truss or two, he had the privilege of the stables where he lived, at the Bull-and-gate Inn, at Kentish-Town, to buy and sell hay as he liked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was he to get hay of his own? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You knew perfectly well he was not the master of that inn? - A. He had the privilege of doing as he liked in the stables.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the privilege of the stables; did you suppose this man had a right to sell hay as he pleased out of those stables? - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stevenson. This man was <rs id="t17960622-28-deflabel160" type="occupation">ostler</rs>

               <p>Jury. (To Crane.) Q. How often may you have gone to him for hay? - A. Never, except I was short of hay, and wanted a truss or two; he sold to a great many people in the town.</p>

               <p>I was going home on Sunday morning, about two o'clock, and met a man with a truss of hay, he is not here present, he was coming up to town from the place where this rick of hay stood; I went on a little further, and met another man with another truss, that was the prisoner, Waters, I did not say any thing to him, I am sure he is the man; I watched them both into the Bull-and-gate, I thought it a very strange time to carry hay in, and I went over the hedge to see if there were any trusses gone, and I got under the hedge, and saw two men come and fetch three more trusses away, and throw them over the corner of the field, and I went home; I did not see where they took them to, but they went the same way; the next morning, I asked my master whose rick it was; and he told me it belonged to one Mr. Stevenson; my master, Mr. Crane, went and told Mr. Stevenson of it.</p>

               <p>I am a foreigner; I went out in company on the 26th of May, and liquor overtook me; I got astray, and some strange body picked me up, I cannot tell who it was, I was so much in liquor; my company left me, we were somewhere in the outskirts of the town, playing at skittles, and we all got a little groggy; the next morning I found myself in a strange room by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you were picked up? - A. I was in a strange place where I never was before, and I could not come there by myself; I laid down in a sort of a bed, the door was open, and the key sticking into it; when I awoke it was about six o'clock in the morning, when I searched, I found my breeches were gone with all that was in them, there was a purse in them with sixty-three guineas; misfortune had been preparing me for bad luck, it was my own money, I brought it from abroad, and I lost a silver watch with a gold chain, and a silver seal, three dollars of the Zealand coin, and a Portuguese piece, and some shillings, I cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>Q. And you got dead drunk with all the property in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last observed this property in your pocket? - A. When I was at play in the afternoon; I made an enquiry who rented that room where I found myself in, and they all agreed it was a young woman, not very tall, a Scotch woman; I went and informed the constable of the parish of it, and he went and gave some notice of it; I don't know any thing of the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. We wish to ask him, if, when he left his friends, he was sober enough to know that he had his money then? - A. Yes, I am sure I had it then; but coming in the air, I was very hot, and the liquor overtook me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay any thing when you came away? A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what was in it? - A. No, I never opened it; I put it into a cupboard; she came back again about eight o'clock, and I gave it to her again.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Hatton-Garden: On the 27th of May, the prisoner at the bar came to the office, and said, she was robbed; she was very much in liquor; she said, a coachman had robbed her of fifteen guineas; the coachman was examined before the Magistrate, and was committed to be brought up the next morning; I went with her to tell her landlady to keep her sober till next morning, it was in East-Smithfield, in a court full of lodgers; I don't know whose house it is, I went only to take her home, as she was so much in liquor; I had no suspicion of her having robbed any body, she told me, first of all, she lived in Hermitage-street; going along in the coach, she asked me where I was going with her, I told her, I was going to see her home; she told me she had robbed a foreigner, she was very drunk at that time, and she told me she would give me a watch and two guineas to go back with her to the Rose, in Hatton-Wall; I said, I thought you told me you had no money; she said, she had got some at that house; when we came back to the Rose, in a coach, she went backwards; I saw the girl, the last witness, hand a parcel across to her, so I sprang in, and said, I insisted upon having that parcel, I brought it out into the tap-room, it was rolled up in a dirty handkerchief, and I told out forty guineas, two half guineas, and a watch, and I think 18s. in silver, three dollars, and a Portuguese piece; I asked the Magistrate to put the office seal upon it, which was done, and it has been there ever since, (produces it).</p>


               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, I know it by the seal and the string, it is an English made watch, and a Dutch paper in it, where it was cleaned, in Amsterdam; the gold was in a purse; these dollars are the same sort that I lost; these are my purses, one of them was broke, and I know it by the colour.</p>

               <p>I was sent for by the prisoner to take a coachman in custody, who had robbed her of fifteen guineas; I went to the Rose, in Hatton-Wall, and there the coachman was, and upon searching him, I found eleven guineas and sixpence, and three-pence in halfpence, (produces them); I took him down to our office, and I was bound over to prosecute the coachman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coachman confessed he took the money from me, and offered the constable five guineas to let him go.</p>

               <p>Witness. There was something similar to that; the coachman said, he would give me five guineas to let him escape.(The prisoner, in her defence, said, it was given to her by a country woman of her's).</p>
               <p>Brown. My Lord, she told me, when I was taking her down to Bridewell, that if she could find out this man, she would give him the money again, for it would do her no good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had it from another person? - A. No; she said it was a foreigner's money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say they were her own? - A. She did not say whether they were or not, but that he had taken the money from her; accordingly I took him to a little back room to search him, and he put his hand into his breeches pocket and pulled out eleven guineas, and sixpence in silver, and two-pence in halfpence; I took them both before the Magistrate, when she swore that the coachman had robbed her of 15 guineas; the prisoner was present at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When the girl made the charge against this hackney coachman, she was drunk? - A. Yes; and he both.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went into the room, he, instead of avoiding the search, pulled out the money from his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not attempt to say the money was her's, she could not swear to the money? - A. No, she did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220055"/>Q. You found no Portugal pieces or dollars upon him? - A. No, nor watch.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was her examination taken down in writing or not? - A. This was not before the Magistrate that I am talking about, but it was not in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Longden.) Q. Did the prisoner give any account how he came by this money? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from any body that he gave an account that it was his master's money? - A. Yes; from the man's wife; she was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

I told him if he would return me the watch I would not hurt him; he said, he had not a farthing in his pocket, he had paid it all away to where he owed it; I found it at a pawnbroker's in Holborn; I sent for a constable to Bow-street, and when he got to the Brown Bear, the constable asked him if he had got any money, and he said, yes; and he told out 25s. and a knife with two blades out of his pocket, and he gave me the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. What time passed from Graves's going in to that other person getting in? - A. About a minute; he had about fifteen yards to walk; the prisoner White came, and took a direction nearly opposite the house in the livery-stable gateway; I walked past the gateway to a street beyond it; I stood there, and could see the door, though White in the gateway could not see me; I observed the name of Hood on some premises opposite; I went and rang at the gate, and asked if those were Mr. Hood's premises; the porter came over, and remained with me on the opposite side of the street; when I supposed they had been in a quarter of an hour, I left the porter, and went to Mr. Eddington's, a coal-merchant at the next door; I knocked at the door; the maid came; I asked if any of the family were at home; she said there were not; I went in, and looked out at the stair-case window to see if they could get away backwards; I saw they could not; I then directed the porter to go and ring the bell of the door; the instant he rung the bell, White came out of the livery-stables yard; I came out on the front of the pavement, and could see White's attention; I saw his eyes directed to the man ringing the bell, on the instant of his ringing the bell; he mended his pace to a walk, and then to a walk and run, with eye over his shoulder at the man; I followed him, and caught him with my hands by the collar, and told him he was my prisoner, and endeavoured to force him back to Mr. Hood's house; a number of people came round, and I begged their assistance; somebody came out of Mr. Eddington's, and said they were going out backwards over their tiles; I ran down Mr. Yelloway's yard, and Graves was going from the head of one of the lighters, appearing as if he had hurt himself; there being a distance between the wharf and the lighter, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220057"/>round a plank and cried stop thief, he mended his pace, and ran up the stone steps into Chatham-square; about thirty feet from the top of the steps, there were a parcel of bricks, a number of people were coming, the prisoner got as far as the bricks, and was surrounded immediately, and secured; I took him round to Mr. Hood's door, where the spectator's had got the other prisoner; as I was taking Graves to prison, going through a court, I had hold of him, he made against the wall, as if he meant to drop something, I clapped my head over him, and he struck me in the face with a little crow, and dropped it immediately; I took the crow and put it against his face, and told him I would push it into his head if he did not go quietly; I took him to Newgate, and found nothing upon him but a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A carpenter and builder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Mr.Hood's house afterwards? - A. Yes; after I had secured the prisoner, I returned to the house, that was about a quarter after five; I sent a man to Blackheath, where I understood the family were, and Mr. Hood came immediately to town; I remained in the house till he came, and finding a number of drawers broke open, I compared this crow to the marks of violence on the drawers, and it exactly fitted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (White's Counsel.)</p>
               <p>Q. White was never in the house at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in his house in Blackfriars on the 5th of June? - A. I was; I went out between half past two and three o'clock, I left the house secure, the door was double-locked, and the key was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the house? - A. No; I returned between six and seven, I found the people about the door, the lock had been picked and broke open; I opened the door with the key, the gentlemen were all in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look over the house to see if any thing was taken away? - A. I looked over the things up stairs, and found every thing secure as I left it; three table-spoons, and three tea-spoons, that I had left in a small closet in the kitchen, when I returned, were tied up in a silk handkerchief on the kitchen-table. Mr. Hood's bureaus were all broke open, and his watch was taken out; I believe it to be a walking watch, a pedometer, I did not know he had such a watch in his possession; the constable has the spoons to produce.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I apprehended Salmon next door to the office, and took him to the back room, in custody with Bedell, he said to Bedell, you are a bloody rogue; he had a good mind to blow his brains out; Bedell said, he lent him two guineas.</p>
               <p>Sills. These boxes of tin have all separate marks; the marks of the boxes were missing; as I counted the boxes I made a chalk mark, which remains on one.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the boxes? - A. I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the tin plates? - A. Three pounds a box they are usually sold at.</p>
               <p>Chandler's defence. I went with Bedell; he said he had bought some tin at an auction; I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Salmon's defence. That man only throws the charge off himself to me. I know nothing of it; I went to the office myself; as soon as I got to the office the gentleman took me, and he ran away; I know nothing of the felony; that I put the things in the cart, I don't deny.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that deficiency in the parcel reserved for your own use, or in the parcel that you had packed up? - A. The deficiency was in those that were put back again, and the same with the patent silk; there were twelve pair in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the patent had he agreed for? - A. He had not agreed for any,</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity he had fixed upon for packing up? - A. He took out what he liked and laid them in a heap; when my back was turned to show him some others, he must have taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was that deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see those stockings again? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't understand you with respect to the white and patent silk stockings, there was a dozen of each; did he direct you to pack the whole dozen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with those that he did not order? - A. I made up the paper myself, and put it aside.</p>
               <p>Q. This paper you did not examine till two days after he had left the shop? - A. No; not till the third day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those things? - A. Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In the first place, are you quite sure he is the man? - A. I am very sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. He ordered you to pack up some stockings? - A. He ordered me to pack up the silk carefully by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many pair you packed up? - A. I really don't know; I know the whole amount of the stock that he looked out was 18l. odd.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only ground for your supposing he took those things is, that three days after, when you came to calculate your stock, there were five deficient? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted your shop was not shut up those three days? - A. No; certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And those things have never been found since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the parcels that you put back appear to you to be in the same state the third day, as when you put them back? - A. They were; I am sure they never had been opened.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am son of the last witness; I was in the shop at the time the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the time that he first called? - A. Yes; I was there the whole of the time, though not behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the second time? - A. No; he only called once.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, he did? - A. Yes; I believe he called on the Thursday morning first, and on the Friday morning the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. However you saw him both times? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the quantity of stockings that was shown him? - A. Yes; I am confident there were twelve pair in each bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bundles upon their being taken down, when you suspected some had been stolen? - A. My father did in my presence; there were three pair deficient in one bundle, and two pair in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of serving in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the interval of the time between his coming and choosing the stockings, and your examining them afterwards, had you taken down those bundles? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your father any other servant that serves in the shop? - A. He has not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You were in the shop the first time that he came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220062"/>Q. Your's is a shop of very good custom, I believe, and a great many people coming in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It happens in the hurry of business, when customers come into your shop, that you pull down a great many bundles in your anxiety to serve your customers? - A. It might have happened so, but these things I am positive were not taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. But in the hurry of business you or your father might have done it? - A. I must have recollected it, if it had been so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are certain you took down in that interval neither of those bundles? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) In the internal between your showing him these stockings and examining the bundles, had you shewn them to any body? - A. I am sure I never had, for they were patterns I intended to return, the patterns not being agreeable to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Is there any other servant in your shop? - A. There is a shop-woman attends occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. You have left somebody there, I take it for granted, to take care of your shop? - A. Yes; Mrs. Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. She serves occasionally? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, in the defence that I meant to have set up, I intended to prove an alibi, but was advised to the contrary; if I had not, I should have been able to proved myself to be near 100 miles off at the time, at Bury St. Edmund's; but it would have been a very great expence to have subpoened witnesses so far to give evidence; I think it is not necessary for me to trouble your Lordship long, and therefore shall say but very little; that I am innocent of the charge is all the defence I can make; it is not very likely that twelve gentlemen-remember, gentlemen, my life is at stake-it is not likely that twelve gentlemen, as honest men, would take away my like in such a case as this; a shop that is open to all comers and goers; the prosecutor said, three days afterwards he examined the parcels; is it possible, that upon such evidence my life is to be taken away? I shall trouble you no longer, gentlemen, you will remember my life is at stake.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Edwards: On the 3d of June in the afternoon, I was sent out upon some business about four o'clock; upon my return between five and six, I saw a great number of people round the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in before your master? - A. Yes, I was; upon seeing a crowd round the window, I immediately ran off home, and enquired of Mrs. Edwards what was the matter, and she told me the prisoners at the bar had cut the window; the boys were both then in the shop; I asked Greenhove how he came by them, one pair of buckles had been taken from him before I came in; he said, that as he was passing by the window, he perceived it was cut, and the buckles dropped out; that he had picked them up, and given them to the prosecutor, Mr. Edwards; I then asked if they were brothers, or related to each other, and they said they knew nothing of each other.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Edwards.) In what respect did these boys seem at all connected with each other? - A. They were close together, both their heads were contained within the compass of the square of glass, stooping with their hands very close to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon searching them did you find any thing by which the glass could have been cut? - A. No; a piece of glass was cut out, just room for a pair of buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it of a regular uniform shape, as if it had been done with a diamond? - A. No; it had been eased out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go away together? - A. Yes; in a close conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away? - A. No; they walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the buckles? - A. One guinea.</p>

It appears to be more a consideration what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220063"/>shall be done with those children, than as to their guilt or innocence; I am afraid you must say guilty, and I will endeavour to do something with them; there is a society would be very glad of them.</p>

Bank Note in it, four guineas in gold, 5s. in silver, and upwards, I cannot tell how much, I believe there were six or seven guineas in all; it was a green silk purse; when I accused her of it, she denied it strongly; she went across the road to the corner of shepherd-street; I was going to strip her, but I thought it was not decent in the street, and I gave charge of her to two watchmen, one was a private watchman, the other a parish watchman; the private watchman gave up the charge to the parish watchman, and they let her go; I did not see her again till she was taken this week; I went to the watch-house, in the first place, and complained against the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her again? - A. At Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your purse or your effects again? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she is the person? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in her company? - A. Not two minutes before she committed the robbery; it was not half an hour altogether; I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion was it you saw her at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220064"/>Marlborough-street? - A. She was taken, I believe, for robbing a chimney-sweeper.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you the parish watchman? - A. No, the private watchman; employed by the inhabitants of Bond-street; I went down where he was, and he told me that she had robbed him of his purse and money, and he told me to take charge of her, and to take her to the parish watchman, and she told him and me to strip her in the street, that she had not a farthing about her; then this gentleman said, he would not wish to strip her in the street, and the other watchman came up, the parish watchman; I told him he would take charge of her, that it was too far out of my beat, and I could not stay any longer, and the parish watchman said, he would take charge of her; I knew no more of it from that hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Jones that night? - A. Yes; while he was along with that woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he was sober or not? - A. I took him to be sober.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed in the sugar-house? - A. Yes; he brought a couple of hoops and heads to head up a hogshead, he is a cooper's labourer.</p>

               <p>Q. Ask him whether the man did take any sugar, or whether he only looked at it, laid it down again, and went away? - A. The first time, when he took out the handful, he threw that down.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Pyecroft). What do you call that sugar? - A. It is what we call headings, it is manufactured sugar, but not in a finished state.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - A. About 3s. I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the washings or scrapings of the sugar? - A. No; it is the wet part of the sugar, when it is taken out of the moulds; this man has come to our house as a cooper's labourer very frequently, 4 or 5 times a day sometimes, to bring hogsheads.</p>

               <p>Q. When it was snatched from you, did you see him snatch it? - A. I felt the snatch, and then I saw his hand go with the chain in it, he dropped it, and I picked it up.</p>


               <p>Q. Did he get away from you? - A. Yes; a little way, but I never lost sight of him, I gave the chain to an officer, and he is not come yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it is the same chain that you have described? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else besides halfpence?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220068"/>- A. No; only some saw-dust among them, it was dirty and greasy; the halfpence, if they had been good, would have been worth four pounds, five shillings, and nine-pence; I did not search the prisoner, I took him to the Compter; the key of the house was found in the privy of the White-horse; Wainwright and King, and I, went to the house, and searched it, and found the implements for coining; we got in by the key that was found in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not search the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the prisoner's hands? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. They were quite clean, were they not? - A. No, quite dirty all over; there were a pair of dies fixed, I found a halfpenny between them, (producing it); it corresponds with the dies.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a patrole in Chick-lane; I sat in my box, I heard a bullock come down, and somebody coming after it, between one and two o'clock, it was a month ago last Monday; I looked out and saw the bullock, and a man coming, and I thought the man did not drive it as if he was driving it right, he did not go after the bullock as if he belonged to it, he did not wish to turn it, that made me stop him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he driving it fast or slow? - A. Pretty fast down Chick lane, from Smithfield; I knew he had no business to drive it that way; I drew my cutlass and ran after him, I called out to a man below, stop that man, and he called out, stop that bullock; I said, never mind the bullock, stop the man, the other watchman let the bullock pass him, and stopped the prisoner; we jumped on the man at once; I said, there is a number of false badges, let me look at your badge; they are numbers they wear on their arm, granted by the Lord-Mayor, the watchman looked, and said, that is a false badge; I said, who do you work for, and he said,

            , so accordingly I said, if you work for Stevy Player, go along with me, it is very well, if you don't, I will take care of it; I called another watchman to go with me for fear he should be rescued; I took him as far as the Three-tuns, and there I stopped, and said, I would go to Stevy Player; there was a man with a drove of beasts, he said, that is the man I work for, I asked the man if he did, he said, yes; I asked the man his name, he said, Porkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked the prisoner his name? - A. Yes; he said his name was Porkey; I said, then you are brothers, are you, and the other man said, no; with that I said, I thought you were brothers, being both of a name; the prisoner then made off, my partner and I ran after him, he ran among the beasts two or three times, and dodged me; I met him, and then he had a hedge-stake in his hand, and made a stroke at me with it; I made after him again, and met him again, and he struck at me him, my partner has the badge, we let the beast go, we did not take any further notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know this to be a parcel of any yarn that was in the vat? - A. I am certain of it; I compared it, and it is the same kind of yarn exactly; I stood behind him a considerable time before I took hold of him, and saw him draw something out of the vat several times, and tuck under his coat, thought I did not see that it was yarn.</p>
               <p>Q. This is of very trifling value, I suppose? - A. The value is not more than 2s. but the object of Mr. Bolt in prosecuting, is, that we are repeatedly harrassed.</p>

I was coming across the wharf, and a great many people were standing by this vat; I was intoxicated in liquor, in passing through these people some of them hit me upon the head with this yarn, and told me it would serve my wife for a mop; and I told them to take it themselves, and then I was laid hold of; it is the first time I ever had any thing laid to my charge; my master has been waiting here ever since Wednesday morning, that I worked for four years; and my serjeant, that I have been in the regiment with six years, but we did not expect the trial to come on after six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Last Friday morning but one, the 17th of this month, Mrs. Evans came to me, I got up immediately; she told me she had been robbed; I went with her to a private house in Fryar's-alley, and searched the house; I went up as far as I could go, and found the prisoner at the top of the stairs, he was standing upon the stairs with a bundle upon his knees; I brought him down stairs, and Mrs. Evans said, that was the man that had lodged with her, and that that was the property that had been taken from her house; after that I saw the property examined, I searched him, and found in his pocket a pair of shoes and buckles, and various articles, and a watch in his breeches pocket; he said, it was not his, it belonged to Harper, and the clothes he was dressed in; he had on a coat, waistcoat, shirt, breeches, and stockings, belonging to Harper, he told me they were his property; Harper was sent for, he was a long while coming, and I took him to the Compter; these are the goods, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How far is this house from where Harper lodged? - A. About four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went to him, he told you immediately that all these things were Harper's? - A. Yes; he readily acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Harper. This is my watch, I know it by the chain and seals, and maker's name; here is a black kerseymere waistcoat, and a pair of nankeen breeches, three shirts, one coat, a pair of black velveteen breeches, a piece of printed cotton for a gown, a pair of nankeen breeches, one pair of stockings, four muslin neck-handkerchiefs, and two cotton waistcoats; they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What should you expect for all these things, if you were to fell them? - A. I should suppose, about six pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. All this property was taken upon the prisoner about four hundred yards from where you lodged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive information that you had been robbed? - A. Half past six in the morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by edging? - A. To take the rough edge off; and here are some unedged, (producing them).</p>

               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. These blanks are for shillings? - A. Yes; I found on the table, in the same room, this blank (producing it), lying with a bit of sand paper over it, begun to be rubbed, and the sand paper was lying over it, with these three or four sixpences, which appear to be damaged, and were lying on the table; in the drawer, in the same table, I found a quantity of blank sixpences, which are in the possession of Ferris, who will produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the edge of the table? - A. It was rubbed, but we have the drawer here, which Mr. Ferris will produce; I found these scales in a cupboard in the same room, with these blanks in them, which are not in so finished a state as those that I produced first; and upon a table in the room where Mrs. Paget was, I found these blanks tied up in a handkerchief and in this paper, which Mrs. Appletree said was her handkerchief? these are blanks just cut out, neither the edge nor the surf of the copper taken off at all; I then had them secured; I went up stairs, and in the two pair of stairs front garret, there was a turning lathe fixed complete.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of that lathe? - A. To round the edges of metal; in that room were these two bowls with blanks, which appear the best part of them to be edged.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220077"/>Q. These bowls of blanks, are they for shillings too? - A. I have no doubt, in my mind, that they are to be made into shillings with colour; in searching these blanks, I found three that bear the impression of the saint head of a shilling of King William's, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think these are blanks for shillings? - A. I think by the head on them, that they are for shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why do you suppose it is rather the head of a shilling than the head of a halfpenny? - A. Because I have compared halfpence with them, and have never seen any like it; in the room where the lathe was, there was a narrow weaver's loom, but nothing appeared from that, that it had been used lately; I have seen many, it was fixed in the front of the window, and the lathe at the back part against the wall, so that it had all the light of the window upon it; the loom was very dusty, it did not appear to have been used lately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any kind of webb, or any thing of that sort in the loom? - A. The work had been cut out, and the hand-roll was loose, and the work too, there was silk in it, but not in that form a weaver's loom is when at work, the hand roll had been let go to cut that work that had been formerly made, but nothing appeared to have been used that day at lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the loom and the lathe were fixed in such a manner, as to allow the persons at the opposite room to see the lathe? - A. No; they could not, on account of the loom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else that looked like the carrying on of weaving? - A. None; in the back carret, there was a vice which is used to bend any thing, a common standing vice, it stood against the edge of the back window frame; in the one pair of stairs room, that was empty, except some clean saw-dust.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of saw-dust in the coining of silver? - A. The clean saw-dust is used, if they rub them dry, because, if it was greasy, it would make them appear too black; for the halfpence, it is always oiled, but for silver it is always clean, and to keep them from scratching in the manner they would, if they were put in any thing else. I then came down stairs again, and going into this front room, I desired Mrs. Appletree to let me search a box in that room, she gave me the key, and I did search in that box; I found these, I think there are forty six finished shillings, and I scratched one, by order of the Magistrate, to shew whether the metal looked like this in the rough; in that same box, I found some farthings coloured, and these halfpence in that same box, (producing them), and in the same box a pair of blank dies for cutting out the blanks; there is no impression upon them; I then searched a cupboard in the room that we went in first, and in the bottom of that cupboard lay these two cloths(producing them); this had received some liquid of some kind, here is what I scraped off of one, Producing it); that I did in the presence of Mr. Wife; when rubbed, at the time they were apprehended, produced one of these blanks to the colour of silver; I did it by the order of the Magistrate; it was then wet, it is now dried.</p>
               <p>Q. The cloths were moist when you tried them? - A. Yes; from the person of Mrs. Appletree, I took this half-crown, (producing it), it was in her mouth; I desired her to pull it out, which she did; it is a bad half-crown; the prisoners were then secured, and I saw all these things brought out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a cutting engine? - A. Yes;(produces it), I saw it in the cellar, but left Wray and Blackiter in possession of it; they will tell you all about it; the use of it is to cut out blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular smell in the house? - A. Yes; I told the officers of it immediately; in the bottom part of the house was a smell which wherever there has been coining going on, it is like it; the windows were secured with a gimblet in one, and a piece of an iron candlestick in the other, and the door was locked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of smell is that? - A. Where any kind of aqua fortis is used, it will immediately throw such a smell that the persons going in directly may catch hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hands of the men? - A. Their hands were as if they had recently been at work, very dirty, and they themselves in a heat without their hats or coats.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What kind of dirt? - A. As if they had been handling of metal; as for the women, I did not, till after we had been a long time there notice any thing about their hands; I cannot tell whether they had any thing to do any otherwise than their ordinary business; there was no kind of resistance from the men or women, and nothing but the greatest civility from all the prisoners that we could with for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whose house it was? - A. Yes; Appletree said, that was his wife, and hoped we would leave her there; I believe he told me, he paid a guinea a month, but his landlord is here; the landlord came into the house while we were there, and wanted us to persuade Appletree to give up the key; and it was during that conversation that I think he said he gave a guinea a month for the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not another woman in the house? - A. Yes, the servant maid; she was discharged before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any business carried forward in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220078"/>this house, that you perceived? - A. None, but that loom up stairs; Mr. Appletree said before the Magistrate -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was not examination taken in writing? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your examination taken in writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The clerks were there for the purpose of taking examinations, were they not? - A. Yes; they took the examination from the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, they did not take the examination of the prisoners likewise? - A. I do not know that they do; they did not of these prisoners in writing, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it you heard him say? - A. When I was producing the blanks and counterfeit shillings, he said, they were for whip handles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. From the appearance of the women there was nothing by which you could collect that they had been doing any thing more than the ordinary business of women about house? - A. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mrs. Padget, at the time you came in, was employed in dressing the child? - A. After I had been in, she had a child, and the mother had a child; I did not see any one act done by the women but going in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. Each of them had a child? - A. Yes; Mrs. Padget is mother to Mrs. Appletree.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your asking for the key of the box, Mrs. Appletree gave it you very regularly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this loom, there had been evidently work there? - A. There was some silk in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Reynolds is a <rs id="t17960622-60-deflabel347" type="occupation">weaver</rs>

               <p>Q. And the loom was placed so as to receive the front light? - A. Yes; it must be so for weaving.</p>
               <p>Q. The right way in which a loom ought to be placed for the purpose of working it? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Weavers work very often without their coats? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These blank dies are much too large for coining either a shilling or sixpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this stuff that you scraped off, have you the blank upon which you made that experiment? - A. No; it was kept by Mr. Wife; I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how long it keeps its colour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Were his hands in a condition that you would have expected from a weaver? - A. No; and his coat and hat were in the room below, where he was taken, and not up in the room where the loom was.</p>

               <p>I am an officer: On Wednesday the 8th of June, I went to Rose-lane, with four other officers; before me not to the house we separated, Ferris and I to the back part of the house; and after we had been there seven or eight minutes, I observed two men with their sleeves up in the house, that we stood at the back of; they were in the room where the silver was; I saw one of them take up a paper parcel, as if he took it off the table; he came in sight of the window, and both of them began to put down their shirt sleeves; (produces a paper parcel with a great number of unfinished sixpences); I then said to Ferris, we are right, I dare say Armstrong has got into the house; then we got over the wall on the inside; I dare say it was nine or ten feet, and not above four or five on the outside; the back-door was open, we went in; Armstrong had the three men in custody, and this paper parcel, which I believe was the one that I saw in the hand of one of them, I can't say which, I went to the cupboard, and found these sixpences unfinished in this paper parcel; in the same cupboard where I found that paper parcel, on the left side of the fire-place, I found this, but I can't say what it is, (produces a hard white substance); I cannot say whether it is arsenic or not; and in the same room I found this blacking pot, with this blacking in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A common blacking-pot that they black those with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you know that blacking is used in the coining of silver? - A. Yes; to take off the brightness after it is finished; in the front room, upon the same floor, this bottle was found by Armstrong, in the presence of Mrs. Appletree and me; he gave it to me and said, he had a cold, and wished I would smell it; Mrs. Appletree immediately said, it is nothing but a small beer bottle; when I smelled it, I found it was not small beer, it was aqua fortis; to be further convinced I put some in my hand, and I called Armstrong to witness it; it is not all out of my hand yet, it comes off with the skin; (the bottle handed to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>I was in company with the rest of the officers, Armstrong and Blackiter; I went to the front door, after knocking a minute or two, the door was opened by Appletree; we went into the back room, and there were the other two men at the bar; we secured them; I then went to the cellar-door, which I opened, and went down; there was a cloth which is here, hanging before the cellar; there was a large press fixed, with a candle on each side a-light; I then turned myself round upon my left, and there I saw a cutting press fixed, which is here; there was a piece of candle and a candle stick fixed at the cutting press, but it was not a-light; I found these pieces of cecil on one side of the cutting engine, and these plates on the other; I found a great quantity of copper blanks in the cellar for half crowns,(producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the cutting engine? - A. Yes; I observed the cutter in it, and compared it with some round blanks for sixpences which I found near it, and they corresponded exactly; I then went to the large press, and there was about five pair of dies by the side of the stamping press for halfpence; one pair was fixed in the press; I found a large quantity of blanks and a few halfpence struck, (producing them,) and some mis-struck heads for shillings, (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing between the dies? - A. I found a halfpence, (producing it); I compared it with the dies, and they matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The dies that you found fixed, were dies that would stamp nothing but a halfpence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were exactly fixed as if they had been at work? - A. Yes; it appeared so.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you found several other dies near this press, which, from the candle, you judged had been at work, there were no dies for either shillings or sixpences? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. And that appeared to have been at work from the candle, and that sort of preparation? - A. Yes;</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know, that a cutting engine is made use of for a variety of purposes? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. That stamping-press, where you found these dies fixed, they can take out and put in what dies they chuse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The same press, with a proper die, would answer for silver as well as for copper? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. There are no dies which correspond with these shillings of King William's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Armstrong.) Q. These forty-six finished shillings, how were they in the box? - A. Wrapt up in a piece of soft paper, the same paper that they are in.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was in the box besides? - A. some counterfeit halfpence and farthings, and some clothes belonging to Mrs. Appletree; and a damaged die or two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. You, who are conversant in these things, I would ask, whether there is, in what is produced here, a complete set of instruments for silver coinage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. About the turning lathe that you found, that might be used in making whip-tops, or any round thing that is made? - A. Yes; they are actually used in a vast number of manufactories in Birmingham, and London likewise.</p>

               <p>I went to the prisoner's house with four other officers, and was let in by Appletree; I acquainted him I had a warrant to search the house; he was secured with the other two men; I saw them in a back room on the right-hand side, without their coats, and without their hats, they all three appeared in a very great heat; I went down stairs with Wray, and found a stamping-press, with candles a-light, which I left in the possession of Wray; I found some counterfeit halfpence in a box, finished, up one pair of stairs from the cellar, which were coloured and finished, the key was in the possession of Mrs. Appletree, and some farthings in the same box, which I have had in my possession, Wray had the dies and press; I saw the different apparatus which has been produced.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe their hands? - A. From their hands, they had been very recently at work; and, at the fly, it is necessary to have three people at work, one to seed, and the other two to pull, and then it receives the impression.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That halfpenny, when you took it out, was not in a situation in which it could circulate? - A. No; I found a great deal of dirty saw-dust, and a few halfpence by the side of the press on the one side, and a great quantity of blanks on the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Look at these finished ones;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220081"/>do they correspond with the impression upon the die? - A. Exactly.</p>

               <p>I found this bottle of liquid, and this net up stairs, and this pot (producing a large iron pot); the liquid, in this bottle, is some that I took out of the pot; they boll the halfpence in the liquid, in a net, to change the colour of the halfpence, to make them fit for circulation; and I found two blanks cut out for sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Armstrong). Are these things compleat for the coining of halfpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these halfpence, and see if they are counterfeit? - A. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in such a state as they might pass? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where did you find these halfpence? - A. In a box, of which Mrs. Appletree gave me the key.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any halfpence fit for circulation found in any other place besides the box of Mrs. Appletree?</p>
               <p>Ferris. Q. There were two, in a paper that was found in Reynolds's pocket, (produces it); it contains blanks for farthings or sixpences.</p>

               <p>Armstrong. This is counterfeit, and is in a state of circulation, which I found in Reynolds's pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How many of the same kind may you now have in your pocket? - A. I might have a dozen in a day in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Richard Appletree's defence. I am guilty of this but not of the other.</p>
               <p>Reynolds's defence. I had not any thing at all to do with it; I had removed my loom into his room; it had been there three weeks; I never saw this young man do any thing of that sort; my wife being ill, and I getting in liquor, and being uneasy in my mind, I did not see him at work at all; I was coming down stairs with my hat under my arm and my coat, and hearing the gentlemen say they had a warrant, I thought it was a warrant that my wife had sent against me, and I ran into that room to hide myself.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I called to see Mr. Appletree's wife; I have lived with Mrs. Paget these twelve years, and as she had this child, she asked me to call that day to help her carry the child home; I have had the child in my care for these two years.</p>

               <p>Q. How did these people work the press, I understand there should be three? - A. There should be one to feed the press, and two to pull, but two might work the press, only it would be more tedious.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any candle in the cellar, or appearance that any body had been at work? - A. None; there was a flap would lift up and let light enough in without a candle; there were drops of candle on the press, and it was warm as if it had been recently worked.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Prescott and Co. No. 62, Threadneedle-street: On the 7th of May, I paid a draft of 92l. upon Messrs. Prescott, drawn by S. Cundell; Mr. Cundell keeps cash at our house, I don't know the person to whom I paid it; I gave a Bank note of 25l. No. 8858, dated the 10th of December, I believe, 1795, I have got the note, and another Bank Note for 25l. No. 258, dated the 22d of March, 1795.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Cundell's hand-writing? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have been giving an account of the transaction from that book, is that the original entry? - A. It is the first entry made of the transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. Made by yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that entry is the number 8858, entered as dated 1795? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it is the note? - A. Because it is taken down in another book, before it is paid away by me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that book here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The No. 258 is the date of that entered? - A. No, it is not; it is not our custom to enter the date, I speak of the dates from taking them down the night before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that note to be the note you paid away? - A. I believe it to be the note by the number and the date, (reads the book); 20l No. 8858, 25l. No. 258, and 42l. in money, making 92l. the amount of the draft.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Do you mean this, that you received only three Bank notes, two of which were 5l. the other 25l.? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say, upon this very book that there appears to be any memorandum that a 25l. note was received of Mr. Berry? - A. There was 35l. received.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you shew from the book any specific memorandum that any Bank note was received? - A. There is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220084"/>Q. Did you not tell Mr. White last Sunday se'n-night, you could not recollect whether you received a 20l. a 25l. or a 30l. note of him? - A. I told Mr. Berry I received 35l. in Bank notes that day, and that there was a 25 and two fives.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you state that you could not say whether it might not be a 20l. or a 25l.? - A. I said, there was a 25l. and two fives, or a ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you told Mr. White positively that you received a 25l. note? - A. I did, to the best of my recollection; I told Mr. White what I have told you now.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you told Mr. White positively that you received a 25l. note? - A. To the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a matter of recollection, if you recollect what passed on the 7th of May, cannot you recollect what passed with Mr. White last Sunday se'nnight? - A. I had not made a minute of what passed with Mr. White.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Last Sunday se'nnight you had a conversation with Mr. White? - A. Mr. White called at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any difficulty to ascertain the fact whether you received a 25l. note of Berry? - A. No, I had no difficulty; I believe I told Mr. White I received a 25l. note of Berry.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure of it? - A. He asked me if I had received any money of Mr. Berry; I told him I had received a note, or notes, and cash; I said, I might have received a 5l. note of him.</p>
               <p>Court. If you received a 5l. note, 5l. and 20l. would have been 25l.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember settling your accounts with Hammand, the last witness, at twelve at night, the 7th of May? - A. I do; but I cannot remember exactly the sum he accounted for that day; and Whether it was cash or notes I cannot recollect exactly, I believe there were some notes; they remained in the box till Monday afternoon, then I sent then to the banker's by Thomas Grindall.</p>
               <p>Q. What you sent were the same you received from Hammond? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt they were the same? - A. I have no doubt but what they were the same notes I received of Hammond.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any other notes in the box? - A. I don't know, but I believe not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure there were not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take down the sum you took to the banker's? - A. Yes, on the Monday; 76l. 20 guineas, a 20l. check, and the rest was Bank, but</p>
               <p>What it was I cannot tell exactly; seven light guineas were returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gardener. Q. How many parties have access to that box besides yourself? - A. My father, Hammond, and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your father here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know what you put in on the Saturday night? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you sent 76l. to the banker's on Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there to this box? - A. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. And had you the custody of the key from the Saturday to the Monday? - A. I cannot say; sometimes my father has.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Does your father live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Your father might have the key; - A. I believe he had not; but I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any means to ascertain the notes you received from your clerk? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You neither entered them at the time you received them or the time you sent them to the banker's? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Turn to your book, and look at the 9th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that your own entry? - A. It is 68l. 13s. which consisted of a draft drawn by Williams, upon Harper, for 20l. a Bank note, No. 504, the 5th of April, for 5l. No. 6921, 1st of April, for 5l. and No. 8858, 10th of December, for 25l. with 13 guineas in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return him any? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. The 10th of December, in what year? - A. The entry itself is No. 8858, 10th of December, for 25l.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no year upon the book? - A. No; we never put down the year in the book that it is entered in; if it is not in the same year, we usually put it down; it must have been December, 1795.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220085"/>Q. You have no memory of it but from that book? - A. No other whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot venture to swear that it was of that year? - A. I cannot certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Forsier.) Q. Look at your book; who made that entry? - A. I did; No. 258, 22d of March, 25l. No. 8858, 10th December, 25l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. That other entry, in the rough book, is of the same notes that you have there entered? - A. Yes; we received no notes of that number that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what year were those notes dated? - A. I don't know that I have got the year; one was 1795, and the other 1796.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I have discharged the notes in my waste book with the same number that I have taken them down here; and we did not receive any other notes of that number that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not discharge a note of that number of the year 1793? - A. I cannot; I believe I can prove there are not two notes of the same year the number the same; there is a person in Court that will prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe every Bank note has the date of the year, as well as the day of the month? - A. Yes; but it is not the custom to take them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Bank clerk? - A. No; a banker's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear the Bank don't make out notes of the same date and the same number, except the year? - A. No; I leave that to the other party to do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Have you these Bank notes? - A. Yes; (produces them).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. A Bank note, however dishonestly come by by one person, may go through twenty hands in the same day? - A. It is not impossible that it may go through so many, but it is not likely.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you, as banker's clerks, make memorandums of Bank notes, but a great many individuals don't do it? - A. It may be so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gardner. Q. Did you make any other payments? - A. Yes; to Price and Son, thirty odd pounds the same day; and, I believe, within an hour.</p>

I have very little acquaintance with him; I was there last Sunday was a week, and I went to Mr. Gilbert's along with Mrs. Berry, where Mr. Hammond was clerk; I asked Mr. Hammond and Mr. Gilbert both, if they kept any regular entry of their Bank notes that they received before they sent them to their bankers, and they told me they did not enter the numbers down; and I asked them, if they knew whether they had taken a note of Mr. Berry to the amount of 25l.; and Mr. Gilbert and Hammond both said they could not swear that they had.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did Mr. Hammond say so? - A. Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did any thing further pass about any other Bank notes? - A. No; for I did not know the nature of the business when I went there; Mr. Hammond said, he could not take upon him to swear that they took a note of that sum of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years have you known Berry? - - A. About seven or eight years; I believe, he is a <rs id="t17960622-66-deflabel381" type="occupation">grocer and hop merchant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Are you very correct in your memory as to what passed between you and Hammond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that the precise words were as you have stated? - A. Yes; I understood it to be about a Bank note that was forged.</p>
               <p>Q. As Mrs. Berry was with you, it is very odd you should suppose it to be about a forged Bank note? - A. Mrs. Berry, I believe, did not know otherwise herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any examination took place, before Hammond was known to be a witness by any examination, you went to him, yet not knowing what he was accused of; then how could you guess Mr. Hammond was the man to apply to? - A. He had had an examination on Saturday night at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. And did Hammond appear at that examination? - A. I believe, either Mr. Gilbert or Mr. hammond did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go, professedly, to talk to him, that you might afterwards give evidence for the prisoner? - A. No, I did not; I never thought of coming here at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Berry did not acquaint you that she meant to make use of you as a witness? - A. No; I went to know if he had taken any minute of the notes, and if he could swear that he received a note of 25l. of Mr. Berry.(The prisoner called eight other witness, who gave him a good character).</p>
               <p>Court. I think there is no occasion to call any more witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I have, my Lord, two dozen more upon my brief yet uncalled.</p>

               <p>Q. What appeared to be his complaint? - A. A putrid fever; I gave him a clyster on Thursday night, and nothing but congealed blood came from him; there was a bruise upon his right breach, and a yellow mark about his stomach, but I cannot tell whether that proceeded from a blow or not.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surgeon in Kentish-town: I saw the deceased before his death about ten days and upwards; on the 6th of June when I first saw him, he complained of some pain about his chest, and some about his head; he requested to be bled; I told him at that time there was no particular occasion for it; if it encreased the next morning, he should be bled; the next morning he was better, and I did not see him again till Saturday, when he was seized with a violent bleeding at the nose; he lost a pint, or a pint and an half of blood; that was on Saturday the 11th, and at that time he had a putrid fever; and he continued so; on Wednesday the bleeding came on again, and he had all the appearance of a putrid fever at the time he died.</p>
               <p>Q. And not from any other cause? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Did not two other surgeons attend? - A. Dr. Rowley attended him, and Mr. Cowper, and it was our opinion that there was no symptom by which we could say but that he died of a putrid fever.</p>

I left it with my wife when I went out the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How many doors are there to your house? - A. Three doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person up in the house? - A. No, my wife came to bed after me; very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not alarmed till six o'clock in the morning, except by this cat's story? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 4th of April, was not it? - A. When I went to bed, it was the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it light? - A. I suppose, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to say then, whether it was broke open in the night, or after day-light? - A. I cannot say, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. The Bank note you trusted with your wife after ten o'clock at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What she did with it, you know nothing, but from herself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did there appear to be the marks of the feet of more than one person? - A. Yes, two or three; it appeared to me, that in coming down the cellar they had slipped some little way.(Mr. Raine desired the prosecutor to send for his wife).</p>

               <p>Court. (To Levi). Should you know it if you saw it? - A. Yes; I had it two months in my possession, and was going to change it several times for necessaries, it has got a great deal of writing at the back of it, but I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Is that it? - A. I believe that is it, without Mr. Griffiths has changed it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Looking at that note, you can take upon yourself to say that is the note he had from you? - A. Yes; he took it out of my drawer, with twenty-six guineas, I gave him the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. And that note you had from Hutchinson? - A. Yes; two months before he was in custody, we were going to set up a shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Griffiths). I believe you apprehended the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; on Saturday, May the 7th, in company with some more of the officers, Smith, Nowlan, and some others; I went to Hutchinson's house, No. 2, Hollis-street, Clare-market; when I came there, the house was shut up about seven o'clock in the morning; I saw a string in the middle of the door, I pulled it, and the door opened; I went up stairs, and up one pair of stairs, in the back room, Hutchinson and his wife, or his girl, were a-bed; I went into the back room, and desired him to get up, he got up, and in searching the place, I found between the bed cloath, this horse-pistol, and in a little trunk, close by the side of the window, this pocket pistol; two iron crows in the front room up one pair of stairs, rolled up in a woman's gown upon a chair; and in a table drawer in Hutchinson's front room, I found all these picklock keys, and at the same time, a box of phosphorus matches, and a box of gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to those keys, did you try any of those keys with Mr. Lovell's locks? - A. Yes; that key with the string to it unlocks Mr. Lovell's cellar door, a slap that opens into Butcher-row; Brown was taken by my fellow officers, in the same house, up two pair of stairs, Smith and Nowlan; and when we took them away. I took the young woman's word for appearing before the magistrate at twelve o'clock, but she did not come; about a week or nine days after that, I had a search warrant against the house for this Bank note, and I understood she had moved from there, the house was shut up through some further information; I found she lived in Shoe-lane; I went there and searched her place, and in the drawer of a looking glass was this 10l. Bank note, and twenty-six guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had got the 10l. note, did you at any time show it to Hutchinson? - A. Hutchinson at the office declared it to be his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not that taken down in writing? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, that no examinations were taken down of the prisoner at all before the Magistrates? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not, I was in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. But will you swear no examination was taken down in writing by the Magistrates at all? - A. I believe there was some, I cannot be positive, but I think there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. What day was this? - A. I cannot say, he said it was his note.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Levi). Q. Who lived in this house besides you and the prisoner Hutchinson? - A. A lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that lodger? - A. Brown and another man lived in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let those lodgings? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your house, or Hutchinson's? - A. My house.</p>

Not the least that I can remember; then Estwick came home with me, I told them I had but ten guineas, if they would call to-morrow, I would give them the rest; the next day, Estwick called in again, and I gave him ten guineas more, that was on Sunday; the next day, Hutchinson and Brown came, and Estwick and I gave them sixteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you delivered those skins into the possession of the officers; to whom did you give them? - A. I spoke to Mr. Thompson at Whitechapel Office, and told him I had got the skins, and then I took Thompson and Smith, the Officers, with me, and put the skins into a coach.</p>

            -examined Mr. Knapp. Q. Pray let us know a little how you get your livelihood? - A. I keep a sale shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in this Court? - A. Always upon honourable term, I can prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Always as an evidence for the Crown perhaps? - A. I get very little for my evidence, I never require any thing, I do it for the public good, because I might have brought half a dozen skins, instead of the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in this Court? - A. Twice before, and that was to deliver up 1000l. worth of property.</p>
               <p>Q. This thirty-six guineas was a fair price, was it not, for that quantity of skins, Mr. Honesty? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy them for thirty-six guineas, you who stand forward for the public good, when you know it is not a fair price? - A. I did it in hopes to bring forward 1000l. worth of property that Estwick was concerned in, to discover them for the good of the public, without see or reward.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before, for the good of the public, you informed Mr. Thompson of it? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220091"/>I had not seen the prisoner, during that time, that was three weeks, within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. So then the public good had the go-by for three weeks; you did not inform of it during that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you give any information at all, till you were charged with stealing some boots belonging to a gentleman at the other end of the town? - A. I did not know where they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Answer the question, it is a plain one, did you give any information of those skins, till yourself was taken up for stealing some boots? - A. I was taken up about those boots, and I proved them to be honest boots, I have got them at home.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you give any information of those skins till yourself was taken up for stealing some boots? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then you did not give information for the public good, till three weeks afterwards? - A. No, not for stealing a pair of boots; I had them hanging at my window, so that they could not have been stole, I may have had others, not knowing them to be stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, you may have others in your honourable shop; do you know any thing about any waistcoats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any charge against you of having stole some waistcoats? - A. No; I denied that, there were no waitscoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not that charge made upon you, that you had some waistcoats in your shop? - A. No; I had not</p>
               <p>Q. No certainly not, and with all this public good but was not somebody weeked enough to charge you with having some stolen waistcoats? - A. No; no such charge that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge made against you, respecting your having some waistcoats, the property on a Poland Jew? - A. I denied that.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not they make the charge against you? - A. Any body may choose to say that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was not there a charge of that sort against you? - A. No; there was no Polish Jew charged me with taking waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Nor a laced coat? - A. No; not that I had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. But found in your possession? - A. No; a Polander had a coat, but he had not it of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever that coat in your possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never in your life? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was this charge against the Polander; was he charged with having stolen a coat? - A. I don't know; there might have been such a thing, but I know of no coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What Polander are you talking of that might have a coat? - A. No one man in particular.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not give any information of this till you were in custody yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Durham? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A watchman you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being tried at Clerkenwall? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You were a witness against him, were not you? - A. No, to be sure I was not; that watchman was taken up concerning the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave evidence upon that occasion? - A. Not against the watchman; my heart alive, that man was taken up because he did not do his duty; what do you mean by abusing me, I did it for the good of the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell that watchman to keep out of the way? - A. It was my honesty to take every thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Brown asleep, drunk? - A. He was rather intoxicated, and laid upon the chair, when I paid the money to Estwick.</p>
               <p>Q. The two other times you had been at Hutchinson's lodgings Brown was not there? - A. When I went Brown was not there; and when they came the next day for ten guineas, he was not with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Lovell.) Q. Look at those skins? - A. These are black Spanish, made from goat's skins, they have my mark upon them, some of them by this lad, and some of them by myself; these are all of them mine, though they are not all marked; it is the custom of our business not to mark every skin, but one in a dozen, the outside one; I know them from their being of the same manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those that have your mark? - A. I suppose it to be about fifteen or sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Griffths.) Shew Lovell the note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (Looks at it.) I verily believe it to be the same that I left in the pocket-book that I gave my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to speak to it? - A. From some scribling on the back; I did not take an account of the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that foribbling the same as was contained upon the note in your pocket-book? - A. I verily believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, before the Magistrate, you were not certain of the note? - A. I believe it to be the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you certain of it before the Magistrate? - A. I did not swear to it, nor will I now, if it was an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. As to these skins. I need not ask you if thirty-six guineas as a fair price? - A. If I had bought them, I should not have thought so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220092"/>Mr. Knapp. It is only such honest men as Mr Nathan that would think so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who had you received the note from? - A. From a man coming into the shop; I don't know who he was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make that scribbling upon the note yourself? - A. It was so when I received it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you lose any money? - A. I lost the till out of the shop with, as near as I can guess, about five pounds.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson's defence. I know nothing at all of this; any other person in custody Mr. Nathan might have said the same of; that note I had two months before I was taken into custody, I had it from Bristol; and have had witnesses all last week to prove it, but they are now gone.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I was a lodger in Hutchinson's house, I never saw any of the property there; I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lock it up the night before? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220093"/>Yes, I did; in the morning when I opened the door, I saw two glass-cases which I have, and which hang on the outside, were taken down off the books in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house broke at all? - A. Only up in the dining-room; I got into the shop as usual; I found the stays all gone from the shop window, and I immediately ran up into the dining-room, and found the dining-room door forced open, and all the stays gone out of the dining-room; then I came down stairs and went to Holborn bridge, and let my wife know of it, and then I directly sent her to Bow-street, to have some bills printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of these things again? - A. Yes; one of the police officers came from Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, to inform me of a pair of stay, which I know to be mine; I saw them at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You had left this house in St. Clement's church-yard, by way of sleeping there in September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed your property in February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any idea from that time till the time of the robbery, of sleeping at St. Clement's? - A. No; I meant to sleep in the city, because the city making such improvements as they did, I could not so well sleep in St. Clement's church-yard.</p>

               <p>I am a married woman, I live in Harris-street, Blackman-street, in the Borough: One night, of a Wednesday or Thursday, I cannot say which, between nine and ten o'clock, I suppose, about two months ago, or ten weeks, I cannot rightly tell, my husband and I were going to bed, and I heard somebody lift up the latch of the door; my husband looked out at the window, and it was Mr. Hutchinson; Mr. Hutchinson came in, and another man was with him that is in custody now over the water, his name is Eastwick; not the other prisoner; Hutchinson said, I have brought a man here who has got some stays to sell, will you buy them; I told him it was too late; if he would stay till to-morrow we would go and look at them; he said, that gentleman was going away to-morrow; that he drove some coach, I cannot recollect what coach; he and Mr. Hutchinson said, if you like to leave them in my house, my house shall be at your service; and we went along with Hutchinson, and Eastwick went outside with the coachman, and drove the coach himself, and we went to Hutchinson's house, somewhere near the New Church in the Strand, but what street it was I do not know; we went up stairs, and Mrs.Hutchinson, and Mr. Brown, and another woman, were playing at cards; Mr. Eastwick went up and opened two glass doors where the stays were in a brown Holland bag; he brought the bag out and shewed me some stays, but nothing nigh the number that this gentleman says he lost; I asked him what he asked for them, I think he said 12 or 14 guineas, I cannot rightly say what sum it was; we agreed for 10, but I did not give 10 for them; we had but two guineas about us, and we gave him them, and begged of Hutchinson to pass his word for me for the remainder; he said, it was nothing to him; was it his property, if it was five times the money he should not be afraid to trust me, for be knew where I lived; we got away the stays the next day, they were tied up as we left them; Mrs. Hutchinson delivered them to us.</p>

               <p>Q. This was Mrs. Hutchinson's house, was not it? - A. Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair had you? - A. I suppose about 20 or 24, I cannot rightly say; I gave but seven guineas and an half for them altogether, for I found I had offered too much for them; I got but half a guinea by them after I had sold them; here is one pair of the stays in Court, that I kept for my own wear; the officer has got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Hutchinson's house was full of lodgers? - A. Yes; she always did keep lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. And Eastwick lodged there too, did not he? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Brown, all that you know is, that he was playing at cards with a woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And as to Hutchinson, all that you know about it is, that he brought this man, Eastwick, to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you bargained with Eastwick for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether Eastwick was a lodger there? - A. I don't think he was; I cannot rightly say whether he was or not.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 7th of May, I went in company with Griffiths, and the rest of my brother officers, to Hutchinson's house in Hollis-street, Clare-market; I apprehended Brown in the two pair of stairs, he was in bed with another young man; I told them I had an information against them for housebreaking, and desired them to get up; they got up, and while they were dressing themselves I found in a drawer in Brown's room these false keys,(producing them).</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know they are a part of the stays you lost? - A. In regard of the scoring of them, and the shape of them; they are cut out by my own hands; when I cut them out I mostly number them inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number? - A. I cannot say without undoing them; it is inside the lining, (cuts it open) this is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You make a great many stays in the course of a year? - A. 1700 pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always put the same mark, and make them in the same shape? - A. The marks are not regular.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear you have never parted with that pair of stays? - A. Yes; because I had but two pair of stays made in this manner, this is the first that ever was made with a bow in the front in this manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person engaged in your trade, besides yourself? - A. No; nobody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Benjamin there? - A. Yes; I saw her shove this bill of parcels under it; I asked her, in the presence of the prisoner, if it was her property, and she would not own it; then there was a Mr. Benjamin, her husband there; I asked him, and he said, he knew nothing about it, the prisoner did not deny that it was his room; I looked at the property, and searched them all, and searched the room for the wrapper, but I could not find it; then I took them to the office, and they were committed; I got the key of the room and went back again, and found a bill of parcels under the chair, which alludes to the remainder of the property.(producing them).</p>

               <p>Q. Is the shop part of the house? - A. The shop, and house, and warehouses, are all under the same roof, with communications from one to the other: on Friday the 17th of June, our warehouse was broke open, and entered at the two pair of stairs back window, that abuts to a timber-yard; I had not observed that window the evening before, it is a window that has never been opened since the warehouse was built; in the morning, between seven and eight, I observed it was forced in; we lost a great quantity of tea, from seventy, to about eighty or ninety pounds weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that you lost any? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of it again? - A. Yes; it is found, and will be produced in Court; the packages that it is contained in, some of our clerks can swear to; I don't know them myself sufficiently to swear to them.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 18th of June, at six o'clock, the first thing that took my attention was the lids off the cannisters, the cannisters out of their places, and every thing in confusion; some of the small cannisters were entirely emptied; on further examination, we found that the warehouse had been broke open by the forcing in a sash-window, which was nailed up; and in order to ascertain our loss, we weighed our stock of tea, when there appeared to be a decrease of eighty pounds, more or less of that tea, and three of these bags here are marked by me; tea is an article no man can swear to.</p>

               <p>Q. And particular by this window? - A. Yes; because that window fronts the stairs as you return down stairs; the next morning, about half past six, or not quite so much, I saw it was broke in; the window is two story high from the ground, he could not get in without a ladder, or being upon the premises.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of June, I was going from the Custom-House, to my lodgings, and when I got home, I missed my pocket-book; I went back immediately, and I heard it was stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the pocket-book about you, when you came from the Custom-House? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it taken from you? - A. No; it was about twelve o'clock at noon when I got home, I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>- BACON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was looking out at a window, and saw the prisoner pick the gentleman's pocket, and I called a person to stop him, and when he came back, he had dropped the book; I cannot say it is the same book that he took out of the gentleman's pocket, a boy brought it up to me, and said, that was the book he had seen him drop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my book, there are three bills of lading in it that I got at the Custom-House.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout do you carry that book? - A. In the outside pocket, it is worth 2s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going of an errand when I was taken.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

            , it is a book that has always been used in the business by the clerks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. There was a crowd of people about you? - A. The same as in general in such a public street as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner behind you? - A. I did not take any notice of having seen him before; I applied my hand to my pocket, and missed my book, and he was then a yard and a half, or two yards from me.</p>

               <p>Q. He gave it you the moment you asked him for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that book? - A. When the other clerk went away he left the book and I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for the master to give the books to his clerks when they have done? - A. I believe not.(The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called seven witnesses who gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Fletcher: Some time in the week preceding Sunday the 12th of June, I carried some of my things to the servant to wash. On the Monday morning they were gone, and the prisoner was gone; I went after him in order to recover my property; there was a person with the prisoner on the Sunday of the name of Webber, who had accidentally left his direction where he lodged, at No. 5, Derby-court, Piccadilly; upon that I concluded it was likely the prisoner would be there; I went after him, and when I got there and enquired where Webber lived, I suppose he had seen me, but he ran out of the court; I ran about two or three turnings after him, and took him in a stable-yard, I did not notice the street particularly; when I took him there was a person of the name of Limerick coming along, who went with him to Bow-street; he had two table spoons and some duplicates found upon him; Limerick belonged to the office.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fletcher. I believe the hat is mine, there is no mark upon it; I lost such a one; I selected from the duplicates such as I thought were my property; I delivered them to Andrews, and desired him to go to the pawnbrokers and order them to appear at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Andrews. I went to Messrs. Patmore and Berry, pawnbrokers on Ludgate-hill, with the duplicates; I think there were two or three; I delivered the duplicates to their shopmen, and they produced the articles at Bow-street.</p>

            , and several others, were tried this time twelvemonth, and the case was this: One Isdwell Isdwell was apprehended for forgery, and was committed to Clerkenwell prison, and detained there for felony till the 3d of April, on which day, the indictment charged, that the prisoners were unlawfully aiding and assisting the said Isdwell Isdwell, then being a prisoner in the said gaol, by virtue of a warrant of commitment, to attempt to make his escape. The prisoners were convicted upon this indictment; and after the verdict, two objections were made by the Counsel for them, First, that the statute did not extend to any case in which there was an actual escape, And secondly, that the indictment, upon the face of it, was informal, because it did not, in words, state that Isdwell ever attempted to make his escape. These two questions have been argued very fully before all the Judges; and, in the course of that argument, Mr. Knowlys, on the part of the prisoners, relied upon a case reported in Keilwey, 87. to support the objection which he had made to the indictment. The indictment in that case was for felony, in breaking the prison, and abetting and commanding the prisoner to go at large, but did not state that the prisoner actually did go at large. The decision was, that if there was no escape there was no felony, and the abetting and commanding did not import that there was an escape; but upon this case it is to be observed, that abetting and commanding to do an act are very different from aiding and assisting in the act, and, therefore, that case will not govern the present; a man may command another to do an act which is never done; where the act is done, the command precedes the act, and, therefore, the averment of a command does not simply a subsequent execution of that demand; but no man can aid or assist another in an act unless the act be done, and, therefore, the averment that the prisoner aided and assisted in the attempt necessarily implies that the attempt was made. It is impossible to make sense of the words, or to read them intelligibly, without saying, in this case, that there was such an attempt. Besides this, in the cases of the King and Glover, and the King and Manwood, both of which were (the indictment is stated in Tremaine) indictments against the Marshal and Wardens for escapes, and they stated, only, that the defendants permitted the prisoners to go at large, without alledging that they actually did go at large; and yet no objection was taken against either of those indictments. For these reasons, the objections to the present indictment have been overruled by the unanimous opinion of all the Judges. But it was also contended, on behalf of the prisoners, by Mr. Knowlys, that as there was an actual escape, this case did not fall within the 16th of

            . chap. 31. upon which the present indictment is founded. This objection ought to have been made upon the trial, and before the verdict; but in criminal cases, it is never too late to revise what has been done; and if, at any time, it appears that the prisoners were entitled to an advantage, though the objection may be made out of time, the Courts are always anxious to give the prisoners the benefit of the objection, and to find out some way in which they may avail themselves of it. The statute of 16 George II. enacts, "That if any person shall, by any means whatever, be aiding and assisting to any prisoner to attempt to make his escape, although no escape be actually made, in case such prisoner is attainted of treason, or felony, except petty larceny, in the warrant of commitment, he shall be guilty of felony and transported." The Judges are of opinion, that this case does not extend to cases where an actual escape is made, but must be confined to cases of an attempt without effecting the escape itself. It is made for the further punishing the persons who shall aid and assist persons attempting to escape, and it creates a new felony; but the offence of assisting a felon in making an actual escape was felony before, and, therefore, does not seem to fall within the view or intention of the Legislature when they made the act in question. Upon this ground, the majority of the Judges are of opinion, that the conviction is improper; but as the objection does not appear upon the face of the record, the Court can only assist the prisoners by <rs id="o17960622-1-punish476" type="punishmentDescription">

            ; the prisoner signed the transfer, and the prisoner's son, in his presence, signed the transfer, which was properly filled up; but as he wrote his name with a double S, it was required of him to bring an affidavit that he was the person described in the books with a single S, and therefore the broker did not pay the money, and the transfer was not witnessed, which according to the usual form of the Bank should have been done. It appeared also, by the clerks in the Bank, that dividends may be received at the Bank without being accepted, but there are positive orders that there shall be no transfer without, though with the stock-jobbers the transfer is too often made without being accepted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's Counsel made objections, first, that the transfer was not compleated, because it was not accepted, that was the transfer to Harrison; and secondly, that this transfer, which was made or attempted to be made by the prisoner and his son, was not valid, because it was not attested by any witness. These two questions were argued by Mr. Jackson, on behalf of the prisoner, before all the Judges. The first, as I observed is, that the transfer of the stock made to

                  William

            ; and if he had died before he had accepted it, yet the stock would have gone to his executors, as part of his personal estate; secondly, if

             had no stock, that would not vary this case; for the transfer forged by the prisoner is compleat on the face of it, and it imports that there is such stock to be transferred; if there was no stock in the name of 
               <persName id="o17960622-2-person922">

             the attempt to transfer such stock is more daring and impudent, but neither the forgery or the fraud are less complete. The other objection was, that the signing of a transfer of stock in the books kept by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, was not complete as a transfer until it was witnessed, but the Judges are all of opinion that a transfer is complete without such attestation; for the attestation is no part of the instrument, and is only required by a regulation of the Bank for their own protection. In the case of Bank notes, a regulation is required that the number of the note should be put at each end of it, but if the number be put at one end only there is no doubt but the note would be good, and therefore making a false note of that description would be a forgery. - Mostatt's case bears no resemblance to this; that was the case of a bill of Exchange for a sum under five pounds, and upon the face of that paper it appeared to every person who saw it, that it was not a bill of Exchange, but was absolutely null and void; but here the transfer on the face of it is complete, and no person who looks at that can collect from it that if it is genuine it would not be a complete transfer of the stock. For these reasons all the Judges are of opinion that the conviction is proper.</p>

            , a certain valuable thing, that is to say, a Bank note. There was a long correspondence, a great many letters were written by the prisoner, in which he endeavoured to work upon the fears of Mr. Oldham, with a view to extort money from him, and the result of the evidence was, that a letter was sent by the prisoner, signed with the letters R.R. which contained a threat to publish a libel on the prosecutor, Mr. Oldham. imputing to him the murder of one

            , unless Mr. Oldham would enclose a Bank note in a letter, addressed to R.R. and to be left at the Cambridge Coffee-house, the top of Newman-street, in Goodge-street; the letter says, "On the side of the bar, at the entrance of the coffee-room, is a bracket for letters, let it be placed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220104"/>there, between the hours of eleven and one on Thursday next. On that same day, a line shall be sent by a porter to your house to acknowledge the receipt." Upon this evidence, the Jury found the prisoner guilty, but the sentence was respited, in order to take the opinion of the Judges upon different objections, which have been stated by the Counsel for the prisoner. The Learned Judge, who tried that case, stated that he had directed the Jury to say, whether he had sent the letter of the 12th of January, and whether it did not contain a threat to publish a libel, imputing to him the death of Mr. Dolly. And the Jury were directed, that if they were of that opinion, to find him guilty of sending a letter to the prosecutor, threatening to publish a libel, imputing to him the murder of his master, in order to extort money.</p>
               <p>This case was argued before the Judges, on behalf of the prisoner; four objections were made to the conviction. First, that this was not a letter without a name. Secondly, that the letter did not contain a threat, or demand, so as to bring the case within the intent and meaning of the statute. 9 Geo. I. chap. 22, upon which this indictment is founded. Thirdly, that a Bank note was not a valuable thing within the meaning of that act. And fourthly, that supposing this case to fall within the words and meaning of that statute, yet, that it is the precise offence described by the statute of 30 Geo. II. which, by making it a misdemeanor only. is a virtual repeal of the statute of 9 Geo. I. upon which this indictment is founded.</p>

               <p>As to the first, whether it is with or without a name, is a simple fact, appearing upon the face of the letter itself, it is signed with the two letters R.R. which are so far from being a name, that no man can tell by looking at the letter only, whether it referred to any name, or what name it was.</p>
               <p>The second objection depends upon the true construction of 9 Geo. I. The words of the enacting clause are, "If any person, or persons, shall knowingly send"any letter without any name, subscribed thereto, or"signed by a fictitious name, demanding money, ve-"nison, or other valuable thing, he shall be adjudged"guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as in cases of"felony, without benefit of clergy." The statute speaks of a demand, generally, without requiring any particular circumstances, whether it is by letter without a name, or with a fictitious name, but the preamble recites, that several persons had associated, under the name of Blacks, and entered into confederacies, to support and assist one another in stealing and destroying the dear, robbing warrens, and other illegal practices, and have in great numbers armed themselves with their faces blacked, or in disguised habits, killed the deer, robbed the warrens, and have sent letters in fictitious names to several persons, demanding venison, and money, and threatening some great violence, if such their unlawful demands should be refused; and it was contended, by Mr. Jackson, for the prisoner, that the enacting clause ought to be restrained by the preamble, or at least so far that the demand must be direct and peremptory, and accompanied with a threat of bodily harm. Where the enacting clause of a statute refers to such offences only, as are contained in the preamble, it may be restrained by the preamble, but in this case it would be doing violence to very plain words, if it was so restrained. It is no uncommon thing for a statute to recite the cause of making that statute, and yet for the enacting part of it to embrace more general cases. If the enacting clause in this case were to be restrained by the preamble, it would refer only to where several persons are joined together in a confederacy, where the letter is signed with a fictitious name only, and where they demand venison or money, but a letter signed with or without a name, extending to a demand of any valuable thing, as well as of money or venison, and to all demands, by such letters, whethere accompanied with a threat of bodily harm or not, I agree that a mere request, such as asking charity, without imposing any conditions, would not come within the sense or meaning of the word demand; but here the demand is, as the Jury truly said, when they found a general verdict of guilty of sending a letter, threatening to publish a libel containing a threat to impute the death of his master. The Judges are all clearly of opinion, that it is a demand within the true intent and meaning of the statute, it is a demand of money or mony's worth, which a Bank note is, by means of holding out a threat to impute murder to the prosecutor, and to injure his same, and his character, and not a request of voluntary charity. That a Bank note was a valuable thing, at the time the demand was made, was rightly admitted by the Counsel for the prisoner; but it was contended that it was not so at the time of making the statute, because it was not a subject of larceny. The Judges are all of opinion, that if the thing demanded be valuable at the time of the demand, that is sufficient, though the thing demanded did not exist, or the value of it was not known when the statute was made; but in truth, a Bank note was a valuable thing at the time the statute was made, though it might not come under the denomination of goods or chattels, or be the subject of larceny, but it might at any time be turned into cash, and was to the owner of the value of the money for which it was given.</p>
               <p>The only remaining question is, whether the statute 9 Geo. I. upon which this prosecution is founded, was repealed. It was truly contended by Mr. Jackson for the prisoner, that if one Act of Parliament makes a particular case a capital offence, and a subsequent Act of Parliament makes it only a misdemeanor, the last act is a repeal of the former, and so it was decided in one Davies's case, in 1783, upon this statute, which makes it a capital offence to kill or wound any deer, in any park. The statute 16 Geo. III. chap. 30, having made that a misdemeanor only, was holden to be a repeal of the former; but if the two statutes can stand together, that does not apply here; the 9th Geo. I. extends to such cases only, in which there is an actual demand, and the 30th Geo. II. reaches cases which fall short of a demand, and includes letters sent with a view to extort money, though no demand is made. The consequence is, that none of the objections are well founded, and the conviction is right.</p>

            , spinster, and other goods the property of Susannah Gibbs, widow, in the said dwelling-house then being, burglariously did steal, take, and carry away, and that upon that indictment they were tried and acquitted. Thus they have pleaded in bar to the indictment which is now depending; to this special plea there was a demurrer upon the part of the prosecution, and that demurrer has been argued before all the Judges of England. On the part of the prisoners it was contended by Mr. Knowlys, that as the house mentioned in the two indictments, and the times mentioned in each indictment when the offence was committed was the same, therefore the offence was the same, and the acquittal on the former indictment was a bar to the present prosecution. He also defined burglary to be a felonious breaking of the dwelling-house and stealing the goods, or with intent to commit a felony, and relied upon two case in Kelynge.</p>
               <p>The question in this case is, whether the two offences described in the two indictments can be said to be the same; that there was only one act of breaking the house, and one felony at one time must be taken to be clear, but that does not decide the question. The crime of burglary is of two sorts, first breaking and entering in the night-time, and stealing goods there: secondly, breaking and entering in the night-time with intent to commit a felony, though that felony be not committed; the circumstance of breaking is common and essential to both, but it does not of itself constitute the crime in either, for there must be a larceny committed or a felony intended, without one of them the crime of burglary does not exist; and these offences are so distinct in their nature, that evidence of one will not support an indictment for the other; for example, if a man be indicted for breaking a house in the night and stealing goods, evidence that he broke the house and intended to steal goods, would not support the indictment. In the case of the present prisoners, as applicable to the indictment that is now depending, the intent to steal was not evidence to prove the first indictment for breaking and stealing the goods; and if the crimes are so distinct that evidence of one will not support the other, it is inconsistent with reason to say that they are so far the same that an acquittal of one shall be a bar to a prosecution for the other - neither do legal authorities support such a prosecution. - Two cases were quoted on behalf of the prisoners. In Turner's case, in Kelynge, it is stated, that

             was in the same burglary with James Turner, and there being 47l. of the money of one Hill, a servant of Mr. Tryon's, stolen at the same time, which 47l. was not in the former indictment. They would have indicted William Turner again for burglary, for breaking the house of Mr. Tryon, and taking thence 47l. the money of Hill. But the book says, we all agreed, that William Turner, being formerly indicted for burglary in breaking the house of Mr. Tryon, and stealing his goods and acquitted, he cannot now be indicted again for the same burglary of breaking the house; but we all agreed he might be indicted for felony, in stealing the money of Hill, for they are several felonies, and he was not indicted of this felony before, and so he was indicted; and afterwards I told my Lord Chief Justice Bridgman what we had done, and he agreed the law to be so as we had directed. - Now that case was no solemn judgment, for the prisoner was not indicted a second time for the burglary, it was merely a direction from the Judges to the officer of the Court how to draw the second indictment, and it proceeded upon a mistake, as I shall shew presently. If the Judges in that case exercised a little lenity before the indictment, which might have been more properly done after the conviction, much censure could not fall on them; but they proceeded on the ground that the prisoner having been indicted of burglary, in breaking the house of Mr. Tryon, he could not be indicted for the same burglary in breaking the house, he might be indicted for stealing the money of Hill. So in that case the Judges went upon the idea that the breaking the house and stealing the goods were two distinct offences, and that breaking the house only constituted the crime of burglary, which is a manifest mistake; it consisted of breaking the house and stealing the goods, and if stealing the goods of Hill was a dictinct felony from stealing the goods of Tryon, which it was admitted to be, the burglaries could not be the same; the fact was, the prisoner broke the house of Tryon, and stole the money of Tryon and Hill, at the same time; he had been tried for stealing the money of Tryon, and breaking his house; so that the prisoner's life in that case had been in jeopardy, but still the Judges held that he might be tried for stealing the money of Hill; and if no money of Hill had been stolen, probably the question would never have arisen in that case.</p>
               <p>The case of Jones and Beaver proceeded wholly on the case of Turner, and if the foundation fails, that case must fall also; but authorities are not wanting to shew the principle and foundation upon which a plea of antre-fait<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220106"/> acquits is grounded. Hawkins, 2d Book, chap. 35. section 3. says, "If the party were never known by the"name in the first indictment, he much question whe-"ther the prisoner could be found guilty upon it; and,"if he could not, it seems plain, that his life having"never been in danger by it, the acquittal upon it can-"not be any bar to a subsequent indictment." Foster 361, says, "It is clear, that if A. be indicted as prin-"cipal, and B. as accessary, and both are acquitted,"yet B. may be indicted as principal in the same of-"fence, and his former acquittal is no bar." Again, 362."If a person indicted as principal cannot be con-"victed upon evidence tending barely to prove him to"have been an accessary before the fact, which, I think,"must be admitted. I do not see how an acquittal upon"one indictment could be a bar to a second for an of-"fence specifically different from it." And, in the case of the King and Pedley, K.B. Trin. Term, 1782, which was an indictment for Arson, there were Counts for burning the house of Francis Perry, the house of

            , who demised them to a person of the name of L'Andree. It was, in fact, one and the same house, differently described in the indictment, as belonging to the different persons I have mentioned, except L'Andree, but there was no Count for burning the house of L'Andree. Upon this argument, the Court of King's Bench were of opinion, that as the house was in the possession of L'Andree, none of the Counts were proved; therefore, they gave judgment for the prisoner; but not being tried for burning the house of L'Andree, he was sent back to Bristol, and again tried, though he was acquitted.</p>

               <p>Now, to apply the principle of these cases, the first indictment is for breaking and stealing goods; if it was proved on that indictment that the prisoners broke with intent to steal the goods but had not stole them, they could not have been convicted by such evidence on that indictment. They have not been tried, nor were their lives ever in jeopardy for this offence of breaking the house with intent to steal the goods. For this reason, the Judges are all of opinion that the plea is bad, that there must be a judgment for the prosecutor upon the demurrer, and that they must take their trials upon the present indictment.</p>

               , and several others, were tried this time twelvemonth, and the case was this: One Isdwell Isdwell was apprehended for forgery, and was committed to Clerkenwell prison, and detained there for felony till the 3d of April, on which day, the indictment charged, that the prisoners were unlawfully aiding and assisting the said Isdwell Isdwell, then being a prisoner in the said gaol, by virtue of a warrant of commitment, to attempt to make his escape. The prisoners were convicted upon this indictment; and after the verdict, two objections were made by the Counsel for them, First, that the statute did not extend to any case in which there was an actual escape, And secondly, that the indictment, upon the face of it, was informal, because it did not, in words, state that Isdwell ever attempted to make his escape. These two questions have been argued very fully before all the Judges; and, in the course of that argument, Mr. Knowlys, on the part of the prisoners, relied upon a case reported in Keilwey, 87. to support the objection which he had made to the indictment. The indictment in that case was for felony, in breaking the prison, and abetting and commanding the prisoner to go at large, but did not state that the prisoner actually did go at large. The decision was, that if there was no escape there was no felony, and the abetting and commanding did not import that there was an escape; but upon this case it is to be observed, that abetting and commanding to do an act are very different from aiding and assisting in the act, and, therefore, that case will not govern the present; a man may command another to do an act which is never done; where the act is done, the command precedes the act, and, therefore, the averment of a command does not simply a subsequent execution of that demand; but no man can aid or assist another in an act unless the act be done, and, therefore, the averment that the prisoner aided and assisted in the attempt necessarily implies that the attempt was made. It is impossible to make sense of the words, or to read them intelligibly, without saying, in this case, that there was such an attempt. Besides this, in the cases of the King and Glover, and the King and Manwood, both of which were (the indictment is stated in Tremaine) indictments against the Marshal and Wardens for escapes, and they stated, only, that the defendants permitted the prisoners to go at large, without alledging that they actually did go at large; and yet no objection was taken against either of those indictments. For these reasons, the objections to the present indictment have been overruled by the unanimous opinion of all the Judges. But it was also contended, on behalf of the prisoners, by Mr. Knowlys, that as there was an actual escape, this case did not fall within the 16th of

               . chap. 31. upon which the present indictment is founded. This objection ought to have been made upon the trial, and before the verdict; but in criminal cases, it is never too late to revise what has been done; and if, at any time, it appears that the prisoners were entitled to an advantage, though the objection may be made out of time, the Courts are always anxious to give the prisoners the benefit of the objection, and to find out some way in which they may avail themselves of it. The statute of 16 George II. enacts, "That if any person shall, by any means whatever, be aiding and assisting to any prisoner to attempt to make his escape, although no escape be actually made, in case such prisoner is attainted of treason, or felony, except petty larceny, in the warrant of commitment, he shall be guilty of felony and transported." The Judges are of opinion, that this case does not extend to cases where an actual escape is made, but must be confined to cases of an attempt without effecting the escape itself. It is made for the further punishing the persons who shall aid and assist persons attempting to escape, and it creates a new felony; but the offence of assisting a felon in making an actual escape was felony before, and, therefore, does not seem to fall within the view or intention of the Legislature when they made the act in question. Upon this ground, the majority of the Judges are of opinion, that the conviction is improper; but as the objection does not appear upon the face of the record, the Court can only assist the prisoners by <rs id="s17960622-1-punish479" type="punishmentDescription">

               ; the prisoner signed the transfer, and the prisoner's son, in his presence, signed the transfer, which was properly filled up; but as he wrote his name with a double S, it was required of him to bring an affidavit that he was the person described in the books with a single S, and therefore the broker did not pay the money, and the transfer was not witnessed, which according to the usual form of the Bank should have been done. It appeared also, by the clerks in the Bank, that dividends may be received at the Bank without being accepted, but there are positive orders that there shall be no transfer without, though with the stock-jobbers the transfer is too often made without being accepted.</p>
                  <p>The prisoner's Counsel made objections, first, that the transfer was not compleated, because it was not accepted, that was the transfer to Harrison; and secondly, that this transfer, which was made or attempted to be made by the prisoner and his son, was not valid, because it was not attested by any witness. These two questions were argued by Mr. Jackson, on behalf of the prisoner, before all the Judges. The first, as I observed is, that the transfer of the stock made to 
                  <persName id="s17960622-1-person960">
                     William

                was not accepted by him, and therefore it was contended that 
                  <persName id="s17960622-1-person961">
                     William

                was not the proprietor, nor capable of transferring the stock. But to this there are two answers, first, that by the transfer the property did vest in 
                  <persName id="s17960622-1-person962">
                     William

                     </persName>
               ; and if he had died before he had accepted it, yet the stock would have gone to his executors, as part of his personal estate; secondly, if 
                  <persName id="s17960622-1-person963">
                     William

                had no stock, that would not vary this case; for the transfer forged by the prisoner is compleat on the face of it, and it imports that there is such stock to be transferred; if there was no stock in the name of 
                  <persName id="s17960622-1-person964">
                     William

                the attempt to transfer such stock is more daring and impudent, but neither the forgery or the fraud are less complete. The other objection was, that the signing of a transfer of stock in the books kept by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, was not complete as a transfer until it was witnessed, but the Judges are all of opinion that a transfer is complete without such attestation; for the attestation is no part of the instrument, and is only required by a regulation of the Bank for their own protection. In the case of Bank notes, a regulation is required that the number of the note should be put at each end of it, but if the number be put at one end only there is no doubt but the note would be good, and therefore making a false note of that description would be a forgery. - Mostatt's case bears no resemblance to this; that was the case of a bill of Exchange for a sum under five pounds, and upon the face of that paper it appeared to every person who saw it, that it was not a bill of Exchange, but was absolutely null and void; but here the transfer on the face of it is complete, and no person who looks at that can collect from it that if it is genuine it would not be a complete transfer of the stock. For these reasons all the Judges are of opinion that the conviction is proper.</p>

There was a long correspondence, a great many letters were written by the prisoner, in which he endeavoured to work upon the fears of Mr. Oldham, with a view to extort money from him, and the result of the evidence was, that a letter was sent by the prisoner, signed with the letters R.R. which contained a threat to publish a libel on the prosecutor, Mr. Oldham. imputing to him the murder of one

               , unless Mr. Oldham would enclose a Bank note in a letter, addressed to R.R. and to be left at the Cambridge Coffee-house, the top of Newman-street, in Goodge-street; the letter says, "On the side of the bar, at the entrance of the coffee-room, is a bracket for letters, let it be placed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220104"/>there, between the hours of eleven and one on Thursday next. On that same day, a line shall be sent by a porter to your house to acknowledge the receipt." Upon this evidence, the Jury found the prisoner guilty, but the sentence was respited, in order to take the opinion of the Judges upon different objections, which have been stated by the Counsel for the prisoner. The Learned Judge, who tried that case, stated that he had directed the Jury to say, whether he had sent the letter of the 12th of January, and whether it did not contain a threat to publish a libel, imputing to him the death of Mr. Dolly. And the Jury were directed, that if they were of that opinion, to find him guilty of sending a letter to the prosecutor, threatening to publish a libel, imputing to him the murder of his master, in order to extort money.</p>
                  <p>This case was argued before the Judges, on behalf of the prisoner; four objections were made to the conviction. First, that this was not a letter without a name. Secondly, that the letter did not contain a threat, or demand, so as to bring the case within the intent and meaning of the statute. 9 Geo. I. chap. 22, upon which this indictment is founded. Thirdly, that a Bank note was not a valuable thing within the meaning of that act. And fourthly, that supposing this case to fall within the words and meaning of that statute, yet, that it is the precise offence described by the statute of 30 Geo. II. which, by making it a misdemeanor only. is a virtual repeal of the statute of 9 Geo. I. upon which this indictment is founded.</p>

                  <p>As to the first, whether it is with or without a name, is a simple fact, appearing upon the face of the letter itself, it is signed with the two letters R.R. which are so far from being a name, that no man can tell by looking at the letter only, whether it referred to any name, or what name it was.</p>
                  <p>The second objection depends upon the true construction of 9 Geo. I. The words of the enacting clause are, "If any person, or persons, shall knowingly send"any letter without any name, subscribed thereto, or"signed by a fictitious name, demanding money, ve-"nison, or other valuable thing, he shall be adjudged"guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as in cases of"felony, without benefit of clergy." The statute speaks of a demand, generally, without requiring any particular circumstances, whether it is by letter without a name, or with a fictitious name, but the preamble recites, that several persons had associated, under the name of Blacks, and entered into confederacies, to support and assist one another in stealing and destroying the dear, robbing warrens, and other illegal practices, and have in great numbers armed themselves with their faces blacked, or in disguised habits, killed the deer, robbed the warrens, and have sent letters in fictitious names to several persons, demanding venison, and money, and threatening some great violence, if such their unlawful demands should be refused; and it was contended, by Mr. Jackson, for the prisoner, that the enacting clause ought to be restrained by the preamble, or at least so far that the demand must be direct and peremptory, and accompanied with a threat of bodily harm. Where the enacting clause of a statute refers to such offences only, as are contained in the preamble, it may be restrained by the preamble, but in this case it would be doing violence to very plain words, if it was so restrained. It is no uncommon thing for a statute to recite the cause of making that statute, and yet for the enacting part of it to embrace more general cases. If the enacting clause in this case were to be restrained by the preamble, it would refer only to where several persons are joined together in a confederacy, where the letter is signed with a fictitious name only, and where they demand venison or money, but a letter signed with or without a name, extending to a demand of any valuable thing, as well as of money or venison, and to all demands, by such letters, whethere accompanied with a threat of bodily harm or not, I agree that a mere request, such as asking charity, without imposing any conditions, would not come within the sense or meaning of the word demand; but here the demand is, as the Jury truly said, when they found a general verdict of guilty of sending a letter, threatening to publish a libel containing a threat to impute the death of his master. The Judges are all clearly of opinion, that it is a demand within the true intent and meaning of the statute, it is a demand of money or mony's worth, which a Bank note is, by means of holding out a threat to impute murder to the prosecutor, and to injure his same, and his character, and not a request of voluntary charity. That a Bank note was a valuable thing, at the time the demand was made, was rightly admitted by the Counsel for the prisoner; but it was contended that it was not so at the time of making the statute, because it was not a subject of larceny. The Judges are all of opinion, that if the thing demanded be valuable at the time of the demand, that is sufficient, though the thing demanded did not exist, or the value of it was not known when the statute was made; but in truth, a Bank note was a valuable thing at the time the statute was made, though it might not come under the denomination of goods or chattels, or be the subject of larceny, but it might at any time be turned into cash, and was to the owner of the value of the money for which it was given.</p>
                  <p>The only remaining question is, whether the statute 9 Geo. I. upon which this prosecution is founded, was repealed. It was truly contended by Mr. Jackson for the prisoner, that if one Act of Parliament makes a particular case a capital offence, and a subsequent Act of Parliament makes it only a misdemeanor, the last act is a repeal of the former, and so it was decided in one Davies's case, in 1783, upon this statute, which makes it a capital offence to kill or wound any deer, in any park. The statute 16 Geo. III. chap. 30, having made that a misdemeanor only, was holden to be a repeal of the former; but if the two statutes can stand together, that does not apply here; the 9th Geo. I. extends to such cases only, in which there is an actual demand, and the 30th Geo. II. reaches cases which fall short of a demand, and includes letters sent with a view to extort money, though no demand is made. The consequence is, that none of the objections are well founded, and the conviction is right.</p>

               , spinster, and other goods the property of Susannah Gibbs, widow, in the said dwelling-house then being, burglariously did steal, take, and carry away, and that upon that indictment they were tried and acquitted. Thus they have pleaded in bar to the indictment which is now depending; to this special plea there was a demurrer upon the part of the prosecution, and that demurrer has been argued before all the Judges of England. On the part of the prisoners it was contended by Mr. Knowlys, that as the house mentioned in the two indictments, and the times mentioned in each indictment when the offence was committed was the same, therefore the offence was the same, and the acquittal on the former indictment was a bar to the present prosecution. He also defined burglary to be a felonious breaking of the dwelling-house and stealing the goods, or with intent to commit a felony, and relied upon two case in Kelynge.</p>
                  <p>The question in this case is, whether the two offences described in the two indictments can be said to be the same; that there was only one act of breaking the house, and one felony at one time must be taken to be clear, but that does not decide the question. The crime of burglary is of two sorts, first breaking and entering in the night-time, and stealing goods there: secondly, breaking and entering in the night-time with intent to commit a felony, though that felony be not committed; the circumstance of breaking is common and essential to both, but it does not of itself constitute the crime in either, for there must be a larceny committed or a felony intended, without one of them the crime of burglary does not exist; and these offences are so distinct in their nature, that evidence of one will not support an indictment for the other; for example, if a man be indicted for breaking a house in the night and stealing goods, evidence that he broke the house and intended to steal goods, would not support the indictment. In the case of the present prisoners, as applicable to the indictment that is now depending, the intent to steal was not evidence to prove the first indictment for breaking and stealing the goods; and if the crimes are so distinct that evidence of one will not support the other, it is inconsistent with reason to say that they are so far the same that an acquittal of one shall be a bar to a prosecution for the other - neither do legal authorities support such a prosecution. - Two cases were quoted on behalf of the prisoners. In Turner's case, in Kelynge, it is stated, that

                was in the same burglary with James Turner, and there being 47l. of the money of one Hill, a servant of Mr. Tryon's, stolen at the same time, which 47l. was not in the former indictment. They would have indicted William Turner again for burglary, for breaking the house of Mr. Tryon, and taking thence 47l. the money of Hill. But the book says, we all agreed, that William Turner, being formerly indicted for burglary in breaking the house of Mr. Tryon, and stealing his goods and acquitted, he cannot now be indicted again for the same burglary of breaking the house; but we all agreed he might be indicted for felony, in stealing the money of Hill, for they are several felonies, and he was not indicted of this felony before, and so he was indicted; and afterwards I told my Lord Chief Justice Bridgman what we had done, and he agreed the law to be so as we had directed. - Now that case was no solemn judgment, for the prisoner was not indicted a second time for the burglary, it was merely a direction from the Judges to the officer of the Court how to draw the second indictment, and it proceeded upon a mistake, as I shall shew presently. If the Judges in that case exercised a little lenity before the indictment, which might have been more properly done after the conviction, much censure could not fall on them; but they proceeded on the ground that the prisoner having been indicted of burglary, in breaking the house of Mr. Tryon, he could not be indicted for the same burglary in breaking the house, he might be indicted for stealing the money of Hill. So in that case the Judges went upon the idea that the breaking the house and stealing the goods were two distinct offences, and that breaking the house only constituted the crime of burglary, which is a manifest mistake; it consisted of breaking the house and stealing the goods, and if stealing the goods of Hill was a dictinct felony from stealing the goods of Tryon, which it was admitted to be, the burglaries could not be the same; the fact was, the prisoner broke the house of Tryon, and stole the money of Tryon and Hill, at the same time; he had been tried for stealing the money of Tryon, and breaking his house; so that the prisoner's life in that case had been in jeopardy, but still the Judges held that he might be tried for stealing the money of Hill; and if no money of Hill had been stolen, probably the question would never have arisen in that case.</p>
                  <p>The case of Jones and Beaver proceeded wholly on the case of Turner, and if the foundation fails, that case must fall also; but authorities are not wanting to shew the principle and foundation upon which a plea of antre-fait<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220106"/> acquits is grounded. Hawkins, 2d Book, chap. 35. section 3. says, "If the party were never known by the"name in the first indictment, he much question whe-"ther the prisoner could be found guilty upon it; and,"if he could not, it seems plain, that his life having"never been in danger by it, the acquittal upon it can-"not be any bar to a subsequent indictment." Foster 361, says, "It is clear, that if A. be indicted as prin-"cipal, and B. as accessary, and both are acquitted,"yet B. may be indicted as principal in the same of-"fence, and his former acquittal is no bar." Again, 362."If a person indicted as principal cannot be con-"victed upon evidence tending barely to prove him to"have been an accessary before the fact, which, I think,"must be admitted. I do not see how an acquittal upon"one indictment could be a bar to a second for an of-"fence specifically different from it." And, in the case of the King and Pedley, K.B. Trin. Term, 1782, which was an indictment for Arson, there were Counts for burning the house of Francis Perry, the house of

               , who demised them to a person of the name of L'Andree. It was, in fact, one and the same house, differently described in the indictment, as belonging to the different persons I have mentioned, except L'Andree, but there was no Count for burning the house of L'Andree. Upon this argument, the Court of King's Bench were of opinion, that as the house was in the possession of L'Andree, none of the Counts were proved; therefore, they gave judgment for the prisoner; but not being tried for burning the house of L'Andree, he was sent back to Bristol, and again tried, though he was acquitted.</p>

                  <p>Now, to apply the principle of these cases, the first indictment is for breaking and stealing goods; if it was proved on that indictment that the prisoners broke with intent to steal the goods but had not stole them, they could not have been convicted by such evidence on that indictment. They have not been tried, nor were their lives ever in jeopardy for this offence of breaking the house with intent to steal the goods. For this reason, the Judges are all of opinion that the plea is bad, that there must be a judgment for the prosecutor upon the demurrer, and that they must take their trials upon the present indictment.</p>
