She was taken up the next morning, when she confessed where some of the things were; the other things were discovered by my mistress's going to the pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood: there never was a week but we missed something or other out of the wash.

I was surprized, there being no body in the house but us two, and thought he should not be there: the cook immediately came in, and I asked her who she had had in the house; she said no body but the painters, who had been unloading the paint, and were gone to breakfast and would return presently; I said she had left the door open, and there had been a man in the house who had not the appearance of a painter, and asked if the plaisterer had sent another man; she said, no; I told her I had met a man in the house, who I believed came on no good design; she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177607100010"/> the painter would be there presently, and I might see if he was the man; the painter came, and I saw he was not the man; I then suspected it was a thief, and went up into the room where I saw him; there I found a cloth which I had put over a cabinet to keep it from the dust, removed, and the cabinet broke open and all the things mentioned in the indictment gone: they were found pawned at five different pawnbrokers: I am very sure the prisoner is the man, because he spoke to me: the things are my property; there was nothing of my mistress's gone; I was at the drawer, and saw them the night before. I told the painter we were robbed, and asked him if he saw any body in the house; he said he saw a man come in as he went out, and that he appeared to be a plaisterer; by the description he gave of him, I knew he was the man I met; I can swear positively that the prisoner is the person.

I said, let me look at him again; I looked at him, and said he was like the man that came for the wine, but only he was not so drunk as he was: I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Did not Sheldon say, do you know the man, and you said no? - He asked if I knew the man; the answer I made was, this looks like the man that robbed me of the wet linen; I did not say no at first.</p>
               <p>Had not Sheldon at the time told you this was the man that came for the wine? - No; he said, is this the man that robbed you?</p>

               <p>I was turnkey at Clerkenwell-bridewell: one night about nine o'clock, the latter end of February or beginning of March, the prisoner called at the gaol and insisted upon my drinking with him, because I used him well when he was in my custody; he fetched two pots of beer; he and I and another young man drank it.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk then? - No; he would insist upon my having something better, and asked me what I would have; I told him I would have a pint of red port mulled, and he went and brought it.</p>
               <p>How was he after he drank that, was he sober? - Yes; after that pint was out he said he would fetch a second pint, and then he would wish me good night; he went away, and did not return; the maid brought the second pint.</p>
               <p>What time did he go for the second pint of wine? - I think it must be full ten o'clock; the maid came again in about ten minutes after she brought the wine, and said they had been robbed; I met the prisoner this day fortnight in St. James's Park, and took him; I was determined to take him whenever I met with him.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Did not Mrs. Bursell say she did not know me? - Yes, I believe she did at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Repeat the conversation that passed between Mrs. Bursell and you. - I brought the prisoner to Mrs. Bursell's, and met her in the passage; I said, Mrs. Bursell, do you know this gentleman? she looked at him very stedfastly, and said, No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was there a light in the passage? - It was about twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>What did you say upon that? - I said, don't you remember being robbed? this is the man that came for the wine; she then said, O law! I think I recollect his face.</p>
               <p>This was in the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say when you took him into the kitchen? - I took him into the tap-room; nothing else was said; I did not take him into the kitchen at all.</p>
               <p>To BURSELL. Was the man that came for the second pint of wine the same as came for the first pint and the two pots of beer? - I am clear he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman: I met the prisoners and and another in company with them about a quarter before four in the morning on the 29th of June, near Colbrooke-row; I thought they were thieves, as they were looking into the gardens, and watched them; I saw Jones lean over into a garden and take some linen and put it into the other prisoner's hand; I immediately pursued and took them, and found the handkerchief, the jam, and a bit of rag in Wright's apron; Jones went down on his knees, and said he would do so no more; I took them to the cage, and went in the morning to the people that the things belonged to.</p>
               <p>JONES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Wright and I were going to see after some work; I went to ease myself, and saw this bundle lie up in a corner; I went to see what it was, and put it in his apron.</p>

               <p>What were the contents of a piece? - Generally about 70 yards, but one of them was a short piece; the six pieces contained 380 odd yards; there were seven yards of peagreen silk barred with silver; there was 20 lb. weight of silk died black; there was a draught upon my banker for 10 l.</p>
               <p>Who is your banker? - Boldero, Barnston, and Co. No 5, Mansionhouse-street; and there was 2 l. 15 s. in money, that is all that I can be certain of.</p>
               <p>How long before you missed them had you seen them in the house? - I left the house on Saturday, and left the foreman in the house; on the Saturday following I found the six pieces of silk in the possession of Mr. Worthy, Hanway-yard, Oxford-road; I have found nothing else but the draught: one of Sir John Fielding's men came to me on Saturday morning, and told me he had found the draught upon the prisoner Connor; the silk has been ever since in the care of Mr. Stellings; he is not here, but his head man is. (The draught produced by Heley;) that is my draught. - (The pieces of silk produced); I believe them to be my property; I was out of town at the time of the robbery; one or two I cannot swear so positively to as my man can; these answer to what I lost as near as can be; I believe them to be mine; they measure the same as what I lost.</p>
               <p>Did you look where your house had been broke? - Yes; they had broke through the yard into a lobby where the work-people are served; they cut a hole through the door, and then broke through another door into the warehouse; they cut two holes through each door; I believe one was large enough to get their arm through; they were cut over where the bolts were.</p>

               <p>Had you fastened up the lobby where they broke in? - I fastened that up at seven o'clock; the maid was up before me in the morning; she called me at seven; I was the first that discovered the breaking of the place; as soon as I came to the warehouse door, I found that the lock had been forced off.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was whole and locked over night? - I am very positive of it: I entered the warehouse, and saw the things all in confusion; I went to the door that leads into the lobby; there were two holes cut in it; it had two bolts and a lock; there was a hole cut over the lock that commands that; I then went to the outer door that leads into the yard, and saw that cut in like manner.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177607100015"/>That was whole when you locked it at seven o'clock? - Yes; the outer door next the yard, and the door of the warehouse were broke; I searched the warehouse to see what was missing; I saw the till broke open, in which the draught of 10 l. lay; I put it in the till over night, which Mr. Mason left with me, left I should want cash in his absence; this is the draught, I recollect it perfectly, and I know it to be Mr. Mason's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Look at the silks. - They are the property of Mr. Mason; I am very positive of it; I know them well; there is a mark with a black-lead pencil of my own; I know the other by the work; I took them in that very day; there were 20 lb wt. of silk died black, and seven yards of pea-green silk, barred with silver, and there were about two pounds fifteen shillings in cash lost; I had it in my hand over night: the silks were found in the possession of Mr. Worthy, the draught I saw at Sir

               <p>Did he say where he bought them? - No.</p>
               <p>Or in what manner? - No; he said he bought them of them, and produced a bill of parcels of them before I paid him for them. [The bill of parcels produced]</p>
               <p>Do you know Still and Baker's hand-writing? - No.</p>
               <p>That you had from Edrian? - Yes; I understood him that he was to give but 3 s. 6 d. a yard; the bill of parcels is 4 s. 6 d. it was a mistake, because I had not the bill of parcels then; my brother had it; he was to pay the money.</p>
               <p>The bill of parcels was not delivered till the money was paid? - Yes; we had it before; but I did not see till Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>These are the goods? - Yes; these are the goods I bought of Mr. Edrian, and offered to Mr. Elam; they were loose, because I had just measured them; they came to me folded, not upon rolls: I have dealt with him for silks before; I had no suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>What are the silks worth to a wholesale dealer? - I think, to pay ready money, they are worth 5 s. 6 d. a yard.</p>
               <p>You don't know Major Baker and Still? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you not surprized to think of his buying these silks at 3 s. 6 d. a yard? - I thought it a low price; but knowing him so long, I had no suspicion that they were stole.</p>

               <p>I am a stay-maker; I live in Wells-street; I have lived there two years; I know Smith; I do not know him by the name of Connor; it is the tall man in the brown cloaths with the white buttons.</p>

               <p>What day of the week was it? - On a Wednesday, about Wednesday fortnight; I think the name was Boldero, and some other person.</p>

               <p>Was the draught printed or wrote? - I look upon it it was copper-plate, as I remember very well the body of it was copper-plate and soiled.</p>

               <p>There is a sort of halves sometimes claimed in such cases, did you claim no share? - None at all.</p>
               <p>What time of day did he pick it up? - Between one and two.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a house or are you a lodger? - I keep the house I live in.</p>

I never exceeded that.</p>

               <p>I met one Phillips in Spittalfields, who said he could help me to a lot of goods; I went with him to the Gibraltar to look at them; the silks were produced by a man whom I never saw before, Lipe Lyons; he asked 71 l. for them, and said they were a lot of damaged goods which he had bought at a sale; I thought they were damaged goods; they looked as if they had been in the dirt, and had been trod upon; I agreed to give him 65 l. for them; I gave him a 10 l. note, a 40 l. note, and the rest in gold; Corbet knew nothing of the affair: when I heard of the goods, I called upon my brother, and told him I was going to the Gibraltar to bargain for some goods, and wanted him to come and help bring them away: my brother did come and help to carry them home; the goods were not worth any thing nigh what Mr. Mason said, for I have worked for him, and know as well as he.</p>

One of the men that stood by the horse had a pistol, the other three had cutlasses.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish the faces of any more of the men? - Yes; Davis was the person that had the pistol and stood at the horse.</p>

               <p>Might it not deceive you with regard to Davis too? - If it might deceive with respect to one, it might deceive with respect to the other.</p>
               <p>Then you will not take upon you to swear to either of them? - I think the prisoners are exceedingly like them; I think I know Davis's voice too; he said, when he came up to the chaise, You bloody dog, deliver your money; I heard him speak at Sir

About 12 o'clock that same night, as I was coming up Holborn, just by the Bull and Gate, I saw Hollis take off his great-coat, and give it M'Coul to go into Masters's shop to pawn it; I had not been there long before a young fellow of the name of Rose came by, in two or three minutes Upton and Davis came; I said to the young fellow, Will you assist me? he said he would; I laid hold of Upton directly, Davis set off running, I ran after him into Red-lion-street, there we over took him; from

               <p>Are you certain of that? - Yes: he dined about two o'clock; he went out after he had dined, and came home about seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>You are positive of that? - Very sure; he staid at home and we supped, and I was very happy to think I had him at home, and said, I hope you will never be in trouble any more; he said, No, he would go to sea as soon as he could get a birth: I told him, I feared he would be hanged if he did not.</p>

I said with all my heart; Captain Johnson took up the money: we then agreed to meet at the King's-Head Tavern, at the corner of Tower-hill, to shew the money and determine who had gained or lost: I went between three and four in the afternoon, and found them all there; they proposed to go to the <placeName id="t17760710-35-crimeloc164">Ticket Porter's in Cooper's-row, Crutched-friars</placeName>

               <p>Then they did not know you? - No: I stopped at the Mackerel at Mile-end, and told a neighbour I suspected I had some things in my cart that were stolen; he advised me to open the bag; I did, and immediately the man ran away; we secured him, and carried them before Justice Curtis, who committed them.</p>

               <p>Was the lock broke? - No; I found the lock safe when I came.</p>
               <p>Mr. VERBRUGGEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am master founder at Woolwich: we have a particular art of boring cannon out of the solid with a particular tool that is not known in the kingdom; we weighed the borings and found a deficiency of 200 pound weight and half within a few pounds.</p>
               <p>How do you know the quantity that was in that chest? - Knowing that this was the boring of ten three pounders, we know that it should produce ten hundred pound weight, that is to a certainty within five, six, or seven pounds; it is done so exact, we can always speak to a few pounds; there was near 200 pound weight and a half deficient in this chest.</p>
               <p>Should you know these borings again if you were to see them? - By the shape and the metal: I have brought some on purpose that we bored afterwards to compare them.</p>
               <p>You can tell by the metal, and likewise by the form of it? - Yes; it is my own.</p>
               <p>When you call it your own, is it your property? - His Majesty furnishes us with the metal, it is only under our charge: the prisoner has been working with us upwards of three years and a half; he worked nineteen months in this room; he was a smith, we took him from Woolwich: the prisoner took his discharge in November.</p>

               <p>I am a brass founder at Hoxton: on the 21st of last month a Mr. Hall that lives in White Horse-street, Stepney, brought me 215 pound weight of this metal; he is a man of reputation, I have dealt with him some time, I bought them of him; I heard afterwards that the royal foundry at Woolwich had been robbed; I sent to Mr. Verbruggen to let him know that I believed I had some of the metal which had been stole from the royal foundry, and would give him all the information I could: this is part of the metal I bought (producing it); we make pot metal of it; I never saw any of that sort nor in that form before.</p>

Elliot and the butler sat down to drafts, and I sat down with them; at this time Read was missing; I left them at drafts, and went to a relation's in Whitechapel to drink tea, and from there I came to my lodgings in James-street, Gold-square, and there I saw Read fast asleep; I waked him, and bid him go home; he said, by G - d, he had taken French leave, and never would go home any more; he said, he had a suit of his master's cloaths on, and that he had broken open drawers, and taken away cloaths to the amount of 20 l. and he would go off for France; I desired him to meet me at the Coach and Horses next morning, and a relation of mine went with me to tell the butler what Read had done: I rang the bell; the butler called to know who was there? I said, my name was Chester, and I came to tell him what Read had done; the butler, when I began to tell him, called two watchmen and seized me.</p>

I said, yes; she said she believed the house was robbed; she described the people, and told me which way they went; I followed them; there were three of them; one had a brown bag, I cannot say which; I believe the prisoner is one of the three; I was behind them: I cannot swear the prisoner is one of them, I believe he is; I was pursuing them through the church-yard; they were in the horse road about fifty yards from me; they threw down the bag on seeing me; I took up the bag; it contained wearing apparel, silk gowns, and cloaks; there was a wall as high as they almost between them and me; I took the things home to my house till Mr. Mascall and his wife came home.</p>
