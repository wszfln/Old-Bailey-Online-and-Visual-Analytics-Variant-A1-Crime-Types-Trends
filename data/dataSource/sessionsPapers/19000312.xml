               <p>I was in the Princess of Wales public-house, Villiers Street, Strand, where I saw the prisoner with two others sitting in conversation—one of the men is named Wilson, the other is not in custody—the prisoner was the middle man of the three—I heard the man not in custody say to Record, "How about the things?"—Record, after speaking to the man on his right, replied, "We will bring them to<lb/>morrow night; they <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> finished"—the man not in custody said, "In here, then, at 7.30"—Record replied, "All right, we will be here sharp with them and wait an hour"—I then left the house; the three men were still sitting in the bar—on the next evening I went again to the Princess of Wales at 7 p.m., dis<lb/>guised as a rough seafaring man—at 7.30 Record looked in and went out again—at 7.40 he returned with the man not in custody, and they sat down next to me—the other man said, "Is he coming here to-night?"—Record replied, "He will bring the <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> at 8 o'clock to a house up the road"—they left the bar at 7.50, and I, with other officers, followed them to the Northumberland Arms, in Northumberland Avenue—they entered the bar and came out with Wilson—when Record came out I followed him, with other officers, up to Holborn—I was present when he was stopped by Sergeant Cox—Sergeant Lawrence stopped Wilson—the third man got away—after they were stopped I saw a paper on the pavement, which I picked up and gave to Sergeant Cox—it contained five counterfeit 5s. pieces.</p>

On the evening of February 28th I went to the Princess of Wales public-house, Villiers Street, Strand, with Sergeant Williamson—I saw the prisoner there—I first saw him that night at 7.30, when I was keeping observation from the railway station, looking down at the public-house—he came down and looked into the public-house and then left, and went towards the Strand—shortly afterwards he returned with another man—they both entered the Princess of Wales, where they remained for some little time—soon after the prisoner and another man left and went to the Northumberland Arms, Northumberland Avenue, followed by Sergeants Lawrence, Perkiss, and myself—after remaining there a short time I saw them leave—the third man is an old man whom I know of—we followed them to Holborn, when I and Williamson took hold of the prisoner, and in doing so I heard something fall on the ground on the opposite side to where I was—I called Perkiss' attention to it, and he picked up this paper with these coins in it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they were rolled separately, with a piece of paper between them—I told Record I should arrest him for uttering counterfeit coin in various parts of London—he said, "It is too bad, Cox; why don't you take the other man?"—I said, "You need not trouble about him; he will be arrested"—I took him to the station; the other man was brought in, and they were charged with having five counterfeit five-shilling pieces in their possession—neither of them made any reply—the prisoner refused to give his address; he said, "No fixed abode."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant in the Works Depart<lb/>ment of the London County Council—in June and July last, building operations were going on at Boundary Street, Shoreditch, where a large number of men were employed—there was a man named Frederick Bartle in charge—the men were paid on Saturday at 12 a.m. for the week's work which ended on the Friday evening—the full week's work would be £2 1s. 8d., which is 50 hours at 10d.—they would be paid the full</p>

               <p>amount or for the time they had worked, which was recorded in a book and checked by Hutchins, the timekeeper, who would make out the wages sheet, which shows the time the men work during the week—the wages sheet would be sent to me on the Friday to be checked—the pay-clerk would go down to the works on Saturday morning to pay the men at 12 o'clock—if the men were not able to come for their money they were allowed to send a written request, containing the name of the deputy, that had to be signed by the man sending the request; the pay-clerk would refer to his sheets to see if such a man was there, and, pro<lb/>vided it was in order, he would pay the amount—it would be signed by the person who brought the request, and countersigned by Bartle, the general foreman—I remember the circumstances under which Hutchins was convicted on September 8th, and in consequence of certain facts which came our, a complete investigation was made by myself—I found out that the man Downes was not entitled to £2 1s 8d. for the week ending July 14th, but only to 15s.—I examined the time-book and found that he had been marked "Absent," and then altered to "Nine hours."—then I saw Downes and asked him, and he told me—the wages sheet showed that £3 1s. 8d. was due to him—no sum of 15s. has been paid to him—in this request in the case of Jones (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), I noticed that the word "Horsman" is in the same writing as the body of the request—the wages sheet of July 29th shows that a man named F. Jones worked a full week's work, and therefore made £2 1s. 8d.—on looking at the time book, which was kept by Hutchins, I came to the conclusion that the names had been written in and the hours filled in afterwards—I noticed that Jones had not been paid, and I made inquiries as to why he had not been paid—I went to the works on August 2nd, and saw the prisoner there, and asked him if he was the man who had presented a request on the previous Monday to obtain Jones's money, and he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he got the request from—he replied, "From a boy"—I then asked him, supposing he had obtained the money, what; he proposed to do with it—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "I want an answer to my question"—he said, "Give it to Jones"—I said, "Where were you going to see Jones?" he said, "At Bishopsgate at 2 o'clock."—I asked him if he knew Jones, and where he lived—he said he knew him, but did not know his address—the prisoner was discharged practically at that moment—nobody has applied for the money for Jones—No F. Jones has ever worked on that work either before or since then, and this is the only week on which he is shown to have worked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post Office—on January 24th I saw Baker in custody—he was in uniform—I showed him this parcel—there was a conversation between us—afterwards Hawkes was brought in—I cautioned him, and read over this statement which Baker had made: "The parcel, produced, addressed to Mr. Thomas Davis, 429, Edgware Road, London, I took out of the Paddington Parcel Depot this morning amongst other parcels I had for delivery. I did not enter it on my delivery list. When I had delivered all but the parcel produced, I placed the latter in a mail bag I had with me, and I carried it towards Porchester Road, W. I there met Hawkes, and we went together into the Stafford public-house, where I handed the parcel to him. I asked him to dispose of it, and he said, 'Very well' He is a tailor by trade, and so am I, and we have worked together in the same shops. During the last two or three weeks Hawkes has pawned about two stolen parcels for me. I have paid him a shilling or so each time for his services. Other people, whose names I do not know, have also pawned the contents of stolen parcels for me. In every case these people have handed me the pawn-ticket"—he then took the pawn-tickets from his pockets—"These are some of the pawn-tickets referred to. I stole a parcel addressed 'Mr. Newport Wright, 2, Westbourne Grove Terrace,' two or three days ago. It contained a suit of clothes. This address label and piece of paper bearing the same address belonged to that parcel"—on hearing that statement Hawkes said, "I have known Baker about three months. I have heard Baker's statement read over. I admit having received about three parcels from Baker, which I have pawned by his instructions, and received a shilling or so for doing it. I did not know that the clothes which Baker handed to me had been stolen. I gave Baker the pawn-tickets. I have one at my address"—he told me he had served in the Royal Engineers as a volunteer.</p>

At 10.45 p.m. on February 19th I was at the Police-station at Canning Town—as I was going out I saw the prisoner coming towards the station—he said to me, "They have been to my house"—he did not say whom he meant—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Adam Greeb"—I said, "You will be charged with shooting John Ellingham"—he said, "Me shoot him! I did not. I got my hand cut, and have been to the Seamen's Hospital and had it dressed"—I then searched, but found nothing on him—his right hand was bandaged, and was in a sling—I saw blood on his shirt, under-coat, and trousers—he said, "He is a dirty dog; he will poke his nose in where he is not wanted, but won't stand up and fight fair"—this knife was handed to me by Belsham, who pointed out a spot in the road, which was 10 paces from the public-house.</p>

I was house surgeon at the Poplar Hospital on February 19th—the deceased was admitted at 8.45—he had a wound on the left side of his neck about 1 in. long, and 2 in. to 3 in. deep on the abdomen—in the middle line below the navel was a wound about 3 in. long, pene<lb/>trating the wall of the abdomen, and through which the omentum pro<lb/>truded—an operation was performed under an ansthetic at 9.45 p.m., when we found, on enlarging the wound, a large amount of blood in the abdominal cavity—peritonitis set in about three days afterwards, and he died on the 22nd, about 9.30 p.m.—death was the result of that wound—the wounds could be produced with this knife—the direction of the wound in the abdomen was to the right from the middle line—the wound in the neck was slightly forward and downwards.</p>

Bevans was there. I was with Greeb about 10 minutes. I had two glasses of ale with Greeb and Peterson. Something was said about a colt. Adam Greeb spoke to me about it. He said to Peterson, 'I know a man who will buy my colt.' Greeb called me a dirty something. I said, 'If you call me that again I will hit you.' He called me a dirty b—. I then struck him in the face with my closed fist: we exchanged several blows. This was inside the public-house. We then went into the street. Greeb went away. I then went back again. Nothing took place outside. About 10 minutes afterwards I was standing in the bar by the fire, when Greeb came in and said something which I forget, and plunged a knife into my side, and said, 'Take that.' I then struck out at him. I did not feel it then; as he pulled the knife out I saw it. It was a fishmonger's knife. Then he made a blow at my neck, and blood started running down my neck. He missed me once or twice with the knife. I closed with him and became exhausted; I let go, Greeb walked away. We had been friends for years; we had not had any quarrel. Greeb had had plenty to drink. I had had several glasses of ale during the day, but was not drunk. Robinson, a friend, called a carman with a van. I got in, and was brought to, the Poplar Hospital, where I am now. I am positive it was the prisoner who struck me."<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

I never did anything.' I had hardly time to speak before he cut me. Greeb had the knife in his hand; Greeb cut his hand himself. He had some blood on him. When he went out I did not run after him.

                  </hi>. I am a horse-keeper, and between 6 and 6.10 p.m. on February 20th I was in York Road, Wandsworth—I saw a hansom cab being driven by the prisoner—there was a stationary tram, and in front of the tram I saw a little girl and a little boy crossing the road in front of the horses—I saw the little girl knocked down by the cab, which came along on the near side of the tram—that would not be the proper side, in my opinion—there was no traffic on the other side—he ought to have gone on the off side—he was going between seven and eight miles an hour, and the same way as the tram—I saw the off-side wheel of the cab knock the child down and pass over its chest; the boy was a little in front of the girl, and he escaped—I held my hand up and shouted to the prisoner to stop—he turned round and looked, and then went about three times as fast as he was going before—I gave chase to him, and then took his number—he was in a stooping position, leaning over the cab—I gave his number to a policeman, whom I took back to the spot where the child was run over—the policeman sent me for a cab; I went, and then saw the prisoner's cab, and caught hold of his horse, and gave him in charge of another policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My judgment was that the prisoner went three times as fast as he was going at first, when I shouted at him; that would be 24 miles an hour—it was dark then—I do not know that the prisoner suffers from an internal disease which prevents him from sitting—he had a fare in the cab at the time—he came back to the same road afterwards—it is very unusual for cabmen to go on the near side of a tram-car when</p>

On February 20th Turpin brought the prisoner into the station at Wandsworth, about 6.30—he was charged with being drunk, and recklessly driving a hansom cab—something was said about a child being run over—the prisoner was drunk—he made no reply—when I read the charge over to him he said he did not remember running over anybody—there were other cabs in the road at the time—he asked if he could see a doctor, and I sent for one—he could not stand upright in the dock, and had to have the assistance of the rails of the dock—about an hour and a half afterwards I heard that the child was dead, and I charged the prisoner with manslaughter—I saw the horse; it was very restive in the station yard, and it took two men to hold it—I should say it had been driven rapidly, from its state.</p>

I was at the station on the early morning of February 3rd, when Franci was in custody—Parker handed me a revolver, which was taken from Franci—I examined it, and found it to be a six<lb/>chambered revolver; four chambers were loaded, one was empty, and one had an empty cartridge case in it—about 8 a.m the two prisoners were brought in, and Police-constable Read handed me this revolver (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) as having been taken from Braun; it is a six-chambered revolver, and was fully loaded—I saw Braun searched; six cartridges were found on him—I received a third revolver from Dyer, who found it at the spot where it was thrown away by Reuter—it was fully loaded in six cham<lb/>bers—I saw him searched; 12 ball cartridges were found on him, and two loose cartridges were found by Dyer when he found the revolver—the revolver was jammed, and I could not unload it till I had eased the screw at the side—after it was unloaded there were distinct signs of blue smoke on the inside of the barrel—you could not work the revolver at all—I found on both the revolvers taken from Braun and Reuter indications that they had been recently fired—the blue smoke was quite fresh—the cartridges found on the prisoners were all of exactly the same size and pattern as those found in the three revolvers—no cartridges were found on Franci—the revolver, which was jammed, had apparently been loaded in a hurry, and the cartridge was not pushed home, and so got jammed—when it was pushed home it worked quite well.</p>

I am a medical practitioner and divisional surgeon of police at West Dulwich—about 6.45 on February 3rd I saw Harrington at Dulwich Station—I saw a hole in his trousers—I looked at the inner side of his left thigh, where I found evidence of a rather severe contusion—it might have been caused by a bullet fired from one of these revolvers—the bullet had not penetrated the flesh—the sergeant, in my opinion, was suffering from shock and pain, and I ordered him to bed, where he stayed for 12 days—he has not resumed duty yet.</p>

We must get rid of it'; I said, 'I will take it to a man I know'; I then took it to Lazarus, at Old Montague Street; he examined the stuff, and said, 'I will give you £15 for the lot, but do not say any<lb/>thing to anybody'; Lazarus then put it under the bed"—I left Musheat in the charge of Sergeant Gill and Police-constable Rand, while I went with Sergeant Wensley to 30, Old Montague Street, where I found a jeweller's shop was being carried on, with the name of Shapiloff outside it—it was rather a small repairing shop, with some ordi<lb/>nary common watches in the window; no silver or anything of that kind—I went in and found Shapiloff—I said, "We are police-officers, and are making inquiries respecting a quantity of silver plate stolen on January 21st"—I read a list of the property to him, and then said, "We have been informed that you purchased the property from a man mamed Musheat on January 21st"—he said, "I do not know whether I did or not,but if you bring the man to me I may tell you"—I despatched an officer to bring Musheat, and when he came Shapiloff said, pointing to Musheat, "Yes, I know him, and have had two or three deals with him"—Musheat said, "Yes, of course, you have; you gave me £15 for the knives, forks, spoons, and other things in this very kitchen last Sunday fortnight"—Musheat was then taken upstairs, and Shapiloff said to me, "What are you going to do with me? I bought the things and sold them again, but I cannot tell you whom I sold them to. I did not know they were stolen"—Shapiloff was then taken upstairs to where Musheat was, and I told them they would be charged with feloniously receiving the property—Shapiloff said, "I will not go; you must get a warrant"—he resisted very violently—Musheat went quite quietly, and said nothing then—they were taken to Peckham Police-station and charged—they made no reply—on the morn<lb/>ing of February 17th Reuter and Braun were brought to the Police-court, and into the prisoners' waiting-room, where Musheat was—he called me on one side, and, pointing to Braun and Reuter, said, "Those are the two men who brought me the property"—I did not ask him the question; it was a voluntary statement on his part—Shapiloff said I might search his premises, which I did, but found nothing—both the prisoners speak English without any difficulty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say, "I do not know whether I bought the property or not; but if you bring the man to me I will tell you"—he said he did not know Musheat.</p>
