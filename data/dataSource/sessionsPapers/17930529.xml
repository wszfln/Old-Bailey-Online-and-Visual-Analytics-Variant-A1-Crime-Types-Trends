I went then and got them down, says I, sir, here are the stockings you asked for; and turning in that moment I see him place a card of lace in his hat; I said, here is the stockings you wish to see; he then threw open the door and said, there goes my mother, and went out; I said to my fellow servant, there is that young lad has got a card of lace, and placed it in his hat; we went out directly after him,

               <p>I am a servant in the shop; I remember when the prisoner was in the shop; I did not see him take the things; he came in and asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, and he went out and returned in about a quarter of an hour, and then he came in and asked to look at some edging; he said he wanted about a shillingworth; the one he chose was too fine, we could not make a shilling-worth of it; then he asked my fellow servant for some coarse worsted stockings, after looking for the stockings she happened to turn round and see him place a card of lace in his hat; I did not see that, my mistress desired me to run out, and I ran out directly, I pursued him up Castle-court and kept him in my sight till he went into a house; I followed him into the house, it was a carpenter's shop; he went down into the cellar; I went down after him; when I went into the house there was a woman coming up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any lace on him? - No, me and my fellow servant went down stairs and she pulled his hat off, she found no edging in it; there was a man came down with us, he went about three quarters<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290006"/>of a yard, as near as I can guess from the prisoner, picked up the edging and gave it me, I cannot say exactly how much the quantity was, the man picked it up and gave it me into my hand; I have kept it ever since; I did not find any cards at that time, went again and found three more parcels of lace within a quarter of an hour, about ten minutes afterwards, both times we found thirty-nine yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any cards? - No, a shoemaker brought some cards; I have all the lace and have kept it by itself. (Produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. Is your privy near the carpenter's house? - No, it is No. 2, in Church-lane, almost facing the house of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the carpenter's cellar where the prisoner was found? - No. The prisoner asked leave of me to go into the privy on the 12th of April, it was before he was taken up; I never saw him before, he stayed in a very short time.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. He gave the key of his trunk on being asked? - He did. The purse from the appearance I believe to be mine; from the sight of the pistols which I saw in the chaise I should have thought them rather smaller than these appear to be.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get off your horse? - No. It was a mare with a white face and cropt ears.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the side you rode, or on the other side? - On the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observations you made of the man, can you say that is the man now in the court? - I cannot. After he had committed the robbery he told me to drive on; he called to me at a distance from the chaise; from that I drove on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home when the mare went out that day? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time of the robbery think the mare was your's? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mare that morning? - I did. The mare was my master's, it went out about three o'clock in the forenoon; that is the man that took her out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home before the mare was brought back? - No, it was brought back before I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the person who rode the mare again? - On the Monday following, I believe, on the day I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the robbery did you recollect it was the same person that took the mare away? - Yes, I know the man for I had seen him two or three times before at my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his business was at your master's when you saw him there? - He came for a horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At the time of the robbery you did not know the man at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man that came for the mare you knew his face perfectly, you had seen him several times before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been frequently in your master's yard for a horse? - He had.</p>

               <p>I live in Cary-street; I keep a livery stable; I know the prisoner by making application for a horse three, four or five times; I was not present on the 19th, he had a horse then from my house; on the same day Mr. Mills ordered a chaise to take him to Hounslow; I sent this boy with the carriage; a little before ten o'clock I heard the cry of hostler, in the street; I ran into the street, and when I came into the street the mare was facing the street door, says I, this is a mare of mine, not pleased that she had been out, I put my hand on her and found she was in a violent heat; the prisoner was the man who came with the mare; I said, you have rode this mare fast; says he, I have not rode her far; then, says I, you have rode her too fast; I made the hostler hear as soon as I could, and he came to the gate and took the mare up to the stable; the prisoner then walked into the house and called for a pint of porter; while he was drinking of it he went into the stable and to the hostler, and returned and went with his porter and drank it in an inner room, and paid for it, and wanted a farthing out of his two-pence; I told him we always charged two-pence a pint in that room; he wished me a good night and went off. When the boy returned he told me the transaction that had happened, and brought me a directions from Mr. Mills for me to give to Mr. Mills's clerk, giving a statement of the robbery, in order that his clerk might give information at Bow-street, as I understand; when I saw Mr. Mills's clerk, I said to him, we had better keep this business a secret, and not expose it, for I dare say he will be coming again for another saddle horse in a few days; we did keep it secret, and on Saturday evening following he came again, about eight o'clock, I immediately knew him, he came and asked for the same mare as he had on Tuesday; that mare was engaged; he walked into the stable and there had agreed with the man for another mare; I went after him and said, pray where do you live? says he, at the Spread Eagle, in Gracechurch-street; I took him then by the arm, and I said to him, you are accused of committing an highway robbery the last time you hired my mare; he says in answer, me accused of an highway robbery? yes, says I, you are, and so strongly that I must detain you till you have cleared the matter; I then took him by the arm, says I, we will go to Mr. Mills to see if he is at home; I desired the hostler to go with me, when we came to Mr. Mills's chambers, Mr. Mills was not at home, his clerk was at the chambers; I said to him, this is the man that hired my mare, that the hostler says the man was on that robbed Mr. Mills; says he, Mr. Mills is not within; he not being within we concluded to take the man to the watch-house, we took him to the watch-house and I fancy some little time after Mr. Mills returned and went to the watch-house to him, about half an hour after he had been in custody, as I should suppose. He did live at the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So that the place where he told you he lived was the true place where he did live? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And he expressed a surprize in saying when you charged him with the robbery, me accused of a highway robbery? in that sort of way? - He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hired a horse on Tuesday the 19th of February to go to Mitcham; I went to Mitcham; I was there on some business; I returned from there about seven o'clock and came to the turnpike at the Obelisk, the other side of Blackfriars Bridge, about nine, and from the turnpike I rode the horse very hard to this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290011"/>man's house. When I was taken to the watch-house on Saturday, I, without any hesitation, told Mr. Mills my lodging; on the day following, which was Sunday, I sent to an acquaintance who lived in Chancery-lane to get me some clean linen, as I had not changed since Friday; I delivered my keys to my acquaintance and desired him to bring my linen to me; he went and brought me word that Mr. Mills arrived there just at the time he arrived, and prevented him executing that order that I gave him; I had told him to leave every thing safe in the trunk, only to bring me some clean linen; I cannot say any more; I was at a great distance from the place where the robbery is said to be committed; I know nothing of it; I am quite a stranger to the business; I cannot prove an alibi, but there are some respectable people to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the outer door of the house locked? - I cannot say. I lodge up one pair of stairs, other people lodge above me; the people that keep the house lodge below.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the lock seem to have been opened? - When I put the key in to attempt to lock the door, I found the lock had been strained, I could not get the key in, I found the door open, or at least upon the latch; there were three coats gone, two close bodied coats and a great coat, nine shirts, four neck muslin handkerchiefs, three muslin cravets, a pair of silk and worsted stockings, a pair of worsted stockings, four pocket handkerchiefs; the shirts were entirely new, they cost me a deal of money, I valued them altogether at 9 l. the boy that came for me informed me that the prisoners were in custody, they were down at the public office in Hatton-garden; I went down to Hatton-garden and the things were there produced, and I saw the prisoner Hastings, and when I came to examine him he had got a great coat of my own on his back, and one of the officers took it off his back; I understood that some of these things were taken from him before.</p>

I observed them some time, and had a suspicion that things were not altogether right; I after that went into the yard behind my father's house, when I came back I was told that one of them had gone into a house nearly opposite, Mr. Austin's house; I then went round the corner to see for assistance at Elliot's and Harris's, and there I found them together; I mentioned my suspicion to them, Mr. Elliot and Harris were together, and I desired them to look out, and returning a very short time afterwards I saw the prisoner Hastings come out of Austin's house, I followed him about twenty or thirty yards and then laid hold of him; I then brought him back to my father's door, a number of people were collected about at the time, and his coat and waistcoat was unbuttoned or tore open, I cannot say which, and these things that were taken was under his clothes, and in the course of the time he dropped something out of his apron, but I cannot tell whether he dropped them after I had hold of him or no; I cannot say any thing but to Hastings, I followed him, and never lost sight of him; the others I cannot positively say they are the men.

               <p>On Wednesday evening the 9th of May, between six and seven o'clock, I was standing with Mr. Sherrin, that has been examined, and we see three men standing together, which are the three men at the bar now, the prisoners, they seemed as if consulting about something, and I says to Sherrin, I think these men are after no good, we will stop a moment and see what they will attempt to do; accordingly Hastings, who is one of the prisoners, walked away from them and walked to the house door where the robbery was done at, the door was open, he stopt there with a pretence to make water, which I fancy he did, he then went on a little further to a gateway just behind the house and there he stopped to see if any body was watching of him; I left the door and was going into Mr. Sherrin's shop when he was coming back from the gateway, while I was going through Mr. Sherrin's shop from the parlour he told me there was one of them men gone into the house; I waited a short time and out came one of them, which I did not see before, it was Stevens the evidence, he came out with several things in his apron; I immediately said, that is none of the men that I saw, where is the other two? Hastings came out with him; I immediately followed Hastings with several things in his apron; I told Mr. Sherrin that this was the man that I saw talking with the other two; I am sure the other two are the men that were consulting with Hastings before the robbery; I walked back again to the place where I had been talking with Mr. Sherrin and Hastings came across there, and I laid hold of him by the collar, as soon as I laid hold of him by the collar, he dropped several things out of his apron, I think there was two coats among them, and one was a green one; I then gave him to Mr. Sherrin, and says to him, there he is; it being very ill convenient for me to attend at this place, I went off and knew nothing further till Mr. Blamire sent for me.</p>

I gave her half a crown; then she requested me to give her something to drink; I said, I have no more silver; she said, you have more money; I put my hand into my pocket and gave her half a guinea to go and get something; she went to the door and talked as if talking with somebody to give an order for the liquor, and then returned in again, and was there about ten or twelve minutes, or thereabouts; I said, this liquor is a great while coming; she said, I think it is; then she turns about and whips my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive it go? - I did, it was a silver watch with a steel chain, a metal watch key, and a steel bed hook; she was gone out about a quarter of an hour after she got the watch, and then returned in again, as soon as she returned in again I said, give me my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit her to go out with your watch? - She went out in an instant as she got the watch; it rained as hard as it could rain, and it was very dark, and I was in an entire strange place.</p>

The beginning of February last our petty cash keeper came to me, and in consequence of some information from him the prisoner was taken up on the 6th of May, and committed to the Poultry Compter, having previously confessed in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the confession was made had you made him any offer of favour or threatened him? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing at all to make any impression on his mind, one way or the other? - I had not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand there is a written confession.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there a written confession taken? - There was on the 7th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner sign it? - I did, I see him sign something, I cannot say it was this paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there is any body else here that see him sign that paper? - I don't know there is.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this written confession made? - He was taken up on Monday the 6th of May, the confession was made on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the other confession made that you was talking of before? - That was on Monday morning the 6th of May, he came to me, to the counting house, and said that he was the person who had robbed the desks; I had sent for him into the counting house and asked him why he went out on the Sunday without my leave. On the Saturday, previously, I questioned him how he came by such and such clothes and he had often been flush of money, I did not know that it was with my own money; I questioned him how he came by such and such clothes, he having laid out about twenty five pounds, I asked him where he had got the money? he replied, from a Mr. Law the third officer in the ship Cornwallis and whom he sailed with, and with Mr. Hodgson; he said that he had had various sums at different times but could not tell within ten or fifteen pounds how much he had had of Law, Saturday evening I forbid him to go out of my house on the Sunday without my leave. On the Sunday morning I got access to Mr. Law and he denied every thing that the prisoner said; on his coming into the counting house on Monday morning, I asked him why he went out the Sunday contrary to my express approbation? he said he had been to

               <p>Q. The house and the warehouse adjoins? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. The rent of the house is it borne by you or all your partners? - I am the landlord of the whole, and I charge the trade with a certain portion of the rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the dwelling house, your dwelling house, is paid for by all the partners? - I pay for the whole in the first instance, and I charge to the trade for the proportion of the rent.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you charge any proportion for the dwelling house? - Not for the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this counting house? - In the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Which it is paid for by the trade? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it all under one roof? - It all adjoins.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the only person that dwell there? - Yes, I consider myself as the master, but the other partners dwell there occasionally.</p>
               <p>Court. Then that takes it out of the act.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At first when you suspected the prisoner I think it was on Saturday the 4th of May? - That was the first time I had any conversation, I suspected him previously.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday evening you stated to me before, that you had no sort of conversation with the prisoner? - Not in the evening; I had a great deal in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying this to him, that the best way to save you the trouble, and the prisoner the disgrace, would be for him to confess that he had robbed you, for now is the time for to stand or fall? - I never said any such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to that effect? - I am positive I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday following did you promise or say any thing at all about shewing him mercy? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing like this, that if he could find any friend that could make up the money the matter should be hushed up? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you before you suspected him at all? - He came to us in May 1792, and I did not suspect him till after this deficiency was found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to recollect whether when he came to you from captain Hodgson, he did not come with an exellent character? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that of Massey, you had entertained suspicions of him, and in point of fact he had been discharged? - Not in consequence of dishonest suspicion; I had given him notice to quit our service before that, but he did not quit it without suspicion, because he could not account for these deficiencies.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290019"/>Q. After his discharge and before any suspicions fell on the prisoner, had there not been a considerable number of deficiencies and mistakes happen? - Never since Massay was discharged there was no mistake, but before there was reason to suspect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect having any conversation with the prisoner at the bar on Monday before you went to the magistrate's? - None but what I have related.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no conversation of this sort, I am in hopes that captain Hodgson will come forward and make up matters, to which you answered, if captain Hodgson will do that I am satisfied? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not some conversation about six or seven o'clock in the evening when captain Hodgson and Mr. Barvis was present on Monday? - I do recollect we had some conversation in the afternoon, we were in the parlour together, and Roberts said he was a bad fellow, and deserved any punishment that should be inflicted on him, and that he would suffer the punishment due to his crimes.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would be kind enough to recollect again, for I have it in my instructions said, that you made a promise of some sort of favour or held out a favour to this man? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose means did you discover that he had robbed you? - By his own confession alone.</p>
               <p>Q. He came then voluntarily to you and acknowledged himself to be guilty of a capital crime; then it did not proceed from any conversation that you had with him, but he came to you point blank at once? - He did, point blank at once, without any sort of inducement, promise or threat.</p>
               <p>Jury. There had been some conversation respecting his clothes? - There had, but that was on Saturday the 4th.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say that he made the confession without any sort of inducement held out by you? - He did so; and said what I have said already.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any recommendation to him to tell the truth if he was guilty, or to that effect, or that you would not prosecute him if he would tell who was the thief? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. So then there never was any promise of reward, or promise of screening him from justice, or any thing to that effect? - There never was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then I am sure the man must be a madman.</p>

               <p>Q. You did go before Mr. Alderman Wright? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who attended there? - Mr. Borradaile.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th then every thing was settled, and you was discharged before the Alderman? - I was totally to Mr. Borradaile's satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Q. So well satisfied that he kept you seven days after. How came you to keep all this so snug from your master? - By the advice of the head clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the person that invested you with the cash? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. So you chose to pursue the advice of the head clerk instead of going to your master? - I thought the head clerk would advise me to the best.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it was very odd to lose till it amounted to the tune of one hundred and twelve pounds? did you not think it extraordinary that he should give you this advice? - I did not know his reason, the only reason he gave me was that Mr. Borradaile would think it very careless of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he, in order to screen you, advised you not to tell your master; so he and you kept it snug to yourselves till it amounted to one hundred and twelve pounds? - No, it was known to others in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by this man's confession when you came into the parlour on Monday? - Mr. Borradaile said, do you choose to confess before Massey what you have said just now? He then said, yes; and he told the story.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till then in your presence? - Not till then.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you discharged? - On the 25th of March.</p>




               <p>Q. Seven days after you had been before the alderman.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. alderman Wright and Gill, and Co in Abchurch-lane. In October last my brother went into the service of Mr. Borradaile; Mr. Borradaile put him under his head clerk, soon after he lost the sum of fifteen pounds; after it was the sum of one hundred and twelve pounds he told me, and Mr. Borradaile insisted on my brother's making it up; I went to Mr. Borradaile on purpose that an investigation might be made; Mr. Borradaile wished to know what kind of an investigation; would wish to have made of the matter; I told him, and my brother went before Mr. Alderman Wright with Mr. Borradaile, but not as that gentleman has represented it, he was not lugged by a constable but Mr. Wright sat as an arbitrator, not as the justice, the matter was determined to Mr. Borradaile's satisfaction, and Mr. Borradaile said he had no farther to look to my brother. On the 6th of May my brother and I were sent for to Mr. Borradaile's, when the prisoner confessed that he had taken the whole of the money that Mr. Borradaile had lost out of his desk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Borradaile insisted on your brother making up the deficiency? - He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290021"/>Q. Where was Mr. Alderman Wright when he heard the parties as arbitrator? - In his parlour at Abchurch-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room at Mr. Borradaile's the same time as your brother did on Monday? - We all were in together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard something that your brother has stated that the prisoner said; will you state the particular words that Mr. Borradaile said to him? - Now Roberts will you state before Massey what you told me? and then he said that he had taken all the money that my brother had lost from his desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday morning Mr. Borradaile asked me where I got the clothes? I said I got the money of Mr. Law; he said he missed a good deal of money; I told him I was very sorry he suspected me; he said he would give me one hour to confess it in. On Saturday evening he called me up again and told me that he had seen Mr. Tomlinson, and Mr.

             said again that he had missed the money, and the best way would be to save him trouble, and me disgrace, to confess whether I had or no, and by that I should stand or fail, and he desired me to stop at home on Sunday; I went out thinking it was a liberty I had always took since I had been in the house. On Monday morning Mr. Borradaile came into the counting house about a quarter of an hour after, he then told me that if I would confess to the money being taken he would make up matters with captain Hodgson, and I should not hear any thing of it more.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of Dowgate Ward. On Sunday morning the 14th of April at a quarter before six I was standing at the corner of the Mansion House, near to Lombard-street, the prisoner at the bar passed me as I stood at the corner, he had this bag under his arm, he was dressed in a porter's dress, and I thought it rather looked odd to have this bag under his arm at that time in the morning, he crossed the street and went by the Bank, up Threadneedle-street; I followed him up into Threadneedle-street; I got up to him, says I, young man what have you got here? he said he had got pepper; I asked him where he was going with it? he said, he was going to the Vine Inn, Bishopsgate; it was to go into the country; I asked him where the directions were? he said, he had lost it; I asked him how the waggoner could know where to take it to without directions? he said the man knew where to take it to; I asked him what weight it was? he said he could not tell; I asked him where he brought it from? he said he brought it from a grocer's in Bread-street, I told him it had a very bad look, I was afraid he had not come honestly by it, I would wish him to go back with me to see if it was right or wrong; he said very well; he came a little way back and then began to hang<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290022"/>back, and desired I would let him go; I told him I could not think of letting him go by no means; he said he would give me his watch or any thing; I told him I should not let him go, I was a constable, and I took charge of him; when we were going back opposite the Bank he said it did not come from Bread-street, it came from Mr. Whitmell's in Cannon-street; I said, I know Mr. Whitmell very well; how could you get it out that time in the morning? he said, the carman got up to go with the horses, and he followed him out, that he was a porter in the house, and to the best of my knowledge, he said he lived in the house; I then put him into the Poultry Compter, and about eight o'clock I went to Mr. Whitmell's, and I sent word up to him by the servant that I would be glad to see him, and he came to me at last, and I informed him of the matter; I have had the property in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I understand you to say, that he said, he got it of the grocer's in in Bread-street? - He told me, to the best of my knowledge, that he was a porter there in Bread-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards he told you he belonged to Mr. Whitmell's? - He did, and I told him I knew Mr. Whitmell very well.</p>

I told him no, he might have it at the last house in the railing, and I watched him on to see if he went in, seeing him not go in, but to make up to his companions, and they shuffling on together and looking back, gave me a suspicion, I went in and missed my watch, I came out and gave the alarm; they were pursued after, and the one that took the watch came back to a public house and called for some bread and cheese, and beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go into the house? - I did not, I was told by one that see him go in there; I went and see him there, and left him there and went home, I had young children at home, and I wanted to get home to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken? - Between the hours of two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them? - I cannot say, he was kept there till the other two men were brought to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. You are a married woman you say? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been out? - About the space of four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hang the watch there? - It hung there always.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it there when you went out? - Yes, because I left the chair just by it, and I saw it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that you saw it there, or only surmise it was there from being usually hung there? - I saw it there.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was this you saw Collyer at? - A public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was this from your house? - About an hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was that place you found the watch to the place where you saw the man? - They went up to the top of the wall and turned round, and it lay at the top of the wall, about twenty yards from where the crow laid; Short and Steele were the men that I saw up there.</p>

               <p>Court to Knowles. You did not tell me the day of the month, or the day of the week? - I cannot be positive, but I think it was the 5th of April, I think it was Thursday night; it was Friday morning I lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Taylor. The prisoner came to me on the 9th of May, Thursday, came to town to me and asked me to go to Mr. Heather to ask the value of this watch; he stopped and stayed with my horses the while; it was neither offered to be pawned nor sold.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to ask the value of it? - I went to oblige the prisoner. Mr. Heather looked at the watch and asked if I wanted to sell it; I made answer, no, and I asked him if it was worth five guineas? he looked at the watch and asked me how I came by it, and where I got it, where I stole it? and stopped me in the shop till the prisoner came in and then we were taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. It seems the prisoner held your horses while you went to enquire the value of this watch; did he direct you to sell it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not on your own account offer to pawn it or sell it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon was the prisoner taken up afterwards? - In about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was detained by Mr. Heather did you give any account of the prisoner? - I was detained two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when you was detained by Mr. Heather, did you give any account to Mr. Heather that the prisoner was holding your horses - I did, and I told him I had the watch of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner taken? - He was taken in the shop; he was sent for, and we were both taken together in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you both charged with this robbery before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was discharged I suppose? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Taylor the last witness brought the watch into my shop to know the value of it; from seeing of him I asked him a good many questions how he came by it and where he got it? and I suspected from what he said that he did not know any thing about it; I sent my servant privately to Bow-street to get a constable, and when the constable came I gave him charge of him; then he said he had the watch of a man that was with his coach three or four doors off, waiting with his coach and horses; then I sent the constable and my servant to tell the man to come; the prisoner at the bar said that he gave this man the watch, for him to ask the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When your servant went after the prisoner, in what way did he come to your house? - He came directly with my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass that is material to state? - He said he found it in the necessary house, on the seat; I searched them both at Bow-street, and there they were examined; the coachman was discharged to take care of his horses; the other man acknowledged that he gave it the coachman to ask the price of it at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the watch after that? - I have kept it in my custody ever since, (Produced) it is a metal watch gilt with gold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Then it was not offered to you either to pawn or sell? - This Taylor said he was to give five guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner came willingly to your shop when you sent for him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether he was a servant, or in what capacity he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. He was an assistant to the hostler at the Red Lyon-Inn, Kew Bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heather. The prisoner had a direction where to go with the watch to get the two guineas reward, it was found when he was searched; I saw it and read it.</p>
               <p>- RUTHEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrole under the direction of Mr. Addington; I was sent for to Mr. Heather's shop; this young man and the prisoner were in the shop at the time, and I was desired to take them to Bow-street; this bit of paper was found in his pocket where to take the watch to get the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. It is the direction I left with the landlord. (The watch deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat to Heather. Did the other man say before the prisoner that the prisoner wanted to sell it for five guineas? - No, it was before the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I meant for the gentleman to have the watch, and I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I am a washerwoman. On the 29th of April I was sitting out at my own street door on Monday between eight and nine in the morning; I live opposite Mr. Hughes in the same street; I saw a woman running out of Mr. Hughes's house, and Mrs. Hughes crying out, O dear, Mrs. Fox, that woman has got something out of our house; I ran after her and cried stop thief; I did not lose sight of her till I stopped her; she ran down a coach yard, just as I came up to her she threw down the bundle, it was tied up in a black silk handkerchief; I picked up the bundle and told her to come along with me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she detained then? - She was; I carried the bundle to the justice, and the constable has it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the bundle again? - Yes, they were all the articles in the indictment, except two, which were taken out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>- SANDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to Marlborough-street; I am an extraordinary constable; I was sent for; I received the bundle of Mrs. Fox before the magistrate; when we took her to the watch-house I searched her, and I took an apron from before her, and this muslin handkerchief came out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Owens. After the alarm, were the things brought back with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them back? - Mrs. Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these articles, see if you know them? - They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. These things were given to me by a woman that was up in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Owen. Did not you hear that there was another woman? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to my house on the 1st of May, I believe it was a Thursday, to sell a table spoon, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I saw it broke, and I judged the prisoner might have stole it; I asked him a good many questions; he said he had it of his father about nine years ago; with that I said to my servant, go and search him, and see if he has got any more, he heard me say that to my servant and he immediately ran out of the shop, and my servant ran after him and brought him back, with great difficulty we stopt him and searched him and found two more table spoons and a pair of salts, all broke, my servant took them out of his pocket before my face; he struggled a good while, and wanted to get away, but I searched him and sent for a constable; I have kept them from that time to this, except a little time, I marked them with my own mark; I can swear to them; the young man's master was sent for, Mr. Screen, he is a private gentleman, and he blamed the man, and asked him why he did not go and sell them at his own silversmith's and not to bring them to my shop? but when he found they were stole he was very sorry for what he had said, and said I had done right; a Mr. Hughes went to sup with Mr. Screen the next night, and Mr. Screen told him that his servant was taken up for stealing three silver table spoons, and the next day there was some table spoons brought from the family which corresponded with these the prisoner brought; I advertised them the next day. (The spoons produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Box. Do you know whether these spoons were in the house at the time you left the house? - I do, they were then in the beaufet, they had been used for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on you to say for a certainty that the spoons were there? - I can; the three table spoons and a pair of salt spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked or left open? - It was locked, but the key was left in it; it was the custom of the house so to do; they have all my mistress's cypher on them, I. E. D.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss more than those? - No more than those found exactly.</p>

I said I left it to him; he said he had a six-pence; I said I never was with a gentleman for six-pence; he then said he had a shilling, and after he had connection he wanted the shilling back again, and I said I would not give it him; so he knocked me down and gave me a black eye, and made me bleed, and the other woman came to my assistance; as for the knife I had it to cut a bit of bread and cheese.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now over night you marked a certain number of guineas, you put them in a purse, and took a list; when you again came into the dressing room did you again take the guineas and compare them with the list? - I did not exactly campare them with the list then, but I found them right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them right from your recollection, or from actual comparison? - By my recollection. On the 22d of April I took a list of these guineas, but I did not examine them by the list the next morning, but I found them all right before she came in to light the fire; immediately as she left the room I went and examined them again and I found one missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say for a certainty, and are you sure that there was any one less than there was before? - Yes, there was. I went down the stairs, called the prisoner to me, and told her to give me the guinea she took out of lady Elizabeth's purse; she denied having taken any; I then told her to shew me what money she had in her pocket, and she pulled out a guinea, which I had marked, and I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept that guinea separate? - Yes, I have, I then sent the housekeeper up stairs to lock up her room, and sent for one of the Bow-street officers; Mr. Kennedy came, she gave up the keys of her boxes, and I had them searched, and I found this piece of lace, I believe it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290037"/>belongs to me, I missed just such a piece, and have compared it with some others, and it suits exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it out of her box? - No, Mr. Kennedy did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you found it? - I meant to say that I sent for Mr. Kennedy and he searched the box.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had taken down a list on paper of a number of guineas which you put into Mrs. Palk's purse? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There is but one guinea in dispute? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you looked at a number of guineas the next morning? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your recollection now serve you to be accurate whether it was fourteen or fifteen? - I have not looked at the list; I cannot be positive now; I know there was one missing by the list, and I will tell you how, when I found one guinea missing I compared the rest with the list; I marked them down as I took them out of the purse; I found one missing; I took notice of the mark on that, and I found it answered exactly with the one on the list that was wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you know they were correct by the list when you did not take the trouble of comparing? - My memory may be indifferent, but it would serve me for a dozen hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray in whose pocket had this purse been? - in nobodys pocket but lady

               <p>On the 1st of April last I was in the stable in same Mews; I left the stable for about five minutes, I went to borrow a truss of hay at the next stable, and when I returned I met the prisoner coming out of the stable with a coachman's frock in an apron under his arm; I throwed down the truss of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290040"/>hay from my back and ran and catched him by the collar; then he desired me to let him go, I would not let go; he said there was somebody at the top of the mews wanted to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did he speak english? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he understand what you said to him? - Yes. And then he offered me his money and watch if I would let him go; I told him I did not want any thing of the kind, he should go back along with me to the stable, for he had got something more in his bag; I got him back to the stable and then I sent for somebody to come to my assistance, and then I sent to the house to let them know what had happened, and then they sent for the constable and he was taken to Marlborough-street; the constable emptied his bag and there was the coachman's great coat in the bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came through the street I called clothes, and as I came along to this door this man laid hold of me, two minutes after I had bought this great coat, and this man came up and seized me by the collar, and I told him if he would go back with me to the place I would shew who I bought it of.</p>

(The watch produced and deposed to by Mr. Moore.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out of place, and I was told of one at Maidenhead, and I went down, and when I came to enquire for it, it did not suit them to keep any other than that they had got; I saw a chaise at the Sun, at Maidenhead; the chaise belonged to Slough, I was going to speak to the boy, I was going into the yard, and the gentleman asked me if I belonged to the chaise? I told him, no; says he, call the boy that belongs to it; I went into the yard and I saw the boy speak to him, and the boy and the gentleman came out, and what the agreement was I don't know, but the gentleman told him to give me a glass of liquor I went in and had it, it was a glass of rum; afterwards the boy and I had another, the gentleman told us to have it, the gentleman got into the chaise, and I was going to get on the box of the chaise, and he desired me to get inside; we came to Slough, and the same chaise went on with a pair of fresh horses; the gentleman told me to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290044"/>on his great coat, and I picked up this watch in the bottom of the chaise; whether it belonged to this gentleman or any other I did not know, therefore I was willing to keep it till it was advertised, or I was recompenced for it.</p>
               <p>Court. You heard the gentleman talk about losing his watch? - No, not till we got to the Hotel, the gentleman then said he lost a gold watch, and this was a watch in a green case, and whether it did belong to him or no I did not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You say you was a good deal in liquor? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you did not drop the watch at the bottom of the chaise? - I am pretty confident I did not; I am not quite.</p>

               <p>I work at Mr. Cooper's, coal-dealer, No. 15, Great Shire-lane; I was in my master's shop on Saturday evening about six o'clock; I heard an outcry of stop thief! I looked out and saw a great many people coming up, and a young man came up before me; there was a young man attempted to stop him, and I saw the prisoner push him down; he was meeting him; then I jumped out of the shop, catched the prisoner by the collar and stopped him, and then took him to Mr. Akerman's in Butcher-row, and they kept him till the constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You took him and delivered him to a constable; you found nothing on him? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. He ran against the man that you described, and the man ran against him? - The man wanted to catch hold of him, and he shoved him down.</p>

            's in Butcher-row; Brace gave charge of him, with feloniously breaking into his apartments; I took the prisoner up stairs into his apartments and searched him, and found nothing but one small key and three pennyworth of halfpence; there was a pair of sheets folded up and a pair of boots lay on the top of them, and the beds were turned down.</p>
               <p>Court to Brace. How many beds were there in the room? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheets on the bed in the common way when you left the room? - They were; the beds were regularly made; when I returned, I came home and I looked at the prisoner in the lower part of the house, and then went up stairs, and found each of the beds turned down from the blankets, and there was a pair of sheets lay on a heap on my own bed, and the boots which lay in the side of the room were put on them; when I went out they were on a box, on the side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not leave them on the sheets? - I am clear I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether the sheets were removed or the boots while you was out you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is a capital charge that will affect the man's life? - On my oath I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not learned it since you came into this court? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that there is a forty pounds reward on the conviction of house breakers? - I have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that if this man is convicted you will be entitled to a proportion of it? - I am not throughly acquainted with the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that there is a forty pounds reward, and that people that give their evidence are entitled to a share of it; if this man is convicted don't you know that you will be entitled to share in the reward? - I don't wish to look after my property in such a light; I don't know I should be entitled to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean then to take any share in this reward? - I don't wish to get my bread in this line.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290048"/>Q. If this man is convicted do you mean to refuse to take any share of it? - Sir, I have not come here with that view.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer. Do you mean to refuse your share in the reward if this man is convicted? - Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you understand me? - I have not come hear with that view.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer before I have done? - I don't think I should take it; nor I am sure I should not; I don't come with that view; I thank God I think I can do without it; I don't want any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You come hear then purely for the sake of justice? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to the Constable. It was a small key you found on the prisoner? - It was. There were two other keys in the room, and a screw driver, one of which opened the door very well, and which a person in the room observed the prisoner endeavouring to put into his pocket; this person was in the room when I went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first find the prisoner? - In the shop below stairs; I took him and led him up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys had that man of him? - Two, one of which unlocked the door perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between the prisoner and that man about the keys? - Not in my presence. The prisoner denied knowing any thing about them when I asked him to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it appeared that this other had keys about him, one of which opened the door, and which he talked about to the prisoner, and the prisoner denied knowing any thing about them? - He did. The person at Bow-street declared on oath that he had the keys of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man in the house had a pair of boots of mine to sole and heel, he lodged in the garret; I went up to see if they were done, just as I came to the landing place I saw a man run out, and the woman after him, he ran down Shire-lane, and the woman after him; I was there after him to see what it was, and just as I got to the coal shed the man came and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Could a man with tolerable ease get in and out? - Yes, by making a little effort and spring on the outside. On searching my drawers I missed several things.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the room on your return? - In the same state I left it, except these drawers which had been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these drawers locked when you left them? - The keys were in the drawers. I missed a watch and a pair of buckles and some spoons; there was some linen taken out of the drawers but not taken away; I missed all in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of all the articles you missed? - About five or six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner with this? - He took the things to different pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things in the hands of the pawnbrokers yourself? - Yes, the pawnbrokers are here; one pair of silver buckles I recovered on the afternoon of that day; I received the rest about five or six days afterward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What day do you say this was? - On the first of May.</p>
               <p>Q. You had left your chambers as early as ten o'clock, therefore at what precise time these chambers were robbed you cannot tell? - Only by information.</p>
               <p>Q. Of your own knowledge you cannot say when this robbery was effected, except between ten in the morning and two or three in the afternoon. Have you a laundress? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. The laundress of course has a key to have access to them? - She has.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she had been or not, of course we can know only from her.</p>
               <p>Q. She is not here? - She is not.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know the window might have been left open by her? - It is not very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. She had a power so to have left it? - She never goes into our chambers between the hours of ten and three.</p>
               <p>Q. She had access at any time if she chose it, and whether she did that day or not you cannot say? - I cannot.</p>

            , I was standing last Monday, the 27th of January, in the shop; I heard the breaking of the shop window; looking round I saw the prisoner at the bar with her hand and arm in the window, it was between one and two o'clock in middle of the day.</p>

I jumped over the counter and ran out of doors, and catched hold of her arm; she had got then about a dozen yards from the window; as soon as I got up to her I found these two pair of buckles on her; I catched hold of her and brought her into the shop with these buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember where abouts these two pair of buckles were in the shop? - These two pair of buckles were in the window at the time she broke it; I took them from that hand which arm was all bloody, with the cut, which the force had given when she struck against the glass; I sent for an officer at Bow-street, and had her taken there, and she was committed.</p>

             and I lived fellow servants together, with Mrs. Southo. On Sunday morning the 24th of March the prisoner got up near about seven in the morning, and left me in bed; when I came down I found the door open, and when my mistress and master got up they missed the property, and then we never saw any more of her till the 11th of May; when we were at the office the constable took a pair of stockings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290055"/>off her legs, and an apron off her sides; after that we went to Mrs. Holloway's and found the cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Sunday morning I got up and left my mistress Southo, and went out, and left the door open, and in about two months afterwards I met with the officer, and he said I must go with him to the office, and I never owned any thing, but my master came to me to the prison, and said if I would confess where the things were, so that he might get his property again, I should not be hurted.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Southo. Do you know whether there was any promise made to her or not? - There was not; it is false what she says.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the pocket book was missing the time you caught her hand in your pocket? - It was; it was a red morocco pocket book, and those articles in the indictment were in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no reason to suppose it was taken at any other time? - I had felt but a minute before in my pocket, and found my watch and pocket book safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt it was at this moment you lost your pocket book? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A few shilling. She was searched, there was nothing found on her; she was taken to the house in Bow-street and searched immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was above an hour and a half in custody before ever the pocket book was found, or brought against me.</p>

             my niece brought them in; I have had the care of them since; I have brought them now. (Produces the coat waistcoat and the woollen cloth.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You live in Red Lyon-passage; it is a narrow passage? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. The houses are very close to each other, and an alarm very easily communicates of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you heard no alarm till after the thief had got out of the way, clearly from Miss Price? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was at work in the story immediately over that room from whence the robbery was committed? - No, I was at work in the garret, and this was in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was the alarm communicated to you at first? - My niece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290057"/>hallooed on the stairs, or at the room door, and called up to me, and said I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she call you by name first, and then tell you, you was robbed? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you you was robbed before you came down stairs to her? - Yes, she called me and told me I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. She called, you came down, and then she informed you, you was robbed? - She said, come down, you are robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not call to the neighbours at all, nor threw up the window at all? - I believe she ran down after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether your niece did not describe to you, that the person who had robbed you had thrown her down in the room, and held a knife over her, and threatened her if she made any alarm? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. You called Mr. Macphaile over, and he came over? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether when you saw that bed, it had any signs of any person being thrown down on it, and whether Mr. Macphaile did not say so in the face of your niece who told this story? - He has represented it so, he has hinted something of that kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Now we come about hints. Has not he said so to you? - He said he should wish to speak what he knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that, that was part of what he knew, that your niece had told a story, because there was no marks of violence on the bed? - He said he should wish to be on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason? - He is to give his reasons I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he so hint to you? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not he so express to you in the room, in the presence of your niece; you must not shelter your niece, though, she is your niece? - He did not say so at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? did not you hear him say so? - After that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - He said he should wish to come on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. That is very different. When was it he told you that he observed there were no marks of violence on the bed, that your niece said she had been thrown down upon? - I cannot exactly recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after your niece's story was it? - It was not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we talk about hinting, I believe it is not the first time your niece has hinted that you was robbed? - I never was robbed before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no house in which you have lived in robbed before? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your mother been robbed? - It was not my mother, it was a cousin of mine, who lives in the same house of Mr. Macphaile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she accuse your cousin who was proved before all the world to be innocent? How many times has your niece made accusations of robbery against other persons, which have proved to be unfounded? - I never heard of any but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Never heard of any but that, and there every body was convinced that your niece told a story on the business? - That does not concern me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this man very well known in that neighbourhood? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he bear a very excellent character in that neighbourhood? - I don't know nothing to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he was extremely respected and bears a good character? - He was no acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not heard a very good character given of him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290058"/>in that neighbourhood? though the answer comes with difficulty I will have it? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it is matter of recollection? have not you been told by all the neighbours that he bears a good character? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear they did not tell you? why that man that you accuse is as honest a man as any in the neighbourhood? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know one way or the other. You heard no alarm of this till this matter was over? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was about six o'clock in broad day light, in a place where the man was well known.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the niece of Mr. Hatch; I live with him; he was robbed on Tuesday the 7th of May; the prisoner at the bar came and rang the bell at the door below, about six o'clock, and I went down to him, and he asked me if Mrs. Hatch was at home? I told him, no; and then he asked me if Mr. Hatch was within? and I told him yes; and then he went away, and I shut the street door after him and came up stairs, and I was at the fire place when he came in to Mr. Hatch's room, up one pair of stairs; the street door stands on a latch, and then he shut the middle door that goes into the front room, there is a back room and a front room, and the middle door is between the two rooms, and he left the back room wide open, and then I got away from the fire place and got to the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the foot of the bed? - I knew it was the man that had been talking with me at the street door. Then he tosses me on the bed; then I thought to have hallooed when he pushed me down on the bed; but he produced his knife, the knife had two blades, he opened it and he called me an impudent hussey, and said if I dare to halloo he would cut my throat from ear to ear; then I laid still, and heard him go to the drawer, it was the second drawer, he took out a red waistcoat, and piece of cloth, and a green coat, and as for the third drawer I cannot say, because I cannot say I was quite sensible when he went to it; then he went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with these things? - He took them with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any table cloth? - Yes, there were three table cloths missing; I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a callico gown? - I do; that was mine I did not see him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a wooden box, a check apron and five shillings in money? - I don't know any thing of them; they were missing; they were all in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they missing from the drawers? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about this at the time - I made the alarm when he was gone as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see on that alarm? - I saw a good many people; I saw my uncle, he came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man pursued at all at the time? - No, not then, nobody went after him then; my uncle was undressed, not fit to go after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other people undressed? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it nobody went after him? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of these things again? - Yes. On the 10th of May, I let my brother in at the street door at twelve o'clock from school, there came a man by and asked me if I was the person that had swore that innocent young man's life away? I told him I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290059"/>know what he meant; then he said if I would go along with him he would give me some of the property back again; and another man came up, a bricklayer's labourer, and he said that I had no need to be frightened, I will see you safe there and back again; then I went with the man to fetch the clothes, when this bricklayer's labourer came up, I went along with him, and I went to a house in Eagle-street, across Red Lyon-square, and when I went in, this bricklayer's labourer left me to this other man, and the man gave me the green coat, a piece of cloth and a red waistcoat, and there came some bad women up in the room, and they bid him to let me go about my business; then I came home with the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you follow? - My uncle keeps me.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the other articles have ever been found, have they? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have told this story several times have you not? So this was about six o'clock? - It was near there.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Macphaile lives very near opposite to you? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner rang the bell and you went down; how was he dressed? - He was dressed in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a light coloured coat? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go when you told him your aunt was not at home? - I cannot say; I shut the door immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What lock has it? - A latch only.</p>
               <p>Q. It was but a very few minutes when you saw him again? - I had but just got up stairs to the fire place, and then I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. The door of this back room communicates with the stair case? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the door of this back room would enable you to have gone up to your uncle's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came in, was not you a good deal surprised that he should come in? - Yes, I was, I knew it was him that I had left at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him what he came for? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that happen? - It surprised me to I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a good deal alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray as you was alarmed, why did did not you call out for your uncle? - Why when he shut the middle door I thought I could get out of the middle door.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first came in he shut the middle door; you was by the fire place at this time, the back door was open, but instead of moving to the door you moved to the bed? - The bed faces the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of going up stairs to your uncle you went to the bed? - I got to the bed post; he would not give me time to get out; when he saw me going out, by that he pushed me on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was going out at the back door; how came it you did not tell us this before? - I was going strait to get out, and he pushed me strait on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say that you went and laid hold of the bed post? - I said I got to the bed post.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have got to the back room door? - Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as you was alarmed and could have got to the back room door, why did not you? why should you stop at the bed? - I made an attempt to go to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not the direct way from the fire place to the back room? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290060"/>Q. There you stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By this attempting to push you you stopped? - I cannot say, I might stop at the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not stop at the bed before he attempted to push you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you? - I don't know upon my word.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure I cannot guess the reason; this frightened you of course. Did not you scream out as every girl does who is frightened? - No, he said if I dare to halloo out he would cut my throat from ear to ear.</p>
               <p>Q. But before this it takes some time before he can say all these words and produce his knife, you never saw any thing of the knife then? - When he pushed me on the bed, he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out his knife, and opened both blades.</p>
               <p>Q. So here he stood, first of all, having made the threat, he opens both the blades, and there you see him in the operation, opening both the blades, one would not do for the purpose? - I see him open both.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much alarmed, after this you had hardly your senses about you? - I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you say you particularly noticed him taking out a great coat a waistcoat, and the piece of cloth; you particularly observed from what drawer he took it, this coat, waistcoat and piece of cloth from, that it was the second drawer, though you was in this alarm, losing your senses by the fright of two blades he had produced, yet you saw him take those things, particularly as you was laying flat on the bed at this time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your face thrown on the bed? - I laid flat on my back.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not dare to rise yourself for fear he should cut your throat. Now I ask you by what possible direction your eyes could see that second drawer from the bottom? - But I did see the second drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you did; but we must know how you could do it; the bed was higher than the second drawer at the bottom? - Our bed is very low.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps your bed is not so high from the ground as the first drawer of that pair of drawers? - I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the bed is not higher from the ground than the first drawer of that pair of drawers; is it not higher than the second drawer? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you in what possible manner you could see any thing, laying flat on your back on this bed? - Ours is a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. In what possible direction could your eyes see the second drawer of that chest of drawers. Leaving that to be reconciled in the minds of the jury; where were the rest of the things taken from? - From the third drawer from the top.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - I did not, I was down in a sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I assure you in your examination at Bow-street you made no more scruple in swearing to what he took from the third drawer than from the second? - (the information read) They did not ask whether I was sensible or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my girl he ran down stairs with these things; was the back room door which communicates with the stair case, open all the time this was going on? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man had the precaution to shut the middle door, but not the door by which every one must see what was going on who went up stairs? - We have no lodgers except up in the garret. He shut the middle door because he knew the neighbours could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290061"/>Q. How long was he gone before you communicated any alarm? - He was not gone long, about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps ten? - I don't think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing you did when you got up? - I hallooed to my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not run and throw up the window, and call out stop thief in the court? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you stayed somewhere between five and ten minutes, and then went to the back room door and called to your uncle; did he come directly? - He did not come down till the second call; and I was at the street door when he came down; I first of all called uncle, and then ran down and called again uncle; I called out, uncle you are robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your brother all this time? - My brother had that minute gone up with the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call to your brother? - I did not; he was not so big as me; he had just gone up before the man had rang at the bell, and my brother was coming down to the bell when I got up stairs, he came out of the garret when the man rung the bell; he had left the iron up in the garret, for I had gone up stairs, and the man was gone, and I sent word up to my uncle, by my brother, that it was somebody wanted my aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm to the people in the street, at this second time, before your uncle came down? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before your uncle came down you had given an alarm in the street, and there was a great mob came, that you are sure of; I thought you had called out uncle after the mob had come round? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think it was between your calling uncle the first time and the second? - The instant I got off the bed, I called uncle then, then uncle did not hear what I said, then I went straight to the door hallooing out, uncle, thieves! I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came up on this? - There was nobody else to come but those below stairs, Mr. and Mrs. Walden, and they came out at the time my uncle came down, and then the mob came about.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the mob Mr. Macphaile came over? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Macphaile came up in the room, where the robbery had been committed, what did he see? - He see what had been done without my telling of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that he had thrown you on the bed? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon your oath did not Mr. Macphaile say, there is no mark of any person being on that bed? - This was the remark he made to me at the time, he lifted his hands and said that he never saw such a cruel thing in his life; he did not say till two days afterwards that there was no mark on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody else remarked it at all? - No soul.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he say and where, that there was no mark of violence on the bed? - It was below where he lives, at Mr. Johnson's, he is Mr. Johnson's lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that he said so; did you hear him? - I did not. What I heard was that he told his landlord so below.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the neighbours have been cruel enough to intimate some suspicions that the robbery was done by a relation of Mr. Hatch's? - Yes, so they have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mr. Macphaile got into a sad scrape for making this expression? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he has been ill treated, and ill used in consequence of having made use of that expression? - I know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very glad of it. Don't you know he was extremely ill used? - I never knew he was ill used. Mr. Gammon's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290062"/>niece has lost a gown at Mr. Johnson's, and the next morning I see Mr. Macphaile's sister-in-law come out with a bundle in her lap.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not using Mr. Macphaile ill. Don't you know that your uncle has told you that Mr. Macphaile has been ill used because he has thrown out that hint? - I never heard any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard it from your uncle, or from some of your relations that they have treated Macphaile ill for what he said? - I have not heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my girl at the time you gave this alarm to the neighbours, was there any pursuit made after the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you seen him out about that neighbourhood before? - No, I had not, only his being such a remarkable man that made me look so much at him; he was in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly not a blue coat then? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken up when? - Two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q It was after that, that these things were brought back to you? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Your uncle did not pursue after the man at all at the time the robbery was committed, and the reason was he was undressed and not fit to go after him, that was the only reason? - It was; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. The mob about the place were not undressed? - But they did not attempt to pursue.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much surprised certainly at these barbarous neighbours, Your uncle, you mean, to say had the knees of his breeches unbuttoned, and his coat and shoes off, but your neighbours were dressed. Did not you think it was cruel, it was a great pity; advise your uncle the next time to have his shoes on. The neighbours have been so unkind as to impute it to some part of your own family? - They have.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had just let your brother in, and a man came up and asked you if you was the girl that had swore that innocent young man's life away? Did you call your brother to hear what the man said? - I told him I did not know what he meant; he said if I would go along with him he would shew me the things; he came alone, he was not in company with any body, there came up a bricklayer's labourer, at the same time, as I took him to be.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. He came alone, you wanted somebody to protect you. Did you desire your brother to step up stairs to your uncle? - My brother had gone up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as you did not like to trust yourself alone, did not you call out to your uncle? - This bricklayer's labourer came up and he offered to see me safe.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come up till the man had done talking and you was afraid to trust yourself along with him. Pray how came the bricklayer's labourer, as the man had done talking to you, to come up and offer to protect you? - He might be a friend of the man's who had been talking to me; I was crying, because I thought it was too much to go by myself, I thought it was something so flattering.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why not call Mr. Walden to go with you? - I did not think any thing about Mr. Walden.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Walden you know could have protected you? - He told me I must go alone with him; he said if I would go along with him alone he would help me to my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this bricklayer's labourer to be suffered to go along with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290063"/>you? Have you ever seen that bricklayer's labourer again? - Never have.</p>
               <p>Q. Eagle-street runs at the back of Red Lion-passage? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Eagle-street runs from Red Lion-street to Gate-street? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are at twelve o'clock at noon. At what house in Eagle-street did you go? Have you ever fixed on that house, or have you ever been able to tell what house that was? - No, I cannot tell what house it was, because when I came out I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not at all frightened going there? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You told your uncle you was there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your uncle then say, shew me the house that we may get the rest of the property? Pray does not your uncle's brother and sister live in Eagle-street? - I have heard a young man say so; my uncle's sister does not speak to me, because she owes me a great spite.</p>
               <p>Q. However this house is in Eagle-street, and you have heard a young man say that your uncle's sister lived in Eagle-street, and at that time. Now your uncle is out, pray tell us where this sister of his lives. Who told you that she lived there? - One Mr. Baker said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your uncle's brother live? - He has no brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a brother-in-law? - He knows nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not he live in Eagle-street? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He knows where to find your uncle and your uncle's premises? - I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that Wood's wife was at your uncle's the other day? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Mr. Wood's wife knows where your uncle lives, how came you to tell us that Mr. Wood did not know? - They do not live together; my uncle's sister is a very bad girl, and they have not lived together a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you got to the house there were a number of bad women there, perhaps you was so much frightened if she had been there you would not have known her? - I don't know whether I should have known her or no; but I think I had my senses about me just enough to know her and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. So then they gave you these things and you came back. Did you tell any part of this story at Bow-street? - My uncle went back to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you give account of this at Bow-street? - I have not been there since the things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things brought back before he was taken up or after? - After he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now my girl this is not the first you have accused of a robbery? - I did say that I saw the woman come out with a bundle, and the people said she had not been out all the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never accused any body else with a robbery? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that this man was taken up? - I believe the second day after the robbery; the man was in prison when the things were found; I recovered the things on Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to insist on it that you never charged any other person with a robbery, except that person that you now mention; remember Mr. Macphaile is here? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hear the girl relate that the robbery was done while she was on the bed? - I did; but the bed was perfectly smooth.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you, with your own eyes, observe it, that it was perfectly smooth? - I communicated it to them all, and had an argument with them on the impossibility of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had an argument with them? - I am; and they wished to evade it.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they cannot possibly be ignorant that they had that argument with you? - I communicated every thing to them as I have to the court, on my oath,</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in this neighbourhood? - Since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least interest in this business, or are you at all related, connected, or any way known to the prisoner? - I am not. About a month prior to this, I heard a person at the door where Mr. Hatch lives, I looked out of window, and a cart was there; after some time a person got up and began to speak, and said they had been tumbled down stairs neck and heels, and she said she was the daughter of Mr. Hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you communicated to them your intention of coming here, to declare the whole truth? - I have; I have been threatened for it by Mr. Johnson; I have been threatened even at this door.</p>
               <p>- CROCKER sworn.</p>
               <p>In consequence of information I apprehended this prisoner; I only produce the knife which the girl swore to at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner? - In Eagle-street near Red Lyon-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you apprehend him? - The 9th of May; I believe this day three weeks; I received the information on the 8th; I apprehended him the next day, by the girl's shewing him me in the street, in Eagle-street, at a door; the information I received from Hatch was, that they had been robbed; I was informed that he was at a club at a house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290067"/>in Dean-street near Holborn; I thought it was not prudent to go there that evening, I would not take him without the girl was positive for I had no warrant; therefore the girl and I went and waited for him, the girl was on one side of the way and I was on the other; I took him into a public house and searched him, and I took out of his pocket a pocket book, and this knife, and a mask, and then I took him to Bow-street, before the sitting magistrate there, the magistrate shewed the knife to the girl and she said it was the knife he held in his hand while she was on the bed; she then said that the prisoner had not on the clothes that he had then, he had a light coat; I went back to his lodgings, and I found that light coloured coat, here are some things I found in the lodgings, a ladle, a crucible, and a dark lanthorn, that I thought proper to bring them away; I took the key out of the pocket of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been an officer a long time at Bow-street? - Near nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you know that you must be consistent in your story, it is your duty certainly; you was examined before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to put the mask in your examination? - I shewed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore to your examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was read over to you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. But there is not a word in it about the mask? - When the clerk is writing he may omit something.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not your duty to attend to your examination that you are to swear to? why did not you tell the clerk you have forgot to put down the mask? Did you swear to finding that mask before the magistrate? - I did at the examination; when I was before the magistrate I produced every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. So you say, but here is a note in which nothing of that kind is mentioned, and you, of all others, are most bound to attend to your oath; it is not a new thing for you to take an oath or sign an examination? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q Now it does not appear in the examination? - I produced it before the magistrate, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Hatch. Look at the coat, waistcoat, and piece of woollen cloth and check apron. - The coat I valued at ten shillings, the waistcoat at six shillings, and the piece of woollen cloth at eighteen shillings, the check apron sixpence; the coat waistcoat and cloth is mine; the coat I can swear to, and I believe the other things,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Crocker. You found nothing else relating to this robbery, nor any property of Mr. Hatch's in this room? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Price. Look at the knife? - It was such a kind of knife as this; the knife had two blades.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean such a kind of knife? - I know it by the blades and handle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You remarked it particularly that you might know it again? - Indeed I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What remark did you make on it? - It looked very bad, having both the blades open.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore because it looked very bad it must be the same knife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at it particularly that you might know it again? - I did look at it particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was so much alarmed, you really had your senses about you to take notice of these blades? - It looked so terribly to have both the blades open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am entirely innocent of the charge laid to me; does it stand to reason, that I should go to commit an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290068"/>outrage on a person I knew very well? Mr. Hatch and I were children together; I was known to the people of the house; I was born in the neighbourhood, and have lived in it twenty eight years; I hope my lord and gentlemen will take my case into consideration, and pronounce me innocent; I have several respectable people who will give me a good character.</p>

Will you be so good as to tell us what day he was at your house? - He was there on the 7th of May, he came there between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, he called on my daughter to go with her into the City to Guildhall, to get a warrant, which my daughter intended to take out; I believe he stayed there about half an hour; my daughter and him set off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your son at that time? - He was not at home; he was out at service; they went out between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, it was about three when he came, and they returned near eight o'clock or half past seven, it was rather dark, he came home with my daughter and stopped in my place some short time, and it was dusk when he went away,</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was this? - Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you never said to any body it was Wednesday? Why are you positive it is Tuesday? - I took particular notice of the day, because of my daughter's going out on the business she was upon.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it for? - For abuse and scandal to my daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the abuse and scandal? - I cannot justly say myself.</p>
               <p>Q. It was hardly a secret to you, what the abuse and scandal was? - I cannot positively say myself what the scandal was; there were many scandalous things said of her.</p>

               <p>Q. You must know? - To be sure it was very scandalous, he said that she had a child by him; and went and exposed her at the public house; it was on that occasion they went for the warrant.</p>

Tell us whether you went to Guildhall together or not, tell the whole story, how far you went together, and the whole of it? - Me and the prisoner, we went straight to Guildhall from my mother's, we went to get a warrant; we then returned home, and in Charter-house-square, on his return, the prisoner met a person whom he knew, he is not here, he was a person I did not know, this was I suppose between five and six o'clock, I suppose so from the length of time and the length of way; from Charter-house-square, we went straight on towards Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other man join you? - No, he only spoke, and after he spoke we parted. At a house near Clerkenwell-green we stopped, at a public house, the prisoner and I we had a pint of ale, he left me and went out to get some ham and bread, I suppose he was gone about a quarter of an hour; I should suppose this was about six o'clock; he returned back with the ham and bread; we set there and eat it, and drank and had another pint of ale to it; from there we went straight across Clerkenwell-green,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290070"/>and in some shop, I believe it is called Mutton-lane, a chandler's shop there he called, and I stopped at the door, he stayed there a few minutes and came out to me, and from there we went straight home to my mother's; at the time I got to my mother's I believe it was between seven and eight o'clock, it began to be dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what coloured coat the prisoner had on at the time he went with you? - It was a blue coat I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the coat, (which Crocker produces) is it at all like the coat he had on? - Not at all; he had on the coat he has on now, all the time he was with me.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to go so round about a way home? - We were not in an immediate hurry to go home, so we took our time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he eat and drink in the house? - No, not after we came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that white coat. - I have seen it before; I have seen the prisoner in it before.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live the corner of Mutton-lane, Clerkenwell; I keep a chandler's shop; I remember the prisoner's calling at my shop the 7th of May between six and seven in the evening, nearer seven than six; he called for to see me and how I did, and how my children did; he is a shoe maker; I asked him in, and he was in the shop, but he said he had a young woman waiting for him, and he could not conveniently stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this was on the 7th of May? - I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the young woman? - I did. Says I, my dear Tommy, why did not you bring her in? I knew his mother; no, madam, says he, I cannot, because I cannot stop indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact, see that he had a young woman with him? - I did; I cannot recollect whether that is the young woman or no, that he had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was near seven o'clock? - Nearer seven than six; he always bore the character of an honest, industrious young fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection what coloured coat he had on? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was this? - Tuesday; the reason of my being so very particular, I am very correct in my tea book.</p>

               <p>Q. How came this business to get into your tea book? - That made me know the day; I was settling the book when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. When do you settle it? - Sometimes once a week, sometimes every other day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it may be some other day; you don't always do that of a Tuesday? - But that made me particular then as to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know this man's mother? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give them on this occasion; tea or coffee? - He stopped but a few minutes with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not let them go away dry handed; did you give them any thing to eat or to drink? - I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290072"/>Q. Did the young woman come in? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not ask her to tea? - Ask her to tea! I had my tea; she did not come in at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought you here to day? - To speak the truth of this young fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Came you here by a subpoena? - Which I was surprised at.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you subpoenaed? - The night before last, I think to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave it behind you? - I put it on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served the subpoena on you? - I was not at home; my maid came for me, and I went home and I saw a young man, and he asked me if I recollected seeing one

I had no money to pay my lodgings, I have been used to sleep on board a ship; I went to sleep on one of the bulks in Covent-garden; I picked up these things on one of the bulks; I took them away with me, thinking they would fetch me a trifle in the morning and going along Drury-lane Mr. Grimes laid hold of me; I have been nine years on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. Whereabouts were these things kept? - In my work shop in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did she get these things from your place? - I really don't know; the door of the shop is kept bolted, and on Monday morning we found it unbolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communications to your work shop exclusive of the dwelling house? - There is a passage through my own house, but that door we generally make a point of shutting at eleven o'clock but that night it might be left open, sometimes it is.</p>

               <p>I am a plaisterer; I saw this man about Mr. Fitzgerald's coach, on Wednesday, the 18th of April, and I saw one of them, Gastrell, go up and take the box coat from the box, the other two were close by; he delivered it to Johnson, and he put it in his apron, and the coat was so big he could not put it in, and they went away with it; they were not taken till the next morning; I was at work in a building, in a garret, and there were no stairs, and I could not go down; I gave the alarm out to a carpenter, who went to Mr. Fitzgerald's coachman, and then they got off in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they strangers to you, or had you seen them before? - I had seen them before, but not to say to know them.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the stable where you see them from the garret? - One hundred and fifty yards I suppose; I cannot speak with certainty, as to the men I take it was Gastrell that took it; I am confident to Johnson; as to the other I cannot positively swear, because I was only looking out of the window, and so far off, not nigh enough to speak to them.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to be so positive to the other? - Because I see him so plain, and I knew him before, better than I did Gastrel.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Johnson after this? - I saw him two days after,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290080"/>when he was at the justice's, at Marlborough-street I was then positive it was the man that had the coat in his apron.</p>

               <p>I am a bricklayer's journeyman; I saw the prisoners go along with Mr. Fitzgerald's great coat, Johnson had it in his apron, they were coming along Baker street; I was at work at the very next door, at the sign of the Globe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Baker-street? - It a great way distance from where they took the coat, not a mile; I saw the coat hang out and I saw a bit of the sleeve; Gastrell was in company with him, they were talking together, they went along a little past me and Johnson turned down Davis-street with the coat in his apron; there were three of them in company, and the other two kept along Baker-street. I went the next day and apprehended them with the constable; Johnson and Gastrell were together at the Spotted Dog, in Oxford-road; the great coat has not been found at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Johnson. If he saw me with the great coat, why did not he stop me? - There was another bricklayer along with me at work, and he persuaded me to have nothing to do with it, he saw him go along the same as I did.</p>

the indictment.</p>


               <p>Q. Which did you see first, the prisoner or the articles? - I took the prisoner myself, in the Hambury, Westminster, the next morning, between the hours of seven and eight, I found some of my property; he told me where it was; it was at Strutton Ground, at the corner of the same street: he had sold the things for a guinea and a half; he went with us, the constable and him, we took him into a coach with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it all? - No, I found the best part of it; the constable has got the property, which was found there, he told me that he broke the box open in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was apprehended, the constable and him told me if the property was found I would be immediately discharged? - Yes, but he would not tell me, he always refused to tell me of some things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he made the discovery? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to discharge him? - Not at that time; I did in the morning as soon as I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you where the things were, did not he expect to be discharged? - Yes, but he never told me; there are a great many things lost, which he never would discover.</p>
               <p>Q. He told me in what manner I should go after them, but I would not go by myself in such a manner, without a constable, he said I should go into a house and, say damn your eyes where are my things, my bed fellow brought into this house, the last night? but he never discovered where it was.</p>
               <p>- BOOTH sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Going of twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been sworn before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you tell a lie, or a story, or swear that, that is false; have you been taught what will become of you? - Go to hell and into everlasting fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Now mind you will be punished here and hereafter if you don't tell exactly what is true? - At half after nine o'clock on Tuesday, that man came to my mammy, I don't know the day of the month, and he asked my mammy for the key of the room to go to bed; then my mammy gave him the key, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290082"/>he went up stairs, and he came down with the box and made a noise in the passage; I ran out and saw him in the street, he was facing a shop where there is a great light, and I saw the box very plain; I ran in and told my mammy as soon as I saw him, and my mammy told me to go and call Mr. Sparing; and I went and called him, and he came down.</p>

I had seen him about a twelve month before, but not to say any thing to him, there was a young man with him; I asked him if they were his own? and he said the things belonged to an acquaintance of his; but I did not ask whether the young man belonged to them or not, he laid them down, and he asked two guineas for them; I told him that the clothes were old, and I could not afford to give him that for them; I gave him a guinea and a half, I did not ask him whether they were his or not.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I produce the property found at Mrs. Daws's, I got it there on Wednesday the day after the robbery was committed; I have kept it ever since. (Produced and deposed to by Mrs. Daws, as the things she purchased; and by Sparing as his property.)</p>
               <p>Sparing. The womens clothes are my sister's; she is here to swear to them; they were in my box, I had them to keep for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the constable apprehended me the constable and another young man was with him, an acquaintance of the prosecutor, and I was in liquor, when they first apprehended me; when I got sober they both came to me to the watch-house, and told me if I would tell where the property was I should be discharged; I told them I could not tell where all was but I could the best part; he said that would do; and the constable said so himself, that I should be discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. Was that so? - It is strictly true, he was very much in liquor; in the morning when I took him, the prosecutor told him if he would tell where the things were he would forgive him; indeed he offered him money, but he would not tell then.</p>

Do you mean to state it is a fact, that you saw them taken away, or do you reason on it? - Most undoubtedly I saw them taken away, there was a piece of silk which was laying along with them, they were all laying together, I could not take on me to say what the man took, but they all lay together, opposite to one pane of glass; as to the handkerchiefs I clearly saw them go; I was rather flurried in consequence of such a daring thing, so that by the time I had got to the door they were so far gone that I did not think it worth while to go after them; I saw them turn the corner a few doors from my dwelling house; there were other people in the street who gave the alarm; the two prisoners were brought back by the evidence Bocknell and another, who is here, in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your property brought back? - There were six handkerchiefs and a piece of silk, something short of a yard, it was given into my possession when brought back; I gave it to Carpenter, the beadle of the night, in the watch-house; I have had it since of the constable, in Marlborough-street, it was sealed and delivered to my custody.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Drummond's, I am his butler; I was in Glass House-street, this Saturday evening, about twenty minutes before nine, on the 20th of April, it was candle light, quite dark in the street, candles were light in all the street, and lamps; passing Glass House-street I heard a window break, I was in Glass House-street, opposite to the house, I went over to see what was the matter with many others, I found that Mr. Ramsey had been robbed of some silk handkerchiefs, and his wife then said stockings; she came out of the door, and I asked him why he did not pursue the prisoners? I then went my way home, and going down the Hay Market there is a small court, which leads into Jermyn-street, I heard a buzzing, and I looked round and I saw three men coming out of the court; I thought them suspicious people, and it might be those that robbed Mr. Ramsey; they crossed over the Hay Market; I followed them; they then went into a court, called Coventry-court; I followed them into this court, I passed them in this court, there were three of them, and Edwards, the tallest of the two at the bar, he pulled out this piece of silk handkerchiefs, and was shewing it to the others, that confirmed my suspicions, and I went and passed them again, and got into Coventry-street to get some assistance to take them, being three of them; I saw a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290084"/>butcher coming out of Newport market, and I asked him to help me and we went and took two of them, one escaped, these are the two that we took.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between this prisoner, who produced the silk handkerchiefs and the others? - Yes, they were in deep conversation all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they be conversing together? - Not five minutes. They made no resistance at all; the handkerchiefs were with Edwards; immediately after they were taken he threw them from him; I saw him throw them down; I am not quite positive whether I picked them up myself or somebody else, but they were in my hands directly, I believe the other man, Smith, had the silk, but I will not take on me to say, the butcher is not here; I heard the prisoners in conversation in this court, and they said, did you hear a buggar of a butcher say, they were gone down Hare-street? I took and carried them to Mr. Ramsey; they were in the same dress they are in now.</p>

               <p>I was the beadle of the night. On the 20th of April, I think Saturday night, near nine o'clock, they sent down to the watch-house either for beadle or constable, to take two thieves out of Mr. Ramsey's house; I went down and I took another man along with me, and I had some property home with me, which lies here now; I kept it in my custody till we went before the justice, then it was delivered to Mr. Ramsey again after we had sealed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ramsey. I can swear positively to the silk, because of the pattern; it was a piece I had by me, the remnant of a gown, and the same number as I lost; there was seven in the piece, and one I sold, and these are the six remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man's arm in the hole of the glass; could you distinguish the colour of his coat? - It does not strike me any observation of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Bocknell. How soon might it be after you left this house, that you saw these people in the Hay market? - Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. On hearing the noise and going up, did you see any body? - I did not see any of these men; there were many people ran up through curiosity, but the thieves were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. I have got a brother that lives in St. James's market; I always carry his linen home of a Saturday night; coming from him through Coventry-court, this gentleman came up and laid hold of this young fellow and me, and said we had done a robbery; I know no more of it than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Edwards. I had been on an errand to Mr. Reynold's printing office in Piccadilly; coming down Coventry-street I met this young fellow, and this gentleman laid hold of both me and him, and said we were the persons that committed the robbery; it is no such thing, sir, says I; in the mean time there were two hundred or three hundred people round about at the time; I know no more of it than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Edwards called one witness to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say then that he was not taken away the very next day, after he came to your lodgings? - No the next day, it was turned three weeks or a month.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I unfortunately lived and cohabited with this here woman, and I believe, who has been the perpetrator of the act, and to screen herself has entirely laid it on me: I know no more of Bunyan's things nor never handled any thing of them, or took any thing out of the room; I met that woman in the street on the 2d of March; she told me she lived in Corbert's-court; did not know Mr. or Mrs. Bunyan before she said if I would come and be with her as usual she would be glad; accordingly I went with her, she took me up stairs into the chamber and walked round the room, after some few words passed I said, I suppose these things to be none of your own; she said they were not, but part were and part were Mr. Bunyan's; I then asked her what she paid a week rent for the room? she told me half a crown; on Saturday night following she asked me for the money, she said she had no money to pay her rent; I asked her what the rent was? she said, three shillings; I thought she wanted to impose upon me to get the six-pence for herself. I am very sorry, my lord, if the law allows by my paying for that week's rent to be brought into a scrape for what is done; I went to Mrs. Bunyan's and paid the two shillings and six-pence, little thought what I was to come to through that, I stayed there the whole three weeks; in the course of this time I found one morning a sheet pawned off my bed, I said to

Another time I came home in the day time I missed a saucepan, I asked her what she had done with it? I said, I hoped she had not pawned the saucepan; she said, no, Mrs. Bunyan had got it down stairs for her own use. Another time I found a different quilt on the bed to what I saw at first, I was then told that Mrs. Bunyan had changed it; I told her I did not chuse to stay with her any longer, and then I found out this quilt she had pawned; I then gave her the money to fetch it out again, and insisted on her fetching it home; she went out and when she returned she brought a quilt, which I thought was the same that she had first when I came away, I did not know whether she meant to stay there or not, she told me she should stay, and I sees no more of her for five or six days, when I was accidently going through the street and she called after me, she then told me that she had got a room in Twister's-alley and had left Mr. Bunyan's; I then went home with her into Twister's-alley. On the 24th of April Mr. Armstrong and Mrs. Bunyan came up into the room, as soon as Mrs. Bunyan came up she took up a pair of bellows, she said they were her property; I never carried them to the place where they were, nor was I there till after the bellows were there; the things which Mrs. Bunyan calls her mattrass was joined to another piece which we made use of for a bed, being stuffed with straw; I was then carried before a magistrate, when I came there

            's, on Messrs. Hughes for twenty pounds, I saw one of Mr Coutt's clerks whose name is Charlton, and I received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290089"/>a twenty pound bank note in exchange; I don't recollect the number of the bank note, when I had received it I returned home, I put the bank note loose into my breeches pocket, I had no pocket book about me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q Had you any other bank note about you at the time? - I had not. When I came home I went through the warehouse to the counting house, part of No. 17, on the ground floor; I took the bank note from my pocket and laid it down on my desk for Mr. Mead to lock it up; the note was first missed on Thursday morning afterward, the bank note was lost on Monday the 15th; the Thursday morning, subsequent to the Monday, which was the 17th or 18th, I called all the servants in the house and enquired of them if they had seen such a thing; I enquired of the prisoner at the bar, as of all the others, if they had seen a note? I told them that a bank note was lost, and I was very much surprised for I never lost any thing before from that place; the prisoner said he had seen nothing of it; the reason I laid it on my desk was, I had not the key of my small iron chest in my pocket, therefore left it for Mr. Mead to take care of it, there was one

             not present when I made this enquiry, he was ill in bed up stairs; I desired the prisoner at the bar to go up to him and ask him if he had seen any thing of it; the prisoner brought down the answer, so far as I can recollect, that Charles had seen nothing of it; I think those were the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover your bank note again? - I received it by order of Mr. Newland from the File at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say that you never lost any thing before? - I would not wish you to press that particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of April you say you went with the draft to Mr. Coutts's? - I am perfectly confident it was of a Monday; and the reason why I remember the circumstance was I was at a funeral on the Monday before, in St. Martin's Church.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether your's is a wholesale or a retail shop? - We consider ours as a wholesale shop, but the doors of the warehouse frequently stand open.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid this bank note on the desk? - I did, and there I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever the precaution given you of having papers loose in your pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other bank notes on the desk? - Not that I know of; my attention was not drawn to any other.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say, that when you made the enquiry of these servants of your's, the manner in which you made it was, I have lost a bank note from that place; naming the desk, the particular place from whence it was lost? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked your servants if any body had seen it; you was ignorant of the number at that time, therefore you could only describe it as a twenty pound bank note lost. Do you know a person of the name of Adams? I mean a cobler who lives in your lane? - There is a cobler lives there, but I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years has he lived there? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. He had his seat or stall in Pudding-lane, just by you? - He has a seat or stall close underneath the blacksmith's, opposite Mr. Mead's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who you left in the warehouse at the time you left this bank note on the desk? - Mr. Mead was in the counting house, and I don't know whether all the men were in the warehouse or not.</p>
               <p>Q. The warehouse has communication with the counting house? - It has; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290090"/>I went out of the counting house I met the prisoner at the bar; I gave him instructions when Charles, one of my men who was out, came home, to go to Mr. Lambert's on Ludgate-hill, that was a little after four o'clock.</p>

On the 15th of April, my partner brought home a bank note and laid it on the desk before me, I was then writing at the desk, I did not touch it because I was busy a writing, it laid before me, and after I had done writing, in about five minutes, I saw the note and went out to my dinner forgetting to put the note into the iron chest, I had set down about ten minutes at my dinner, I recollected I had not locked the note up, I went into the counting house but could not find any note there; I looked all about but could not find it; Mr. Gordon was gone, I took it then for granted that Mr. Gordon had seen I had left it; when I found it was not so, all the servants were enquired about it, and they were particularly examined, and one servant was ill,

            , we sent the prisoner up to him to ask about it; the prisoner said that Donnell had seen nothing of it; he expressed some astonishment that he should be asked; three other persons were asked, they were all asked individually.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There were three others in the warehouse? - There were.</p>
               <p>Q. You directed your attention to the bank note that lay on the desk? - I did; the number I had not specified, because I had not seen it, it was laying down before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you much pressed with business? - A good deal; but not more than common.</p>
               <p>Q. I find that you forget something that was communicated to you, by your partners; your mind was so much engaged that you forgot to do what you was desired to by your partners.</p>

               <p>Q. In the hurry of business you had forgot to secure this note as your partner had directed; might not the same want of recollection induce you to clap it in your pocket? - Certainly not; I certainly did not do that; I did not lay hold of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think, Mr. Mead, that in the hurry you were in you might possibly have sweeped it off the desk in your motion? - No, it was above the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in such a hurry as to forget one material thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The bank note was on the flat part of the desk above the sloping part? - It was.</p>

Mr. Charlton be so good as to tell me how many bank notes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290091"/>you may have paid in the course of six or seven days after? - Some thousands. When I receive a bank note from a gentleman I take the Number and date, but when I pay it away I only put down the number, and I generally pay away the last note I receive first.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what the date of the note was, whether the year 1791, 1792, or 1793, it is impossible for you to tell? - Not from memory.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that the same number occurs in bank notes of different years, therefore a bank note of 1792, may be of the same number of one of the same value, of the year 1793, therefore without the date the number is no criterion to make out the identity? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you pay away those bank notes you take in the course of the day, or those you do not? - In general those we take.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you do pay them away the same day, do you put down the date or only the number of them? - Only the number, because it is the custom of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say then any particular date or number of any note paid away that day? - Yes, we can, by referring to the person's name from whom I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive this from? - From a person of the name of Gressey.</p>
               <p>Q. Read it? -</p>
               <p>"Monday, 25th April. Received of Mr. Gressey, bank note twenty pounds, No. 4,822, dated 4th April 1793." Both entries are in the same page.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able, by these two entries, to say that the note you paid to Mr. Gordon was the note you received from Mr. Gressey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Charlton, do you mean to say that you are positive you paid away that identical note you received of Gressey? - To the best of my knowledge, and from the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mead. Have you not learned, that while you was up stairs a quart of oil was sold by some persons in your house? - I cannot tell that.</p>

               <p>Q. How far had he got from the tail of the cart when you first see him? - Not a great way off. I cried stop thief! he had the box on his shoulder, almost close by me, and he ran away, and I ran after him, and he dropped the box at Butcherhall-lane; then I took up the box and the people pursued after the man; I was going away with the box, and thought I was very well off with it, but they took the man and the people made me come up to him, I dare say I was very nigh a quarter of an hour before they brought the man back; I am sure that is the man, it was between eight and nine o'clock; I saw him very plain, I am certain he is the man, I am positive; I am sure it is the same box</p>

               <p>Court to Pigeon. What are you? - I am out of employ at present; I was a clerk and warehouseman to a wholesale linen draper, I never saw the woman except at Guildhall, nor him neither, before I took him. When I came to find the bill I did not know the way to apply, in which time the bill was found. When I came on Thursday morning his wife sent several people to me to make it up for two guineas; and because I would not take it the prisoner's mother-in-law came and abused me very much: I told her if she did not desist I should certainly complain of it when I came to give my evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - It was. There was another young man with me when we met these two women, and this woman was with her I took that night; this woman had my watch, because my property was found the next day upon her; it was the other woman that confessed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290094"/>before the justice, this woman was taken up the next morning.</p>

Coming by Aldgate two women met us, Rowland and I were together, one walked by my side, and the other walked by the side of the other man; one of the women were near to him, and the other to me; before we came to the India House, in Leadenhall-street he said he had lost his watch; we went back to the George Yard, Whitechapel, to see if we could find the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know which of the two had stole it? - We took the first up for being in company with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rowland know? - I cannot tell whether he did or not.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of April, in the morning, I took the prisoner into custody, and when I met with her in the street she had this watch in her hand, wrapped round with an handkerchief; I asked her where the watch was? she cried and I found it in her hand; I asked her where she got it? she said she had been along with some young man near Moorfields, and as she left him, the watch, by some means, got hold of her clothes; I took her into a public house and there I found another watch under her arm, which the prosecutor swore to be his property. (The second watch produced and deposed to by Rowland.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This young man picked me up one night, and would not let me alone, he wanted to go home with me, but he said he was short of money; I said, if you are short of money make me a present till another time I meet you; he left the watch in my care; the next morning he came, but had no money, and he said he would have the watch or he would charge an officer with me.</p>

               <p>I am in partnership with my father; I went the 20th of April with the constable, I went to a public house in the neighbourhood of Covent-garden, Russell-street; I believe the constable found the key of his box in his pocket, he found these nails there; the papers of the chair nails have our private mark; the coffin nails have no mark on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell these? - No, we never sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - From his own confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say so independent of that? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I generally went out for orders; I was ordered by Mr. Bent to call on the customers, I called on a customer who gave me an order for these things, and Mr. Bent and I we did not settle sometimes for some weeks, and there was a balance remaining frequently between him and I for three weeks, and I took these to my lodgings with a view of taking them to the man, I had an order besides to go very near to the place where this man lived; when the night he called on me to settle with him I was behind hand, I had not cash to make up; he said that if I expected any mercy of him I must send for somebody to make up the cash; he seemed to express a concern for the present unhappy situation in which I am involved in; says he, I will do every thing in the world if you will tell me how matters stand with you, but if I would not the utmost of the law should be exercised; I told him I would tell the truth, and he went out and got a constable, and when the constable came I gave him the key, and he found the things in my box.</p>

On Monday morning the 29th I was going to London, between the hours of nine and ten, the prisoner past me in Brick-lane on horse back, on Mr. Barnet's horse, I knew the horse before Mr. Barnet had it, and I called to him, I knew the man, I have known him three or four months, I called to him in the highway, he would not stop; I said, stop, and repeated it till I came to the French Chapel; I followed him to Bishopsgate-street, and he would not stop, and then I followed him to Shoreditch and there I came along side of him, and then I asked him about the horse; says I, is it your's? he told me, no, but, says he, you must know, it is squire Sayer's, a brewer at Winchmore-hill, and then I let him go about his business, and then I went to let Mr. Barnet know that that man had got his horse; I knew that Mr. Barnet had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop him? - I did not know as I had any right to stop him, as I was no office.</p>

               <p>I am a breeches maker; I live at Stratford in Essex, and a constable; I apprehended the man; all that I know is of a hue and cry that Mr. Barnet had lost a horse, on Sunday morning; on Tuesday evening by the description they gave me of the man I stopped him; I saw him go by where I was at work; I said to him, what have you done with Mr. Barnet's horse? says he, the horse is safe enough, it is grazing on the Forest.</p>

             Long's, at Wanstead; I was coming out at Bush Gate on Tuesday and Mrs. Harley comes out of the yard about two o'clock, she calls to me to tell me that there was a man had found a horse on the forest; I was not the first person that saw it; I went and I found the horse standing in a hollow bush, fastened by a hemp halter to a hollow stem of the bush; after I had seen the horse stand I went to let Mr. Parker know, who is the steward, he desired me to go and take him from the hollow bush and put him in the Manor Park in the Pound I delivered it into the bailiff's hand, he had the key and he put it in; Mr. Barnet came the next day to own the horse; I was not present when he looked at the horse; I knew it to be the same horse by the make of the horse, it was a bay horse, a star on his forehead and two white feet; I saw it after Mr. Barnet took it though I did not deliver it to him.</p>

            's? - I did on Wednesday morning; I found my horse there, the same horse that I had lost on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord, as I was going to London on Monday morning, I met the horse loose by the Butcher's at Bow, one rein was broke and the other was loose, so I took hold of him and led him along for about half a mile, and then I wanted to do a job by myself,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290099"/>and then the other rein broke for I thought to take him to the Pound.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the man the next day that it belonged to Esq. Sayer, at Winchmore-hill? - I never told him so, I went to a house close by Mr. Barnet's and asked if they knew the horse? and asked the turnpike man and enquired of every body that I saw and nobody knew him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you locked the door? - I had, and was fitting on the key and when I got up, and went and looked at the door I saw this man that stands now at the bar, I found my door quite wide open, the place where the lock goes in was a little thrust, but a very trifling, and the lock half went back, the prisoner was standing just at the opening of the door, as if standing to keep it open within the room, I asked him what he wanted and then he dropped the petticoat from his hand, and told me he wanted Mrs. Wilson, and asked is there such a person in your house? I told him no; do you know such a person? no; I catched hold of him by the collar, and told him he was a liar, he wanted my clothes; when I had him by the collar I fell down the stairs, whether he tripped me up, or I slipped down, I cannot say, but here is a piece of pocket and a piece of the flap of his coat which I tore off; then, sir, when the pocket tore off and the piece of the coat, he ran away from me; I got up in a moment and ran after him, I went across the way after him and across the Church-yard, and I lost sight of him by going up a little court, up which I did not follow him for I did not know but what there was a thoroughfare in it; I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man, it was a dimity petticoat that he had hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there are other articles in the indictment; what have you to say about them? - They were all dirty linen left by one corner of the bed, I had left them not above ten minutes before I found the prisoner, and when I returned and went into the room I found them off, on the ground in the middle of the room, rather behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were removed? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what may be the value of the two cotton gowns? - I think about thirty shillings, the linen shift about five shillings it was new, it was never worn, the dimity waistcoat about eight shillings, the linen apron two shillings, the muslin handkerchief eighteen-pence, the cloth waistcoat two shillings, and the linen shirt four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of these things are old? - They were.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a journeyman to Mr. Sherwood. On the 1st of May I was informed that we had got a thief supposed to be taking the property belonging to my master, I was alarmed and I went according to the information given me, and found him in my master's shop; I says to him you have got something here I think that don't belong to you; he made for answer, never mind, being very much intoxicated in liquor; I said, that will not do, we have been accused several times of thefts that we have not been guilty of, and my master has cautioned us, if we could find out the thief, he would make an example of him; my shopmate said let us take it out of his pocket; I said, no, let charge be given of him; I then left him in the situation he was in, with several more shopmates, and ran over to this gentleman Mr. Feild and brought him in, and told him to take charge of him; I did not see the hobbing taken out of his pocket; I gave charge to the constable; the prisoner was a journeyman to Mr. Sherwood, and had been three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had information; how many might there be at work in your shop at this time? - Sixteen or eighteen; we are not exact as to number.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you had information; was it given in the hearing of the prisoner? - It was not, it was given by our own people; they are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no more of your people here? - No more.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290102"/>Q. How do you know that to be the property of your master? - This hobbing I have noticed several times, being a particular thing for the purpose we had used it for; I cannot tell how long we have had it; I know it from the levelness of it, and the goodness of the steel and iron.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was taken from the man's pocket, can you say there was one missing? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you take it to be your master's? - By the knowledge of it, in the account I have given to your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man been at work that day? - I don't think he had.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in the shop, how came he in the shop if he had not been at work? - That is out of my power to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass except that which you have mentioned? - When I brought him to the door he said, don't hurt me; I said I am afraid you are hurting yourself.</p>

               <p>Q That tool that is produced you say is your master's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it called? - It is in the place of a anvil; its use is to punch upon; I really believe it to be my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are these kind of tools made by? - There are smiths on purpose to make these tools.</p>
               <p>Q It is an instrument to punch metals upon; what is the name of your master's trade? - A gunsmith, or gun lock maker.</p>
               <p>Q. There are more gun smiths than your master? - Certainly; but this is a very uucommon good tool.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of that kind of anvil, or thing which is so extremely outlandish, that there is no remembering of it? - It is an hobbing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that hobbing made by a particular way, in a particular manner, and with particular kind of metal for your master alone? - I will not say that.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your master's? - I cannot positively say any more than this; I have seen the tool in my master's shop; I was not at the buying of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, do you know that tool by its weight? - Yes, I believe I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think nobody else uses such a tool of the same weight? - I don't think they do.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me why you think so? - Because it is reckoned the best tool in the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - By them that are judges in workmanship.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are they? - I myself for one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other tools of the same description used by other gunsmiths? - There are</p>
               <p>Q. Of the same size? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh it? - It is thirteen pounds as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh it? - I have heard the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290103"/>Q. Did you ever measure it? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the same kind of tools made of the same materials for other gunsmiths? - I believe there are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by the taste, smell or colour? - I can tell it by two out of the three, by the smell for it is oily, and also by the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. You admit you do not know it by the weight nor the measure; is the colour peculiar? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it whiter, blacker or browner? - It is rather whiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not tools as white as that? - I never saw one more clearer, or more whiter.</p>
               <p>Q But there are many tools as white as that, and as you are a very good judge of grammar, iron that smells as sweet and as sour, which ever you please; you may scratch your head you will find nothing there; let us know in what manner you know that tool to be your master's; I admit your master might have a very good tool of that sort, but tell me how you know that tool in your hand; tell the jury how and why? - In the first place I know it by the end of it, for I made remark of this end at the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us know how you know it, you have such a flippant tongue; you tell me you don't know it by weight, nor measure, nor the smell, nor taste, nor colour; tell us what you do know it by? - I do know it by the smell.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever work at it yourself? - No, not myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Tell us what you know it by in plain language? - I have told his lordship all that I know about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When you came home did you find any hobbing had been missed? - I did; I looked directly as I came home at the bench where this hobbing should have been.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen it any where should you have known it to be your's? - I should by the sight; I am satisfied it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Will you permit me to ask how you know it by the sight; that wants some explanation; let me know how you know this; give me some better reason for this? - Just the same as I should know you from some other gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do, and I will have a better reason before I have done with you? - I know it by the sight of it, the same as I should know you.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very true, that every man has got a nose, and eyes, and chin, and therefore you may know him to be a man; there are other tools used of this description by gunsmiths? - Not many.</p>
               <p>Q Then you are the only gunsmith that uses these kind of tools? - I am not a gunsmith, I am a gun lock maker, and there is only me and Mr. Nock on Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know its weight? - I see it weighed when I bought it; I think it is thirteen pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you weighed it since this man was charged with this fact? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this tool a peculiar little size, or a peculiar large size for the purpose for which it is used? - It is a large size.</p>
               <p>Q And you take on you to say on your oath that this tool is your's? - If there were five thousand and that was put amongst them I would pick it out.</p>
               <p>Q How would you pick it out? - By knowledge of it; it is impossible for any man living to make a fellow to it.</p>
               <p>Q Then I would be glad to know why they cannot make a fellow to it? - That has been worked upon for many years, and without damage which very few have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290104"/>Q. Then it is impossible that an instrument of that weight, dimensions and every thing the same as this can be worked upon without damage, and you know this tool it is impossible there should be such another in the three kingdoms, or perhaps in the world except in France, and that we know nothing about? - There cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I was in the shop at work, I had been drinking in the morning it is true, we had been paying for beer towards birth days, I had had my coat off it is true, with presence to go to work, I did do a little and but a little; when I went to put my coat on I found it very heavy, and while I was putting my coat on the gentleman's apprentice seized me and put his hand into my pocket to see what was there, and found my master's property in my pocket it is true, and it is not the first time I have found things in my pocket, and who the person was that put these things in my pocket I cannot tell, and what I am challanged with I am innocent of.</p>

The 23d of this month about one o'clock in the morning, to the best of my knowledge, it was Thursday, going along Coventry-street I met with the prisoner she stopped me and asked for something to drink; I told her I had no money; at the same time I had between four and five pounds in my breeches pocket, gold and silver, and some halfpence in my waistcoat pocket, I told the prisoner that I had no money, neither could I give her any thing to drink; so she said she would treat me rather than we should part without drinking together; so we went to a public house in Piccadilly, I don't know the sign of it, we had a glass of gin a piece, and she put her hand into her pocket for to pay for it, and she wanted a halfpenny, and she asked me for the halfpenny which I gave her out of my waistcoat pocket, to pay for the gin, after that we came out and came back again down Piccadilly, and stopped at the corner of <placeName id="t17930529-52-crimeloc290">Piccadilly</placeName>

I replied she was not; but I had been robbed by her, and told him I was waiting for somebody to take her into custody; he replied directly that he was an officer belonging to Bow-street and that he would take her; going along I told him I had been robbed of four guineas; when I came to the watch-house I searched my pocket, and I found only one guinea and one shilling left in my breeches pocket, which both the witnesses saw, and the halfpence were gone out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q What halfpence had you in your waistcoat pocket? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the property? - They are in the court with the pawnbrokers, all that I could find, I have found none but what the pawnbrokers own to that are in court.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The fact is I keep this house, and I have pawned these goods with them gentlemen; this good woman was turned out of her house in Mary-le-bone some time before this happened, through keeping a bad house; Mrs. Rivers being my landlady, begged me to let her have a room in my house, accordingly I agreed to it; Saturday the 21st of July she came to me, and asked me to help her to move these things into the lodging, she told me if I would go and help her in with the things she would pay me; a fellow workman called on me expecting I would go to work, but I did not; in the midst of it she told me that she was distressed for a little money to make up her rent, and that her landlady had told her that she would cartainly seize the things if she did not make up the money, and she asked me to go and pawn these things; accordingly I told her I would, and I went to these places, I carried the things that she gave me, I went out once and after I came back, she told me that was not enough, and she desired me to go again, I went the second time, and when I came back I gave her the money and the duplicates, before my fellow workman; the Monday following I went into the country to the harvest, this woman never said a word to me good, bad nor indifferent. I found on Sunday that she came with three women of the town and abused my wife very much; on Monday morning I spoke to her and she said she had got a drop in her head, and did not know what she said; Monday evening I met her and she told me she had got a warrant against me; I told her she had no right to have a warrant against me; she did not say any thing to me, good, bad or indifferent; and when I was in the country she turned my wife away, and never let her come into the house any more.</p>

             there was also a silk cloak pawned in the same name, which the prosecutrix came and redeemed herself; she redeemed it about three months ago; she paid the money that it was put in for, and said she would take out all the rest by degrees; she did tell me she had been robbed of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>


               <p>I have known the prisoner at the bar for some years back, he worked along with me; this Saturday morning that the woman has been speaking of, he stayed away and did not go to work; he was moving in goods for this woman into his own house, and I lent him a hand down with two or three stoves into the kitchen for her; I see her give him a bundle, I know there was in it two gowns and a black cloak, and he went out and brought in some money and duplicates. I think it was the 19th or 20th of July, it was a Saturday. She told him to pawn the things, I waited till such time as the man came back again, and he gave her some gold and silver and duplicates, and they wanted me to go out and bring in some gin; there was some gin got, a shilling worth, and we drank together, and she had the money the things produced herself, and the first time he came back she said that was not enough; she sent him out the second time with another bundle, and she was very well satisfied at both times.</p>
               <p>Q Had you more gin when he returned the second time? - Indeed we had; the gentlewoman had almost a pint mug full of gin when I came into the place.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Norrie. Is that true or false what this man has sworn? - I never saw him with my eyes before; I never saw his face in my life time before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290108"/>Q I want to know whether on that day you charge this robbery to have been committed, any man was in your company drinking gin with the money that was got from pawning these articles? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any time sending any body to pawn these clothes? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you insist upon it on your oath? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordon. Do you mean to say upon your oath that that fact passed? - I do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty to Watts. You say these things were pawned with you the early part of the day? - Yes, before dinner time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call dinner time? - Before two o'clock, but I am not very exact in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were they found at your house after they were pawned? - I think she made an enquiry on Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. This woman swore positively that she went out at half after three o'clock, and then all the things were safe; do you think they were pawned before that time? - I firmly believe they were; I believe they were pawned before two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q You are now stating a transaction that happened ten months ago; what reason have you to induce you to suppose it was earlier than the time she speaks? - Because on the Monday when the enquiry was made I had the recollection of it in my mind, that makes me have little or no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you have little or no doubt, in opposition to this woman's positive oath, or what is the ground of your belief that they must have been pawned earlier? - I recollect being very particular in taking them in, he told me he was a housekeper, and that I might go and see or send.</p>

Before I begin with my evidence, I would wish just to observe, that with regard to the prisoner White, I never sought the prosecution against him, he was brought before the magistrate, and from the circumstances which I related to him, it was the only way that he was committed; I am a very innocent prosecutor against White; I had no thought against him, only what I related before justice Addington.

            , was on my right side, then he catched fast hold of me on my right side, the moment the others fastened on me on my left side, they are not here, there was several of them; the prisoner catched hold of me by my coat, it is a great coat; there is a post the corner of the street, the others on my left side jammed me up against the post, the post was right at my back, and they were on each side of me; there were some women who were in the front of me, but they never molested me; this Paterson at the bar, he put his hand into my great coat pocket, I had two handkerchiefs in that pocket which he drew out; I catched hold of his arm with the handkerchiefs in his hand at the same time; the others on my left side was searching this here pocket, and another put his hand into my waistcoat pocket; I called for the watch as soon as ever I was attacked, and at the very moment of time I saw a lanthorn spring from the side of the houses, at the corner of the street; when I saw the lanthorn spring I observed it and I saw it was going the wrong way; I immediately catched hold of Paterson when he had the handkerchiefs, and held him in my arms; he struggled to get away from me, I seeing the lanthorn I still held him, as he was struggling, it was right under a lamp, I had a full view of his face; in his struggling to get away from me he pulled me two or three yards into Lukener's-lane; when I was there I perceived the lanthorn to stand, but it never came up to me at all, it stood at some very short distance, and as I held him a blow came on my head, which seemed to be from a bludgeon, that blow was still repeated, I did not fall at the first, second, or third blow, I received a great many blows before I fell to the ground, the blows cut my head right into wounds, I received a great many blows, some under my ear, whereby my hearing is so much hurt that I cannot hear no more than if I put my finger into my ears, my hearing was never bad before; when I was on the ground I was bleeding very much, and as I laid I remember a person, I believe it was the person of the public house, came out first and the watchman came up to me, and several other people, and I was taken into the public house and I had blood pouring from me in two strong streams, my eyes and every part of me was covered with blood; my head was washed with some brandy there, and I believe a table cloth, or something of that kind put on my head to stop the blood; then the watchman White came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290111"/>into the room where I was, and I then naturally looked at him, and supposed him to be the watchman that I had seen before with the lanthorn, and I said, if you had done your duty, I should not have been cut in this way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner in the public house at that time? - No, he escaped, I said so to White, meaning that I thought he should have given me some assistance. They asked me in the public house whether I knew any of them that had robbed me? I told them I did, as near as I can recollect, I said, I know some of them or one of them; I was rather afraid in the house; I was then taken to a surgeon in Queen-street; the surgeon did not open the door, but he said this, I must be taken to an hospital; as I was coming back again down Drury-lane to go home I was so ill I could not stand; I remember falling down in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who attended you to the surgeon? - I cannot be certain; I had two with me at least, if not more. I believe I lay on the ground for a quarter of an hour; I fainted there, whether these people stopped with me or not that took me to the surgeon, I cannot positively tell; I recollect as I lay there, begging of somebody to go and get a coach, and I recollect somebody returning and saying they could not get a coach, but whether it was the same people as went with me to the surgeon's, or somebody going by I cannot say, but I remember that some that stood by helped me up and led me home.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it you got home? - It must be between twelve and one I think; when I was taken home I remember being brought into the parlour, and I remember somebody saying they found me in Drury lane; a coach was sent for and I was immediately taken to the Middlesex Hospital; when I came to the Middlesex Hospital I remember the surgeon opening of my head, and examining the wounds; he said he could not tell whether my skull was fractured or not; I was in the hospital four days; I enquired at home who brought me home, and I was informed that there was no watchman had seen me home; on the next day somebody called at my house and asked how I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know what was the name of the woman that was with you? - She is here; she will tell herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this woman that was with you? - I have known her a great many years; she did keep the house where I now live; she works at the upholstery line.</p>
               <p>Q. From the best recollection you have, what length of time might the prisoner be in your presence? - In that situation a minute is a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now considering all the wounds you received, and the state in which you received them, have you a perfect recollection that the prisoner Paterson was the man? - Certainly, because I saw him before ever I received any wound at all, I had seen him once in the street before, which I told him when I held him; the lamp shone right in his face as he struggled to get away, and I said I know you.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after this happened? - I believe a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - In New Prison, Clerkenwell. One of the men belonging to Marlborough street office had got an order from the magistrate for me to see the prisoner, one or two before that had been shewn to me to see if I knew them; there was one brought up to Bow-street, and another at Marlborough-street for me to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other persons in the room at Clerkenwell when you saw him? - I saw him through a chequer gate, and there was twenty or thirty in the yard, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290112"/>more for what I know; I pointed to the man though he was in a very different dress; I saw him through the grate at the door, before he came through the gate, I said to the officer that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any hat on? - He had on a round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - I did perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any part of his dress? - His dress appeared to me a lightish coat; the description I gave before ever he was taken at all at Bow-street was in this way, a youngish man, a very remarkable nose, sandy hair and pock marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. The first you saw of White was that he was one of the watchmen assisting you in the public house, and you thought he was the watchman whom you had seen before with the lanthorn in the street, and on that the magistrate thought proper to commit him for the felony? - I never thought or intended any prosecution against White and I never said any thing more against White then I have now; I told the magistrate that I could not take on me to say that it was White that was in the street with the lanthorn I was in such a bloody condition.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you had known this man Paterson some time before? - I had seen him in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever had any thing to do with him before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you by that light, and in that situation know he was pock marked, and that he had sandy hair? - This was before I was struck.</p>
               <p>Court. You had observed you say, that this man was pock marked, and that he had sandy hair, was it from the light you had at that time that you distinguished he had pock marks and sandy hair? - I am sure it was, for I held him in my two arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by only previous knowledge of him that you knew he had sandy hair and was pock marked, or was it from the light then? - It was from the light then. I mentioned I believe that it was the people on my left hand that took the three shillings out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How happens it that you only put one handkerchief in the indictment, and you say he took two? - I took one out of his hand, and I did not charge him with that, because I got it again.</p>

               <p>I was with the prosecutor the day he describes; he has a house in Compton-street and a shop in Drury-lane, I called on him in Drury-lane, I am not certain whether it was nine or ten in the evening. Mr. Gordon was going to see me home into St. James's; I live there now; coming down Drury-lane the corner of Lukener's-lane there were several people, they seemed to be very riotous; Mr. Gordon dropped his arm, I had hold of his arm, and I immediately went across the way, I thought that Mr. Gordon was following me, but hearing his voice call out watch almost immediately I turned back, but could not see him; on missing him I turned back again and hearing him still call out watch, with that his voice appeared over the way, I looked up Lukener's-lane and could see the light of the publican's candle, who stood at the door, the watch stood on the other side with his lanthorn in his hand, and Mr. Gordon stood before the door of the house bleeding, I immediately crossed and begged of the people to let him come in, and I went in with him, and had some brandy to bathe his head; I was very much frightened and was afraid he would bleed to death, a gentleman who was there scraped some hat and put it to his wounds to stop the blood, he still bled violently; I asked if a doctor could not be sent for? they said there was a surgeon in Queen-street and he had better be taken there; we tied up his head and two men held him up, and Mr. Gordon and the watchmen, then walked out to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these men are here? - No, they were total strangers to me; they came in I believe by the alarm; Mr. Gordon asked me if I had a shilling to pay for the brandy? I gave the shilling to the publican, and he rather disputed that it was not good, he took me into the bar to try whether it was good, in this time Mr. Gordon was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290115"/>away to the surgeon, and I lost him for that night; I went away and enquired of a watchman where I could find them; he told me they were gone to a surgeon Cooper's in Queen-street; I went up and down Queen-street and could not find him, I then went and enquired of a watchman where surgeon Cooper lived; he said he could not tell me; I then went home and saw him no more till I saw him in Middlesex Hospital on the Friday following, as this happened on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor at any time after that happened give any account of the man that did it? - He always described him as he has done now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray where does Mr. Gordon live? - He keeps a house in Compton-street, but he keeps a shop in Drury-lane within a few doors of the spot where this happened, it is almost opposite Brown-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you called on him in Drury-lane, I called on him first at his house in Compton-street and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you say you called upon him? - On Tuesday the 19th of April, at night between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be accurate as to the time? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the time that you think this business happened? - I think it was past eleven, but I am not very clear to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stay at his house? - I might stay an hour.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard of this robbery being done a short time afterwards; I heard it was done on Mr. White's the watchman's beat, in consequence of which I went to him and I found him in bed, after they have been on duty they commonly sleep in the day, I believe this was about ten or eleven o'clock, this was a day or two after the robbery was done, I asked him if such a circumstance had not taken place? he said it had, I asked him to go along with me after some of the people to see if we could apprehend some of them; he signified that then he was rather tired, but he would meet me at five o'clock in the evening; I met him at that time, and he seemed to go very readily with me in search of some of these men, and I make no doubt but if I had met with any of them he would have assisted me to have taken them. In consequence of the information of this robbery from Mr. Gordon, I shewed him a man at Marlborough-street office, a man we know by the name of Old Hyke, I asked him if he could swear to him? he said he could not, but he could swear to one was he to see him; he gave me an exact description of the prisoner at the bar; the moment he gave me the description I said it was Paterson, and I obtained an order from the magistrate to take the prosecutor to see Paterson in Clerkenwell New Prison; I went with the prosecutor to the prison, Paterson was called forwards and the prosecutor looked through the grating of the bars, and see him and knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the prisoner as he happened to be with the rest in the gaol, or was he brought forward by himself? - There was a good many in the gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he separated from the other prisoners? - He was after that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when he saw him first? - The keeper called him by his name, and he was walking forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your duty as an officer; you always have particular orders in such cases that the prisoners should never be separated? - We had no such orders at that time; Paterson was called to, I saw him come forward from the rest, and the prosecutor see him come out from the rest on the call; I would wish you to understand that before he came from the rest the prosecutor said that is the man, and then desired them to let him out that he might take a full look at him; he said this before he was called.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290116"/>Q. Are you sure that the gentleman before the prisoner was called pointed out to him as the man? - Not before they hollooed the name of Paterson, then they were all together, Paterson was advancing.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was done as soon as he came to the grate? - The name of Paterson was called by one of the keepers, and the prosecutor was looking through the grating of the gate at the prisoner; the same time, he kept looking through the gate and he saw Paterson among the rest, and he signalized him out and said, that was the man, and when he said that was the man, I asked the keeper to let him through that he might have a perfect look at him; he said he need not look any longer at him for he was sure he was the man; the prosecutor pointed him out before he came from the others.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordon Was your handkerchief ever recovered? - No, I never saw it more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Paterson. I wish to know first how that man can swear to me that hour of the night? - I held him sufficiently long enough under the lamp, I held him a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My hair does not answer the description he gives; it is a dark auborn hair; I would be glad to know whether he was perfectly sober? - Perfectly sober and never otherwise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sanders called me up to the gate, and that gentleman came and looked at me directly.</p>
               <p>Sanders. I am sure he pointed him out first, and then I desired him to come between the gates that he might look at him more fully.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish you to examine the Prosecutor's character to know what house he keeps.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What sort of a house is it you keep? - It is a large house of forty pounds a year, it is let ready furnished, it is let to women of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single man? - I am not a married man; I have a person that has lived with me this many years; I have carried on the business of a taylor a number of years, I have a shop in Drury-lane where my men work as well as my house in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Paterson's name called at the gaol? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, was he advancing from the rest, or along with the rest? - He was along with them; I looked through the grating, and there was a great number of prisoners, and I said there he is.</p>

            , a wine and brandy merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Being out of place, and Sunday being an idle day you and your companion had been drinking together? - We had been but not so as not to know what we were about.</p>
               <p>Q What time of the Sunday was it you first went into a public house? - I did not go into any public house in the day till I came to the ship in Swallow-street about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had not been in any house before to drink? - We might have liquor in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q How much might you have in the garden? - We had some in one place and some in another.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to evade the answer. These gardens belong to public houses, do not they? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what time in the morning did you go to these gardens? - It was between eleven and twelve when I set out from my lodgings, and I got to the gardens about an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the gardens - Somewhere about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank in the gardens I suppose? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before dinner, and on an empty stomach, and a little liquor will then do a good deal of execution. Now where else did you get drink next? - We did not drink any thing till we came back to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q Where did you dine? - At a cook's shop; after that we drank together again for about an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. No, the person does not dispense good liquor, he only gives good advice. Where did you go next? - We walked to Kentish Town, we went to a house that belonged to my master, a house that he keeps there, a private house, my master is not there, the house is empty; we went to look into the gardens; we went after that into a garden over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the house? - We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the garden did not produce any liquor whatever? - But the liquor can be brought in though.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted it was brought in; how much did you take there? - About two pints or three pints of cider.</p>
               <p>Q. Cider alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing else with the cider, because the cider is apt to disagree with the bowels? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go next? - We came home again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after that? - We came to Swallow-street again, we went to a house there and drank tea, and sat there the evening till about ten o'clock, when we went into the Ship; and came out again at half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had parted with your friend Colebert and came out of the last public house, was you in your way home? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your home? - No. 161, Oxford-street, directly opposite Davis-street; I was going from home when this man came up to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you been at supper at the Ship? - We had been drinking at the Ship, but not getting our supper.</p>
               <p>Q. You then had been drinking again at the Ship, and after that was going to get your supper at eleven o'clock at night? - I suppose when we went out of the Ship it was half after ten; when we are out of place we sup when we like; it was in my way to supper when this man came up to us; he was a perfect stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. He was pretty drinky, was not he? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you drink there? - We drank six pennyworth of gin and water.</p>

               <p>Q. Not in the whole course of the time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told us all the truth on this occasion; was not you in company with bad women? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you was not in the whole course of your walking with him, in company with any bad women? - There was a bad woman came into the house while I was there; but there was no woman with me all the way I was coming home not coming up or going down only the woman that came into the house while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was at the corner of Stratford-place there was a watch box close by you? - Yes, I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner began pulling you there? - He began pushing me across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You began then to suspect him; why did not you call out to the watchman who was in the box? - I did call out, and the watchman was standing at the corner of the market, and told me the prisoner ran down James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you called watch, the watch did not come up? - There was no watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at what time did the watchman tell you that the man was gone down James's-street? - This was after I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was quite sober you got up the moment you was pushed down. What was that watchman's name? - I don't know; I asked them why they did not come, they told me they did not hear me call, not one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come up at all? - They were coming from the door when I was coming to them.</p>
               <p>Q. On what beat was this watchman that you spoke to? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you ever applied to any watchman to come forward on this occasion? did you ask these watchmen to pursue or spring their rattles? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not desire them to make any alarm or make any pursuit, and in fact they did not? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from you when he pushed you down? - I was pushed down the corner of Davis-street, and the watchmen were all standing in the middle of Oxford market.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him the moment when you got up; which way did the prisoner run? - Across the road down James's-street; so they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him run? - I did not, when I got up he was out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say just now, that you got up immediately almost as you was pushed down? - I got up as soon as I could; he knocked me down, and I could not get up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did the blow hit you? - On the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it knock your hat off? - It did not; when I fell against the wall my hat fell off, my hat was off when I was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a violent blow? - I don't know, it was very violent.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you produce any kind of mark to the watchmen on this head of your's? - No, it was a blow on the temple, on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. No bruise, no bump at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was the other side that fell against the wall? perhaps a wall will not bruise a head like your's? - It was not hurted.</p>
               <p>Q. This head of your's, I wish you would go with the Duke of York's army, for according to your account of it, a cannon ball would not hurt it. Nor you never found any bruise nor bump; he seems to be a very good stout man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290121"/>which could hit a hard blow? - He knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you was quite sober? - I don't say I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how far you was gone towards drunkenness? - I knew very well what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had your watch about you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - I felt him pulling the chain before he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before he knocked you down? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you call watch? did you call up the street? - I was out of Oxford-road then, it was in Davis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You came down the Stratford side of the way, and you said just now that the moment he began to push you you suspected him, and called out? - I did not suspect him till he got hold of the chain of my watch; I called out as soon as I felt he got hold of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not call out, till he had hawled you from Stratford-place side of the way, into this place by the timber yard? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out while you was in Oxford-road or not? - I believe I was off the road getting on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment he began to push you you suspected him? - I did the moment he got hold of the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out before you got to Davis-street? - I did, I called out as soon as he got hold of the chain of the watch; he shoved me across instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not call out all the time he was pushing you across Oxford-road? - I did not till he got hold of the chain of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then direct opposite to Stratford-place is South Moulton-street, Davis-street goes aslant? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you suffered him to be pushing you all that way, and never called out; you say you got up directly; was you stunned by the blow? - I cannot say I was much stunned by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you, or was you not? - I was not stunned by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing to prevent you from getting up, and yet you could not see which way the prisoner went? - I saw a man running down the corner of James's-street, whom I suspected to be the prisoner, when I went to the watchmen I asked them, and they said a man ran down James's street; I asked them if they did not see a man? and I asked them why they did not come when I first called? and they said they did not hear.</p>
               <p>Q. And they made no pursuit after him, nor did you; and you have not called any one of these watchmen to be a witness here to day. Have you had any conversation with Cole about this business? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You charge him with a highway robbery, and you are out of place; how long have you been out of place? - Between two and three months.</p>
               <p>Q. So this force; this knocking down, and this violence, makes it altogether an highway robbery? - It is an highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you get, how much by it? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard that there is a forty pounds reward on the conviction of any one for an highway robbery? - I have heard it since the prisoner was taken; I never heard it in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear it since, and who told you? - I heard it in this Court by the counsel of a person that was tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the first that you heard it from? - My master was the first that informed me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When, how long ago? - I cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a month ago? - Not a month ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290122"/>Q. Was it before you preferred your indictment? - I cannot say exactly when I was before the grand jury, but I heard of it before I was before them.</p>
               <p>Q. In the drunken state in which you was you would have trusted your friend Colebert with your watch I have no doubt? - He had a watch of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been going any where for any particular purpose, you would have had no objection to have trusted your friend Colebert to have kept your watch for you? - I was quite sober enough to keep it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner taken up? - At the Cross Keys, Mary-le-bone lane, at his pay table; I went to the house where we were drinking, and asked a person if they knew the prisoner, and where he worked, and I found his master, and I went to him, and his master told me he was at work on a job for him in the country, and he came back to his pay table on Saturday night, and there he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, man, when he was taken and asked about the watch, did not he tell you if you would describe the watch you should have it? - He did not; I had been there a quarter of an hour before he came in there.</p>
               <p>Q. This man is not out of place? - His master told me he was gone down to work at Woodford.</p>

               <p>Q. You went into the country that day; what house did you go into? - We drank in the country that day to be sure, but I don't recollect where, and I am sure we were not the worse for liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. You never sat down at the Ship to drink an hour together? - We sat down there to drink about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that before supper? - We had no supper at all; we were going to the Thirteen Cantons to supper when we met this man.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear you was ever absent three days in a week? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you or are you not in the character of a runner? - I don't know whether I am or not; I am not confined there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are constantly attending there? - Sometimes I am not there from morning till night.</p>
               <p>Q. I find you have introduced a great deal of conversation which we did not hear from the others. Do you know there is a reward of forty pounds if this man is convicted? - But what of that, sir? I have no more thought about the forty pounds than I have about this here.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good deal of conversation before you got there? - The man came to me about seven o'clock in the evening on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before? - They came to me on the Tuesday, and then Mr. Hurd told me he had been robbed; about seven o'clock on Saturday they came again, and we took him about eight o'clock; I don't suppose we could be in the house above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that conversation which you have related of the prisoner, passed in the presence of the two witnesses; - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are then not ignorant of this forty pounds? - I have spoke nothing but truth.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man had described to you that he had been robbed, and a man was seen running you would have thought it your duty to pursue? - I had no occasion to pursue, because the man was present.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you would not have done such a thing if this man had described to you he had been robbed, and a man was running? - I don't know whether I should or not; very likely I should; I know it is my duty to do so.</p>

On the 18th of May the constable Cole charged me to assist him in apprehending the prisoner; I went with Cole into Mary-le-bone-lane, to a public house called the sign of the Cross Keys; the prosecutor pointed out a man to Cole, and said, that was the man that robbed him; Mr. Cole took him into the parlour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290125"/>and took a watch from his pocket which the prosecutor said that is my watch; the prisoner said, I never saw you before in my life, that is my watch I can prove I had it this four years. I assisted Mr. Cole to take him to the watch-house; that is all I know of it; Mr. Cole had the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. The man, the officer says, that he first of all searched his breeches pockets, and there he found nothing, but he found this watch in his fob? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Though you attended to them at the time you cannot say that he did not make that demand, that the prosecutor should describe the watch, and tell the number before he gave it up.</p>

            , No. 69, Cable-street. I took in a cotton apron for sixpence the 1st of May, and a shift for sixpence the 2d of May, and a blanket for fourpence the 3d of May; I am sure it was the prisoner; I had seen her before. (The things deposed to by Mrs. Garland.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lodged with this good woman a matter of two years, and I always used to go out a charing, and get money, and I used to give her the money; she used to have the money and support herself with it; she used to want me to turn out and look for men; and when I would not she used to lick me and abuse me, and when I came to prison I had a black eye, and I have been in the sick ward almost ever since; she desired me to pawn the things.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garland. I never desired her to pawn any of the things; she pawned them for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She is just moved to that house where she is; and pays twenty-pence a week for it, she knocked me down, she wanted me to go with men, both with blacks and whites, and I am not guilty of the crime; I have no witness nor a friend in the World; I was born in a place called Southampton, I have friends there, but none in London.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Had you any knowledge of her pawning of these things? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now that she pawned them to get drunk? - I am certain she did, because she came in drunk and went out sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever suffer her to pawn any thing at all? - Yes, she did, my own things.</p>

When I came nigh the place this William Sanders followed me and says here is my fine woman; with that he called to me and said, Mrs. Marshall I want to speak to you; on which I went up to him, and the first word he said to me was, fine woman, are you going to give me any gin? I told him I had no gin money, it was better for him to take and pay me what he owed me; he then called me a very bad name, a bloody whore, and up with his hand and knocked me down; when I was going to get up, he upped with his foot and kicked me in the mouth, and knocked three of my teeth out; my blood gushed out with a deal of blood, and I spit my teeth out on the ground; I immediately catched hold of him, and tore his shirt; I fixed on him and laid hold of him by the shirt, and tore his shirt; with that he laid hold of me by the hair of my head, and he dragged me into the stable, and he threw me under an horse, and he hit the horse to make it stand on me; I cried out for mercy, and he saw the horse startlish, and he took me by the right hand to pull me from underneath the horse and immediately I dropped the money, and he took and dragged me towards the door, and kicked and beat me very much; he pulled me from there to throw me some where else about the stable; immediately as he saw the money drop he directly dragged me towards the door, and kicked me in a woful manner; I ran out of the stable as fast as I could.</p>

On 27th of April last, at eight o'clock, or a little past, I was serving my customers and I saw a man looking in at the window; I looked very earnestly at him, and I saw him move his foot; I went out to him, and he was kicking a cask of butter; I ran up to him, and asked him what he was taking? he said he saw some boys rolling of it, and he began rolling, and he was rolling of it by his arms when I took hold of him; he could not lift it, it was two hundred weight and odd; there was no one boy there, but himself; I stopped him with the butter, and took him and called the people into my own shop for assistance. (The cask produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Was this butter your's that you have been speaking of? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. How many minutes might have elapsed from the time you saw the cask at the door, to the time you saw it with the prisoner? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think? state as accurate as you can. - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it five? - Something more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ten? - It might be ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible that twenty boys might have helped roll that cask while you was serving your customer? the cask in question did not stand by the counter, did it? - No, it stood at the door in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you was serving your customer you could not see the cask? - Not without turning my head that way; I could not always have my eye on that.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it might have been rolled by boys for what you know to the contrary? - There were no boys there.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible that you could look at the firkin and the customers at the same time, therefore the boys might have been there for ought you know.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he ask leave for his wife to come? - I cannot justly say, she might be there three weeks or a month, or longer; I did not put it down; we delivered the articles to him in the room, a feather bed, bolster and pillow, two woollen blankets, two sheets, a coverlid; all the articles mentioned in the indictment; the brass candlesticks he had to light them to bed on the 8th of May, and the 9th she pawned it with Mr. Hammond.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these things? - He went away the 13th in the morning, and I went up and looked through the hole, and saw the bedstead drawn across the room, and the door was opened, and the things were missing, and I pursued him and had him taken in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he convey the feather bed out? - We suspect it was taken out by piece meals. The woman was not with him when the lodgings were taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You let lodgings all the year round to travellers, and to persons of all descriptions? - I seldom take in any body without a character.</p>
               <p>Q. But you receive travellers and persons frequently without any previous knowledge of them? - Not one time in a twelve month; I have not done it for more than a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a communication between the prisoners apartment, with some other part of the kitchen, a kind of trap door? - There is a place we can call down to the cook at a dinner, or of that sort, but that was fastened down to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that aperture big enough to admit a chair or a bed to pass through? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it big enough to admit the person of a man or woman? - I never took such particular notice; I know it was very loose at the time I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that it was so circumstanced that it could be opened with ease? - When I went to the house I fastened it down myself and I never examined it since to this day.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was it while the prisoner lodged in your house? - It was fast when he went in there; I saw it fast; it was fastened by me just before he came in, by a nail, the very time that I let the room to a single man; I fastened the place up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290132"/>Q. Did you see it every day after you fastened it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This house of your's is in Smithfield, and I presume you have a good deal of custom to it? - So far as to live.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact it is a common open public house, open to every person that chuses to use it; you have a victualler's licence? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe there are sometimes insurances in the lottery going on there? - Never was.</p>
               <p>Q. There are men and women company come in at pretty late hours? - My house is always shut up at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Mr. Stack lodge at your house? - To the best of my knowledge he came the 8th or 9th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mr. Stack was not there when you broke open the door? - I was not there when it was done, I was gone out about some other business.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have a bunch of keys whereby you can occasionally go in and out when you want? - I had not any key that would open that door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any key in your house to your knowledge that would open Mr. Stack's door? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems this lock was a very common lock? - It was appraised in to me when I came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room when you entertained this suspicion in the occupation of Mr. Stack, and you expected to be paid? - I did expect to be paid till such times as I found myself mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't mean your wife; have you any persons concerned in the business? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose the prisoner owed some rent? - He did above a guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Is it not within your knowledge that Stack had another room for fear of the bailiffs? - I did not know it, I did understand that that house of Mrs. Rose's was his own right and property, and that Mrs. Wheeler was his lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact he was afraid of being arrested, and he had other apartments for that reason? - He never told me about his business no further than I imagined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he act as a man in debt? - He did go out by six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No never in my life but twice.</p>
               <p>Court. What business did he pretend to be? - He pretended to be a lawyer, and a man of consequence, and brought in papers and large bundles of writings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. However that lady at the bar he stated to be his wife, and you received her as such? - We did.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of the rolls. On Monday the 13th of May, about half after eight, I was called to take charge of the prisoners at the bar for a felony, at Breames-buildings, for robbing Goodall at the White Swan; when I came to the door I found a great croud about the door; I went in to the landlord to know what I was wanted there for; he said that the prosecutor wanted me to search his house for the prisoners now at the bar; I asked if such people where at his house? he said they had been there, and were gone, but they would be there in a little time; in the course of five or ten minutes they came to the house, and the landlord called me to receive them,

             if she had any duplicates? she said, no; I then proceeded to search her person; on searching her at first I found two keys which were owned afterwards by different prosecutors, who are here now; I had nearly given up searching her when I found something stiff, I desired her to let me see what that was; I found they were duplicates; she kept some in her hand, and some she put in her mouth, and chewed them the same as I would bread and butter; there were some taken out of her hand, and some fell on the ground, and some she put in her mouth, and one I positively swear, but how many more I cannot say that she did chew like bread and butter; the man was sent down to New Prison; we searched him and found nothing on him except a copy of a forty pound note, which he said was of great consequence to him, so we returned it and some blank papers. In the morning came two women to ask leave to see the prisoner, I did not know who they were or what they were; I opened the door, and told them not to go too nigh, they asked him immediately for the keys of the rooms and I delivered them to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You was present at this delicious meal on pasteboard, you saw some pawnbrokers duplicates and I suppose you examined those that she fed upon, before she began her operation? - If I had done that I should not have let her done it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was pawnbrokers duplicates? - By the check; positively on my oath I sware to her swallowing, and chewing one duplicate, and after she had chewed that same duplicate for a quarter of an hour she complained of a load on her stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you did not take these papers into your hands before she did chew them? - No, I could not do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is that they were in that state, and they were never in your hands, she would not wish you to touch what she eat. What other things did you find on her? - A bundle and a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing there you knew, any thing there owned by other persons? - No.</p>

The candlestick is mine, there is a gentleman now in court who mended it; I am confident to it by this little bit of a knob that was in casting of it; I bought five of them all odd ones; the rug is mine; it was used as a coverlid, it was an outside rug and a little damaged, which I was allowed something for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. I think there are about fifty thousand candlesticks of that kind in London. Don't you know that these candlesticks are cast in a mould? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know this; whether persons that make candlesticks make a mould for every different candlestick that they cast or do you happen to know that they cast fifty thousand in one mould.</p>

               <p>Q. A candlestick came to you to mend; you did not measure the candlestick? - I know my work where I mend; it is the same candlestick.</p>
               <p>Q. Well and you being a founder, I presume that other candlesticks have been mended by you? - Without doubt, many, I have mended a great many, but I never mended any other of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a knob? - There has been a soldered place in the foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably the same mould serves for a great many candlesticks? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it is very probable an hundred more might be cast of the same description, and the same quality of metal? - Without a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you know it by the soldering? - That is the candlestick that I had to mend.</p>

            . In the first place I asked my landlord for the key on Saturday last, to go to bed; he gave me the key; so I went up and I saw a pannel of Anston's room broke open, and a man inside looking through where the pannel was broke through; the door was padlocked; I called to him and I asked him if he lodged along with that young man in that room, and he never spoke; I asked him again, but he never spoke, but got out of sight; then I went down and I told my landlord, and my landlord took the key of that room, and Anston and me, and him all went up together; he opened the door, and the person was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hole big enough in this pannel to let a person out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think the person must have gone out of this pannel? - He went out of the window; my landlord went out of the window to look after him; we found the window open; my landlord went out at the window on the top of the house, and there he found him; I saw him find him; my landlord took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the man? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - The watchman found some keys and a knife; the watchman is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in regard to this pannel, was there always a hole in it? - No, it had just been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Might the man have come in at the window? - No, he could not, for that house is ten feet higher than any other house; he was taken on my landlord's house. It was a garret window he got out at.</p>
               <p>Court to Anston. Was you at home at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go up on the alarm? - I did</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last been in the room? - I came home from shop about six o'clock; I was in then.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the window? - Open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ladder near, or any way by which a man might get in at the window? - No, my lord, it is full ten feet higher than the houses of either side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the room did you lock the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Was the pannel safe? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up on the alarm; how did you find the pannel? - The boards quite open, with a hole big enough for any man whatever. I did not see the prisoner till I saw him on the top of the house, and my landlord had got him, and I knew him when I first saw him; it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290136"/>a little after eight, as near as I can say, it was very day light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there day light enough to see a man's face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Had you lighted candles below? - Yes, and we brought a candle lighted up with us; I knew the prisoner before, no acquaintance before, but I knew his person perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room did you find the things in the same state as when you left them? - No, the box was removed.</p>
               <p>Q Were all the articles in the indictment in the box? - I did not look then; I had put all the things in the box the Monday before, and I don't recollect opening the box after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this box removed from? - From the floor on to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing out of it? - No, nothing; the lock was forced.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left it locked before? - Yes. I am sure when I went in before the box was not on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house at this time? - Mr. Folkstone,

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - Yes, I took him in Blue Anchor-alley; I did not lose sight of him half a minute; he had the property on him when I took him; I brought him to the house of the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what I am here for; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable and beadle. Mrs. Greasley where Mr. Tooner lodges sent for me; they gave me charge of the prisoner at the bar, for robbing them of these articles; I went and searched her, and I found these duplicates that she said were her own. (Produced, and two of them deposed to by Neale the pawnbroker.) I found this key which opens her own lock and the other lock where Mrs. Tooner says her clothes were left, but with great difficulty; I found some things at a neighbouring house, and I was made to understand that she carried them there; it was at No. 4, Haydon-court, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Tooner's lodgings; I was informed they were carried there to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew the things to the prisoner? - Yes, she went with me, and shewed me where she carried them; I found there a muslin handkerchief and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Tooner. What do you produce? - A gown and a coloured apron that we found under the bed, under a lodger's bed; I left these things about eight weeks ago at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return? - The next Sunday after but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room and find the things missing? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so kind as to look at the two things produced by the pawnbroker, and tell me whether they are your things; I think the one is a cotton gown and the other a linen apron? - They are mine; they were left in the box; I know the gown, I put new sleeves into it before I left it; my name is on the linen apron; there is my name on the cotton stockings; the two muslin handkerchiefs I only just made them before I went to my place</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Greasley. Are any of those things that you saw on the woman's back here? - This check apron I am confident of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing about it, nor do I know what I was taken up for; when I was taken up they put their hand in and took some duplicates out of my pocket, and seven-pence, they had me down to the watch-house one night, and the next morning they took me up to the justice's, and I knew not what they took me there for; I have lived in places where I have always had an upright character; I never touched a rag of any body's, for I had plenty of my own to put on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in his hands? - No, I did not, it lay close by the side of him as he lay down in the inside.</p>

It was an old iron door frame, that lay by as old iron, it was left about four or five yards from the place where it was found with the prisoner; my father keeps Bagnigge Wells; it was laying against a fence in a yard where we keep lumber in, on the other side of the ground.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This affair happened on Saturday night, this witness, who is a witness against me, owed me some money; in the course of the week I had asked him for it, and I told him I would summon him for it on Friday; I know nothing about the stove, it was not found in my room; I was in my own room sitting by my own fire when they came; it was found behind the passage door.</p>
               <p>Constable. It was behind the first door before a small passage which leads to other peoples door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he call on you for the money? - No, he never asked me; his wife said, why did not I pay Sam the six-pence; I had not the six-pence then to pay her when she asked me.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that your nephew at the bar? - Yes. I was sitting in the parlour the 27th of January. (I live in <placeName id="t17930529-74-crimeloc407">Lemon-street, Goodmans-fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see him as soon as it was done? - I saw the side of his face but I did not see his hand or arm, I was so frightened; I was sitting down, and I got up, I turned my head and I saw my nephew; he went out into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your nephew appear to have any thing about him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your nephew when you saw him? - Partly behind my back in the parlour; he walked out from the parlour like a man frightened and went into the next house; he went into my yard first, after he went there I cannot say any thing more. I said, my God! my God! what is this you have done.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you last see him after this happened? - Going out of my own wash-house into my own yard.</p>
               <p>Q Is there a thoroughfare from your yard to the next house? - There is no gate but some small pallisades, which he had used to get over.</p>
               <p>Q Where did you say my God! my God! what is it you have done? - I was so frightened I hardly knew what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the same room besides you and him that you knew? - Not any one.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom do you impute the firing of this pistol? - I cannot pretend to say, I did not see any pistol from first to last, but I should suppose from the wound it was from some piece, pistol or gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the wound was made by? - By a ball of some piece.</p>
               <p>Q The wound was by a ball you say, was that ball shewn to you when it was extracted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ill will at all between you and your Nephew? - I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was your nephew taken after that? - He only went into the next house, he never went from there as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the instrument by which this was done at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We understand then that there was nobody else in the room besides your nephew and yourself, so that nobody else can give an account of this transaction except yourself; you say your nephew was behind you; during the whole time you had observation of him; you did not see gun or pistol or any thing else, I believe your nephew and you had been always on very good terms? - Six years almost we had lived comfortable together.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to the recorder and court just now, that there was no ill will between you? - Not on my side, nor I hope on his.</p>
               <p>Q. The nephew went to the next house, he never went any further? - He was there I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you Mr. Lloyd, what is his mind, is he completely in possession of his mind? - I don't know he was ever affected, I never observed any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290144"/>thing that led me to think that he was so.</p>
               <p>Q. So what the wound was given by, you don't know, as you never saw any piece.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear any report? - Yes, I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your nephew? - I believe he is turned of sixteen or seventeen.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he make you any answer when you said good God! what have you done? - Not a word, he seemed frightened so.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; the prisoner has a brother and he was taken up for this offence, and the brother was discharged and I was bound over to prosecute this prisoner; I found some things in the brother's box, I found some cases of pistols, and on one of the cases there was a label; I found some powder and shot; on drawing the charge of the pistol which was produced at the office, the powder and ball which I found in the brother's box corresponded to the ball in the charge; I found the brother's box in the New-court, in the Old Bailey, nearly opposite these gates; the brother was an apprentice to a cooper in Whitechapel, but he had ran away from his master, and I don't know how he lived at that time, I understand him to be about twenty; when I apprehended the brother, I apprehended him in Cornhill, I found on him a key, and I examined him as to where he lived; he told me, and I came to No. 3, New-court, Old Bailey, and there were two children only in the house, at last I found the box in the cellar; on one of the cases was a label, I had received information where the pistols was purchased, and I went with this case with the label to the shop, the man said, that this case was purchased with the pistols, but he could not tell who purchased them, therefore I did not bring him to the office. I found likewise a canister of powder, I understand he lived in these lodgings by himself, and I found likewise some shot or small ball. I found also the key of some pistols.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did it appear to be the same sort of ball as was extracted from you? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You apprehended the brother in Cornhill, and went to his lodgings, and there you found a key and some cases belonging to pistols, this was at this boy's brother's lodgings, and he had ran away from his master and there he lived by himself and it was his lodgings? - I know him to have run away.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did your nephew live with you? - Yes, he did for twelve years to the present time.</p>
               <p>Jury. That brother had not been at your house that afternoon? - Not to my Knowledge; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He used of course frequently to come to your house? - He did, but whether he was there that day, I do not say, nor will I take on myself to swear.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure the piece was discharged in the room, was the window broke? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open or shut? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. I think I understand you to say that when this happened you stood up and turned your head round, did you then see the prisoner in the room or in the wash house? - He was going out of the parlour into the wash-house; when he was in the room I heard him turning the books over, and I thought he was reading, as he used to read frequently.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any smell of powder? - I suppose there must, but I was so frightened I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody came into the room soon afterwards? - The next neighbour came in directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you see by the appearance of these coals whether they were the same coals that came from the barge? - I think they were; then I rowed on shore to the Orchard house and called the officer that is in court,

               <p>Q. Did you go up with him? - No, we pursued directly after the boat and found the prisoner in the peter boat with the property which I described before, we took possession of the coals, and brought him up before the magistrate, there might be six or seven bushels, some of them are brought here, they have been in the office ever since, and there was a seal put on each sack.</p>

I took them into the boat and we went round and got to the craft, then Mr. Peat stepped into the craft and took the name and number of the barge, 1,018, Beccy; after we had seen the lighterman, Mr. Peat spake to the lighterman, we then after that pursued after the boat, and took it; the peter boat was up at Blackwall at a good distance from there, I dare say half a mile, the boy was rowing the boat in by the side of the Gun at the upper part of Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in a direction from the barge? - Yes, it is where the boy and his master lives.</p>

A barge came down from Blackwall and the wind blowed very hard, they were on the lee shoar; I was standing at the Gun-yard at play, and the man could not hold his craft in, he immediately called out for help, my fellow servant called me out of the yard and I went and helped the man almost round from Bow-creek, and he had no money to pay me and he told me to take some coals, he insisted on our taking them for our good nature for helping him down off the lee shore, and my fellow servant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290149"/>chucked them on board because he would not dirty his boat with them.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Mrs. Smith's house; I went down for a pail of water and I saw something lay on the dust hole which I pulled; the dust hole is at the bottom of the kitchen stairs; I laid hold of it, it pulled against me, I drawed the pail of water and went by the dust hole again and pulled it again, and it pulled very much against me. I went up stairs and knocked at my landlady's door, I saw, but I could not particularly observe what it was I saw, it was a person laying there, which very much alarmed me; I desired them to go down and look into the dust hole for there was somebody there that ought not to be; my landlady went down and met the old woman the prisoner, standing on the stairs, and went down and found the sheet in the dust hole; she said that she had been there to sleep and I had awaked her; it was between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. How long had you left the kitchen? - It might be two or three hours, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Elder. Was the old woman drunk or sober? - She appeared stupid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the sheet nor had it till I see the gentlewoman had it in her own room; I had four witnesses here on Saturday but they could not come to day.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I produce the sheet; I took the woman into custody and took the sheet, and have kept it till now.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand you that you was going home, did you go back again? - I walked a little way out of the way for home while she was telling her story; when she robbed me I was just standing still, I was talking to her; this was in Holborn.</p>

I have been under the doctor's hands ever since I have been in Newgate; likewise the prosecutor struck me before I struck him; I knew him about five or six months before.</p>

On Sunday the 5th of May, a young man came to me after dinner, and asked for the name of Elizabeth, and asked if she had lived with me? I told him yes; I had then discharged her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290157"/>and she was at a grocer's, another place, she had left my place about six weeks to the best of my knowledge, I told him that such a person had lived with me; he pulled out some tea spoons and asked me if any one of them were mine? I owned one; I went afterwards to her place, looked at her box with the constable, and found this property in her box; I went to one Mr. Barnes's a grocer in Princes-street, Piccadilly, on Sunday the 5th of May, and in her box was found three pocket handkerchiefs, a napkin, and a tea spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she present? - She was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked? - It was, and was opened by Price the constable; she was taken up by the master, Mr. Barnes; I did not appear against her the Monday, because he came to me the Monday morning, and begged I would not, and that he would not go; so by that she was discharged; when she went to the constable to demand my property, and likewise her own spoons, the constable would not give them up. I was sent for to Bow-street about a month ago last Saturday, by an order from the magistrate to go there and prove my own property; when I came to Bow-street I saw my property, and was very much against swearing to it, but I did at last.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took her up at that time? - Nobody; she went to the magistrate to demand the property of the constable as I did not appear against her.</p>
               <p>Q. She behaved well in your service? - Exceedingly rude several times which made me part with her at a day's notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This unfortunate woman at the bar lived with you five months, during that time she deserved a very good character? - Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say in consequence of some information you went, and in her box the spoons were found? - No, the gentleman brought the spoons to me; there were more than one spoon, six or seven in the whole, and one of mine.</p>
               <p>Q You did not mean to prosecute her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire her to go to Bow-street to claim her property? - No, I told her to get the property and I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did go to Bow-street to claim the property of her own accord? - She certainly did go to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how often she might have gone to the constable's before she went to Bow-street? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that she went to the constable's two or three times? - Yes, at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. A week had elapsed before you got to the justice's? - I don't know whether it was a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q At last she was charged on your complaint, now she is committed and on your charge? - I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much against swearing to the property? - I did not wish to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the property after you searched her box, was she discharged from Mr. Barnes's service? - The matter is, she was employed by Mr. Barnes as a charewoman, I fancy he did discharge her in two or three days, he did not immediately, I never went to the house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go back to Mr. Barnes's? - Never there only Sunday the 5th of May, and that day the prisoner was not there, she was at the Round house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was not by when the box was searched? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was her box or not you don't know? - I make no doubt 
it was her box, I know it was her clothes.</p>


               <p>Q You told the prisoner to go to the constable for the property, where did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290158"/>see her? - At her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have lost your husband? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she attended him to the time of his death? - I beg your pardon, I attended him myself.</p>
               <p>Court. When you came to this Mr. Barnes's you examined the box? - I cannot speak to the box.</p>
               <p>Q Who was present? - The constable, Mr. Barnes and myself.</p>
               <p>Q You desired her to get the property? - I told her if she would get the property I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by your request she applied to the constable? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The prisoner went by the appointment of the constable to the magistrate? - I don't know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear that she had been before to the magistrate, and the constable was not there, and she attended another day? - I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of St. James's parish; I was present when these handkerchiefs and this napkin was found in her box, she gave me the key.</p>
               <p>Q Have you got the key here? - No, I gave it her back again, it was a paper box, a ban box; that was not locked where these things were, I am sure of it, the spoons were in a box that was locked but not the napkin and handkerchiefs, the spoons were in a trunk lined with leather, it was a common key she gave; I asked her which was her box? and told her it would be better for her to tell; when I took these things the prisoner was in custody at the watch-house, then she was examined the next morning for another robbery, I was constable of the night on Saturday night; I did not attend before the magistrate because the watch-house keeper had took her up till I came; I was attending on Mr. Hastings's trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an hired constable? - Yes. Because you ought to know that when a person is trying for one offence you have no right to give evidence of any other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - A year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you should have known your business better than to give evidence in this kind of way. When did you see her after she called at your house? - Two or three times after, she came for the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you deliver it to her? - The magistrate advised me not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prosecutor with it? - No, I did not, I did not think it was proper, I did not know who to deliver it to; I went to Mr. Addington's and he desired that the maid might come forward and swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her if she came before the justice that she would have it? - I did, I told her so, I fixed the time.</p>

I said no, he said it was the sweat of his pocket; I got a person who was a stander by, to be so kind as to look at it, and they said they thought they were bad, and would not have me take them, then I gave them to Mullein again, and he laid down four more, the same person that had looked at the others looked at these, and he said to Mullein these will not do, they are all of the same stamp, and I refused them, then Mullein had them all again, he had these eight again; he put down four more and the same person said, they will not do, all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290161"/>these twelve are alike.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings did he produce in all do you think? - I cannot justly say, he had all of them again, he had a hand full of silver.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Did Lett give him any provocation except saying they were bad? - No other. When Mr. Newman came, Mr. Newman insisted upon searching Mulleins before he went out of the house, he did search him, I saw him take the money from Mulleins, I don't know how much exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ten shillings which you had in your hand? - I gave them to Mr. Newman when he came in, and he said they were bad.</p>

               <p>"Common Sense, and the first Parts of the Rights of Man."</p>
               <p>Page 18,</p>
               <p>"It cannot be proved by what right hereditary government could begin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290163"/>neither does there exist within the compass of mortal power a right to establish it, man has no authority over posterity in matters of personal right, and therefore no man or body of men had or can have a right to set up hereditary government."</p>
               <p>Page 19,</p>
               <p>"Hereditary succession is a burlesque upon monarchy, it puts it in the most ridiculous light, by presenting it as an office which any child or an ideot may fill, it requires some talents to be a common mechanic, but to be a King requires only the animal figure of a man, a sort of breathing automaton; this sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man."</p>
               <p>Page 20,</p>
               <p>"A government calling itself free with a hereditary office, is like a thorn in the flesh, which produces a fermentation which discharges it."</p>
               <p>Page 21,</p>
               <p>"The hereditary system therefore is, as repugnant to human wisdom as to human rights, and is as absurd as it is unjust."</p>
               <p>Page 25,</p>
               <p>"Whether I have too little sense to see, or too much to be imposed upon; whether I have too much or too little pride, or of any thing else, I leave out of the question; but certain it is, that what is called monarchy always appears to me a silly contemptible thing. I compare it to something behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of bustle and fuss, and a wonderful air of seeming solemnity; but when by any accident the curtain happens to open and the company see what it is, they burst into laughter."</p>
               <p>Page 26,</p>
               <p>"That monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money, is evident at least to me in every character which it can be viewed."</p>
               <p>Page 27,</p>
               <p>"It can only be by blinding the understanding of man, and make him believe that government is some wonderful mysterious thing, that excessive revenues are obtained. Monarchy is well calculated to ensure this end. It is the popery of government, a thing kept up to amuse the ignorant, and quiet them into taxes."</p>

               <p>I am an officer; on the 16th of April about six o'clock in the evening, I was coming along Petticoat-lane Whitechapel, I met the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder, I had some suspicion seeing something rather round that there was something there more than tools, I asked him what he had got there? he said what is that to you? it is my own property; I said it is to me and I shall see it, he said I should not, however I pulled it off his shoulder, and on the top of the tools I found this large pewter dish and this copper cover, they were covered over with this green coat that they should not be seen; says I, my friend where did you bring this from? says he, I brought them from my own house at Snow-hill; and where do you mean to take it to? says I; to Snow-hill again, says he; says I, I don't think you give a good account of them, and if you cannot give a better account you must go before the magistrate. I got him into the public house before we went into the office where we keep the prisoners, and there he told me that he had been at work for Mrs. Carpenter; I went to Mrs. Carpenter and found he had been at work there, says I, have you missed any pewter dishes? she went round and she said I miss a pewter dish off my salt pan, and a copper cover from my pot. (The dish and cover deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were some taylors drinking in the house and I was drinking with them, and we drank pretty freely, and we got to sky-larking, and I did not like it, and I had some beer to myself; one of the taylor's came to me at last and said, carpenter you had better take your basket and go home, not knowing what was in it, when I went home I took my basket and did not know what was in it no more then of my dying moment; accordingly I was going home and two men met me as I was going home, and they asked me what I had got in my basket? and they took me away directly and locked me up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

I ran backwards directly, and when I came into the yard, the prisoner stood in the yard, on a plank which supports the wall from falling, it is an old wall, he stood with the sheets in his arms, I don't know rightly the length of ground he might be distant from my house; my yard is very small; I ran to him, and pulled the sheets from him, and he jumped over the wall, and I screamed stop thief! I immediately ran back screaming all the way I went; this gentleman that is here pursued him, and took him on a vacant piece of ground at the back of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man that you took the sheets from? - I am very sure, and I am very sorry about it; he had a hat on then, and the same jacket he had on that he has on now; the sheets are here, the constable has them; I gave them to him the next day, one is my own, and the pair was a person's up stairs, that I am paid for washing of them, I am answerable for the sheets, there were three linen sheets in all; my own was marked, I. A. C. No. 2. I am confident of the others they are the same sheets, because I pulled them from his hands before he was out of the yard; had they been out of my sight I could not have been so positive.</p>

On Friday last the 31st of May, between the hours of twelve and one o'clock, I was behind my counter, I found my window had been broke, and a silver fruit knife gone; I keep a hardware shop; my wife was present at the time, she said, you had better take the things out of the window and send for a glazier, and have the window mended; just before dinner my wife went out to see if she could get a knife out by the hole that was broke, and she could but just touch them; we went into dinner, we had not been at dinner three minutes before we saw the prisoner at the bar, he looked first at one part of the shop and then at another; he then looked up and down the street, I went out at the back door and came into the street that way and Mrs. Jones walked forwards toward the shop, when I came to him he had got a hook in his hand, and was trying to take one of the other knives out of the window, a silver handled fruit knife, he drew it from the situation where it was before, about two inches and a half, he had removed it an inch out of the window; I thought he laid hold of it; I seized him instantly, and took him into the shop myself, and when I took him into the shop he had the hook in his hand, some way or another he dropped the hook out of his hand, that I did not find the hook to produce it when I came before the Lord Mayor, but Saturday morning when I was sweeping the shop I found the hook; when I came into the shop Mrs. Jones went out and pushed the knife into the window as far as she could; I am very positive it was removed, because when I went to dinner I observed where it lay, and I was so positive with respect to his having the hook on him, that I had him taken up stairs and searched to find it, but did not find it till the next day.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. I was in the shop at the time that Mr. Jones perceived the window broke and a knife gone; this was before I went to dinner; I went then into the street to see if I could take a knife out with my finger; I could reach one with my finger, but I could not take one out of the hole it was so very small; I wished Mr. Jones to take the knives out of the window; we went into the parlour the back part of the shop, we never took our eyes from the window till we saw the boy come up to the window, he looked in to see if any body was in the shop, and he looked up and down the street, and then he put his hand to the hole of the window, and attempted to get a knife out; Mr. Jones went out of the private door and catched hold of him before he got the knife quite out, and brought him in; I went out into the street and shoved the knife back again to where he had got it from, it was drawn through the hole about an inch, there was one gone besides this, which I have never seen since; I missed that before I sat down to dinner, we missed the first between twelve and one, and the boy came about twenty minutes after one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was looking in at the window when this gentleman laid hold of me, and took me into the shop.</p>

I went on the top of the bulk, and I said, it would not do; I said that is my master's property, you have no business with it; they looked up, but never a one answered; I told them that is my master's property, and the best way will be for to bring it back again, and put it in its place; they jumped down into their master's barge, and says to me, you get down and give us a heave; Garrat said so; with that I made reply, I will not, I am put here in trust to take care of my master's barge, and I will not stir from it, and Lawrence jumped down and lifted it on Garrett's back, and he brought it back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were the prisoners taken up afterwards? - Between ten and eleven the next day; the next day I gave information to Mr. Randal our master's factor.</p>

               <p>Court. What kind of terms are you upon, you and these men; Did you know them before? - Yes, this ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know you was waiting in your barge? - I don't know that they did. Lawrence was watchman in another barge, he was on board of Keith's barge; they came from Abingdon loaded with malt.</p>
               <p>Q. You are all then brother bargemen; is it not customary for somebody to be on board of a night to watch? - It is always customary.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any quarrel with these men? - Never had a word with these men in my life.</p>

Pray, says I, to him, what have you done with the goods? says he, I beg you will send for my father, and I have no doubt but he will settle the matter; says I, are you a son of Mr. Gibbs? yes, says he, I am; I immediately sent for his father, and begged to see him; the message came back that he could not wait on me; I felt a good deal of alarm for the circumstance, I thought it was an extraordinary one, and immediately left my dinner and went to Mr. Gibbs in Fenchurch-street, and told him I was shocked to understand that it was his own son that had these goods, and wished to know whether he had these goods on his account; he said he had not; then, says I, you not owning these goods; I must commit your son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. How far does the father of this lad live from your house? - A small distance; so far as from Clement-court, Milk-street to Fenchurch-street:</p>

               <p>Mr. Hancock. My private opinion of the business is, that the cruel inhumanity of the father has inclined the son to do what he has done; I have heard the story, and understand the circumstance of his having married, and having married a young woman who was a servant, has occasioned the father's displeasure to such a degree, as to send this young man, woman and child into a garret, and to send eighteen-pence at a time to support him, the poor woman and the child; and he knew the situation of the case, he knew that his son had no other mode of getting his bread, but in that line of business. The moment we told Mr. Gibbs, his suspicions led him to his son; the son acknowledged the fact, but in his distress I think he pointed at the right object; I am sorry for the young man's situation.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Cowles in Cornhill, he is in the jewellery line. Having occasion for the articles which are described in the indictment, I sent to Mr. Evance's, and was informed of their being defrauded of such articles, red morocco collars for ladies, being informed they had not got any, we applied for some elsewhere. The articles laying in the window was the cause of the prisoner bringing in some to offer for sale, he came in the 18th of April, saying he had an article which he found on Tower-hill, and seeing that I had an article of the same description in the window, he came to know if I would buy them; he did not know what their value were; from the appearance of his story I thought they were the collars that Mr. Evance's lad was defrauded of, I suspected him, and to be certain before ever I taxed him with it, I begged him to sit down while I went to shew them to Mr. Cowles who was hard by; instead of which I went to Mr. Evance's, and asked Mr. Evance's clerk if they had heard any thing of the collars? he informed me they had not; when I returned to the shop, I found the prisoner was gone, and had left the shop about a minute, I was informed he was gone down Sweeting's-alley; I immediately went in pursuit of him, at the bottom of Sweeting's-alley the prisoner looking about observed me, and he immediately communicated it to some others, as I conceived by their looking about too; I went up to him and asked him if he had not shewn to me some red morocco collars at a shop in Cornhill? he told me he had; says I, why did you leave the shop till you had done your business? the excuse he made was, that he had some business with these friends in Broad-street, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290175"/>he wished to finish it in my absence; I told him he must come back with me and finish the business he had in hand first; accordingly he came back, and he was charged with the constable; the collars are in the custody of the constable.</p>

I saw his horse, but I refused it, I told him I did not want to rap, I came to sell; I left him then; as I rode the horse up and down the market there were several people asked me the price; I told them it was six guineas, I would not take no less, unless it was one shilling to drink, whether I sold him or not; then in a little time after, Sanders said, if I would rap my horse for that grey horse that was in Laugher's possession, he would give me the six guineas; I thought that was the same as if I sold my own; he pulled the money out of his pocket, some money, I cannot say how much, in gold and silver, and shewed me, I made him some answer and held my hand out for the money; I think he said, do your business first; I accordingly asked Laugher whether he would warrant his horse found or not? Fife was not there then; he said he would warrant it found; I agreed to the exchange, and exchanged with him; I told him before I took him into my possession I would have a man to give judgement of the horse; accordingly we went and tolled the horses where the horses are tolled, Sanders went with us, and in a short time after we were there Sanders quitted the room again; I don't recollect what passed while we were there, he then left another man to vouch for him, Laugher was along with him the mean time, we were all three together; when I came out again my brown horse was gone, it was tied up at the rails within three or four yards of the grey horse; when I came out I asked where my horse was? Sanders said he was safe enough; I then asked him to give me the money which he proposed for the grey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290177"/>one? he wanted me to untie this horse from the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you? - No, Laugher untied the horse from the rails he took him from the Toll house, he took him on the left hand from the Toll house, he went to the bottom of the market, and turned up on the right hand; Sanders then took the horse into his possession, and told me to take my horse; I told him it was no horse of mine; then he wanted to shove the halter into my coat at my breast; then he let the halter go, and went off. The horse was there a little space of time, and I asked a man, who I saw there, to take hold of the horse, and I took it up to the Toll house, to take the horse to where he said he lived, and where he brought it from; I got the directions, and when I came out there was a man came up to me and said, farmer, you have been taken in here by a snitch. I went with that man to a public house in Long-lane, where I saw Mr. Fife and three or four or five more, I cannot say exactly, I saw Mr. Fife when I got to the door, and he acknowledged the horse was his, and said it was his servant that had transacted this piece of business with me; he was very sorry that it had happened into a poor man's hands like mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the six guineas? - No. Then I wanted the money, he said I should not be the loser of the horse, he said he had not got the money about him then. I was very much vexed to think of the loss of my horse; I told him I would behave like a man to him, if he would give me five guineas ready money I would take it; he had offered me a note of six guineas for the money of the horse, he told me he would give me a note of hand where to find him to-morrow morning, and then he would pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean a note of hand? - A direction in writing Accordingly I refused taking it, several times I refused the note of hand which he wanted me to take.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer to give you? - He told me he put down in it five pounds five shillings, for the horse; I took that note; I brought the note away with me down to Fleet-market, to Mr. Clipson's in Fleet-market, the Bull and Garter, next door to the prison gates. I cannot read any writing; I am sure that is the paper he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you that note what did you understand that note to be? - He read it me, and told me where to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say this was? - He said it was a note of hand for five pounds five shillings, and told me where to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you to call on him? - No. 6, Harp-court, Fleet market.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note ever paid? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of the parties after that? - I saw Sanders as that happened on Friday, on the next Friday following, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him at Guildhall? - I had taken Laugher at Black Heath Fair, on Thursday after the Friday, I went and fetched a constable, and took him up, and brought him to Guildhall, Sanders came to Guildhall to bail the other out, Mr. Alderman Clarke was the magistrate, then Sanders was apprehended, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before you saw Fife? - I attended here four sessions, and I had attended here two sessions before I saw him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - I believe he is the man, but I cannot positively swear, but to Sanders I will swear to</p>
               <p>Q. When was Fife apprehended? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who apprehended Fife? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the man? - have none in the least, but I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290178"/>swear positively he is the man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gardiner. How long was it you first saw Mr. Fife afterwards? - Five or six or seven months, when I first saw him after this transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Fife? - I cannot say I do; he came to me five or six times along with Mr. Mincher.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note. Have you ever seen that note before? - Yes, I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Fife the defendant with that note? - I was with him about the note; I did not see him at the time; I had a writ against him some time afterwards and then I mentioned it to him; he said he had given such a note. The first night Reeves had been to sell the horse in Smithfield he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Fife about the transaction? - The day after the note was taken I went to demand the money; I told them if the note was not paid they must abide the consequences; I told that to Mr. Mineher; I saw Fife about ten days after, and arrested him; he wanted me to let him go; I told him there was a note also of a poor countryman's at my house; after that he sent the money for the note, and I went down to Mr. Reeve's one Sunday with the money, and he said he would not take it, he was advised to trouble him for horse stealing.</p>
               <p>Q When you saw him ten days after this transaction, you told him you had a note against him, due at your house to one Reeves, what did he say to that? - He said he would pay it as soon as possible with some other little matters, and also the writ I had against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Reeves himself sent you to demand the money for him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all he accepts the note, and the note not being paid he charges him with a felony? - I believe it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did receive the money to pay this note some little time after of

               <p>Mr. Gardiner to Prosecutor. What was it that Mr. Fife said, as exactly as you can recollect on this occasion, when you mentioned what he said about his servant? - He said it was his servant transacted this business with me, and he was very sorry that it had happened into such a poor man's hands like me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know it had the glanders? - I did not; I am no judge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know he was a serjeant of mace for the City of London? - I knew he was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to him in hopes he would get the money for you? - I told him the story, and he offered his services first.</p>
               <p>Q. You tried your men for felony? - They were.</p>

               <p>Q. You know if you had convicted them at that time, you would have been entitled to a certificate? - What do you mean; I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Then attend to me. Supposing you had convicted them, do you know that you would have had an exemption from parish officers? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Fife he gave you the note, and he said that the other person was his servant, Laugher was his servant? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. There was nothing said about Sanders at that time? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You applied to Clipson as your friend? - I did.</p>
