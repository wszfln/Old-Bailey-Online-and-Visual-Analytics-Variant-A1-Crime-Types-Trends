The 7th of May, at eleven o'Clock at Night, I went to Bed and left my Son (who is my Partner ) up, and about five in the Morning, he came up and told me, that the House was broke open, and we were robb'd; that the Drawer in the Bar was broke to Pieces, that the House was broken into up-one Pair of Stairs, that a Pane of Glass was taken out, and the Casement left open, and that the House-door was unlock'd and left open. My Lord, I miss'd the two Linnen Bags, one of Silver, and the other of Gold, in which there was upwards of 190 Pounds in Gold and Silver.

<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174206030003"/> was Sen'night, I was in the Country as Hackney, and the Prisoner's Master came and told me, that he had taken the Person that had robb'd me, and had got the greatest Part of my Money. I came Home on Monday, and went to the Sun-Tavern, in Milk-Street, where the Prisoner was brought from the Compter, by the Constable. I ask'd the Prisoner which way he robb'd me. He said, that he clamber'd up the Out-side of the Bar, in the Court, and got up into the Coving of the first Floor, and that he drew up a large Sash Window, that open'd into the first Floor, and the Shutter being fast pin'd, he could not get in there; that then he went to the Casement that was on the Stair-case, and took out a Pane of Glass (a square Piece of Glass) and put his Hand in, and opened the Casement in the Inside. I ask'd him, whether he took the Pane of Glass out with a Knife, and he said no, he did it with his Nail: he said, that then he went into the first Floor, and came down Stairs, and open'd the Bar-door, and went into the Bar, and broke open the Drawer with a Chissel. I ask'd him, how he came by the Chissel, he said, he bought it for that purpose. I then ask'd him, where it was, and he said, that he had thrown it away: He then own'd that he took both Baggs of Money away, a Bag of Gold and a Bag of Silver. I ask'd him, what he did with them, he said, that he went into his Master's House, that the Door he had left upon a jar, and went up Stairs, and hid the Bag of Gold between two Stacks of Chimneys at the Top of his Master's Leads, and then went down upon the Leads of the Church, and hid the Bag of Silver in a Hole under the Roof; then I took the Bank Note that he had of 100 l and asked him, whether the Money that fetch'd that Bank Note was mine, and he said it was. My Lord, there was 18 l. that he had lodg'd in a young Man's Hands, at the other End of the Town, and he said, that that was also my Property, and the young Man's Master delivered the Money up to us.

            . About half an Hour after eleven at Night, the 11th of May last, my Father seemed very sleepy, and I asked him, whether he would not go up to Bed, and he went up to Bed, my Mother was gone up before. About twelve o'Clock at Night, I told my Money, and put it into these two Bags, and lock'd the Drawer, and put the Key into my Pocket, the Company being all gone, I went all round the House, and put my Hand against this Casement that was broke open, and it was safe. The next Morning I call'd the Men up at five o'Clock, as I always do, and they went down Stairs, and in about five Minutes time, the Men came and told me, that the Door was broke open, and the Till was broke, and I came down and found it so, and I miss'd the 2 Baggs, one of Gold, and the other of Silver, there was in them, 195 Pounds, or thereabouts; there was 96 Guineas carried to the Bank, and 8 Guineas and half a Moidore, I found at an Aunts of this Lads in Black-Fryars, he told his Master that he had lodg'd them there. When I came down and found my House broke open, I saw upon the Table by the Bar, the Marks of his Feet, and the two bends of his Knees upon the Top of the Leads over the Bar. He endeavour'd to take out one Pane of Glass, but could not; he then took a Pane of Glass out over that, and then open'd the Casement. The Saturday Sen'night after, a Gentleman came to me about 9 at Night, and desired I would go and fetch a Constable, for he had got the Thief, and then we went into his Master's Shop, and took him out, and had him to the Nagg's-Head Tavern, and we had there the young Fellow that had got the 18 Pounds, that he (the Prisoner) had left in his Hands. Mr. Brigg's asked Shad, where he had the Money, and he said that he found it; but before that, he had told Noel Gregory, that he had made Wigs for it, and then Mr. Briggs took him into another Room with his Master and another Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you there?</p>
               <p>J. Stepple. No. The Sunday Morning I went to him to the Compter, and told him, that I was sadly afraid, that he had impeached an innocent Person, and that I had very good Reason for it; that if a Person had been concerned with him in the Robbery, he would not have taken the Bag of Silver for his Share; and then he cried, and said, his Life laid in my Hands, and he then confess'd, that the Person that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174206030004"/> had ask'd him what he had done with the Bagg of Silver, he said, he had hid in under the Roof upon the Leads of the Church, Event the next Morning and took him one of the Compter, and got a Carpenter, and we went and took up a couple of Boards according to his (the Prisoners) Direction, and we found it, and he (the Prisoner) was with us when we found it.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of a Pistol?</p>

               <p>Another Watchman. Mr. Haviland came to our Watch-house and said, he was robbed by two Men, we went immediately along with him, and he took hold of the Prisoner, and said, this is the Man that clapp'd the Pistol to my Breast and the other Man ran away.</p>

He had no Arms with him, only two Knives, a Tobacco box, and Flint, which he used to strike Fire with when he smoaked. I live near the London 'Prentice.</p>

               <p>Smith. No, my Lord, she came to my House, and sat down by the Fire Side, and happened to fall in a Fit, and it held her 3 or 4 Hours, but not Speechless, and this was about 3 Weeks before he came out of Newgate. - After his Wife was dead he came to our House and called at the Window, and my Wife called out to him and said, God bless you, get away, or you'll go to Newgate To-morrow, and he went away, and never was seen in the Parish from that Day to this.</p>

               <p>The Counsel for the Prosecution in opening the Charge, took Notice that Mrs. Proctor came from her Brother's in Somersetshire, and lodged at Mrs. Davidge's a Milliner in Covent Garden, where the Prisoner came acquainted with her and married her, and pretended to be a Person of very considerable Fortune; that as he understood her Fortune was not very large, and that as he had a Dependance on an Uncle, therefore desir'd it might be kept a Secret; he promised he would bring a Friend to be Witness of the Marriage; but when he came there was no body in the Coach with him, and the only Reason he gave for not bringing his Friend was, his Fear that his Uncle might know it. Mrs. Proctor was over persuaded, and went with him to Chelsea, and there was married. He took Lodgings for her, and owned her for his Wife, and wrote a Letter to the Brother of this Lady, in which he calls himself his Brother; as one Artisice always wants another to support it, he thought proper to produce a Ring, in which was the Name of Parminter which he said was his Brother deceased, this Crime is of a deep dye; because he had as good and virtuous a Wife as any Man. We shall bring the strongest Evidence to prove the Fact upon him, and doubt not but the Jury will find him guilt, of the Indictment.</p>

On the 27th of Sept. 1739, he drove the young Lady from Mr. Seaton's in Suffolk-street to a House at Chelsea, and a Clergyman came and married them, he staid with her two Days, and then said he must leave her on account of Business; he afterwards moved her from Lodging to Lodging, and the Lady seeing him uneasy in his Mind, asked him what was the Matter? then he fell on his Knees and confessed the whole Fact; we shall shew you this Gentlemen, in a full Light, and we doubt not but you will find him guilty.</p>

We were to have been married at Richmond, where he said he had taken Lodgings for me, but I put it off till my Friends knew of it, then he let me know that he had taken Lodgings at Chelsea, and we were to be married there, and he consented to let Mr. Seaton in Suffolk-street go along with us, but at Night he sent me a Letter, and in it said, that as the Thing was to be kept private, he would have no body with him but his Friend Bury; at 9 o'Clock I received this Letter, but I had before acquainted Mr. Senton that he was to go along with us; he also said in the Letter, that he would bring a Friend along with him to be present at the Marriage, in the Morning he came there was none but that Man, (pointing to the Prisoner) in the Coach, I asked where his Friend was, and he said he would tell me in going along, which he did, and he said he was afraid Mr. Bury would tell his Wife, and then it would be blown.

            . He told me it was Chelsea. I went to sit down in the Window, and he told me I must not sit down, and there that Man married me (she produced a Ring) and said, that is the very Ring which that very Man married me with. After we was married we went to the Hospital, and we din'd at a Gardiner's where we lodged, whose Name is Singleton. We staid 2 Nights and three Days there, and afterwards I went to Greenwich, and staid there from Saturday till Monday, he said he was obliged to go to Exeter on special Business, but he took Care to write to me every Post, that Man did (pointing again to the Prisoner) Exeter was stamp'd on the outside of the Letters. He staid there a Month, and on his Return I told him, it was sitting that my Brother should know of our being married, I told him that several had wished me Joy; why said he, several of my Friends have wished me Joy too.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know that?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. I know no more than that Man told me so. I wrote to him at the Bath, and he told me in a Letter, he had a Grandmother dead, and desired I would put myself in Mourning, and that he would let my Brother know of the marriage.</p>
               <p>Counc. When did you see him next, after he wrote about the Mourning?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. I did not see him till about the 14th of January.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where did you see him next?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. He directed me to meet him in Somerset-Gardens, and I met him in the Street going thither.</p>
               <p>Counc. When was that.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. It was in Jan. I was with Child when I went from Mrs. Davidge's, and had about a quarter to go, and while I was there, this Man came to me, and told me, he would go to my Brother himself, and discover the Marriage to him, but instead of that, I had a Letter from him, that his Uncle must not know it; after that he wrote to me, as from Rotterdam, when he came from Exeter, he came to see me, at one Mrs. Jones's, where I then Lodged, he disliked the Lodgings, and desired me to remove to one Mrs. Williams's, in New-North-Street, Red-Lyon-Square, and I was there about 13 or 14 Months, and was there deliver'd of a Daughter now alive. He wrote to me several Letters, acquainting that he had something to tell me, that would shock me to the last degree; when he came to me I desired to know what it was, whether he was in Debt, or had murder'd any body, as to his being in Debt, he said he was, for he was bound for a Person now dead, in a large Sum of Money. I ask'd him if this was true, and he told me, that there was something more than that, and then seeing him again, about 2 Months before I was brought to bed, he told me that he had something to tell me, that he must now let me know, with that he fell on his Knees, hung his Head down, and said that there he would remain till I bid him rise, says he, do you know where you directed your Letters to me my Name is not Parminter, but it is Bury, that he had suffered a great deal for me, and he begg'd that I would keep it a secret, and said that as he had D - d himself for me, he hoped that I would not hang him, and that if I had no regard for him, I should consider what uneasiness it would be to my own Family, I let him remain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174206030010"/> upon his Knees, till he got up himself; then he put my Hand up to his Eyes to feel his Tears, but I believe he had spit on his Fingers to counterfeit them, and then that Man, (pointing to the Prisoner) left me, and told me that if I made a Noise, he would never come near me again, and at last went away. Two Days afterwards I was taken exceeding ill, and that Man, came to see me, but I could not speak to him.</p>

               <p>Counc. After this Discovery, did he come to you again?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. He came 2 Days after and found me exceeding ill.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he come two Days after he said he had d - d himself.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. He did come two Days after he said he had d - d himself.</p>
               <p>Counc. After these two Days did you see him.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. I saw him frequently after that, for I was then big with Child.</p>
               <p>Counc. When you was brought to Bed, did he come and Father it.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Counc. When was you brought to bed?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. I was brought to Bed, October 14, 1740.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he come during your Lying-in.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. He was prodigious ill at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Counc. When was the Child christened.</p>
               <p>S. Proctors. About a Week afterwards, after the Child was got to Nurse, he came to see it.</p>

               <p>S. Proctor. When 6 Weeks old, in New North-street, Red-lyon-square.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you discover this to your Friends?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. I did not discover it to my Friends first, but I was determined to discover it to his.</p>
               <p>Counc. Who did you discover it to first.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. I discover'd it first to one Mr. Shippen, who was an Acquaintance of that Man's there (pointing to the Prisoner) that marry'd me; I discover'd it afterwards to one Mr. Fleetwood in the Temple, Brother to his first Wife.</p>
               <p>Counc. How long was it after you lay in, that you discover'd it.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. It was about 3 Months after I lay in, after this, I saw him at Mr. Shippen's, in Boswell court, and there I charged him with every thing, as I do now.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he own it.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. No Sir, he said he knew nothing at all of me, and that he had never seen me before, and called God Almighty to witness that he knew nothing at all of me.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he ever make you a Present of any thing.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. Yes Sir, a Gold Seal.</p>
               <p>Counc. Is this the Seal.</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you ever see him write?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. Yes Sir; I saw him write two Songs once.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know his Hand if you see it? Look on these Letters?</p>
               <p>S. Proctor. There are none here but what are of his writing, and these Letters came from him to me. I had a vast Number of his Letters, but he took them from me.</p>

               <p>DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first Time I saw this Mrs. Proctor was by Accident, I met her in Cannon-street, she had a Hat over her Face, I took her by her Air to be a Mistress of the Town, I followed her, and spoke to her, and asked her Name, which she immediately told me; I asked her to drink a Glass of Wine, she said she could not then stay, and was going to a Persons in the City, but I live says she at Mrs. Davidges a Milliner, at the 3 Flower-Pots in Tavistock-street, Covent-Garden, and there you shall be welcome to drink a Dish of Tea; in 2 or 3 Days after I went to see her, the first Time she was not at Home, the second Time I found her at Home, and we drank Tea together, when we had so done, I told her I should be glad of an Opportunity of seeing her abroad, and she said, if I would send a Message to her she would come, or let me know why she could not by a Letter. I told her to direct her Letter to Mr. Parminter, to be left at my House, that if the Letter came directed to me it might fall into my Wife's Hands, and the Thing would be discover'd; upon this she directs a Letter to Mr. Parminter, to be left at my House, which my young Man received, and gave to Mr. Parminter, who afterwards told me he had received such a Letter, but could not tell what to make of it, but he thought it might come from an old Mistress of his. After this I sent a Porter to Mrs. Proctor from under the Piazza's in Covent-Garden, and she came to me, and said that at Time she was very busy, that if I came another Day she might be more at Leisure. The next Time I sent a Porter again, and she came to me, and I called a Coach, and we went to a Bagnio, I took her up into a Room, and told her here we was private, and might stay all Night; she did not deny me any sort of Freedom, (I must do her that Justice) I sent a Porter another Time, and she came to me, and said, if you will get me a Lodging I will go with you. This second Time I had her out to the Park, and walking near Rosamon d's-Pond there was some Trees cut down, which serv'd us for a Bed, and there I told Mrs. Proctor my Name was Bury, and that I was a married Man, and said, if you will give me the Pleasure of your Conversation I shall be very much obliged to you, from that Time she sent Letters to me directed to be left at Will's Coffee-House, Cornhill. After this I went up to Jenny's Whim at Chelsea, and I asked the Man of the House to get me a Lodging, and I declare I did say that it was for my Wife, and I should bring her next Week, it was at Mr. Singleton's. The next Week she went with me, I called upon her at Mr. Seaton's in Suffolk-street, there was two Ladies at the Door, and we drove to Chelsea, went to the Whim and bespoke a Dinner; I enquired how long it would be before Dinner would be ready, and in the Interim we took a Walk in the Garden, after that went to dine at Mr. Singleton's where the Lodging was taken, and lay there two Nights; then we came down by Water, I was landed at Billingsgate, and she said she was going to her Sister's. Soon after that I went out of Town to Exeter, and saw no more of her till the Month of January, and indeed I heartily repent that I ever saw her; I believe at Will's Coffee-House I received 100 Letters from her. After I came to Town she sent a Letter desiring to see me, and that she must speak with me, or otherwise she would come to my House, accordingly I met her in Somerset Garden, and she told me a Story of her being under great uneasiness, because Mrs. Davidge had discovered that she did not come to her Brother's House till Saturday Night, and she said that made her very uneasy; I asked her if she could go out with me to Night, she said she would go with me any where, I then said we will go to a Bagnio, the next Morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174206030014"/> I brought her Home again. This was the second Time we had been there, and the Woman Waiter gave her a Handkerchief she left there the Time before. Some Time after this about Midsummer, she said she was out of Order, and was with Child, and that Mrs. Davidge had a Suspicion of it, says I, I am very busy now and left her. I met her a second Time, and she said that Mrs. Davidge has intercepted some Letters, that she was big with Child, and threaten'd to tell her Brother of it; she said that her Mistress had 40l. with her when bound Apprentice, and that she expected 20 l. more if she quitted her Service. Says I, you must see and moderate the Matter with your Mistress; however I was to meet her again, and when I met her she told me that she had prevailed on her Mistress to take 12 Guineas, says I, you should speak to your Brother, it is a most abominable Imposition on me; she wept, and asked if I would let her have the Money, says I, I will give you 6 Guineas, which I did then give her to get rid of her; afterwards she told me at another Time that she had brought her Mistress down to 10 Guineas, and I gave her 4 more, and then she said she would look out for a Lodging, which when she had done she sent to me to come to her there, I saw it was a little poor Lodging, and she said she did not intend to stay there, and would look out for another. After this she sent me Word that she had found another Lodging, but refused being taken in except somebody knew her, she said she had mentioned my Name, I went up there, and the People of the House asked me if I knew one Mrs. Proctor, I said, yes, and then they took her in; after this she grew near her Time, and when she was brought to Bed she came to me, and asked me to go and see the Child, I said it was no Business of mine, and I did not go to see her for 6 Weeks or two Months after, and then the Child was at Nurse in at the next Door; she would have sent for it for me to see it, says I, I don't want to see the Child, in short, she prevailed with me at last to go and see it, and there the Nurse was, and that was the only Time I ever was there. After this she came to me, and said her Brother would be reconciled to her if I would go and tell him that she was married to Mr. Parminter, Parminter! says I, how can you mention such a Name, Mr. Parminter is a first Cousin of mine, says she, if you will write a Letter in the Name of Parminter that will satisfy my Brother, I shall go out of Town and never return again; why, says I, a Thing of this Nature may be of ill Consequence, Mr. Parminter is in London, and will (provibly) find it out, but however, by her Intreaties and Tears I was at length very foolishly brought to a Compliance, and I wrote while she was by me, and directed it, she would have me send it myself, and I said no, at the same Time I wrote Letters to her in the Name of Parminter, as from Rotterdam, there was no Post Mark upon those Letters, that I wrote them is very certain, and this she said would satisfy her, accordingly I did do it, and heard no more of her till some Days after; then she told me her Brother was not yet satisfied, but insisted upon seeing me, who was a supposed Friend of her Husband's, says I, I don't know your Brother, if he will not believe it I can't help it, says she, why will you not be so good as to go, it is but to Crutched-Fryers; at last one Morning I went, and waited for him, he came down, then I told him I waited on him at the Desire of his Sister. Sister, says he I say Sister, Sister tells me many Stories of a Cock and a Bull, and tells me of being married to one Parminter, but I do not believe any Thing about it. I said if he did not believe it 'twas no Fault of mine. After this she came to my House, and found me at Home, and said if I would write her a Letter of Recommendation, it would help her off with the Child; accordingly I did write a Letter, and in it represented that I knew her, and thought her an Object of Compassion, (whilst I was writing this my Wife came into the Compting-House) and told her this is the last Thing I can or will do for you, and when I had so said she went away, and I saw or heard nothing of her till 3 Months after that, when Mr. Shippen acquainted me that a Woman told him a Story about a Bond; after that she desired to see me there, accordingly I went, and there she run on a rig-me-roll Story, and said, that I had married her at Chelsea; when she charged me with it, I flew into a Passion, and quitted the Room, or otherwise I might have done her a Mischief. Mr. Shippen afterwards asked me why I could not keep my Temper, says I don't talk to me, I happen'd only to pick her up as a common Woman, afterwards she went to my Brother-in-law's, but however he did not think fit to send to me, but when he saw me told me, that there was a Woman that said she was married to me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174206030015"/> but bid me take no Notice of her, for he supposed she only wanted to get a little Money out of me. After this I heard no more of her, till she had applied for a Bill of Indictment, which was in January last, the Sessions passed over and no Notice taken of it, at last brings a Warrant to Mr. Shippen, here is says she, a Warrant, and if he does not comply he will be taken up in in two or three Days Time. Mr. Shippen after told me of this, and I could not believe it; says he, you must go and enquire, and upon Enquiry I found it was so, and when I found it, I immediately gave Notice of Trial, why, says my Brother, says he, they only want a little Money of you, you had better give it them. No, says I, as it is made public I will at all Events bring it to a Hearing.</p>

               <p>Counc. Did nobody introduce you into the room?</p>

               <p>Alderman Lambert. I have known him more than 20 Years, I know him to be a considerable Dealer, I know nothing of his private Character.</p>
