I am a tailor, and live at 12, Tenter Street—on the night of 22nd December, about ten, I was walking along Newman Street, Whitechapel—I had got about twenty yards from my house when I was seized from behind by the prisoners; Shiner put his hand over my mouth, and House came, round, opened both my coats, and attempted to take my watch from my waistcoat pocket, but the chain broke, and he only took that—I struggled with Shiner, and he slipped down—I heard a voice call out, "All right, Joe "—I left Shiner and went after the voice, and at the corner of St. Mark's Church I caught House and gave him into custody—after that I went into a public-house for refreshment, and there saw Shiner, and gave him in charge; he bit my finger—I saw</p>

On the night of 22nd December I was in Scarborough Street, and heard cries—I 'ran into Newman Street, and saw the two prisoners run out of there, followed by the pro<lb/>secutor; House crossed the road and Shiner turned into St. Mark's Street—when opposite the Scarborough Arms Shiner crossed and went in the public side of the house—House almost ran into my arms, followed by the prosecutor; I stopped him and asked the prosecutor what was the matter; he said, "They have stolen my watch and chain "—I took House into the Scarborough Arms, and told the prosecutor to go in and see if he knew anyone there—he went in and went straight up to Shiner—I took him into custody; he said, "You have made a mistake"—I searched both the prisoners; on Shiner I found a pension paper and a life certificate made out in the name of Goggin; he said that was his right name.</p>

Wickers, Surgeon"—Wesderby said, "Have Hill as well"—I handed him over to Thomas.</p>

I am the wife of Ashton Warner, and superintendent of the East End Mothers' Home, Commercial Road—the prisoner was porter there in December, his wife acting as cook—Mrs. Rhoda Hindley is a subscriber, and has been in the habit of regularly sending a guinea subscription—up to 18th December I had not received that subscription—as porter the prisoner's duties would take him to the Home door, on which there is a letter-box—on 16th December I heard something about that box, and in consequence I had the lid altered and made secure—on 18th December Mr. Glanville, a grocer's manager, told me something, and afterwards I sent to Mr. Colley, postmaster, and after getting an answer from him I charged the prisoner, when he came back to the house, about four, with taking a cheque and presenting it without my permission—he was then very tipsy indeed—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is signed by Mrs. Rhoda Hindley; it never passed into my possession—it has been altered from "order" to "bearer"; I don't know whose writing that alteration is in—this cheque, signed by M. A. Chaplin, for £1 1s., payable to myself on behalf of the charity, has never passed into my possession; I first to saw it after the prisoner was in custody—the prisoner has taken in the letters at the Home in the morning—I never saw this postal order before I was at the Police-court; the money for it has not passed into my hands.</p>

I am wife of the last witness—on this night I served the prisoner with half a pint of beer in a can, about ten minutes to nine—he asked me the time at a quarter or twenty minutes past nine I went out and slipped, and I saw the prisoner there, who said, "Have you hurt yourself, Mrs. Hunt?"—he was then thirty or forty yards from my door, nearer his father's house, which is about fifty yards from ours—when my husband was out I left the bar a little before eight, and was away not more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I think—that was before the prisoner came in—no one was serving besides myself—I don't think anyone came in to be served while I was away—I did not exactly keep a watch on the front door; I watched people come in and out—no one was left in charge of the house while I was out for a quarter of an hour, but I left the back door open so that I could hear—Mr. Hunt was in the cellar.</p>

"—he said, "Yes, I gave him 1s. 6d., and bought him two ounces of tea and a pound of sugar "—his mother said he had no money of his own, he had done no work for a lung time, and he had no money except what they gave him—I left him in charge of another constable, and made inquiries as to whether he had been at work—afterwards I went with the prisoner and two other constables to his father's garden, and there the prisoner pointed to a place from which Rivett moved the snow and found 11s. 6d. in silver, tied up in a piece of rag—among the silver there was a Jubilee sixpence—when that was found the prisoner sail, "Naggy Nibs took the box, and that is part of the money"—Nibs was arrested—the Magistrate discharged him.</p>

Come with me, and I will show you where it is"—I went with Whitbread and Rivett to the back of his father's house and in the garden, buried in the snow, the prisoner pointed out a place from which Rivett picked up a rag containing 11s. 6d.—Naggy Nibs was. charged at the station, and before him the prisoner repeated his state<lb/>ment several times—Nibs was remanded, and afterwards discharged by the Magistrate—I was in company with Rivett when he found the cash-box.</p>

I am a valet and hall porter—I have been acquainted with the prisoner's writing for the last seventeen years—this letter is not his writing—I said at the Police-court that it was, but I have thought about it since; it is not—I have not been speaking to the prisoner—I found some writing of the prisoner in a portmanteau at home, and I found it did not correspond with this—I did not look for that before I gave evidence at the Police-court; I have some of his writing in my possession.</p>

               <p>May, 1888—we charged the prisoner as soon as we had traced the notes, at the end of October, 1890—in July, 1890, he had left our employment, and had set up in business as a solicitor in Broad Street—we have had a client Thomas Thompson for many years—he was the promoter of the Loma Gold Mine Company; Mr. Creasey was the secretary—we had been instructed by Mr. Thompson to prepare the papers for registra<lb/>tion of the company—among them was a contract for the purchase of the supposed gold mine for £250,000 between John Henry Davelin of Beading and the company—I have never heard that Mr. Lupton was interested in the company except as a purchaser of shares; I have no personal knowledge that he held shares; I heard it suggested that he had purchased shares—I do not know that the seller of the company was an undischarged bankrupt who was paid £2 by Lupton to sign the contract—I have not inquired—I believe our clerk, Mr. Bartlett, went to Beading in September last—I did not send him; he went when I was away for my vacation, and I know nothing of the circumstances—I have not inquired what he went for—Mr. Snell is here; he was not called before the Magistrate; it was unnecessary—I cannot say if Mr. Bartlett went to Beading on 18th October, six days before the charge was made against the prisoner—he may have seen Davelin at Beading, I don't know; Mr. Bartlett is here, and can be called—I did not know that Lupton instructed the prisoner to take criminal pro<lb/>ceedings against Thompson and Creasy—I did not retain Sir Charles Russell and Mr. Poland on behalf of Creasy; I don't believe the firm did—I believe they were retained on behalf of Thompson; it was during my absence, and I do not know the date or anything personally about it—I did not see Mr. Thompson about that impending prosecution; I believe the younger Mr. Snell had interviews with him while I was away—I used to see Thompson usually when I was in town, but I was out of town at this time, and did not return from the vacation till 13th October—I did not see Thompson when I came back—I have seen him since this prosecution was instituted—I did not know from him or any other source that he had received notice from Lupton, and that Lupton had been referred to us—when I saw Thompson he handed me a letter which Lupton had handed to him, saying, with refer<lb/>ence to the proceedings at the Mansion House, that they were entirely unwarranted—I am not aware of any proceedings in which Sir Charles Russell was retained having been instituted—I cannot say why my firm went to Sir Charles Russell—I did not meet the prisoner in Broad Street three or four days before these proceedings were taken—I have not seen a letter of 7th October from Lupton to Thompson; it has never been mentioned to me; I was away when all these occurrences are alleged to have taken place—I did not meet the prisoner on 23rd October in Broad Street; I never spoke to him from the time he left the office till the day he was given in custody, and I only saw him once, and that was within a month of his leaving—I did not say I wanted a few minutes' conversa<lb/>tion with him; the whole thing is a myth—he did not suggest I should walk to his office—I did not say no, I was going down Great Winchester Street, and we would talk on the way; I never saw him—I did not say he had no right to mix himself up in the Loma matter, or that he would have to drop it—he did not then say that I might just as well have it out and be done with it, as he did not intend to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189101120024"/>
               <p>worried and annoyed with threats of proceedings—he did not ask me what I wanted, and I did not say that our firm must have an undertaking that he would not act either for or against anyone who was a client of the firm while he was there; or that we must have a hold over him in the shape of a monetary claim; or that he was to bind himself to pay £500, and take a receipt in the form I dictated—he did not decline to do it, because the interview never took place—this document was found on the prisoner when he was arrested. (<hi rend="italic">On the back of the document, which was a letter addressed to the prisoner, there was in pencil:</hi> "With regard to our differ<lb/>ences in pecuniary matters, the settlement we have come to this day is, we agree the amount of your appropriation of our money, in round figures, at £500; we assure you the £500 owing on the 500 shares taken by us in your name in the Electron Company has now been paid; you therefore now owe us the £500 appropriated, which is now settled as follows:—£100 which was retained from your salary when with us, £100 now paid by you in. cash, and your two bills of £50 each at six and nine months, and your bill for £200 at twelve months ")—nothing of the kind ever took place; the whole thing is an invention of the prisoner's; it is absolutely untrue; such a memorandum would be contrary to the fact—he did not say he would do nothing of the kind, but would lay all the facts of the matter before the Incorporated Law Society—application for a warrant was made on 29th to Alderman Cotton, and refused; we were told at the Mansion House that it is not his practice to grant warrants in a matter of this kind—then I went to the City detective offices—the prisoner has presented a petition to the Incorporated Law Society since the adjournment of this trial—I have not heard that other people have made a petition to the Incorporated Law Society against us—I have not suggested that the prisoner has given information in respect to charges made against us in the public press—I have not read this article at length—I have not read distinct charges of deliberate and consistent fraud by our firm, in the public journals; any such charges are absolutely false, a tissue of falsehood from beginning to end—we have taken no proceedings with regard to them at present; I cannot answer now whether we intend to do so—we are charged by the prisoner with deliberate frauds with regard to a large number of companies—notwithstanding the numerous charges of fraud against our firm we said we did not, nor do we, propose to take any proceedings against the paper—the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> has called attention to one of the charges; they did not repeat them—I am not aware that the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> called attention to them in strong terms—it was a perfectly safe offer for the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> to invite us to produce our books to show the statements were not true, and if so they would apologise; they knew we should not show them our books—at the time the prisoner was arrested I had given him no hint or notice that he was going to be arrested—Mr. Snell, senior, was the partner who attended to the Road-Car business—it was not necessary that he should be called before the Magistrate; the witnesses who proved the case were called as they have been to-day—the Etheridge Gold Mine Companies were not promoted in our office; we registered it—Mr. Snell, our senior partner, was chairman of the first company—there were many companies in connection with it—this matter did not arise in relation to the Etheridge Company—Mr. Snell took shares in the Etheridge Company in the names of clerks, including the prisoner, but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189101120025"/>
               <p>cannot say what the amount was—Birch, Robinson, Kelleher, the prisoner, Smith, Fletcher, Prickett, and others were clerks—I don't know how many shares were put in their names—Ellen Agnes Bryant, the wife of Bryant, our clerk, had shares in her name—Bryant had a salary of £300 a year—I did not know his wife took shares to the amount of £1,000—I took shares myself unfortunately—some of the clerks were copying and bill clerks, all grades—I cannot tell you if a call was made in respect of these shares shortly before May, 1888; the whole of the capital of the company was called up from time to time; I cannot tell you the dates—the firm did not write to all the clerks making calls on them in respect of the shares; they wrote to Mr. Prickett—the purchase was partly in cash and partly in shares; in respect of those shares Mr. Snell has paid every penny in cash—I do not know what amount was due in May—I did not attend personally to the Etheridge matters; Mr. Snell, sen., did so—I believe this letter was sent down to me for signature with other letters, and I signed it—there was not a claim on the prisoner for as much as £500, which he had taken up for Mr. Snell; the total liability was £500—there was a liability against the prisoner—he did not to my knowledge tell Mr. Snell that he must pay the money—I do not interfere in my partner's private concerns—I never said that the prisoner was to pay the money on shares he had taken up for Snell—it would have been very improper—I don't believe that at this time claims were made on the prisoner for this money, or that he told Snell he must pay it—the cheque for £378 10s. was received in December; tendered, not accepted; paid back and repaid on 19th April—the summons under Order 14 was taken out on 24th April—the amount to be paid under Order 14 would be determined on the hearing of the summons in the ordinary course—it was returnable on 30th April—I understand the order was that the money was to be paid in nine days—at that time five actions were being brought against the Road-Car Company—I believe there were no other actions of any kind except those in respect of Bailey—there were no running down actions that I was engaged in—Bailey was the principal of Bailey's Carriage Works, and had a debt against the company—I don't know if there were any other actions against the company at that time; we were not concerned in them—probably there were others—I do not know that the prisoner spoke to Mr. Snell about the money, or that Mr. Snell suggested it would be as well to have from the Road-Car Company at that time the full amount that was claimed; I believe that was not the fact—I am sure it was not—it was not upon that that the letter was written—sometimes the prisoner would sign letters himself; sometimes he would have them signed by a member of the firm—this letter came to me, and I read and signed it with others—at that time I should think it might be that the prisoner usually signed letters himself in matters he was concerned with—the money was certainly received—the calls on the prisoner's shares in the Electron Company were paid on 1st January, 1889, by Mr. Snell—I don't know if the calls had been made before—the whole thing had not been gone into and arranged that the call should be paid by Mr. Snell—in April, 1889, I believe Mr. Snell received a letter from Messrs. Ashurst and Morris in reference to the prisoner's character, as he had applied to them for a berth in their office, and the prisoner was spoken to by Mr.</p>

               <p>Snell on the subject of some payments that had been made into Court in actions by him, not the present case at all—you keep asking me to tell you things I don't know myself. (<hi rend="italic">A letter was read written in April</hi>, 1889 <hi rend="italic">saying his salary would he raised to</hi> £400 <hi rend="italic">as offered by Morris; that all dis<lb/>agreements were closed, but that in respect of them the prisoner was to pay</hi> £150, <hi rend="italic">of which</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">would be retained from the coming year's salary; and there was further reference to Electron shares</hi>)—there was not that arrangement—if the arrangement was then made why should I have made an arrangement in October, 1890, which was almost in the same terms—the prisoner con<lb/>tinued in our employment till July, 1890, and was paid £6 a week—he left in July—he had then been admitted as a solicitor; I first heard that in proceedings myself about a fortnight or three weeks before he left—the only clients who left us and went to him was a client Dennison whose business was worth £5, and one whom he introduced himself, Tabart; those were the only cases where there has been a formal change of solicitor—Maxey was never a client of ours—I don't know that Captain Somerset has gone to the prisoner, we are still acting for him—we had never acted for Mr. Lupton—I advised James to apply to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The only client who left us was Dennison, whose business was worth £5, and he left just after the prisoner left—there is no suggestion for saying that we took these proceedings because he took our clients; away—I find in this letter-book the letter of 30th April, signed by me; it is one of several letters which came down to me from the prisoner's room and which I signed on that day—there is no pretence for the suggestion that we wanted to get all the money from the Road-Car Company, though we only had to pay £300; it is a wicked suggestion to make—the Road-Car Company are perfectly solvent, and good clients, and it would be absurd for us to ask for it—no complaint, to my knowledge, has been made about our firm to the Incorporated Law Society, except that by the prisoner, which was since these proceedings—the Law Society have fixed the 5th March for the inquiry, and I have written, urging them to press forward the day—we have taken the best advice as to instituting proceedings while the question is under the Law Society's jurisdiction—the putting of shares in the names of clerks of the firm, or the writing of letters to them about the matter, has nothing to do with the present case nor with the prisoner—no arrangement was ever entered into by the prisoner with regard to the deficiencies that had taken place; we had no knowledge of this at the Police-court—I had not the slightest suspicion of the prisoner having stolen moneys under this cheque till Mr. Hen wood called on me in October, 1890—I did not return from my vacation till 13th October—between 13th October and the day on which the prisoner was arrested I had no communication with him of any kind; I did not even see him—the document found on him is a letter with his pencil-writing on it—there was never any question of our receiving bills from him in pay<lb/>ment; his bills would have been waste-paper if we had taken them; we could not have recovered on them.</p>

The prisoner did not, to my knowledge, sometimes pay expenses out of his own pocket, which he afterwards received from the firm—I cannot say if he paid his expenses out of his pocket when he went to America—he told us he was going to spend his vacation in 1889, I think, in going over to America, as he had interests there;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189101120027"/>
               <p>we then had business there, and we asked him to go on to Chicago and do it for us—he was reimbursed afterwards; I cannot say whether he had anything in advance—for ordinary petty expenses he was always paid in advance—if he paid witnesses' fees with his own cheque it was a very irregular thing, and there was some irregularity connected with, it; he would receive the money beforehand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the senior partner in the firm of Snell, Son and Greenip—the prisoner was in our employment up to July, 1890—I was away from London from May, 1890, until the end of" October, until after the prisoner was in custody—I had no idea when I went away or while the prisoner was in our employment of this misappropriation of £378 10s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not called before the Magistrate—I received a letter in the country from my partner about this charge, and he got my immediate consent to the prosecution being instituted—I cannot tell you anything about the affairs of Thompson at the beginning of October or September, as I was away—my son was attending to any matters that came in—I cannot tell you the dates when various amounts were due in respect of the Electron shares; I could do so no doubt by referring to the papers—no doubt calls were owing on shares in the prisoner's name—probably they were owing in May, 1888—I think they were paid in January, 1889—I should think they did not amount to between £400 and £500; I should think they were between £200 and £300; it might be £350, I am not certain; I don't know what the amount was—claims were not made on the prisoner in respect of that at that time; the directors knew the shares belonged to me, and I was to pay for them, and I have paid every penny in respect of those shares—the prisoner never said a word about my arranging for the calls to be paid—the prisoner had superintendence of the Road-Car Company matters, but if any question arose he would consult with me rather than with any other member of the firm—I saw the pleadings as they went on; I never saw the order for the payment of £378—I did not see the pleadings in the action till very lately; I was satisfied in leaving it in the prisoner's hands; he was a very clever common-law clerk—it was one of five actions; it was not very serious for our clients, I think—it was a serious matter as to how much money was paid into Court, but defendants are the persons to judge how much they owe, not solicitors—you cannot tell from the pleadings how much had been paid into Court—there appeared in pleadings, "Have paid into Court £378 10s., and say that such sum is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189101120028"/>
               <p>sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's claim"—I may have seen the pleadings after they were pleaded; I could not tell you when I saw them—I should only see it if the prisoner brought it to me, and he would take good care not to let me see it; I should be satisfied with leaving it with him—if he had wanted me to see it I should have seen it—I cannot say whether I saw the amended statement of defence when a further sum was paid into Court—I cannot tell whether I discussed the amendment with the prisoner; we had perfect confidence in him and the directors of the Road-Car were so satisfied with him that they requested him to have the conduct of the matter, and he only consulted me when there was any question—the money to be paid in was arranged by the directors them selves, the prisoner attending at their board meeting—a cash account was kept in our books—there is the ledger account with the Road-Car Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In that ledger account credit would be given to them for these sums, and they are debited with the payments out—the state<lb/>ment of defence admits that £378 10s. is due, and brings that sum into Court, and the plaintiffs if they like may take it out; but when an order as made under Order 14, the sum is paid into Court, and remains there to abide the result of the action; the plaintiff cannot take it out—whether £692 had been ordered, in fact, to be paid into Court or not on this motion for judgment, equally the sum of £378 would be mentioned and had to be mentioned in the statement—when a larger sum is paid into Court you have to appropriate the amount you mention to be due to be paid out, and the other amount has to remain in Court—whether the order specified £378 10s. or £692 12s. 6d., the matter being in the prisoner's hands, it would not be until a settlement of accounts that any<lb/>thing had to be paid out—it never came to my knowledge that there had been anything wrong about this, I was extremely surprised when I heard of it—there is not the least foundation for suggesting that I suggested it would be as well to get the full amount, £692, from the Road-Car Company, although we had only to pay in £378 10s.</p>

On 30th October I went with Mr. Greenip to Old Broad Street and saw the prisoner—I told him who I was, and showed him the cheque for £378 10s., and said, "You will be charged with stealing this cheque for £378 10s. "—he requested to look at it, and after doing so he said, "I don't know that I ever saw the cheque; it is an open cheque; anyone may have cashed that"—he re<lb/>quested to be allowed to have five minutes with Mr. Greenip, who said, "No, what you have to say you must say in the presence of the officer"—the prisoner said he was quite innocent—he was given in charge—I found on him the document with the pencil memorandum.</p>

                  </hi>. I now keep the Beehive beer-house at Pentonville—in February, 1890, I was living at 48, Powis Square, Bayswater—I let apartments there to Frederick Nicholas Long; he said he would move in the next day, but his wife was taken ill, and he could not do so, and his brother, Henry Daniel Long, came and occupied the rooms instead—Frederick Nicholas Long was to pay the rent—on 30th January I think Henry Daniel Lone came first—I first saw the prisoner about 2nd February—I knew Turn as Henry Long—he slept there about four or five nights—he occupied the same room as Henry Daniel Long for the first two nights, but then Frederick Nicholas Long came, and when Henry Daniel Long went to Brighton the prisoner occupied his room—they had two bedrooms and a sitting-room—on Wednesday, 12th February, I had a conversation with Henry Daniel Long in his bedroom about money, and he handed me this cheque—the prisoner was not present; he was in the house, but not in the same room; he was in the sitting-room—Henry Daniel Long endorsed the cheque in my presence—I did not see him exactly write the endorsement, but I saw him write on something on the mantelpiece, and as there was no other paper he must have written the endorsement—when he first showed me the cheque it was filled up as it now appears, but it was not endorsed—after he left the mantelpiece it was endorsed—in consequence of what he said to me I gave him, after I had cashed the cheque, £15 8s. 6d. deducting 10s. (<hi rend="italic">The cheque dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th February, teas drawn on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, payable to Henry D Long or bearer, for</hi> £15 18s. 6d., <hi rend="italic">and was signed H. Holroyd Clark, and endorsed H. D. Long</hi>)—I think it was crossed when I received it—I cashed it at Whiteley's, and sent the money into H. D. Long—I had information on Friday, 14th February, I think, that the cheque had come back marked "no account"—on Thursday morning, the day after I cashed the cheque, H. D. Long and the prisoner left the house after breakfast—I did not know they were going—all the bill, except 10s., was due when they left—they had no luggage with them; they had not brought any—I put the matter into the hands of the police—I did not see either of them again until H. D. Long was arrested in October.</p>

D. Long I wanted some money he took the cheque out of his pocket from among other papers—I understand cheques—I looked at this one, and believed it was a cheque payable to H. D. Long, who was handing it to me—I said it was payable to him, and he had better endorse it, and the bank would know it came from him through me, and thereupon he at once endorsed it—I had complained to him that his brother had not paid for the lodg<lb/>ings, and so I wanted money—I let the lodgings to his brother—he said he had no change, and then he produced the cheque, saying he could let me have 10s. out of it—he never said to me that it was not his cheque—next day he went away without notice—I did not expect the prisoner to give me notice—H. D. Long did not owe me anything; his brother who look the lodgings owed me something like 30s.—when I found the</p>

                  </hi>. In October last I went into occupation of the Shoulder of Mutton public-house, Winchfield, Hampshire, and upon attending before the Magistrates for a licence I was apprehended on the charge of obtaining money by false pretences by means of this cheque for £15 18s. 6d.—I was taken before the Magistrate at the West London Police-court, and comm<lb/>itted for trial at the London Sessions upon that charge—after my committal I swore an information against the prisoner, voluntarily; no one requested me to do so; it was of my own motion—on the prisoner being arrested on a warrant I gave evidence at the West London Police-court against him, and he was committed for trial—he is Henry Froggett Isidore Long, my cousin—in February last I was staying at Powis Square, Bayswater, and the prisoner was also staying there—Frederick Nicholas Long, who took the lodgings, is my brother—on 12th February I handed this cheque to Mr. Lai, who gave me £15 8s. 6d.—I endorsed it H. D. Long on the table in the back bedroom; Mr. Lai suggested I should endorse it—next morning I left the house with the prisoner—we went to Brighton for two days, and afterwards I went with him to Jersey—I stayed there for about two weeks, and then came back by myself; I have been there several times since—ultimately I took this public-house in Hampshire—I don't know where the prisoner was all this time; I left him in Jersey when I took the public-house—of the £15 18s. 6d. Mr. Lai had 10s.; I received £15 8s. 6d. from him—I gave the prisoner £4 for compensation the same day; he asked me for a little money on condition of getting him the loan—there was no conversation about the cheque; I simply gave him £4 as compensation for getting me the loan of £15—got the cheque from the prisoner on 12th February, the same day that I cashed it with Mr. Lai—I told the prisoner on that day that I wanted a loan of £20—he went out, and came back and handed me the cheque, filled up as it now appears, and signed Holroyd Clark—I did not know the prisoner's writing at that time, I had had no correspondence with him before then; I have had letters from him since, and I know his writing now—I believe this cheque is in his writing—when he handed me the cheque he said it was a loan from a racing man—I had never seen any cheques like it before—I have received this post-card and letter from the prisoner since this occurrence. (<hi rend="italic">The post-card, dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st October</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">from Clapham Junction, stated:</hi> "Please let me know by return of post how you are getting on, and when it will be convenient for me to run down and see you ")—that was before I was arrested—he was then in London, I believe—his letter of 25th September is written from Jersey.</p>

               <p>evidence against mo, and I was committed for trial—it was not after I was committed I first told this story about the prisoner's giving me the cheque; it was after the first time I was charged—I swore an informa<lb/>tion against the prisoner before I was committed—I was committed for trial in October—I don't remember the day I swore the information; I forget the month; I have a very bad memory. (<hi rend="italic">The date of the information was stated by Mr. Avory to be 27th November</hi>)—I asked the prisoner for a loan of £20, and he said he knew a man who would do it, and he went into the street to find the man—I have never known an instance before of a man I did not know lending me money; the prisoner got it for me—the loan from the man was a loan to me, made payable to me, so that the man knew he was lending money to me, as the cheque is made payable to me; my cousin. knew him—he did not know me, but he lent the money to me and made the cheque payable to me—I was not surprised at that; the prisoner knew me—I was to pay back the loan when I got employment—I might never have got employment; I am out of employment now—I gave no security; I would pay him when I was inclined to work and got employment—I have never found any people since who would lend money on those terms; I have never tried to—it did not strike me as an odd amount £15 18s. 6d. to lend me; it might have been all his balance at the bank; I have had cheques for more curious sums than that from people I know—he might have owed money to my cousin, for all I know—I don't know how the £15 18s. 6d. would in that case be a loan to me, it was made payable to me; perhaps it was all lie could afford to pay—I pledge my oath that I believed at the time I endorsed it that Mr. Holroyd Clark was the man who was lending me the money; that is as true as everything else I have said—it was at nine in the morning I asked the prisoner to lend me money—I told him I was in want of a little money; I don't know why he should lend it to me; I wanted a loan, that was the only reason—I suppose he saw I was in want of a little money—I was not very hard up—I had no employment then—J should have repaid the loan to the prisoner—I paid him £4 commission for getting it—I never mentioned paying it back to him—the time has not come when I should pay it off—I could not repay it; I did not know where Clark was—I took no steps to find him out—that was not the reason I did not repay it, that I did not know where he was; if I had money I should have paid it—if the prisoner had mentioned it I should have paid it back—he never mentioned it, and I did not—I left Mr. Lai's on the Thursday to go to Brighton to see some friends, and I was going over to Jersey a few days afterwards—I told Lai's wife that very likely I should leave to-morrow—it is not true that I left without notice—I did not pay my bill, my brother was security for my bill—Lai asked me for 10s. on account of the washing—I told the prisoner I was going down to stop at Brighton with some friends—my mother was living Worthing way at that time—I did not ask him to run away from Lai's place with me; he was to accompany me—in Jersey, before I was arrested, I got married—the prisoner had been paying attention to the girl I married, I believe; I don't know if he was engaged to her—I did not think she had some money—Miss Mars offered me something to start in business with—I got £40 and our wedding expenses—the wedding was on 1st May—I did not make accusations against the prisoner to Miss Mars, saying he was trying to</p>

I am the wife of Henry Daniel Long; I was married to him on 12th May—for nine years before that I had lived with Miss Mars, my father's first cousin, at Jersey—I had known the prisoner for nine years, since I first went to live with my cousin; he was a friend of hers; he went away during that time—I have had letters from him and know his handwriting—I am certain that this cheque is in the prisoner's writing—I have seen cheques like this before, and have seen him with a book, which he showed me one evening about the end of February last year, at my cousin's house—my husband went with the prisoner to Jersey about that same time—I was alone with the prisoner in a room, and the conversation turned on cheques, and I said, "I wonder what cheques are like, I have never seen them;" and he said, I have got some and I wilt show them, and he took some out of the pocket of the overcoat which he had on—he had two books one was exactly similar to this cheque, and one was on the London and County Bank—this letter and this post-card are also in his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was the first time I ever talked about cheque books—I think I must have been reading something in the papers about cheques; he was in lodgings at the time, he came in just that evening—he took both cheque-books out of one pocket—I thought they were bank notes; I asked him for some; I read them and said, "Give me some"—I</p>

               <p>remember exactly what the words were on them—I hope I have a good memory—I have not the least feeling in this case—he was not an old sweetheart of mine—I did not know what it was to be engaged at that time; it was given out in Jersey that I was engaged to him for two months—I don't know if he was an admirer of mine—I gave him up because he was a very bad man; I did not like him—I said before the Magistrate that the only reason Miss Mars ever found fault with me was because I was too truthful—she said I was too truthful; she often said, "How can you get on in the world if you speak the truth too much?"—she never found fault with me for telling falsehoods, only for telling the truth too much—the prisoner did not want me to steal chairs, jewellery he did—I knew where the jewels were; I said, "She has no jewels"—"Cannot you get the chairs?" he said—that wag the only time I did not speak the truth, I thought I had bettor tell him that—after I was married the prisoner tried to burn the house, and my husband prevented him; she had the insurance money, and I thought he wanted that—my husband was the first to tell Miss Mars of that; I was not there when it happened—the prisoner wanted to steal the jewellery before I was married; Miss Mars knows of that, she does not trust him, she locks everything up—at the time of our marriage Miss Mars gave my husband £40; it was a wedding present to me; and she paid the wedding expenses—she hinted she would have liked to Jive with me; before we were married she said, "Get yourself a little home, and I will come and live with you"—we should have liked that, she had been our best friend—she has enough money to live on—my husband has no employment now—it would not have been convenient to have her there, but we thought she had been very good to us; it was not for her money, she has really only enough to live on, and she has always told me that what she has dies with her—we never thought that if we did not get it in her lifetime we should not get it at all—she had not a chance of living with us, she came to see us at Winchfield—I told my husband to write the registered letter to her; I said, 'Henry, she has been so kind to us, I think we ought to let her know whom she has to deal with"—she is old and kind, and I did not want to see her imposed on—three weeks after our marriage my husband came to London to look for work—I stayed and kept house for Miss Mare for six weeks after that—he, the prisoner, and Miss Mars all came to London together and stopped at the Hotel Provence, Leicester Square; I did not think my husband was going to be away more than a few days, he wanted work—we wanted a little public-house—he came back by himself; the prisoner remained in London—he was with Miss Mare all the time, and they went to Paris together—I came to England after that—the prisoner wrote me perhaps twenty letters before I was married, not love-letters or anything of that kind, he meant business by them; he wrote to my cousin first—I have none of the letters—the first I heard of this cheque given to Mr. Lai was when my husband went for his licence and was arrested—a brewer's clerk told my brother-in-law about it, and the next day I knew of it—my husband was bailed, and they called me as a witness, that was how I got to know of it—I knew my husband was committed for trial; I was called as a witness after that—all I could see of my husband's writing was at the back of the cheque—I said that when I was shown the cheque at Clerkenwell—I went with my husband and his solicitor, Mr. Spender, to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189101120041"/>
               <p>get a warrant against the prisoner—I did not know before I went to the Police-court what I was going for—I had never seen the cheque before I saw it at Clerkenwell—I went with Mr. Spender—I don't remember if I had been before Mr. Curtis Bennett before I saw the cheque—Mr. Spender asked me if I should know my husband's cousin's writing, and I said, "Yes," and then I went and saw the cheque—I did not know that that was the cheque which my husband was charged with giving to Mr. Lai—I did think it was the same cheque they had talked about; he only asked if I would know his handwriting if I saw it; they did not say they were going to show me a cheque or anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Soon after the prisoner came to Jersey last year there was this rumour in Jersey that I was engaged to the prisoner; in February he spoke to me about it, and I said, "Yes; I have no objection to it"—it was broken off because considering the way he went on in Jersey with my cousin I thought it was. not suitable—I had the conversation with him about Miss Mars' jewellery before I was married; that was why I gave him up—when he could not get any jewellery he asked me if Miss Mars had a cheque-book, and I said, "No, she does not keep a cheque-book"—after he showed me the books I saw one cheque on the London and County Bank one evening at Miss Mars'—he wrote it out and gave it to me; he wanted me to get some money in some shops or something—I did not get the money; I gave the cheque to my cousin.</p>

Glyn, and returned, marked No account"—no such person as Holroyd Clarke has ever had an account at our bank—the cheque comes from a book issued to Mrs. E. C. Bennett in April, 1884—on 24th July, 1888, she ceased to be a customer of the bank; the account was closed—I believe that in 1888 she was living at Lavender Road, that was the address we had in our books.</p>

Bennett lived in that house—during that time the prisoner came there frequently to visit Mrs. Bennett—he stayed a fortnight once—I always understood that he managed her money matters, and so on; as far as I was concerned he did so, paid her bills and so on—I believe she was very intemperate.</p>

I am a clerk in the India Office, and the brother of Henry Daniel Long, and cousin of the prisoner—I know the prisoner's writing; to the best of my belief the body of this cheque is in the prisoner's writing, but I don't know about the drawer's signature—I took these lodgings originally at Powis Square for myself, and we should have moved in, but my wife was confined, and I could not enter into possession of them.</p>

I am secretary of the 710th Star Bowkett Building Society, and have been so since October 16th, 1890, on which day the defendant resigned—I produce a copy of the rules, which show that it was incorporated in the East Hounslow district under the Building Society Act of 1874—the defendant had been secretary since August,</p>

               <p>1884—in 1889 the society took possession as mortgagees of some houses property at Edmonton, and employed the defendant to look after it—his salary as secretary was £45 a year, and he also received five per cent, commission on the rents he collected—he returned quarterly accounts, in which he entered the rents he collected, and on the other side the-amounts expended in repairs and other expenses, and charged his commission, and any amount due from him on the account, ought to be handed by him to the society, or if any amount was due to him it would be paid him by the society—in addition to his quarterly accounts he produced to the society the vouchers for the expenses—I have no recollection of any estimates for repairs to this particular property being submitted to the board—I produce his accounts for the quarters ending September 29th and Christmas, 1889, and March, 1890, in which he charges the society for different repairs to the houses at Edmonton, and also the vouchers purporting to be receipts from Mr. Chessum and Mr. Moss for money paid to them for repairs—I find here a receipt, dated August 20th, 1889, for £3 18s. 6d., signed by Moss, for repairs at 147A, Brickhill Road—I also find a receipt, dated August 26th, for £2 3s., for repairs to 10, Folkestone Road; and another for £2 17s. 6d., dated October 1st, for repairs of 6, Folkestone Road; and another for £5 4s. 6d., dated November 11th; another of 2nd December for £4 17s. 6d., for repairs to 12, Folkestone Road; one of 13th January, 1890, for £2 19s. 6d., for repairs to 43, Lawrence Road, all signed by Chessum—the defendant has charged the society with all those amounts, and has been credited with all the sums paid to Chessum and Moss—at the March quarter there was a balance due to him of £3 10s. 0 1/2 d.—there was an investigation into his accounts about September or the beginning of October, 1890, at which he and I were present—he said that he had a right to make these extra; charges as auctioneer and house agent, but offered to refund the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Hounslow, and of Mitre Court, Temple—I am solicitor to the 581st and 710th societies—in September, 1890, I was instructed to investigate the defendant's accounts of the property at Edmonton, which the society had taken possession of as mortgagees—I went to Edmonton and saw Mr. Chessum, ascertained, certain facts from him, and reported to the society—I obtained from Mr. Chessum this book showing the amounts he had received, and compared the entries with an office copy affidavit which I had in some foreclosure proceedings in June or July, 1889—it was necessary to file accounts of the receipts and expenditure on the property—I applied to the defendant, who supplied me with the information I asked for, to vouch, the accounts, and made an affidavit to verify them—I compared Mr. Chessum's book with that affidavit—I cannot remember whether I made any report, or spoke to some of the directors first—on, I think, September 25th, 1890, a meeting of both societies was convened at my office, and adjourned to another day, with the defendant present—I then stated in his presence what I had discovered; taking one of the receipts in my hand I said, "This is a receipt for an account in the foreclosure proceedings"—he said, "Yes"—I then put it to him that it was for less than had been charged in the accounts—he said, "Yes, that is so," and. shortly afterwards he said it was a charge he thought he was entitled to make for the extra trouble and expense he had been put to in supervising the Edmonton property, and that they were made in the course of his pro<lb/>fession, I think he said, of a house agent and auctioneer—I called his attention to the affidavit and said, "How could you let me put this before the Court, because I consider it to be a false document?"—I think he said he had not filled the figures up himself, and I should say that they are not his writing; he said he could not remember who filled them up, but they had been done in his office—this is a copy of the affidavit, in which, he swears to the truth and accuracy of all these accounts.</p>

I am a builder, of Folkestone Road, Edmonton—my house is owned by the 710th Star Bowkett Building Society—in July,; 1889, the defendant called to collect my rent, and I asked him to give me a job—he said he would let me know; he called the next week and gave me a job, which I was to do as low as I possibly could, or else the society would send their own man down—he asked me if I would collect rents for him at any time if he did not: come—I said, "Yes"; and he asked me to let the houses for him—I asked what he was going to give me—he said I ought not to ask anything, as I had done the repairs; and then he said he would give one and a half commission—after that I repaired various houses in Edmonton by his order, and collected rents, and sent him Post Office orders for them when he did not come down—before doing the repairs he said I was to send estimates up, because they had to go before the board—I received them back from him with "Passed—W. F. B. "on them—there are three of them—I made out my accounts for repairs to Mr. W. Brougham on a slip of paper for every house; he asked me to do that; and a duplicate bill; I was to receipt them in blank, and I receipted them both—I kept an account in a book of the work I did—I received £1 13s. for doing the repairs at 10, Folkestone Road, £1 7s. 6d. for 6, Folkestone Road, £4 2s. 6d. for 5 and 6, White Hart Buildings, £3 17s. 6d. for 12, Folkestone Road, and £2 2s. 6d. for 43, Lawrence Road, Edmonton—I find here two or three receipts signed by me for letting the houses; four shillings is put down, but I gave the receipts in blank; I</p>

               <p>only received 2s.—the last is dated September 30th, 1889—I did not authorise the defendant to fill up all these receipts for a larger sum than I actually received—he came down to Edmonton at the end of September, and asked if anyone had come down from Hounslow—I said, "Yes, Mr. Peake has been down"—he said, "They have been accusing me of receiving too much money for repairs; what questions did they ask you?"—I said, "He asked different things about the society"—he said, "Will you let me have my account back," and pulled his cheque-book out of his pocket, and said he would give me £5 for it—I said I should not do anything of the kind—he asked where it was—I said that Mr. Peake or Mr. Schmidt had taken it away—he said, "They are making a tool of you," and with that he went away—he always settled up my account on Monday—August 11th and 18th were the last times—he paid me £1 11s. 6d.—nothing was deducted from any of my accounts except £5 in August, 1890, when he said he would not give me any more, and if I said anything about it he would not give me any more work; my account was £27 10s.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The £27 10s. had nothing to do with this society; it was the Ealing District Society—I gave him this estimate, "My prices for material and labour will be £27 10s.

I live at 2, Chester Terrace, Oakdale Road, Leytonstone—I am a policeman in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway—on 24th December, about half-past one a.m., I was on duty in the goods yard, about 300 yards from the stacks—I saw a light break out at the stacks, and about two minutes after I saw another one about ten yards to the right of the first—I knew the stacks well, but did not know whose property they were—on seeing this I went with Police Constable Brock to call up Mr. Turner, Mr. Rogers' manager, at the White Hart, and then went and made an examination of the stacks—I found the first stack nearest the White Hart was alight nearly all at one end, the other one had only got a small hole—the first was only alight in one place, it seemed spreading more towards the end, the wind was taking it; the second stack was alight on the further corner from the other one, that was very slightly alight; I tried to knock it out with my stick—the stacks were about eight or ten yards apart, and the two fires were about ten or twelve yards from each other—I sounded my whistle, and sent Brock for the Leyton Fire Brigade, which arrived about three—I did not see anybody about when I arrived, there was snow on the ground—there had been a lot of traffic down</p>

I am manager of the White Hart, Temple Mills; Mr. Rogers is the owner—there are a few men employed in the brick<lb/>field in December; they do not make bricks in the winter, they burn rubbish there—I cannot tell whether they were doing so about 23rd December, but I should think they are always alight; not a fire, but smouldering—I know the prisoner. I saw him on Sunday, 21st December, at the White Hart—he spoke to me about a man named Scott who was employed by Mr. Rogers—he said, "Is that right, Turner, that Rogers stopped Jack Scott four <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>?"—I said, "I don't know, I don't trouble my head about Mr. Rogers' business"—I afterwards went to the end of the bar where he was standing, and he again said, "I say, Turner, did Rogers stop Jack Scott four shillings?"—I said, "I don't know. I don't know now you should know; did Scott tell you?"—he said, "I heard it a long way from here. Rogers won't gain anything by it"—on Tuesday morning, the 23rd, I sent for him to do some work, repairing a beer engine—he left about two, and between five and six in the afternoon I saw him, and again at eight, and again about ten minutes to eleven, when the house was closing—about twenty minutes to two I was knocked up by three railway constables; I got up and looked out of window, and I could see that two ricks were burning—I told the constable to go for the engine, and I went out to the stacks about twenty minutes to four—I stood at the gate a minute looking at the turncock doing something to the water—I saw the prisoner standing close to me; I did not notice him till he spoke—he said, "Whose are they?" speaking of the stacks—I said, "You know well enough whose they are"—he said, "I thought they were Rogers'"—I said, "They belong to Bush"—he said, "I am sorry for old Bush"—we stood there a few minutes looking at the fire; I then turned and said to him, "How came you here a morning like this?"—it was very cold—he said, "I came to see the fire"—I said, "But how did you know there was a fire?"—he said, "Bill Payne, the turncock, knocked me up, and I came with him"—I called to Roach, the turncock, and said, "Did you knock this man up this morning, turncock?"—he said, "Me, sir? no; I don't know where he lives"—in consequence of that, I sent for the inspector, and had some conversation with him; I told him what had passed—the prisoner had had nothing to do with making these stacks; he had with</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man practising at Guildford—on the 7th January I went to the Anchor Inn, Normandy, about 11 a.m.—I found there the body of a male child between one and two years old—it was well nourished and healthy looking—it was dressed in a blue flannel jacket, white flannel shirt, and a coloured cotton shirt underneath, whole and in good condition—they were frozen on the body—I examined the body to find the cause of death—there were no marks on the body—on opening the chest I found both sides of the heart engorged with blood or distended; the lungs were much congested, and the air passages and the cells of the lungs full of water; the slightest pressure on the lungs caused a frothy mucous to come from the mouth and nose—all the other organs in the body were healthy—in my opinion the cause of death was drowning.</p>
