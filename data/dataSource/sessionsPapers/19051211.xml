I am a warehouseman in the employment of John Corvell at 1, Fell Street—on November 17th I was in Wood Street about 4.30 p.m., and at the corner of Fell Street and Wood Street I saw the prisoner wheeling a trolley with a case on it which I identified as having been lying in our doorway—I ran quickly to the doorway and saw the case was gone and I then followed the prisoner up Wood Street, and when I saw a constable I had him stopped—the constable asked him where he was going; he said a man had told him to bring it up here—we took him back to the premises and I identified the goods—they were ninety-five dozen French braces, value about £40—we were going to unpack them—I saw no other man—the prisoner was about twenty yards from our place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On December 3rd, at 12.45 a.m., I saw Walter Cornhill carrying a sack—I asked him what the sack contained and he said, "I do not know; it was just given to me by a man at Caledonian Road; I do not know his name, and I do not know his address"—I took him to the station, when on the way he said, "I might as well tell you the truth about this. I have been to see my brother Percy to-night. He lives No. 12, Clayton Street, and he gave me this metal to make a few coppers on because I am hard up and out of work. I have a wife and two children"—I found the metal in the sack—I went to No. 12, Clayton Street, where I saw Arthur Cornhill, the father—I said to him, "Have you seen your son Walter to-night?"and he said, "Yes, he left here about ten minutes ago"—I said, "Did you give him anything when leaving?"and he said, "No, nothing"—I then saw Percy and said to him, "Have you given your brother anything to-night?"and he said, "No"—I then said to Arthur Cornhill, in the hearing of Percy, "Your son is detained at the Caledonian Road police station for being in possession of a quantity of metal," and they both said, "We do not know anything about it"—they then went to the station with me, when Percy said, "I did give it to my brother. He has been out of work and I thought he could make a few halfpence on it"—Arthur said, "I suppose you have been at my lead again. At all events, I recognise the sack as mine"—the station officer said to Arthur, "You had better go home and see what you have missed," and be said, "I will soon tell what I have lost if I have a look round"—he then went round to Clayton Street with an officer and myself, when he said, '* Yes, I have lost some metal, I have lost six or seven sticks of solder and a quantity of lead trimmings"—I then showed him the contents of the sack and he said, "Yes, that is mine," and various other portions of the metal he said were his—he then charged his two sons at the station for stealing and receiving and they were brought up at the police station on that charge—I was present when they were brought up before the Magistrate—he was asked to discharge them on that charge and they were then re-arrested with their father—Mr. Kisby, Messrs. Betts &amp; Co.'s manager, identified the metal in the sack.</p>

               <p>Street—Arthur opened the door to us; he was rather surprised to see us—I asked to see Percy, and his father then produced him—Percy was in bed—his father did not question him at all; he left all that to me—I have never seen a builder's yard at his premises; I always understood Arthur was a bird stuffer—he said he was a builder and I have no reason to doubt it—I do not know that he has been employed for seventeen years superintending the repairs of a big estate—we have found nothing against him—I did not tell him that if Percy and Walter had been stealing his metal he must prosecute them; there was nothing said in my presence that he must either forgive them or prosecute them—this sort of metal <hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) would fetch 3d. to 3 1/2 d. a lb—I reckon there was about 14 lbs. in the sack; he might have got 2s. or 3s. from a marine store dealer for it—Arthur did not reproach his sons for having got him into this position.</p>

The solder I bought in the market last Friday"—I said, "The whole of it has been identified by Mr. Kisby, the manager at Betts', Upper Holloway, where your son Percy is employed"—he said, "I did not steal it"—I then told him he would be detained and charged—I then saw Percy and Walter at the back of the Court and told them the property had been identified—Percy said, "I told the truth about it on Saturday night. I have nothing else to say "—Walter said nothing—when charged Arthur said, "I did not steal it," and Percy and Walter said nothing—when Arthur charged his two sons I explained the case to the Magistrate and he discharged the two prisoners—they were then re-arrested and Arthur was arrested and conveyed to Upper Holloway police station, where they were charged—when searched Arthur said, "It is rough on me. This comes of trying to do my duty by my sons. I tried to get them out of it"—turning to Percy, he said, "It is not a great conjure: you could only get 2s. for the lot."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Val Prinsep, of 1, Holland Park Road—on November 14th I had a quantity of jewellery in a bag which I locked up and left on a chair in my bedroom on the first floor, at the side of the house looking towards Leyton House—I left the room between 7.5 and 7.20 p.m., just before dinner; we dine at 7.30 p.m.—the jewellery consisted of two strings of pearls in a case and a quantity of other jewellery in cases, the total value, roughly speaking, being about £6,000—I went straight to the dining room—about 8.10 p.m. I was called back to the room by the maid—I rushed up and found the bag was gone, the window up, a ladder up against the window, and the table just opposite the window where my maid did needlework, upset—the ladder was mine and kept at the end of the garden—I sent for the police at once and Burgess came—next morning Inspector Stockley came—before I went to the Police Court I was shown these two strings of pearls and a number of empty cases (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which I identified as mine—I identify them now as part of the stolen property—I identify this pocket book in which there is still a 100 mark note, but the gold which it contained has gone—about three or four days before the robbery I saw the prisoner in the evening, between Leyton House and mine, looking up at the window—there was a lamp on the other side of the road and it shone fall on his profile—he was on my side of the road; I was coming up to the front door—I wondered what he was doing there—I noticed him especially because the light was on his face—I identified him from a number of other men at the police station on November 18th—I had no doubt that he was the man directly I saw his profile.</p>

I am a German, and a porter out of employment—I live at Belvedere Crescent, where I have been ten months—I have been at work as a porter since I have been in England—I met the prisoner, whom I knew by the name of Altmann, in Charlotte Street about six or eight days before the robbery—he came to me and said that Mr. Grunfeld wanted to speak to me—I knew a man of that name as a mechanician—the prisoner said nothing else—at that time a friend of mine named Ellerman lived with me—on one Saturday the prisoner met me and said that there was some jewellery to be fetched away from Kensington; that there was a house in Kensington, where jewellery could be taken because there was a ladder leaning against the wall, and it could easily be taken; that it must be done between 8 and 9 p.m.; that the old butler had gone away and the new butler was a fool—I made no reply, but went away with my friend, Ellerman, who was standing about forty or fifty feet away waiting for me; he could not hear what was said—I never went to see Grunfeld about this—I read an account of this robbery in the "Daily Telegraph"—I understand</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. King arrested me—he did not tell me anything; I could only think it was an account of the jewels—neither Mr. King nor anyone told me that I was arrested for the jewels—I cannot say why I supposed I was being arrested for stealing Mrs. Prinsep's jewels—I knew nothing of it except what I read—we were arrested coming out of the Globe restaurant, which is about two minutes from Charlotte Street—Mr. King and Inspector Stockley took me to the Tottenham Court Road police station—when I was asked the questions I did not know the prisoner was in custody—I have never known nor heard of a man named Harrar—I have been in England for ten months—I am twenty-seven and come from Hamburg, where I was a clerk—I left Ger<lb/>many for no other reason than to learn English—I had been a clerk for three or four years—I am sure I never got into trouble in Germany with the police—I had been in employment two months before I left Ham<lb/>burg, with a friend in a printing establishment—I have never had any<lb/>thing to do with jewellery, either in Germany or here—I have been punished twice on account of fraud—I have been living at Belvedere Crescent for four weeks, and before that at Sackville Street by Charlotte Street—when I came to London I first lived at either 7 or 8, Windmill Street—I cannot say for certain whether it was No. 6 or not—I lived there with Grunfeld—I do not know Hans Harrar by name—since I have been here I have worked four months as a porter in a restaurant in Rupert Street, leaving four or five months ago—I have done nothing since; I have had an inheritance from home—I have had an 18 carat gold chain; it was gilt—I know 105, Charlotte Street, and go there to see a friend; I do not carry on business there, nor do I manage it at all—I do not know that it is an improper house; I know nothing about it—I may have seen the prisoner at the Kellnerheim restaurant, but I did not speak to him—I have not seen him selling incandescent mantles—he spoke to me about the jewels the Saturday before the robbery—I knew what he meant, but I would not accede to it—I cannot say why he should mention it to me—I did not think of telling the police—I swear that he told me about the jewels—I next saw Grunfeld after that at the Globe restaurant when we were arrested—I said in my statement to Mr. King that all that happened on November 11th was that the prisoner told me that Grunfeld wanted to see me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On the Thursday after the robbery I went to Mrs. Prinsep's house with Ellerman, who speaks English better than I—I stopped at the door and Ellerman went in—whilst there Inspector Stockley came, and that was the first time I saw any police about this matter—Stockley took me to look for Grunfeld and we found him in the Globe restaurant—he then took us to Tottenham Court Road police station, where they kept me and asked me questions, when they let me go—they did not charge me or keep me in prison.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspector F.</hi>) On the morning of November 15th I went to Mrs. Prinsep's house, where in the garden I found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) near the place where it had been communicated to me the bag had been found—it is quite new, but the edges look as though it has been used up against some hard substance—on examining the fence separa<lb/>ting the house from Leyton House I found no marks on it; it is a very low fence—on the fence separating the next door garden and garden of Leyton House and leading into Melbury Road I found a footmark as if some one had been climbing over—in the garden of No. 81 found this pocket book containing a 100 mark note; it was damp, as though it had been there all night—there had been money in it, which had been removed—I also saw a ladder 27 feet long—I and another man tried to rear it against the wall and we could not do it; it took quite three men—against this window it is a very awkward place to rear it—I started making inquiries—on Thursday, November 16th, I saw Hannel at Mrs. Prinsep's house—in the course of the statement he made to me he mentioned the name of Grun<lb/>feld and I took him to Charlotte Street and found him—Grunfeld was detained and Hannel was taken to the station, but afterwards he was al<lb/>lowed to go; there was never any intention of detaining him—about 11.30 on November 17th I went to 82, Wells Street, Oxford Street, with Sergeant King—the prisoner and his wife occupied the top back room, it being a lodging house—I asked him whether his name was Altmann and he said, "Yes, it is"—I told him I was going to take him into custody on suspicion of being concerned with stealing jewellery from No. 1, Holland Park Road, of the value of about £6,000, and he said, "I know nothing about it; I can prove I was with my master every night"—I told him I had not made any mention of any night, and he went on to say, "On Tuesday night I was at home till half-past 7, and then I was in the sausage shop in Charlotte Street until a quarter-past 8"—I had not made any mention of any night up till then—I think every newspaper in London had an account of the robbery—I asked him if he were acquainted with Mrs. Prinsep's late butler and he said, "Yes, I borrowed money off him once"—he was taken to Kensington and there detained until 7 next morning, when</p>

               <p>he was placed amongst several men who were similarly dressed to himself—we took care to have some men with dark moustaches, but of course it was quite impossible to get all foreigners with dark moustaches—Webb picked him out without any hesitation whatever—when Mrs. Prinsep came in she was rather frightened—she looked at a man and said, "That looks like him," but on turning round and seeing the prisoner she immediately said, "That is the man; I am quite certain about it"—he was charged and he made a statement to Sergeant King in German—I ought perhaps to have said that while he was waiting to be put up for identification we heard for the first time that some of the jewels had been found in a garden near the house, but nothing had been said about it to the prisoner before he made the statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did take a number of footprints, but they were found to be quite useless because I afterwards ascertained there had been about a dozen policemen walking over this place—I first heard of Harrar through a letter delivered to Mrs. Prinsep's house addressed to her late butler—it is in German, but it has been translated—there is an envelope Attached to it addressed, "Mr. Charles Pful, 1, Holland Park Road, London, W.—the postmark is, I think, October 24th; it is very indistinct—I inter<lb/>viewed Harrar—it is dated from 6, Windmill Street, and was signed "H.

You will find the stolen things in the corner of a garden covered over with leaves. They were disturbed and chased, and hid the things so that they should not be found on them.

               <p>the police at once acted upon that information and cleared the matter up as far as they could to their own satisfaction—those men had absconded and I have no doubt they were concerned in the robbery.

I live at Buckhurst Park, Sunninghill with Lady Savory, my wife—the property at Shrubshill belongs to me—some years ago I built some cottages there, under the best advice I could obtain—one of the cottages was let to the prisoner—at the time it was built it depended for its water supply on a well and rainwater tank—that was the only supply in the neighbourhood at that time to all the houses, whether mine or not—the prisoner paid me £25 a year rent in the autumn of 1900—he remained there till December 1st this year—in 1900 and 1901 there was very great scarcity of rain, and in the beginning of 1902 the water supply of the whole district quite failed—I received a number of letters from the pri<lb/>soner with reference to the well at his cottage—I had the pumps attended to and then had the rainwater cistern and the well cleaned out—I then did my best to obtain a water supply from the South West Suburban Water Company—the company's mains, in the early part of 1902, were a quarter of a mile from this cottage which stood on a hill—in order to reach the cottage they had to come from another direction to get the pres<lb/>sure, so that it took seven or eight months before the company's water was supplied—in the meantime the prisoner had to go to an inn called "The Red Lion "for his water—in November, 1902, I learnt to my great sorrow that a son of the prisoner, aged seven or eight, died of diphtheria, and on the same day I got a letter from the prisoner referring to it—I wrote in reply expressing my grief at hearing of his sad loss, but pointing out that it was through no neglect of mine—I received no objectionable letters from the prisoner until early in 1904—in February, 1904, he suggested that he should remain at a rent of £20 instead of £25—at the same time the suggestions against myself were repeated—between March, 1904, and the present time 1 have had a number of letters from the prisoner, many of them referring to his boy's death—he has paid no rent since September,</p>

                  </hi>. Since the prisoner has been at Brixton I have had him under observation—when he came in he was in a very dejected and prostrate condition—since then he has improved slightly, but the mental depression and emotionalism have continued; he has been continuously depressed—I have seen a copy of the letter he wrote to Sir Joseph Savory—the prisoner is not the kind of man who in a normal condition would write a letter like that—I had some long interviews on the subject with the prisoner, and all his views apparently were coloured by this intense hatred of Sir Joseph Savory, dating back to the loss of his son—I have not seen any evidence of any suicidal tendency—he told me the boy that died was his favourite child—I think that at the time he wrote the letter he was unable to appreciate the quality of his act, its wrongfulness or its illegality, or to think of the probable consequences to himself—I think he has a good chance of improving if taken from the old surroundings and is taken care of.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector P.</hi>) Information was received at the police station on the morning of December 27th last year that a burglary had taken place at the Prince Albert public-house—I went there about 9.30 a.m. and saw the defendant, who pointed out various places on those premises—I went in at the front door at the corner of the house and passed to the lavatory at the back, passing through the second bar of the coffee room, and past the stairs—he pointed out to me that an upright iron bar had been pulled away from a window in the lavatory and was standing in a corner of the lavatory—it had been fastened by two screws at the top and bottom—I noticed that the sill of the window near the aperture was covered with dust and there were old cobwebs, but no marks upon the sill—the dust had probably been there for months and the cobwebs were hanging across the aperture—there was no glass, but simply an aperture with three bars—the right-hand bar had been removed from the inside of the lavatory—the outside of the window sill was damp or wet and there was an accumulation of wet dust upon it, which was old, and the place was very dirty—the dust had not been disturbed in any way—the pill is about seven or eight feet from the ground, where there is a gulley hole or sink—there was not the slightest scratch on the wall such as must have been made had anyone climbed it—there was a back door through which it would have been easy to enter, because a small piece of glass was missing from the window near the lock and the door was not secured by the bolt—the defendant told me that he was the last up and that he had secured all the other doors and windows and that the aperture referred to was the only one by which anyone could have entered—the door had not been tampered with—there were no marks upon the bolts as if they had been knocked back—I saw no signs of violence on the door—I noticed marks on the top of the door from the lavatory into the passage as if a jemmy had been inserted and an attempt made to prize it from inside the lavatory, and a large ground glass panel had been prized out from the upper part of the beading of the door, and broken—about three-fourths of it was whole and standing against the wall in the lavatory, and two or three broken pieces lying on the ground against it—the door into the kitchen was uninjured—on the door from the kitchen into the parlour were marks of cutting, as if some<lb/>one had made a small hole by the lock with some instrument—the panel was turned out, and there were some large splinters—there is one panel in the upper part of that door—the splinters were lying against the door in the kitchen as if that panel had been torn bodily out—it was a small hole in the first instance, but afterwards almost the whole panel had been torn out and a hole made big enough for a grown-up person to get through—the door had a lock, but no bolts—in the parlour an iron safe of about 3 cwts. was lying on its side—the upward outer sheet of the safe had been removed—one of these photographs shows the condition of the safe—the inner lining has been bashed back—stand<lb/>ing by it I could see into the safe—lying round the safe was the sawdust and sand, and whatever composes the lining—a hole had been made in</p>

               <p>the outer covering, and there was sawdust between—the outer sheet had been removed altogether—some of the rivets fastening the outer and the inner sheets were cut through, evidently with a cold chisel—I traced the process of the chisel through several rivets, and it looked as if the chisel had been struck with a hammer repeatedly—some sharp instrument had been struck into the inner lining, and then turned back, as if the opening had first been made by a sharp chisel or punch, and then the lining turned back, assisted by some instrument such as a chisel struck with a hammer—the hole made was about 10 inches or a foot from one end to the other, and was of a circular form—I tried the cash box which had been in the safe, and it just came through the hole—I examined all the outer doors and the gates of the yard—the gates, which open into East Surrey Grove, have been newly painted—they are marked on the plan as 9 feet 6 inches high—I should say they are about 9 feet—the morning was exceedingly dirty, but there were not the slightest marks on the gates of anyone having climbed on them—there is a wicket gate with a handlock, and the keyhole outside—that was fastened—I saw no key in it—I found it locked—the defendant said, "I was the last to bed about 1 o'clock. I saw all the doors and windows secured, and I am quite sure there was no one locked on the premises"—that was in answer to a question of mine—he said that his mother, himself, a brother, and the potman were sleeping on the premises, but he did not specify the bedrooms in which they slept—he said, "We were all in sleeping rooms at the top of the stairs, but we never heard a sound"—I should say considerable noise must have been made in effecting the damage which I saw—you could not muffle the noise so that it could not be heard, although you could deaden the noise of a chisel, as thieves often do, by a piece of carpet, but I noticed the carpet had not been disturbed—the defendant said he had discovered the burglary at 7.30 a.m., and the property he mentioned as having lost has been put into a report by Inspector Morgan—I asked the defendant if the change money in the till was safe, and he said, yes, he had taken it up to bed with him over night—I asked him why he did not put it in the safe—he said because he considered it would be safer upstairs—I remarked it was strange he should leave a large amount downstairs in the safe, and take such a small amount upstairs; I do not remember his answer, but he said he thought it was safer up there—the first thing I asked was whether his cigars were safe, and he went into the bar and looked round—when he came back he said the thieves had not touched the cigars or the spirits, and he went on to say that he had not much sale for cigars, and that he kept a very small supply—refreshing my memory by the report, he said he had £300 in the safe, and that £120 of that was in silver, and the remainder in gold—on December 29th, in consequence of a message from the defendant, I wept there again, when he told me that he found that the thieves had taken, I believe, twenty boxes of cigars from the bar, or the bar parlour—I do not remember whether the cash box was damaged—I think the defendant's suggestion is right that it was not damaged.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector R.</hi>) I was station sergeant at Peckham police station on December 27th—I received information from the Prince Albert about 8.55 a.m.—I went with the defendant into the bar parlour—I saw a safe there, with the outer casing torn off, and a considerable hole punched in the side where the casing had been taken off—these two</p>

               <p>photographs represent the condition of the safe, except that the outer casing was hanging to the safe by a few of the rivets, and there was a quantity of sand and sawdust on the floor—I imagine a hole had been made in the safe by some blunt instrument—I think the outer casing had been prized off, and that the hole in the inner casing had been punched through by some more or less blunt instrument—very considerable noise must have been made—nothing was mentioned about anyone having been disturbed—I went into the lavatory, and then into the backyard—I found a bar had been pulled off the lavatory aperture; this bar looks like it, but I inferred that no thief had got through there, because there was dust on the ledge, both inside and outside—I should say it was impossible to get through that aperture without removing some of the dust—I did not notice any<lb/>thing else except that the place was very dirty—a great deal of glass was lying on the floor near the lavatory door—I did not observe any marks near that door—it was a wood floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I examined the safe—its appearance suggested that a certain amount of force had been used—I cannot say that it appeared to have been snapped right across the outer casing—I did not notice any "successive "marks of a chisel, as spoken to by Inspector Badcock—it is impossible to say how long the dust had been there, but I should say at least two days—I did not notice any cobwebs—I do not remember seeing them, but it is twelve months ago now—the place was not very clean—I did not see any foot-marks—the safe could not have been opened without making a noise—I have heard of safes being opened, but they have not come under my observation—I have not heard of any safe having been opened in a similar manner of this one—no doubt safes have been opened in that way before, but I do not know of one myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the secretary of the Cannon Brewery Company—the Prince Albert was the property of that company—it was for sale in September, 1903, and was acquired by the defendant, who took a lease of it—he had to pay £5,000, and the company advanced £4,771 on a first mortgage—he went into possession in October, 1903—accounts were collected from him; I did not collect them—payments were made regu<lb/>larly until just before Christmas, 1904, to our collector, Arthur Richard Dewing—I received this cheque, dated December 23rd, 1904, from Mr. Dewing for £115 on the 24th—it was returned from the bank marked "R. D."—it was paid in again, and again returned—it has not been met up to the present time—on December 29th the defendant called on me at the brewery—he said he called about the cheque not having been met, and he said that the reason was that there had been a burglary at the house on December 27th, and that £300 was in the safe, that the police said it was the work of experts, that it had been done by tools specially made for the purpose, and that he was insured for £100—I told him that he would have to pay cash for any goods delivered—refreshing my memory from a note made at the time, on January 4th I wrote to him to call and see me and bring his pass book—when he called with it I found that nothing had been paid into the bank since December 7th, that £40 had been withdrawn on the 12th, and £13 on the 27th—I asked him why those two amounts had been withdrawn, and he said for change—I also asked him why he kept so much money in the house, and why he had not paid it into the bank—he said that there were clubs that met at that house, that at Christmas time they paid out large sums, and that he had retained this money for the purpose of changing the money—he made no further payment, and we took possession about March—I went to the house on Friday, December 30th, the day after he first came to see me—he showed me the safe, and where the burglars were supposed to have broken in, and he said, no one had heard the damage being done.</p>

I am a clerk at the Post Office, 79, High Street, Stoke Newington, which, I think, is about two miles from the Post Office, in Mare Street, Hackney—on November 2nd a woman came into the Post Office about 5.30 p.m. and asked for two £1 postal orders—she put down a sovereign and two half-sovereigns—I sounded the coins on the counter, and one sounded soft—I weighed it and found it light—the woman spoke in broken English, but I could understand it—I said, "The Com<lb/>mission will be 3d." and "I cannot take this half-sovereign; it is a very light one. Do you know where you got it from?"—she said her mistress had given it to her, and that she knew nothing about it—I said, "I cannot give you the order, I cannot accept that," and I gave her back the money—the coin was similar to this in pattern.</p>

To the Magistrate. Sir,—Being unable to speak English, with extreme regret I beg to address you in this letter in order to prove to you I am a victim and not culpable. I received this coin in all confidence and gave it in payment of two postal orders, and I had no hesitation in doing so. I went into the first Post Office that I found on my way, and into no other. The lady who came against me on Friday, the first witness, and said she believed she knew me, but was not sure, was wrong.

                  </hi>. I was the secretary of the British Tea Table Company, of 1897, Limited, of 51, Farringdon Road, up to November, 1902—it has a capital of £150,000 in £1 shares—the prisoner was employed in the Transfer Department from March, 1900, to March, 1902—his duty Was to make out certificates and post precautionary letters—Miss Sullivan, of Palmeira Square, Brighton, was a large shareholder—we held two cancelled share certificates on which her transfers were endorsed—those entries are in the prisoner's handwriting and there is an entry of a sale of 500 shares to E. M. Blackburn, Nos. 105060-105559 on February 15th, 1901, which is also entered in the share ledger—I produce a transfer of the same shares dated July 14th, 1901—there appears to have been an erasure—the words and figures are in the prisoner's writing—it would be his duty to see that the transferor held the shares, and stamp the certi<lb/>ficate for my signature—in the share ledger of February 28th, 1901, I find</p>

               <p>the transfer of those shares entered in the prisoner's writing—the receipt for the transfer of shares of the same numbers dated August 15th, 1901, is in his writing—it would be his duty to send a protective notice to Miss Sullivan—200 of the said shares are transferred to Henry Campbell Black<lb/>burn and are transferred to five different people by him—the remaining 300 are transferred to Alexander Hugh Blackburn, of Madron Villa, Brownhill Road, Catford—the said 300 shares are entered in the share ledger in the prisoner's writing—six transfers (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are executed by Alexander Hugh Blackburn dealing with the same 300 shares and are witnessed by E. M. Blackburn, of 106, Brownhill Road, and are in the prisoner's writing—they deal with 150 of the said shares—the remaining 150 are dealt with by five transfers signed by Alexander H. Blackburn, of Madron Villa, and witnessed in each case by Laura Wallace, of the same address.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Frederick William Nish, 17, St. Anne Square, Manchester—he is an outside stockbroker and advertises for clients through the London financial papers—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>), dated September 2nd, 1901, 36, Canonbury Park South, from H. C. Blackburn—I sold the 200 shares referred to in the five transfers pro<lb/>duced and sent my firm's cheque marked "Not negotiable" and crossed "To account payee"—Mr. Blackburn called upon me—he was a stout</p>

               <p>man of about 5 feet 9 inches—I should not know him again—he asked me to alter the cheque to "Pay cash," which I did—that cheque was after<lb/>wards paid through our bank—in October I received a letter from Alexander H. Blackburn—I afterwards sold 150 shares for him by five transfers (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—my firm's cheque for £307 9s., to order of A. H. Blackburn and endorsed by him, relates to those shares—I wrote, "Pay cash" on the cheque—my letters to H. Campbell Blackburn were addressed to 36, Canonbury Park South, and those to Alexander H. Blackburn to Madron Villa, Brownhill Road, Catford.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These transactions were a long time ago—I have no recollection of the prisoner as the man who came to Manchester—the person who came arrived at 2 to 2.30 and remained about ten minutes—he was not quite so old as the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been employed in the study of hand<lb/>writing for the last twenty years—I have compared the documents in this case with admitted specimens of the prisoner's handwriting—looking at Exhibit 4, I say the date was originally February and has been rather clumsily altered to July—in Exhibit 9, the transfer of 300 shares to H. Campbell Blackburn, the signature of E. M. Blackwell is as near as possible a facsimile of that on Exhibit 4—it is an excellent imitation—to the best of my belief it is in the prisoner's writing—Exhibits 11 to 15, transfers from H. C. Blackburn, are all in the prisoner's writing—the signature of the witness is to the best of my belief the same handwriting—the signature of the witness "A. M. Tapp" resembles the prisoner's writing—the letters (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) from H. Campbell Blackburn to Nish &amp; Co. are to the best of my belief in the prisoner's writing—the letters from Alexander Hugh Blackburn to Nish &amp; Co. are in the same writing as the letter to Waterman—the signature A. H. Blackburn endorsed on the cheque for £307 9s. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) I believe to be in the prisoner's writing.</p>

I have lived at Madron Villa, 106, Brownhill Road, Catford, about five years—about four years ago a man named Blackburn resided there for five or six weeks—he came in October or November—he received some letters—one was from Manchester—he was a thick set man not like the prisoner in the face—looking at the five transfers produced I say there was no other Blackburn living at my house—I do not know the name E. M. Blackburn—there was no person of the name of Laura Wallace living at my house—I do not know the writing on Exhibit 22a—it is not the writing of any person living at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Railway Servants' Association, 21, Finsbury Pavement—in September, 1903, I was advertising for a clerk and received this letter signed Henry Atkinson—a man called next morning who said he was the writer of the letter—he was the prisoner—I engaged him as clerk in the name of Henry Atkinson—I afterwards became thoroughly acquainted with his writing—this letter is his writing—in August, 1904, another man entered our service who gave the name of "H. Waterman"—he was introduced by the prisoner, but it was known in the office that we required another clerk—the prisoner said he was his cousin—this is his letter of application—I became acquainted with his writing and identify this letter as his—the prisoner and Waterman both continued in my employment until October 13th last—on that day they went out together as usual to lunch—Waterman came back alone with a message from the prisoner—I never saw him again until his arrest.</p>

This is all the money I have got on me now; you can either come into the saloon bar of the Blackstock or into the urinal, so that nobody may see us, or if you like to meet me anywhere else I will give you one or two pounds if you will look over it"—I asked him if he was aware of the penalty of trying to bribe a police officer—he said, "I am quite aware of that"—we walked away and left him—I made a note of the conversation—I went back to the police station afterwards and made a statement to the inspector—in consequence of the</p>

                  </hi> (353 <hi rend="italic">Y.</hi>) On October 20th I was with the last witness on special duty and went to Wells Terrace—I there saw Arnold take betting slips, but nothing with them—he took two slips during the period from 1.40 p.m. to 1.45 p.m.—I was not then with Fullick; I was keeping observation separately—I rejoined Fullick afterwards—we then went up to Arnold—we were both in plain clothes—about 3.15 p.m. the prisoner came and spoke to us—he said, "I hear you have been after Johnny; will you take half a sovereign to square it? It is all I have got; you can have it in the saloon bar of the Blackstock or in the urinal"—we refused the money—he then said, "If that is not enough I will meet you where you like and I will give you £1 or £2 if you will only let the matter drop"—I asked him if he knew the consequences of attempting to bribe police officers—he said, "I am quite aware of that"—we then walked away—I knew Arnold as a betting man, also the prisoner as a betting man—when he said "Johnny," I knew whom he meant—I have heard that Arnold and the prisoner are acquainted, but I have not seen them together—after making our observations, we each make a note and then we go on to another bookmaker, still keeping observation—our superiors do not hear of what happens until our observations are finished, but sometimes day by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110064"/>
               <p>day we report and they then decide whether the bookmakers shall be prosecuted or not—the formal report is made afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been five and a half years in the force—I have been on this special duty of watching bookmakers since May, on and often—I have not been constantly at it—as I rule I have been with Fullick—I know the bookmakers and they know me pretty well by sight—I cannot say the exact number of prosecutions we have had, but probably six or eight—I know there has been £90 worth of convictions—I keep account but not for any particular reason—it is no feather in my cap to get a conviction and it would not get me any advancement in the force—a man only gets on in the force by his qualifications and education—I have never been offered a bribe before—I have heard of people being rash enough to offer bribes to police constables, also bookmakers doing so—I knew it was a criminal offence and more serious than betting in the street—I had heard that the prisoner had been prosecuted before the day in question for street betting, but had not heard that he had had two acquit<lb/>tals—I heard that he had been convicted—I told Arnold that he would be reported for frequenting—Fullick was near me then—I had no inten<lb/>tion of arresting Arnold then and therefore creating an obstruction—he did not then ask me to let him go and get the amount of the fine—Fullick and I did not agree to give him that chance on condition of his meeting us at 2.30 at the Clarence—that would be a serious breach of our duty—I have never heard of that being done—if he had been taken into custody then and there he would have appeared before the Magistrate the same after<lb/>noon and in all probability would have been fined £5—in all probability Arnold had not £5 then with him—in all probability if he had not been able to pay his fine, he would have been sent to prison—he did not ask for the indulgence of getting it—prisoners are allowed to inform their friends of their arrest, but not before they are taken to the station—once before when I took a prisoner to the station I allowed him to interview a friend—at 2.30 on the day in question I was in the neighbourhood of the Clarence—I do not think I there saw a man named Tuckwell—I did not speak to him and ask him if he had seen Arnold or ask him where Arnold lived—I knew where to find Arnold—at 3.15 the prisoner met us—I think it was about 4 o'clock when Fullick and I went back to the station—we had an opportunity of talking over the matter, but did not do so—I made my note of the conversation at the station—Fullick could have shown me his note, but I do not suppose he would have done; I should not have shown him mine—it is against the regulations to do so—I do not myself bet—I have never done so—I have a great knowledge of betting men—I never backed a horse named "Chaucer" with a betting man in the street—I do not re<lb/>gard betting men as a rule as a little difficult to deal with—the police do not like to be even with them if they can—bookmakers are pretty smart, I suppose—they are mixed up with a clique as a rule—I said before the Magistrate that Fullick did not make any note in the street—I meant I did not see him.</p>

I am an accountant at the National Provincial Bank, Piccadilly, and produce a copy of the account of Mrs. Annie Neilson—the address is Shaftesbury Avenue—this copy is taken from the books of the bank—this cheque for £13 3s. 4d., dated May 13th, was paid into her account on May 16th—this cheque for £14 10s. was paid in on the same day—the account was opened as a private one—I found debits to that account in the names of Kipling and Carter—it was rather an active account, and latterly cheques for the husband's business were passed through—at the end of June it was practically closed and became over-drawn by the debit of our charges, and since then there has been no opera<lb/>tion—on April 28th there was a credit balance of £2 15s. 7d.—the credit goes as high as £15—there is a credit balance of £2 0s. 2d. on June 21st—our charges were £3 13s. 6d.</p>

I am a clerk in the Registrar's Office of Joint Stock Companies and produce the file of the Spitalfields Silk Co., Ltd.—it was registered on February 3rd, 1904, and was to carry on the business of silk weavers and merchants, the registered office being 88 and 90, Chancery Lane—there is a report on the file on June 9th, 1904, of A. W. Carter, who is described as secretary, and James Green Browne as director—the nominal capital of the company is £2,000 in £1 shares—there were twenty-eight ordinary shares and there is a record on the file of the creation of debentures on June 8th, 1904.</p>

               <p>a letter of appointment and I took possession of what was in the office—he handed me over the Bought Ledger, the Sold Ledger, the Day Book and two letter books—those were not all the books, but they were all that he had—I found no minute book or share register or transfer book—on that day I wrote to the prisoner and sent the letter by my clerk, William Ling, on the next day, the 16th—I informed him that I had been appointed receiver and that I had heard certain property of the company was in his possession or power, and would be glad if he would make an early appointment to hand the same over to me—I got no answer—I made an examination of the books and as the result I sent out statements to all persons who appeared to be owing money to the company and I received certain communications, and in consequence I proceeded to make further inquiries—looking at this Sold Day Book under the date of January 16th, 1905, I find a record of what appears to be a sale to A. Coke &amp; Sons of silk amounting to £22 15s. 8d.—the entry is marked "Memo" and ini<lb/>tialled by the prisoner—it was the practice of the company to occasionally send out goods on approval and to send goods to be finished, and then they were entered in this book and marked "Memo," showing that they were not to be charged, the effect of that entry being that they were excluded from the Sold Ledger—after my appointment, in going through this book I thought that item looked a little irregular and I caused a statement to be sent to A. Coke and Sons, saying that the amount was owing to the company and I received a communication by telephone from them saying that this particular item had been received and paid for—the page is cast, but the item omitted—I afterwards saw the cheque which paid for the goods and which should have been paid into the bank and then entered on the debit side of the cash book and posted to the credit of the customer in the ledger—I examined all the books and it was not in any of them—the bankers of the company were the London Joint Stock, Chancery Lane Branch—there is no record of the receipt of Miss Mason's cheque for £14 10s., and the money was not paid into the account—the cheque for £5 9s. 11d., drawn by Mr. Wray, did not appear to be entered and he seemed to be a debtor to the company—I sent him a statement—those goods had not been marked "Memo" and they had been posted to the debit of the customer, but on the date of my appointment they appeared to be owing—I found that there was account of £13 13s. 7d. and £2 19s. 5d. owing by Messrs. Hammond &amp; Co.—a statement was sent to them and in reply I was informed that the items had been paid—when I was ap<lb/>pointed I found that amongst the people indebted to the firm was Mr. Millenger, but I could not find the two bills—I referred to the letter book and saw that there was an entry which appeared to be a copy of a receipt for £51 8s. 1d. which was paid by two bills of exchange, one due on August 18th for £25, and the other due on September 18th for £26 8s. 1d.—I made inquiries—the goods were supplied, and apparently not paid for—taking it generally, none of these cheques or the bills went into the account of the company—amongst the papers I found a notice from a debenture holder, a Mr. Brodie, calling in the payment of his money—there was another debenture holder, but I only found one notice—it is marked by the</p>

               <p>secretary, "Received, 15th May"—from the time I took possession in May down to the time the prosecution was started the prisoner never came to see me with regard to the matter nor gave me any information—I found that there were trade creditors to the company, amounting to three or four hundred pounds—I never saw Carter after May 15th—I first acted in connection with the company about the middle of May, 1904, as accoun<lb/>tant, at the request of the debenture holders, who were Mr. Brodie and Mr. Browne—Mr. Brodie was a representative of Mr. Brigg—the capital for carrying on the business was found by Mr. Brodie and Mr. Browne, and nobody else; the signatories did not even pay—I was asked by the solicitor to the company if I would act, and I also knew Mr. Brigg personally—Mr. Browne acted as director, and debentures were issued to him and to Mr. Brodie—at the time I was appointed Mr. Browne was the sole director and the prisoner was acting as manager—Mr. Brodie was merely a debenture holder—the business was carried on at the office at Chancery Lane and the prisoner was paid £4 a week—his brother was paid £3 a week for managing the factory at Sudbury—from the time the business was formed until I was appointed receiver it was carried on in that way, the prisoner getting his salary week by week, and it was paid up to May 6th, a week before my appointment—there was a weekly cheque drawn for wages and a record of it in the manager's salaries account—Carter was a young man and was paid £1 18s. 6d. a week—after June, 1904, I visited the premises from time to time, and during the whole of that time the prisoner never questioned the position of Mr. Browne or the debenture holders in any way, or suggested that he himself was more than manager—I visited the premises twelve or fifteen times—I did not give notice of my going—up to the time that I took possession the prisoner never suggested he had any claim against the company—when I first became connected with the company in May, 1904, I was asked on behalf of the debenture holders to see if everything was in order and there were meetings pretty frequently and the minute book was written up by the secretary—when I was appointed I looked through the minutes and found that they did not appear to be quite in order, as the signatories' shares had never been allotted to them according to the minutes—the secretary had been paid his salary before he was appointed and in several ways the minutes were irregular—I accordingly instructed the secretary to re-write the minutes, filling in the conformation of the minutes of the previous meeting and the allotment of the signatories' shares which was made on February 24th—the certificate had been signed on that day, but there was no record of it in the minutes—the record of the tenancy of the company's factory was not quite in order, as it showed that Mr. Browne was the tenant and not the company—I altered that, showing that Mr. Browne was tenant on behalf of the company—the minutes were subsequently re-entered and at the meeting of June 8th, at which I was present, they were, I believe, signed by Mr. Browne—of course there could be no claim on the signatories unless their claim was right—all this was done with the prisoner's and the secre<lb/>tary's knowledge, and they never raised any question about it—with regard to dealing with the signatories, this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a letter from the prisoner</p>

Newall is, who had five—I do not know at what date the meet<lb/>ing as held at which these shares were issued, but I expect there will be a minute of it—the minute book which has been produced was in the possession of either the secretary or the prisoner at the date of my ap<lb/>pointment, and until it was produced at Bow Street I did not see it—I did not start the new minute book; a receiver has nothing to do with the minutes of the company—I have not seen the new one, but I believe one was kept—I had no knowledge of the shareholders.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know the prisoner or Mr. Brigg before I was appointed director of the company—I met the prisoner and Mr. Everett in July, 1904, by accident and I received a letter some weeks afterwards from the prisoner, as he wanted a further interview with me—when I saw him he said, "Well, Browne, I am pleased to see you again"—that was at Mr. Everett's office—the prisoner explained that a company was being started and he would like me to be a director—I was to put £300 into the business, to which I agreed—I knew that Mr. Everett held £300 of Mr. Brigg's—it was certainly the prisoner who asked me to become a director; that was at my first interview with him at the top of Chancery Lane in the street—it was the second interview which took place at Mr. Everett's office—I believe the other debenture holder advanced his money to Mr. Everett subject to his finding a suitable gentleman to take a position in the firm, because the prisoner was an undischarged bankrupt, so he found me to take the reins and sign the cheques—on May 25th I put in £100—I paid all the money to Mr. Everett in one cheque and he paid first £100 in and then £200—I acted as director in the company before I advanced any money—I had never had any connection with the silk trade before this—I was a Manchester agent, doing London business, representing Manchester manufacturers—I gave up that occupation about twenty years ago and have been doing nothing since—I have had nothing to do with horse dealing—I was never a horse dealer in my life, but I kept a hackney stud for amusement—I know nothing about business, but I did not think it was dangerous for me to be a sole director of this company; I thought I was in honest hands—I signed practically whatever was put in front of me—I think this signature at the bottom of the minute dated April 14th is mine—just above the signature is "Mr. A. Doig having consented to become auditor of the company, resolved that his services be accepted by the company"—I do not think those words were there when I signed that minute, and I feel confident I have never seen them before—there are other lines between my signature and the bottom of the minutes—I have never seen Mr. Doig's name in the minutes—I cannot say why the debenture</p>

               <p>interest was not paid on January 1st; that was left in the hands of the manager and he paid it when he had the money to spare, and I had con<lb/>fidence in him—the company was nearly always in difficulties for want of money—I had the interest for four months paid to me before January 1st—the interest in January was not paid, I believe, because it was not best for the business—there were wages to be paid and money was wanted for the silk—I did not have £115 in fees; no such <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi>—I received £70 or £76 and I was supposed to receive £100—I have not had a penny since March—you must ask the prisoner why I did not get my interest—I signed many blank cheques, I am sorry to say—I trusted the man who had been a director, as I was an ignorant man, and I did virtually what he asked me—if he wanted to send the cheques for signature why didn't he—I did not prevent him; I should not dictate to a manager when he should post letters—I was very much annoyed when I received a cheque to sign for £40 or £50 from the secretary for some silk and I sent it to the silk factor and received it back as not sufficient—that was in February last—my confidence was shaken in November, but that increased my distrust—in November the prisoner had been absent from business and I suspended him—I believe he was absent through drink; I accused him of it and he said it was not—I believe he sent me a doctor's certificate—it did not say he was suffering from drink; I cannot say what it was he said—I did not say he had got a false certificate—in spite of the prisoner's denial and of the doctor's certificate, which said it was something else, I still believed it was drink—the secretary also knew of it and we had the prisoner's brother up from Essex to see him and he said it was drink also—I was friendly with the prisoner in business as one should be, and I used to meet him once or twice a week for about two hours—I did not get into trouble with the Railway Company just before November—you suggested at Bow Street that I was to be prosecuted by the Railway Company for travelling without a ticket and I denied it—I was late one morning and I unfortunately ran on to Harold Wood instead of Romford without a ticket—I was talking to a gentleman and went through the barrier without giving up any ticket as I had not taken one—I went to the office and told the prisoner and he said, "That is all right, Mr. Browne; I know Mr. Scott intimately. We will go and see him"—he is one of the head officials, and I saw him on the third morning and put the matter before him and said, "Mr. Scott, such and such has happened. I am exceedingly sorry; I had no wilful intent and I have never travelled without a railway ticket before in my life, and I trust you will accept this explanation and allow me to offer you five guineas for the Superannuation Fund"—he retired from the room and came back and said, "Mr. Browne, your offer is accepted," and that is the only trouble I got into—the prisoner offered to give me his good offices in the matter and perhaps I jumped at them—I think it happened in December, not November—I was talking to the gentleman about the Cattle Show—I now think it was in November; I will withdraw the Cattle Show—I have never said that I was very friendly with prisoner.</p>

               <p>hundreds of people; I am not at all ashamed of it—I had given the prisoner advice about drink and there was a question of his taking the pledge—I had taken it myself as an inducement to him and I kept it faithfully for six months—he did not keep his pledge—I kept mine and felt it somewhat of a punishment—early in 1905 matters came to my know<lb/>ledge which caused me to write to him on the same subject—this is the letter of February 11th (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the witness had heard from Carter that morning with deep regret that the prisoner was once more ill in bed; that the expected had happened because the witness knew that as soon as the prisoner had broken the pledge all was up; that when the prisoner had re<lb/>turned from Hampshire he had seen it in his face; that he wished him (the prisoner) to sign it once more and keep it for ever, and that White had ordered</hi> £40 <hi rend="italic">of silk and he would try to get to the office on Friday).</hi>

I am the prisoner's wife and we have been married for about sixteen years on May 31st—about the beginning of 1901 Kipling &amp; Co. was in a very bad state and I sold some cottages at Sudbury, in Suffolk, which were my own property, and advanced them £125—the solicitor's name was Ranson &amp; Sons—I received the money with one hand and gave it to the company with the other—it was a cheque; I paid it to the prisoner for the uses of the firm—I next sold some of my furniture at "West-field" for £195—that was sold by Messrs. Wheeler &amp; Westoby—I gave the money to the prisoner for the uses of the firm—I next sold my house, "Westfield," through Messrs. Ward, Perks &amp; McKay, of Gracechurch Street—I got £900 for the house, which was freehold, but there were mort<lb/>gages which had to be paid, so I only got £300, which I gave to the pri<lb/>soner—the rest of my furniture I pawned for £400—I was told it was not exactly a bill sale if I warehoused the furniture—I do not know if there was anything else I lent—the company gave me two lots of silk as security—the prisoner and his brother were in the company—I am not a business woman; I do not know if the prisoner and his brother had the busi<lb/>ness between them at this time—the silk came in two hampers—I took care of it at my house—I think I was told its value was about £700, but I have no knowledge of what it was worth—it was pawned by the prisoner for £300 with my consent to help the company again—I do not know the date—the prisoner must have had the £300; I did not have one penny of it—I do not know if I proved in the prisoner's bankruptcy for the amount I had advanced to the firm; I do not know anything about it—the silk is not still in pledge; the company has it; they asked me if they could have the pawn ticket and get it out of pawn—the company con<lb/>sisted of Mr. Browne; the prisoner told me that—I have not seen the person with whom it was pawned, but his name is Battersby—I saw the ticket; the company has it and they took my goods out of pawn and sold them for their own use.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, carrying on business at 365, New North Road—on October 27th I was in the Meat Market buying meat for my business—I bought from Brewer &amp; Co. seven pigs, and from Darrington &amp; Co. two pigs and two pair of hands, some spare ribs and three pigs' plucks—the pigs from Darrington were Cornish pigs—I can tell a Cornish pig from a Devonshire pig—on Cornish pips the shoes are left on the toes; on other pigs they are generally taken off—from Taylor &amp; Sons I bought three loins of Dutch pork and some back fat—when the fat is cut off the loins we generally call it hog meat, and this that I bought was hog meat—it weighed 6 stone and the pigs weighed 19 stone—I engaged Frederick Greast to collect the things and put them on my van, which was in Charterhouse Street—Greast is a porter whom I had em<lb/>ployed there for years in the mornings—I went away and left him to collect the things about 9 o'clock—I returned about 9.30, when Muckenfus, who is a butcher in the market, spoke to me—I looked at my van and saw some beef and mutton there which I had bought, but of the other things which I have mentioned nothing was there except some pigs' plucks and the back fat—the meat which was lost was worth about £9 5s. 8d.—the pigs bought from Brewer were still in the shop and had not been collected; Greast was not there—I went all over the place, but could not find him or his truck, and I went to the police about 10.15 or 10.30 a.m.—this was a Friday—I saw Greast again in the afternoon and had a little conversa<lb/>tion with him, but I have not seen him since—that evening I went with some police officers to 48, Red Lion Street, where the prisoner carries on business as a butcher—I did not know him—we got there about 9.30—his shop was then open—I walked up a little distance and came back again in about ten minutes—the shop was still open and a little later Alfred Greast, the brother of Frederick Greast, and I went to the shop and found it was shut—that was about 9.45—Alfred Greast knocked, and a little boy opened the door—we went in and stayed there for about live minutes and the prisoner came—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Guv'nor</hi>, I have lost three pigs, three loins, and four shoulders this morning from the market; I have some idea they came up this way. Will you kindly let me have a look at the pork you have in the shop?"—he said, "Yes, you can have a look at it"—I looked round and found a quantity of pork there cut up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110081"/>
               <p>and hanging in different parts of the shop—the pieces I found there would make, up two pigs with the exception of three spare ribs and two bellies—I afterwards found the two bellies in the salt cupboard in the cellar—I weighed them and found they weighed 12 lbs. short of 19 stone—the weight of the three ribs would be about 12 lbs., so they weighed apparently just the same as the two pigs I had lost—there was also a quantity of hog meat there cut up into about ten pieces—it was such as would make up three loins with the exception of a neck and a few chops which had gone—I weighed them and found they weighed 6 lbs. short—the weight of the neck and chops which were missing would be about 6 lbs., so they weighed the same as I should expect if they were the same that I had lost—I saw nothing else there which was like the meat I had lost—I say now that the two pigs and the three loins are mine—I recognise them, by the size and quality—the pigs had got the shoes off when I found them—I say they were Cornish pigs—I said to the prisoner, "They are my two pigs and my loins. What have you got to say about them or where did you get them from?—he said, "They were sent up to me. I told a man to buy me a few pigs and they came up this morning"—I asked him if he knew the man and where he was from and if he could take me to him—he said he could not do so that night, but he might be able to in the morning—I asked the name of the carrier who brought them to him and he mentioned Roger and Earnshaw and one name which I could not quite catch", they were not people whom I knew—I said I should like to know where the other pig and the four shoulders had gone to, and a little later on I said, "What are you going to do about the pigs and the loins?"—he said, "You say they are your pork; I am willing to pay you for it if you will meet me," and he repeated that several times—I said, "That will not do for me; I will be back in a few minutes," and I left the shop and told the police and gave him into custody—when the police came in we had some further conversation about the shoulders on hands—there were two pairs still missing and are still, and one pig.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had lost more than I found at the prisoner's shop—the value of the two pigs which I found at his shop was £4 5s. 6d. and the loins £1 10s.—I am a retail butcher—I bought this pork on Friday—I sell a good deal of pork on Saturday—I keep my shop open until about 10.30—when I saw the prisoner at his shop he said, "I have been out all day; I have been up at the Law Courts"—he did not say, as far as I know, that he had been in the market that morning—the other name which he mentioned besides Roger and Earnshaw may have been Hyde or White—I weighed the meat myself and found that it made up practically the weight of the meat I had lost—the prisoner himself told me that the pigs weighed 9 stone 6 lbs. and 9 stone 2 lbs.—when I asked him, "Can you show me the delivery note for the pigs?" he said, "No," and I said, "Can you tell me the weight of them?"—he said, "Yes, I can," and he told me, and also the weight of the three loins—it was as clear as daylight that he had got my pigs in his possession on his own admission, and he told me that they had come between 9 and 9.30 that morning—I believe he said he was in the back parlour at the time they came—I have known</p>

               <p>Frederick Greast eight or ten years, or perhaps longer—I did not know that there was anything dishonest about him—I have only known Alfred Greast a few years and I only knew that he was Frederick Greast's brother—I did not know that he was dishonest—I always buy my own meat in the market—I have no salesman or scalesman in the market upon whose judg<lb/>ment I rely to send me meat if he thinks I can do with it—I have heard that that is done, but I always buy my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I went to the shop there were three or four quarters of beef and some mutton and a small portion of pork and some small pieces of back fat—it was fairly well stocked and there were some sausages on the counter—when I buy meat in the market I can either take it away myself or have it sent by a carrier—if it is sent by ft carrier, it is the custom to send a delivery note which would state what was being sent and the weight, and I should sign the carrier's book to show that I had received it—if I had meat sent to me from the market on approval I should have to sign for it, which would be the carrier's voucher that he had delivered it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher at 69, St. James' Street, Walthamstow—on October 27th I was in the Meat Market at Smithfield, when I saw the prosecutor buying meat—I saw Frederick Greast—I saw the prosecutor's van there without him—about 9.30 a.m. I first saw Frederick Greast coming up the avenue looking for a constable—he came up to me and told me he had lost his truck—I went and looked for it and found it in Long Lane with some plucks and back fat in it, which he afterwards took to the prosecutor's van—a little while after that I saw the prosecutor again and spoke to him—I saw Frederick Greast again directly afterwards and also on Saturday morning about 9.10, when he came to my place at Walthamstow, but I have never seen him since—he does not live in my neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Frederick Greast was going about looking for a police<lb/>man and seemed very much distracted at having lost some meat for which, he was responsible—I have been in the Meat Market about ten years——I do not know if people have salesmen or scalesmen to buy for them in the market; larger people have their special buyers who are not the same as scalesmen—I do not think it is a rule in the market for a butcher in a small way to have a scalesman belonging to some big people to keep their shop supplied with meat, and I have never heard of it, but they might do so—if a butcher wanted to buy his meat from a scalesman's employer and the scalesman bought the meat elsewhere it would be against the scales<lb/>man's employer—business is sometimes done in a pretty rough condition in the Meat Market, but a ticket is supposed to be sent with the meat—it has never happened to me that no ticket has been delivered; I am a German, and perhaps English people may be more lax about it—the scalesman has to weigh the meat and put the weight on the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy scalesman to Darrington &amp; Co., and on October 27th the prosecutor bought from my firm two pigs and some other pork—I did not weigh them, but one pig weighed 9 stone 6 lbs., and the other 9 stone 2 lbs., and the two pair of hands weighed something more—I did not make out a ticket, because he paid cash—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110083"/>
               <p>the clerk makes out the ticket when the weight is called out—the buyer is often there when the meat is weighed—I delivered the things to a porter whose name, I believe, is Frederick Greast—we have no porters employed by ourselves, but if you did not book a purchase in, I should call at the carriers and book it in and they send porters and collect it—we should send out a weight note; I cannot say if things are sent out without a delivery note—if a person not in a very large way of business employs somebody to make a purchase for him in the market it would be the porter's duty to ask for a weight note to give satisfaction to the person who has ordered the meat, and it is taken by the porter and delivered to the man who drives the van to the customer so that he can see if it is the correct weight—the carrier would not have to get a receipt from the buyer—sometimes a carrier will send three or four times to a man in one day.</p>

On October 27th I went with the prosecutor and some other officers to Red Lion Street—the prosecutor went into the prisoner's shop first with Alfred Greast, leaving us outside—he afterwards called us in, when I saw the prisoner and said to him, "I am a police officer and Mr. Rilling identifies this pork as having been stolen from him this morning; how do you account for the possession of it?"—he said, "They were sent up to me"—I said, "Who sent them?"—he said, "I do not know who sent them, whether Roger, Hyde, or Earnshaw"—I said, "Had you a receipt or anything, or any other paper with them?"—he replied, "I had no paper left with them; I was out when they came in a van. There were two pigs and two hog meats"—I said, "Who brought them?"—he said, "I do not know who brought them; they came about 10.30"—he then called me into a little office and said, "I do not know who brought them; they came about 10.30. I was in the back room; anybody sends me meat up. I admit it is silly"—he was taken to the station—I have made inquiry for Frederick Greast, but he has disappeared with his family from Ilford, where he lived.</p>

I am a dealer in jewellery, living at 141, Peckham Rye—I have known the prisoner for about twenty years and have had dealings with him for about five years—I remember his coming to me in September, 1904, at the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit—he asked me if I had got a pearl necklace for a customer of his, somewhere between £70 and £100—I said I would try to get one—on September 20th I let him have two pearl necklaces—their value was £84 and £95—the terms on which he had them were that he was to give me an answer as soon as he could—they were on sale or return—after inquiry I got the £84 one returned, but not the £95 one—he did not say at any time that he had pawned the £95 necklace three days after he got it from me—he had no authority to do so—on October 3rd I let him have three miniatures to show a customer—had I known on October 3rd that my necklace had been pawned by him on September 23rd I would not have let him have those—the price of them was £9, on sale or return—on October 17th I let him have a three-stone diamond ring, value £28—between September 20th and October 27th I received no payment for those goods, nor have I received them back except the £84 necklace—on October 27th I received a letter from him saying he was unable to meet his engagements—that was the first intimation I received that he was insolvent—I then called on him and he gave me the pawntickets</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Hanger Lane, Ealing, and am in partnership with Mr. Sweeney at 5, Regent Street, as inquiry agents—I have been in partnership with him for nearly two years—on the evening of August 9th Mr. Bicknell called at the office and made an ap<lb/>pointment; I did not see him—I did not see him the next day—I had some conversation with Mr. Sweeney—about 11 a.m. on August 10th Mr. Sweeney introduced the prisoner to me at the office; that was the first</p>

               <p>time I had seen him—he did not say anything as to the object for which he was there on that day; they went out together after the introduction—Mr. Sweeney returned alone—on August 11th the prisoner had an in<lb/>terview with me at the office—he gave us instructions to watch his wife, Mrs. Julia Watt, who lived at 15, Chapel Street; he said he wanted the life she was leading found out and we discussed the question of terms—this document (<hi rend="italic">Ex. A</hi>), dated August 11th, 1905, was drawn up in his presence—it is in my writing—he read it through afterwards, signed it, and left the office—he came back about twenty minutes afterwards and made an interlineation (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): 5, Regent Street, London, S.W., August 11th, 1905. Dear Sirs,—I hereby instruct you to take such steps as you may deem expedient to find out the mode of living of Mrs. Watt, of 15, Chapel Street, and, if possible, to induce her to make absolute the decree nisi she obtained against me, and I agree to pay you your usual charges f one guinea per each officer engaged, together with the out-of-pocket expenses, and I further agree that if you are successful in bringing about the decree nisi being made absolute and a settlement of all disputes, to pay you by way of a bonus the sum of £1,000. Yours faithfully, Hugh Watt," addressed to "Sweeney &amp; Marshall, 5, Regent Street"—he came back and interlined the words "and a settlement of all disputes"—the bonus of £1,000 was the prisoner's own suggestion—I saw him next about 11 a.m. on August 12th at the office—he spoke of the immoral life that he said Mrs. Watt was living; that he had had a girl he was keeping and had been keeping for two years, whom he would produce at the proper time to speak as to these acts, and he likewise showed me a typewritten post card of a very scurrilous nature which he said had evidently come from Mrs. Watt and we must find out, as he would lock her up—I do not think he said anything about litigation on that occasion—he told us we were to watch her and find out the character of the people who visited her; that we were to get in with the servants—we did watch her—shortly after he left, we got a telephone message from him—he seemed very excited and said that Lady Violet Beauchamp had been assaulted by hooligans just off Sloane Street at the instigation of Mrs. Watt and we really must do something in the matter—I told him he must leave the matter in our hands and we would do our best, and if he did not approve of what we were doing he could take his business elsewhere—he said, "Come and see me at 72, Knightsbridge, at 9.30 on Monday"—I kept that appoint<lb/>ment and he told me that I must see Mrs. Watt, and gave me £10 in gold for expenses—I did not give him any receipt—nothing else took place at that interview—about 3.30 p.m. on that day I called at 15, Chapel Street, which was a house to let, furnished—I was shown over the house by a ser<lb/>vant named Maloney—I saw Mrs. Watt and had some conversation with her—about 5 p.m. the same day I saw the prisoner and told him that Mrs. Watt was very much frightened at his violent behaviour towards her on the occasion of his visit there, which was made the subject matter of the prisoner applying for a summons at Westminster—he did not say anything to that—I told him that Mrs. Watt had told me that he (the prisoner) had offered her £600 a year to give up the settlement of 1901—I do not</p>

               <p>think he said very much as to that then—the prisoner had mentioned that settlement to me before my interview with Mrs. Watt—he showed me another post card, a written one, of a scurrilous character, but not quite so bad as the first one he showed me, and he said, "Something must be done. You must really find out where these come from"—I said, "We will do our best"—he made an appointment for me to see him the next day at 72 Knightsbridge, at 5 p.m.—I went there the next day and saw him—he began talking about Mrs. Watt; he spoke of the occasion on which he had been to 15, Chapel Street, and said that during the alterca<lb/>tion he struck Mrs. Watt over the left breast with his left arm, but that owing to the muscles of his left arm having been hurt or strained he was not; able to strike an effective blow; that he swung round to give her the right and finish her, and just then Mary Maloney came in at the doorway—he then asked me if I could recommend him a solicitor who could deal with these post cards—he said he had been robbed by solicitors, and mentioned various names—he mentioned that he had given Bernard Abrahams £2,000 to murder Mrs. Watt; that he, Abra<lb/>hams, and two other men went down to where Mrs. Watt was then living, but at the last moment they showed the white feather and stuck to the £2,000—I recommended him a solicitor—he said he would do for her and produced a wooden case from a roll top desk, which he un<lb/>screwed and produced a bottle containing some white liquid, which he said was chloroform—he removed the stopper, but I did not smell it—he then said, "You get Mrs. Watt to come here. We will get her downstairs, where I have a room prepared. I will give her a push, chloroform her, and when it is all over you are to go for Dr. Francis Blake, of Putney, who will certify death to be heart disease"—he said that Mrs. Watt had suffered from a weak heart—I said, "You must be mad," and at once left the place—before I left he said he would come and see me the following day—on August 16th, the following day, he telephoned me he was coming and would arrive at 11 a.m., which he did—he came to fetch the post cards which were in my possession; he only stayed a minute or two, and said, "I am coming to see you to-morrow at 11 o'clock to get the matter settled up"—on that day I seriously thought over what he said the day before, and on the next morning, August 17th, I gave some instructions to McKenna and Drummond, who were in my employ—the prisoner came about 11 a.m. into my private room—he said he had been dining in Devonshire Place the evening before and he passed the house in Chapel Street, and that it looked very dirty—I said, "Have you thought matters over? Is there no other way out of it?—he replied, "No; we must snuff her out. You get her to come to 72, Knightsbridge; we will talk about the letters and induce her to come downstairs. I will give her a push, chloroform her, and when all is over you are to go for Dr. Francis Blake, of Putney, and I will have her cremated within twenty-four hours, and I will give you the sum of £5,000"—he further said, "We will pour essence of peppermint between her teeth to take away the smell of the chloroform"—I said, "Have you told Dr. Blake about this?" and he said, "Yes, and Dr. Blake replied, 'I will not have anything to do with it. You must not have anything to</p>

               <p>do with it, but you must get another man.' You must get Maloney to take her discharge and help us"—I said, "You must give me twenty-four hours to think the matter over, and I will give you an answer, yes or no"—he went without making any further appointment—a minute or two afterwards I went to Scotland Yard alone and saw Acting Superintendent Fox, getting there about 11.45 a.m., perhaps a little earlier than that; it was 11.45 a.m. when I saw Mr. Fox—I had an interview with him—I saw another officer who took my statement down—I left with Sergeants Ball and Fowler shortly after 12, and went to 5, Regent Street, with them, remaining in their company till we got to Marlborough Street Police Court—on arriving there, I should think about 1.30 p.m., we found the Magis<lb/>trate had adjourned and we waited until he sat again—the information which had been prepared and signed by me at Scotland Yard was laid before him and I swore to it—this was before 2 p.m., before the public had come back into Court—the Magistrate intimated that a warrant would be granted and we waited till it was made out—I went back to the office, arriving there about 2.30 p.m.—I was told that the prisoner had telephoned me when I arrived at the office from Scotland Yard with the officers before going to Marlborough Street—I had a communication with the prisoner on the telephone, when he said, "Send me in your account. I am going to the country. I will see the solicitor about the letters"—I asked him to come and see me at 5 p.m.—then I went to Marlborough Street—on coming back from Marlborough Street I did not have any further telephonic communication from him—he did not come at 5 p.m.—this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is very like the one the prisoner showed to me, and this is the case (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in which it was—from the time that the pri<lb/>soner spoke to me in my private room on August 17th until I got to Scot<lb/>land Yard after he left, I had no communication with either Drummond or McKenna.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am employed to find and search out matters and I am paid so much a day per man, which is the ordinary rule—I do not think it is to our interest to keep the inquiry going as long as possible; we like to finish our inquiries as soon as we possibly can; we are looking to future recommendation—we are never paid by results or by a lump sum; this bonus was quite an unusual thing; we did not ask for it—Mr. Sweeney had been at Scotland Yard; he came to me at the beginning of last year, two or three months after he left there—I suggested to the prisoner drawing up the agreement—I left out about the settlement of disputes, but he corrected it afterwards—he did not take it away or make a copy of it—he came back and said he would like to make one or two alterations, and I at once handed it to him—we should require to employ men to find out Mrs. Watt's mode of living—I quite understood that his desire at that time was to have a friendly settlement of all the disputes—when asking him to sign it I did not say it was the usual agreement, nor did Mr. Sweeney, who was there at the time, say so to my knowledge—Mr. Sweeney went away directly afterwards to the country, where he had a case—I did not telephone to the prisoner on that same day after he had signed the agreement that I had heard of or knew that there was a board</p>

               <p>outside 15, Chapel Street, saying that it was to let to my knowledge—it is absolutely impossible for me to say whether I did do so; I have no recol<lb/>lection of it—how I knew about the board was that Mr. Watt told me—I will not swear I did not, because I cannot recollect it at this length of time; to the best of my belief I did not—I telephoned to him that Mrs. Watt was going to Ostend, and he asked me to come and see him the next morning—he did not say that he did not believe it and give me forty-eight hours to finish my inquiries and negotiations, or the matter was ended, nor words to that effect—I swear I did not call upon him in the evening, nor did I have any conversation with him whatever—there was a con<lb/>versation on the 12th at my office about Ostend; he did not say he did not believe my story about Mrs. Watt going to Ostend; he said he did not think it very likely—he did not know more than I did except that I reported to him that she was going to Ostend—I said that I would want two men to follow her if she went—I asked him how long she generally stayed away and he said, "Two months," and wanted to know what the cost would be—I said, "Somewhere about £250 if she stayed two months"—I did not say I wanted £250 for the men to follow her to Ostend—he did not reply that his solicitor, Mr. Bick<lb/>nell, had advised him to pay me only out-of-pocket expenses; he never mentioned Mr. Bicknell's name to me—he did not say that he would give me £10 for my out-of-pocket expenses and that I could either take that or go about my business, nor did he say that to me when he gave me the £10 on the 11th—he did not say either on the 12th or the 14th that he would give me forty-eight hours to make some progress with my negotiations or I could go about my business; he never used such words to me on any occasion—he did not name a time within which I was to do something tangible or go about my business—at no time did he express dissatisfaction with my conduct in the matter—we did not look upon the agreement as a very valuable business; we get so much of it—I suggest that with that document in my possession on the 12th I suggested to the prisoner that he could take his business away if he was not satisfied with what we were doing—it was not in consequence of his having complained that I said that—I did not look upon his saying that we really must do something as a complaint—when we are instructed we usually have matters left in our hands to deal with and we do the best we can for our clients—Mrs. Watt never went to Ostend to my know<lb/>ledge—I did not tell the prisoner who it was that told me she was going—I did not say to him on August 14th that I had now discovered that she was not going to Ostend, but was going on a motor trip; I am quite sure I never said anything about a motor trip to him—I never told him that I had discovered she was not going to Ostend—I did not tell him on the 14th that I had been all over the house with Mrs. Watt; I told him I had been all over the house with Maloney—I got in as an intending tenant—I did not tell him that I was very hopeful of success in my mission after having seen Mrs. Watt; I said I was not very hopeful—I certainly did not tell him that I thought I had been so successful that had I had the agreement I could have induced her to sign it—there was nothing said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110099"/>
               <p>about the agreement that day—on no date was anything said between the prisoner and myself about an agreement for Mrs. Watt to sign—he did not produce to me a document which he had drawn up and wanted me to get Mrs. Watt to sign, nor did he tell me the terms of it—I under<lb/>stood what he was proposing was that Mrs. Watt should agree to accept £600 a year from the present time in lieu of her reversionary interest under this deed, but he never said anything to me about it—I understood he wanted everything settled—I got the idea that the prisoner was going to offer Mrs. Watt £600 a year from Mrs. Watt herself, and she said she would have nothing whatever to do with it—when he gave me the £10 he said, "You will want some money to go on with"; he volunteered it without any request from me—Mrs. Watt never complained of having been assaulted by the prisoner—I did not tell the prisoner on the 15th that I had just come from Chapel Street, where I had had another inter<lb/>view with Mrs. Watt—I did not tell him that I had had a conversation with her regarding their differences and that I thought I would succeed in time—I never led him to believe that I had any hope of success; I led him to believe it was a very difficult matter owing to Mrs. Watt having said that she would have nothing to do with the £600 a year he had offered her—on that day he did not say that he did not believe a word of my stories about her movements; or that he had no con<lb/>fidence whatever in my statements, and as I had nothing tangible to report he did not wish to see me again—he did not open a desk for the purpose of showing me the document he wanted Mrs. Watt to sign—I never saw any such document—I think the desk was in fact open—I did not take up the wooden bottle and say, "What is this?" and he did not say, "That is chloroform which Lady Violet or I have used for some medical purposes"—I had certainly not up to that date led him to believe that I was a person prepared to carry out murders at short notice, nor have I advertised that; I never advertise at all—I certainly say that, without ascertaining what sort of person I was, he suddenly proposed that I should help him in murdering Mrs. Watt—I did not wait long enough to inform Mrs. Watt or the authorities—I did not on the 16th telephone to him that I had important information to give him and ask him to call upon me—I think it was on the 17th that I asked him whether he had said anything to Dr. Blake; it was the last part of the conversation that he told me Dr. Blake had refused to have anything to do with it—in the same conversation he told me to go to Dr. Blake, but admitted nevertheless when I asked him, that Dr. Blake had said he would have nothing whatever to do with it—when he called upon me on the 17th he did not say, "Have you anything to report?" nor words to that effect; nor did he say, "As far as you are concerned, I suppose you can do nothing further in the matter"—I did not make any reference to a motor-car in reference to Mrs. Watt, nor did the prisoner say, after some discussion. "I have no faith in you at all, and your statements are the purest rubbish," and I did not reply, "Very well, you shall have your bill made out"—nothing was said about my bill whilst he was talking to me—he did not leave the room very angry—up to that time he never said if he was pleased</p>

               <p>or otherwise; he certainly did appear quite satisfied with what I was doing for him—I did not make a note of the conversation—I am quite certain he used the expression that the curtains seemed very dirty when he had passed Chapel Street—He left a few minutes' after 11—when I returned to the office from Scotland Yard it would be somewhere about 1 p.m.—my clerk then informed me that the prisoner had telephoned; he may have telephoned at 11.45 a.m., but I do not know—my clerk did not give me any message; he simply said the prisoner had rung me up—when the prisoner telephoned me I understood he was making an end of all the business, as he was going into the country, and for no other reason—Drummond has not been well for a long time; he has been away from the office about six weeks—I gave instructions to McKenna to take written notes of what he had heard that he thought important—I did say at the Police Court, "McKenna had no instructions to make a report, but he had a report ready when I came, back"—there is a difference between notes and a report; McKenna put his notes in the form' of a full report—I take it that a note is a record of something that took place at a time and a report would be made up from those notes afterwards—McKenna made the report on his own initiative—I never saw the notes which he made, only the report—I do not know if the notes are in existence—I did not instruct Drummond to make notes—from first to last I never asked the prisoner for money on account of this business—I had been engaged in this kind of work ten to eleven years, starting by myself as "H. Marshall"—in 1900 I sold my business to a limited company—I had 500 shares, the subscribed capital of the company being £1,000, subscribed by a man named Hanmar, a great friend of mine, and a very wealthy man—he had the particulars of the business from me and he was very glad to subscribe to it—the object of the company was to carry on the various objects mentioned in the Articles of Association, such as financial business, detective work, collection of debts and so on—lending money may have been in the Articles—three years afterwards it went into voluntary liquidation with no debts, the object being that I wanted the thing to be carried on under my own name and Mr. Sweeney's—Mr. Sweeney preferred not to come in when it was a company—Mr. Hanmar has still got his £1,000 in the business; he did not ask for it back—October, 1904, may have been the date of the liquida<lb/>tion—Mr. Sweeney was not in partnership with me in the first place; alter the liquidation he went into partnership with me—I did not tell the prisoner that Mrs. Watt had telegraphed me in the name of Kerrlane, Hanger Lane, Ealing—Kerrlane is the name of the lady I am living with at Hanger Lane, Ealing—I did not swear at the Police Court that she was my wife—I did not swear, "It was in 1896 or 1897 that the divorce in my own case was made absolute"—I swore that it was not made absolute—my deposition was read over to me and I signed it—I did not swear that in spite of its being on my deposition; the word "not" must have been left out and unnoticed by me when I signed the deposition—I said at the Police Court, "My former wife has died"—I swear I do not know that she is alive now—I also said, "And I am living with my second wife and not</p>

               <p>free to marry. The intervention of the Queen's Proctor was successful but my wife afterwards died"—I have not seen her for a very long time—I saw her last in the beginning of last year—the ground for my swearing my wife had died was an anonymous communication I received, saying that she was dead, at the beginning of this year, which I tried to verify—I did not keep it—I showed it to no one—I made all the inquiries I could think of, but I could not trace her—I believe she has been living ever since with the man on whose account I obtained the decree nisi, but I do not. know of my own knowledge—I have seen that man and conversed with him on the subject of my wife—I have asked to see her, but I have not seen her—he has not told me that she is alive, nor has he told me she is dead; I have never asked him—it was only the other day that I saw him—I did ask him whether she was alive and he told me she was alive and living with him—when I said that I did not know that she was alive, I meant of my own knowledge; I have not seen her—I believe she is alive from what you have just said—I asked this man one simple question: whether she was alive or dead, and he did not answer me—I asked him if she was alive, could I see her, and he did not answer—I did not ask him whether she had been subpoenaed to appear here—that is my wife (<hi rend="italic">Pointing</hi>); I do not know where she has been living—I was not living in adultery at the time I obtained this decree nisi from my wife—the Queen's Proctor intervened on the ground that I was living with a Mrs. Williamson, and the Court was satisfied that that was true—Mrs. Williamson was the widow of a clergyman and possessed of considerable property—I became acquainted with her before January, 1899; I was carrying on this business at Regent Street at the time—she was brought to me by a friend to make some inquiries with regard to her property—soon after I promised her marriage in the event of my getting my divorce—I did not live with her on the strength of that promise—after I failed in the divorce I lived with her at 35, Lad-broke Gardens, but never before—I do not remember receiving any notice that the Queen's Proctor was going to intervene—I did not get it until the last moment, when we were in Court for the purpose of the decree absolute—I did not fight the case, because I did not want to bring this lady's name in—I cannot tell you what the Queen's Proctor alleged against me—I may have instructed a solicitor to write to the Queen's Proctor saying I did not intend to have the decree made absolute; it is such a long time ago that I do not remember—I did not know that the allegation was that at the time the decree nisi was obtained I was living in adultery with this lady—I knew that the charge was adultery, but I did not know the time—I lived openly with Mrs. Williamson after the decree nisi was rescinded—I did not live with her secretly or in any way before—she came down to live with me at Torrington; I did not induce her to—at my inducement she purchased two houses called "The Warren" and "The Lodge"—she provided some of the money for it—I provided £300 or £400—the conveyances were taken in my own name—I had a very good business in Marlborough Street as my livelihood—it is quite right that I had no means of livelihood then; I had been very ill from fever—I was living on this lady until I could get something to do—I opened a banking account</p>

If you do not there will be a public scandal")—I cannot explain that; I was not threatening to make a public scandal—I received this letter on September 22nd, 1900, from Mr. Pritchard (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mrs. Williamson was almost without means, but that she would, upon his (Marshall) signing the document making over the houses to her, authorise him to give him (Marshall) a cheque for</hi> £50, <hi rend="italic">and, should the houses sell at the amount anticipated, she would be willing to give him a further sum, making up the amount he (Marshall) mentioned"</hi>)—I see that in the first place she tried to induce me to accept £50; I should not have recollected it if you had not read that letter—I never mentioned any amount—I do not know that I ever wrote to tell him that I had not done so—I cannot give any explanation of his writing that letter to me—I think if you read a letter from him to me afterwards it would put a very different complexion on your questions to me; I have lost it—it is in Mr. Pritchard's letter-book—I cannot recollect the date of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">H. A. MARSHALL</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Further cross-examined</hi>), I obtained a sum of £350 from Mrs. Williamson for the purpose of lending it to a Mrs. Baghouse—when the question of the settlement of all matters between me and Mrs. Williamson arose I said that I did not know where Mrs. Baghouse was to be found; I did not know then—I do not recollect that at that time I gave an under<lb/>taking to procure repayment of that sum from Mrs. Baghouse and to pay it over to Mrs. Williamson—possibly when I received the £250 I signed an undertaking beginning in these words: "I will use my best endeavours to procure payment of the £350 due by Mrs. Baghouse and to pay same over to Mrs. Williamson or her solicitor"—I never repaid that or any portion of it; I have not had it from Mrs. Baghouse—I know where she is now; I know where she was eighteen months ago; I do not know at the present moment—the last address I knew her at was in Ealing; I think it was Castle House, Castle Hill—I may have at the time of the settlement signed a letter to be handed to Mrs. Williamson withdrawing any charges of immorality or misconduct against her; I probably did—I was not in pecuniary difficulties in 1904 and up to the beginning of 1905, and a number of bankruptcy notices were not served</p>

               <p>against me to my recollection—I know there was a dispute with Messrs. Pedley &amp; Mortimer about the rent of some offices at Fleet Street, but I do not remember a bankruptcy notice, but I will not swear to it—it resulted in proceedings against me—there was certainly not a bankruptcy notice served against me by Frederick James Marshall for £321 19a. 9d. I do not know anybody of that name—there was a bankruptcy notice nerved on me by Cohen &amp; Co. for £59. but it was never proceeded with—I know the Pot Pourri, Limited, threatened a bankruptcy notice against me, but I do not remember having one—this was all in 1903 or 1904—I am not often in communication with the police I know a great number of the police personally, but not before Mr. Sweeney came to me—I never saw Inspector Hayter until I saw him at Marlborough Street—with regard to what I said yesterday about Mr. Watt telling me of his offer of £600 a year, the first conversation that arose about the £600 and giving up the settlement of 1901 came from Mrs. Watt on Monday, August 14th, and that same evening I reported to the prisoner that conversation; it was then that he told me that he was prepared to give her £600 a year if she would give up the settlement—when I said yesterday, "He never said anything to me about it," I took the question as being previous to Mrs. Watt having spoken to me about the £600.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say in my deposition, "I did not tell the defendant that I had divorced my wife and that the King's Proctor had intervened; I never spoke to him about that. It is true that I divorced my wife and that the King's Proctor did intervene"—I and my wife parted fifteen years ago—a little boy I had of six years of age died and on the boy's death bed, when I was very much cut up, she confessed to me that the child was not mine, and told me who the father was—then I left—I had a daughter by the marriage also, who is with me now—my wife went to live with a Mr. Charles Cary; he was not the man who seduced my wife—neither written nor verbally did Mr. Pritchard make any charge against me of demanding £250 or that I would make a scandal—there is another letter, which was the final one from Mr. Pritchard, which I have lost; I am afraid I cannot say the contents, but I know from my point of view it was very satisfactory—the theatrical scheme I invested the £2,000 in was Pot Pourri, Limited, at the Avenue Theatre—it was invested in my name—I took shares—£1,100 was invested in that way and the rest Mrs. Williamson spent on jewellery from a Mr. Joseph, a jeweller in Westbourne Grove, which she kept—I think the banking account was first of all started at Bideford and transferred from Bideford to Torrington—I cannot say whether at Torrington I paid in money of my own or at Bideford; I certainly did at one of those places—I paid in one sum of £150 at Bideford; I cannot recollect the other sums; I left all my papers behind and I had not a chance of referring to the bank books or anything else—when the £250 was paid to me by Messrs. Crossman, Pritchard &amp; Co. I had made no threats; I believe I made a claim for it—I was brought in contact with Mr. Sweeney over a case that I did for the Government at Gibraltar in connection with certain insurance frauds—prior to August last I had never heard of Thomas Worley or James Shuttle</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived at 4, Millard Road, Stoke Newington, but I now live at 74, North Grove, Dalston—I am an assistant to Messrs. Sweeney &amp; Marshall—I have been a police officer, and, when I retired, a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police for some twenty-five years—I entered the employ of Messrs. Sweeney &amp; Marshall in July of last year—on the morning of August 17th Mr. Marshall gave me some instructions, Drummond, a fellow employee, being present at the time—at 11 a.m. I saw the prisoner at the office; he was shown into Mr. Marshall's room—I then called to Drummond and went to the door of the room and listened to the conversation from within—I heard the prisoner say, "I was dining at Buckingham Gate last night, and I passed by the house twice; it looks very dull"—he mentioned the address of the house as 15, Chapel Street—Mr. Marshall said, "I have been thinking over what you said to me. Is there no other way out of it, Mr. Watt?" and the prisoner said, "No, no other way, only to snuff her out"—Mr. Marshall said, "How do you propose to do it?" and the prisoner said, "You induce her to come up to my house; we can talk over the post cards. You can help me get her downstairs. I can do the job with the chloroform. When all is over we can send for Dr. Blake, who will certify death from heart disease, and then I shall give you £5,000"—Mr. Marshall said, "Have you spoken to Dr. Blake about this, Mr. Watt?" and the prisoner said, "Yes, I have, but he says that he cannot do it and that I must not do it; I must not do it; I must get a strange man. You can get Maloney to take her discharge and come to my house, and she can assist us in the matter"—Mr. Marshall then said. "Very well, Mr. Watt, give me twenty-four hours to think it over"—I heard a movement inside and we both of us came from the door very quickly—shortly after, the prisoner came out and left the offices—Mr. Marshall came out almost immediately after<lb/>wards—coming out he said to the office boy, "I am going to Scotland Yard"—he did not say a word to me with reference to what had taken place in the room, or to Drummond either—after he left I sat down and made notes of what I had heard—I told Drummond to go into another room [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I placed myself in a standing-up position against the door, and I saw Drummond go down on his knees to listen at the bottom of the door—neither of us have ever been asked to do this sort of thing before—I made notes in my own room just adjoining—I made no rough notes at all at the door—Mr. Marshall could not have said that I made out notes which have been destroyed or which were lost and that I only had a report—Drummond made notes also, but not at the door—I saw him writing it and I saw it there after he left—I did not see what became of it when Sergeant Fowler came; I left almost immediately with them—Drummond did not go to Marlborough Street—I said at the Police Court, "Drummond made out one. Drummond handed his written report to Ser<lb/>geant Fowler. I saw Drummond's report lying on the desk, but did not read it"—it must have been a week later that Drummond handed that report to Sergeant Fowler; it was not that morning—I did not mean to convey that he handed it to Sergeant Fowler that morning—I heard the prisoner getting off his chair, so I hurriedly went away from the door—a minute might have elapsed from the time I left the door before he came out; more conversation had taken place, no doubt, because I could hear talking, but I could not understand it, having come away from the door—the last thing I heard was, "Well, give me twenty-four hours to think it over"—I am quite sure that I heard "Dr, Blake" and no Christian name—I did not hear any expression about getting Mrs. Watt cremated—I think I must say I omitted to put in that I heard about pouring essence of peppermint between her teeth; it occurs to me that I did hear that—I will rot swear I heard it; I have some slight recollection that it was said; I want to be as careful as I can—I have read in the papers that the prisoner did say that, but I do not wish to swear to it myself—there is not a word about it either in my evidence at the Police Court, or here, nor about giving her a push—I did not hear anything about the curtains looking dirty—the prisoner was there about five minutes—after leaving the police I went to Slater's, being with them a year and eight months; I left when the trouble commenced, or was on—I cannot swear whether I went downstairs between the time of the prisoner going away and Mr. Marshall coming back with Fowler and Ball—I was there when they came back—if I had gone out, I had returned—the prisoner came at a minute or two to 11—I did not go out at the same time as Mr. Marshall—I cannot remember whether I went out afterwards—soon after 11 I generally go out to have a little refreshment, but I do not remember—I received a telephone message from the prisoner about 12, or after—I cannot say the time—it was to the effect that we were to send in our account, as he was going into the country—he asked me if Mr. Marshall was there—I said, "No," and he said, "When</p>

               <p>he comes back tell him to send in his bill at once, as I am going away in the country this afternoon"—the office is on the second floor—the prisoner had gone down the stairs before Mr. Marshall came out of the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner left about 11.5, and Mr. Marshall came out one or two minutes afterwards in just enough time for the prisoner to get down the stairs—I cannot say whether the prisoner went away in a cab or walked—I do not know whether he telephoned from home or some-where else—it would be about noon when he telephoned; that is as near as I can fix it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Drummond's deposition, read</hi>): Henry Drummond, on oath, saith as follows:—"Of 96, Hollis Street, Dalston, clerk, employed by Messrs. Sweeney &amp; Marshall, 5, Regent Street. I know the firm was engaged on some inquiries of defendant, whom I knew at the office as "the Captain." On the morning of August 17th Marshall gave me certain instructions. Later on that morning defendant came to the office. He got there about 11 a.m. He was shown into Mr. Marshall's room. The door was shut. I laid on the floor and listened beneath the door. McKenna stood at the door and listened. I heard defendant com<lb/>mence the conversation by saying that he had been dining out at Bucking<lb/>ham Gate and that he had passed by the front of the house twice and the front looked very dull and dirty. Marshall said, 'I have been thinking over what you have said; don't you think there is some way out of it?' Mr. Watt said, 'The only way is to snuff her out.' Mr. Marshall asked Mr. Watt in what way he proposed to do it. Mr. Watt said, 'You must induce her to my house; I will speak to her about some post cards. You can then help her to the room and I will finish the job with some chloro<lb/>form on a pocket handkerchief.' Mr. Watt also stated that he could then call in Dr. Blake. Mr. Marshall asked Mr. Watt if he mentioned the matter to Dr. Blake before and Mr. Watt said, "Yes, but the doctor said neither I nor he (the doctor) must do it; it must be done by some other man. He then said, 'When all is over I will pay you £5,000. He said Mr. Marshall must get Miss Maloney to take her discharge and get her to my house and she can assist us. Mr. Marshall said, 'Very well, you must give me twenty-four hours' notice to think this over.' That is all I heard. I thought the conversation then ended and I moved from the door, so did McKenna. I moved to a separate room and wrote out my statement; I had been instructed by Mr. McKenna to make notes. I did not see either de<lb/>fendant or Mr. Marshall leave. Later on two police officers came to the office, with Marshall, about 2 p.m., I believe. I had finished my notes. McKenna did not see it; Marshall did not see it until the Friday. I handed it to the police officers on Saturday when they came for it. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not give my report to the police officers on Thursday because I was not asked for it. I did not leave it lying on my desk; McKenna could not see it. If he said he did, that is not accurate; I carried it in my pocket until the Saturday. Marshall did not ask me for my report when he returned; I told him I had made one. This case was in Court on Friday before I produced my report. I had seen and read the</p>

               <p>case in the newspapers before I produced my report. I have been with Marshall since fourteen years of age. I am clerk. I am employed on 'Confidential Inquiries' when we are a bit busy and pushed. I listened at the door, lying flat on my stomach. This is the first time I have been so employed; we have never had a case like this before in the office. I did not at any time see McKenna's report and have not seen it now. Marshall told me that defendant had made a proposition, but did not tell me what it was. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My report was ready at 2 p.m. on the Thursday and I handed it to the police the first time they asked me on the Saturday.

Do you want to speak to him?"—he said, "Yes, send Mr. Watt to the telephone"—I handed the receiver to the prisoner—at first he refused to take it—he asked me who was there and I told him—after a bit he took it from me and he held a conversation through the telephone—I think it was Mr. O'Malley at the other end—I heard what the prisoner said—after the conversation was over he had a few seconds' conversation with me, and he walked up and down the hall—he stayed a few minutes at the front door and after a bit went away—I saw nothing more of him until at Marlborough Street—his manner that morning was very excited.</p>

McKenna: 'All right, see the thing through watt does no count for much; besides, look at the advertisement.' Marshall: 'Finish that statement you commenced yesterday, but be sure to keep a copy for me and Drummond or we are done.' McKenna: 'Do you want me to finish it now?' Marshall: 'Of course we must not make a (mess of this job or Watt will paralyse us. Back shortly.

               <p>letter from the prisoner and came to London on the Friday—I cannot think of the date, September 15th, 16th, or 17th—I brought with me the little pencil memorandum of the address which he had given me—it was in my little bag—I had got all the letters with me, but rather than open my bag in the street I asked a policeman which was the right number of the prisoner's house—I then went to 72, Knightsbridge—they there said that Mr. Watt had gone out, but would be back at 4.30—it was then 3.30—I went back at 4.30—the prisoner opened the door himself and said, "I am afraid I have asked you up to London a bit too soon"—I had told him I had come in answer to his letter—he asked me inside and took me into a room on the left—he there introduced me to Lady Violet—he said he was expecting Rufus Isaacs, the King's counsellor, to come in any minute—at that time it was told me about the detectives having gone to arrest Mr. Watt and knocking Lady Violet down in the passage—Lady Violet received me all right, shook hands and told me she was pleased to see me—she mentioned the King's name and the Duke of Fife's, and that she was cousin to the Duke—whilst this conversation was going on the bell rang—the prisoner went to the door and returned with a gentleman who, he said, was Rufus Isaacs, but who I know now was not—I have since found out that he was Bernard Abrahams—I picked out his photograph in prison—I identify this photograph as his—I was introduced to him—the prisoner said that I was the party that had arranged to give evidence, or words to that effect—"Rufus Isaacs" said that he was arranging to get the case hushed up on behalf of the Treasury—it was said that I was to get £5,000 for giving evidence and that it would be a good thing for my wife and family—I said it would—they said they would give me a berth under the Government, of a Government character—I have now got the situation in prison—the prisoner said that he had a large fruiterer's business, with sixteen hands employed, that it was about fifteen to twenty minutes' walk from his house in the West End, and that if I did not get this other appointment he would hand this over to me if I was used to it—soon after this "Lord Kinloch" came in—there were then present Lady Violet, "Lord Kin<lb/>loch," "Rufus Isaacs," Mr. Watt, and myself—we had dinner together at 6.30 in the house—there was a lot of conversation before dinner and the King's name was again mentioned—I dined three times in the house and once in Sloane Street—we had pie for dinner and hard-boiled eggs, sliced—the prisoner brought the pie in himself—there was conversation at dinner about the case—it was never anything else—Abrahams took me in hand, and started to tell me what to do—he told me to get this evidence off by heart, that he was arranging with the Treasury—of course it was always pretty much the same thing, but they impressed upon me that it was the Treasury and the King who wanted the case settled—that was to blind me—Abrahams said he could not take the case himself, as he had too much to do, but he would arrange for someone from the Treasury to come and take it—he said there were very few who would know about it, just Mr. Kennedy, the Magistrate, himself, of course, Lady Violet and the prisoner—he told me on no account to say</p>

               <p>much to Mr. Freke Palmer, as he had not confidence in him, that Mr. Palmer was sure to speak it about aloud, that he was a windbag and could not keep a secret, that all Mr. Palmer wanted was money, and that he had already asked him for £100—they said they had engaged a leading counsel from the Treasury; Mr. Muir they expected would take the case in hand, as he was one of the leading counsel of the Treasury—I believed the whole story—during this evening both Lady Violet and the prisoner told me what had been the effect of the detective's violence on Lady Violet, that she had had a miscarriage, which had prevented him from having a son and heir—after dinner Lady Violet went off to bed, or said she was going to bed—that left me with the prisoner and Abrahams—I had any amount of wine, champagne it was, I expect—the prisoner took out of a sovereign purse five sovereigns and gave them to me—that night I got a registered letter and sent £4 home to my wife—Lady Violet and the prisoner offered to put me up that night in their house—I thought I would rather not; in fact, they offered to let me stay there altogether, but "Rufus Isaacs" thought it would be dangerous my being seen staying there—I left the house with the prisoner—we went through the Park and out of the gate, where I got on to an omnibus—he said he was going home—I stayed that night at Adams' Temperance Hotel, Gray's Inn Road, in the name of Kirtley—next day I returned to the prisoner's house at Knightsbridge—I saw him and Lady Violet—they said I had better go home again for a short while till things got arranged with the Treasury and they would send for me again—I told them I had got a four days' ticket from Thirsk—on that Saturday £5 was given me by the prisoner out of his sovereign case—I went home to Thirsk—the next thing that happened was that I received this telegram: "N. Battle, World's End, Sowerby, Thirsk, York. Can you be here 6 o'clock Thursday evening. Watt, 72, Knightsbridge"—the reply being paid, I replied that I would be there—I went for a drive and when I got back I found another telegram awaiting me, which said "Battle, World's End, Sowerby, Thirsk. If can come Wednesday do so. Will put you up. Watt"—I answered that by telegram and letter—on Wednesday, the 20th, I left Thirsk and came to London, arriving about 2—I went to the prisoner's house—Lady Violet, the prisoner, "Rufus Isaacs," and "Lord Kinloch" were there—they said that I would have to go to Mr. Palmer's office the next morning to go through a statement, about 10.30 or 11—I was told not to tell Mr. Palmer much about the letters or tele<lb/>grams; I was to keep them to myself; as it was practically arranged with Mr. Muir to take up the case, I was to say very little to Mr. Palmer—I was to tell Mr. Palmer that I had heard the story which was concocted at the Hotel—at the interview at the prisoner's house, both the prisoner and "Rufus Isaacs" asked me if I would let him (the prisoner) see Mr. Palmer's two letters—I let the prisoner see them and he kept them—Abrahams also asked to see the prisoner's first letter to me, which I showed him—he kept it—he also asked to see the statement, as he would like to go through it—he kept it, saying it was not necessary for me to keep it—I stayed At the prisoner's that evening to dinner—the party consisted of the</p>

               <p>prisoner, Lady Violet, and Bernard Abrahams—the dinner was as before—after it was over, Lady Violet retired—I was taken upstairs by the prisoner and Abrahams—£5 was given to me—they offered to put me up for the night—I said I would rather not stay there, and went back to the same hotel as before, in the same name—next morning, at 9.45, I went to the prisoner's by appointment arranged the night before, to go to Mr. Palmer's office—I went to the office with the prisoner and saw Mr. Palmer—he asked me a few questions about the statement, which I did not answer very well, as I had not got it off then—he then asked me if I had the original statement, that is the original note of the conversation—I said I had not it with me—I told him I would produce it later on—the prisoner gave me a wink—he was there all the time—Mr. Palmer said he would see me again next day at the Court—I wish to say that Mr. Palmer acted very honestly in this affair—that interview over, I left with the prisoner—we met Abrahams—the prisoner told me I had better get a statement ready, and Abrahams advised me to go into a stationer's shop two or three doors off Mr. Palmer's and write one out—they said I would be asked to produce it somewhere or other, at Court most likely, better have it ready—it was just as a matter of form, they said—they further said that I had made a mess of it with Mr. Palmer—I went to a little stationer's shop and bought a sheet of paper and an envelope—I asked the lady there if I might write something out—she said, "Yes"—I there wrote out in pencil a document and left the shop—I was shortly afterwards joined by the prisoner and Abrahams—I then noticed there was some fourth person near us—they said he was a detective from Scot<lb/>land Yard—he sometimes kept behind and sometimes passed us—when we got to an hotel to dine, Abrahams said, "Are we being shadowed?"—the so-called detective answered, "No, it's all right"—we all four, in<lb/>cluding the detective, went in and had luncheon—I said to Abrahams, "What is there to be afraid of being shadowed if this is all right?"—he replied, "He is just sent up by Scotland Yard to see that Mr. Watt is not annoyed"—the prisoner said, "That's quite right"—I also asked the detective if he was from Scotland Yard and he replied, "Yes"—I never heard his name or other description, but I could identify him out of a thousand—I was the only one who had dinner—they had drink—the prisoner and Abrahams asked me to show them the statement I had written out in the shop—they told me to put the time in the corner—this is the statement—I showed it to them, also the copy I copied it from—they handed it back to me—I left the public-house with the prisoner and Abrahams—they said that they expected the case would be finished the next day—they said that they had plenty of money to spend and that the detective would see that a certain witness would not appear to-morrow, as they were keeping him out of the road, as they had had him drunk for years—they called him "Nosey"—the prisoner said it did not matter what was spent—the others parted company and left me with the prisoner and with him I went through the Park to Hyde Park Corner, and then to Piccadilly Circus—from there he took me round to the right and pointed out Marshall &amp; McKenna's office—he told me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110118"/>
               <p>to take notice of the place and said I "might be asked something about it to-morrow"—he said he had better tell me what sort of weather it was on August 17th—he said it was only a matter of form he was telling me that, as the case was practically settled—he said it was a grey sort of morning—we walked about in the Park and he then said he had to go to the bank for some money—I waited for him—when he returned he asked me was I satisfied that the case was all right on behalf of the Treasury—I said, "Yes, it seemed all right"—he said, "I will convince you; we will go down to Mr. Muir's office, the Treasury office. I am going to see Mr. Muir there"—we got into a cab and went down to the Strand—he took me down an archway and said that it was the Treasury office—he showed me a lot of offices and said he was going in to see Mr. Muir—I waited for him for about forty-five minutes—when he cam back he said Mr. Muir would appear in the morning for him or for the Treasury and the case would be finished—we went back to his house and I there saw Lady Violet and Abrahams, who went over the statement with me and told me I should have to get it thoroughly off—he asked me a few questions likely to be asked me the next day, where I had stopped the night before, the time, and the weather—I went over my statement five or six times—then I went over it with the prisoner after that—it was said that I had stopped the night before the 17th at Paris and to get my evidence taken I was to say I was going to Canada—before I left that night it was arranged that I should be at the prisoner's the next morning at 9 o'clock—I went back to the same hotel—next morning I went to the prisoner's and there saw Lady Violet, the prisoner, and his secretary, who was also said to be the manager of the fruiterer's shop and who collected rents—I begged the prisoner to tell me if it was all correct what he had told me—he said, "Yes, a good thing for you and your wife and family; it will put you on your feet"—I drove with the prisoner and his secretary to the Court—when near there the prisoner said, "I think another drink will do you good; you seem to be nervous"—he took me to an hotel opposite the Court and gave me a glass of brandy—we went to the Court and the prisoner pointed out that Mr. Muir was there and said, "Now it is all right; there is Mr. Muir"—my name was called as a witness and I got into the box and am sorry to say I gave evidence which was taken down [<hi rend="italic">The witness's depositions were then read</hi>]—my evidence having been given, I returned to 72, Knightsbridge, and there had some conversation with Lady Violet—half an hour after I went out with the prisoner and Lady Violet down Sloane Street to a dining-room about 6.30 and there had some dinner—the meal for the three cost 18s. 6d.—during the meal Lady Violet said to me she knew I had been in the box, because a telegram had been sent to her—she said, "It was just signed 'Scotland Yard'; there has also been one sent to the King in the same way"—the prisoner said the case was remanded for a week—I said that was strange, and I was beginning to get frightened then—I said I thought they had made a mess of me; it seemed like it, as Mr. Kennedy had said that if Mr. Watt annoyed anybody in the meantime he would be arrested—I did not hear the Magistrate say that, but I heard</p>

               <p>the prisoner repeat it—Lady Violet at the dinner drank rather a good drop and had to leave the table and go home—after she left, the prisoner and I went to Victoria Station—the prisoner bought a paper, and we saw in it the Magistrate's remark about molesting the witnesses—I began then to complain, saying I thought he had made a victim of me—he said, "Mr. Kennedy must have been in a hurry to-day to get away; it will be finished next week"—I then got on to him about the money—he said, "You will get it next week when the case is finished"—I said, "What about the £5,000 you promised me; it looks as though it is not correct what you told me"—he said, "Oh, you will get your £5,000 when the case is finished"—he was a little bit drunk—we walked towards Hyde Park Corner and pointing in the direction of some houses the prisoner said, "Mrs. Watt lives along there"—on the way back to Knightsbridge he said frightful things about Mrs. Watt, "that she ought to be mown off the earth, Sir Reginald as well," that she was a bad character and that he picked her up off the streets—he said that he had said such a thing to Marshall, as Marshall says, but never really meant it—he also said that Sir Reginald Beauchamp was very "dicky" on his legs and he could soon be settled; it would be a charity to put him out of the road—before I left him that night he said that he expected to get "time" for it; that he had slept in the backwoods of Australia and out in the open air with nothing but the sky above him for shelter and he thought he could do a few months—I said it was serious and I complained generally—I said I would go to Scotland Yard and give myself up, as I found I had been made a victim of—he begged of me to put it off for another week and told me he would talk to me in the morning—I went to his house early next morning—I there saw him and Lady Violet—we had a bit of a row—I told him I was going to tell all about the case, what they had done to me, deceived me, and I would go down to Scotland Yard—he again begged of me not to do that, said he would give me a good handsome cheque besides the £5,000 if I would only keep quiet till the case was settled—they expected that the case would be settled that morning—they gave me £5 and I left—that afternoon I went home and told my wife all about it and decided that I would give information—I got a witness summons and went back with the officer who served it—at Marlborough Street I went into the witness box and made my statement on oath—the first statement I made on August 17th was false; it was the statement that had been drawn up for me.</p>

               <p>any papers to Mr. Freke Palmer at all—I swear I gave it up at the Court when I gave my evidence for the first time; I think so—I gave it up one of the two times; I am not certain which; I fancy myself it was on the 22nd; I made it out on the 21st—I cannot remember giving it to Mr. Freke Palmer; I gave it to the Magistrate or one of the officials—I do not say I did not give it to Mr. Freke Palmer; he may have asked me for it—I gave it to someone in Court—if I knew that I gave it to Mr. Freke Palmer, I would tell you—in August this year I was dealing in cattle and I had a little poultry farm at Thirsk, Sowerby, Yorkshire—I lived at a little place just at the bottom of Sowerby—I had a field, a little orchard, a big garden, a cottage, a stable, a pony and trap, and 100 head of poultry and a horse at that time—I have bought and sold pigs and several things; I make my living at it—I have done nothing else this year, but I did a little bit now and again last year—the latter part of last year I was doing very much the same thing, and in the early part working at my printing trade—that is the trade I served my apprenticeship at, but I have not worked at it for some time—I have worked at it on and off this last few years—I worked fifteen years in one place, rising to head composi<lb/>tor at a head wage—I am forty-two, my birthday being the day I was sentenced—I gave up my berth five or six years ago—as near as I can tell you the last time I earned any money at printing was a year ago—a year ago I passed in the name of Kirtley, because my father was editor of a newspaper and I did not want the people where I worked to think that I had been better off and had come down to work for a small wage—I was in Paris and St. Cloud in January this year for a few weeks—I never did anything while I was there; I lived on what I had—I made a little bit of money gambling—I did not go to Paris altogether to gamble, but that is practically why I went—I only gambled a little in a little street near the Vendome—I made bets; I did not gamble—that is why I went to Paris—I went with a gentleman; I cannot think of his name now—I will tell you, if I think of his name and address—he said he was a photographer from London—I have met him in London—all I know about London is my way from Victoria Station to King's Cross by Piccadilly and Regent Street—I met him by arrangement at King's Cross—he induced me to go over to Paris on the Baltic Fleet Commission, the inquiry about the Russians firing into the Baltic Fleet—I know a bit about the River Humber, and I went there as a witness, but I was never called upon—this gentleman was engaged by the Government to gather up evidence—I am telling you what I went to Paris for as I go along—I stayed at the Rue d' Amsterdam, this gentleman paying part of my expenses and I pay<lb/>ing part—the house I stayed at used to be called "Fox's"; I do not know what they call it now; it goes by the name of "Fox's Hotel"; it is still on the window, "Austin Fox's," but that is not the proprietor—I was very successful in my betting; I was there seven or eight weeks, getting about £200 or £300—it was more in February than January when I did the betting on steeplechasing, at little bits of meetings—I did not lay against horses at all—this was my first experience of Paris—I said at the Police Court that "Austin Fox's" was the name of the hotel</p>

               <p>I should like to see you on the matter and will communicate with you again shortly if you will keep me informed of your whereabouts"—I am quite certain that I did not send the statement until after that letter was written in the post office; I cannot give the date when I sent the statement, but I know I sent it by itself without any letter—I swear my statement dated August 29th was not enclosed in the letter of the 29th—on September 21st I was at Mr. Palmer's office—I think he started by saying that it was no use my making any statements which would not stand inquiry; he did all right; he did his best—the prisoner winked at me as much as to say, "Take no notice"—I was sitting on a chair inside the door and the prisoner and Mr. Freke Palmer were facing us both—Mr. Freke Palmer questioned me closely upon my statement; he cross-examined me—I did all I knew to make him believe in the prisoner's presence that it was true—at the instigation of the prisoner I told Mr. Freke Palmer that I had a note of the conversation I had overheard—I did not repent immediately after I had given my evidence on September 22nd; I repented the same day—when I was at King's Cross I was very much upset; one minute I was going down to Scotland Yard and the next minute I wondered whether I should not go and tell my wife all about it—being at King's Cross, I thought I would go home—I went to see a friend, to go with me to Scotland Yard previous to that—about three or four weeks after, the police served a notice on me requiring me to go back with them—I remained at home making arrangements for my wife and family—I knew I was going to be locked up, because I intended to plead guilty—I told my wife that the very first day I got to the Court I was going to tell all about it—I came back quite voluntarily; I always meant to do so—I met Sergeant Ball coming up the road—I think he said, "You are Battle" first—I did not hesitate—the officer went on to say, "You are the man who attended Marlborough Street Police Court on September 22nd on the hearing of the case against Mr. Watt," and I acknowledged it—he told me he was directed to serve a summons on me for my attendance at the Marlborough Street Police Court the next day—I said I could not come, as it was too short a notice; I said I had just got a letter to go to Leeds to-morrow and it was very awkward, but I would come—the officer may have said, "You must come, "and I said, "If I must come to-morrow, I must"—he told me he could not bring me—I gave in evidence yesterday a number of things which I never said at Marlborough Street Police Court, but I had not the chance"—I did not say a word about the prisoner saying that he expected he would do time, and that as he had slept in the back woods of Australia he thought he could manage a few months; I simply answered the questions that I was asked—I asked to make a statement at the Assizes, but I was not allowed—I wanted to make a statement before I was sentenced, but they would not allow me a barrister—I had given just an outline of my evidence to Sergeant Fowler before I gave my evidence at Marlborough Street on the second occasion—I was not asked for all; I was not in a position to give all; I was too cut up—I told a lot of it to Sergeant Ball in the train—I think I told Sergeant Fowler about the prisoner alluding to doing time—I should like to explain why I did not</p>

               <p>give a lull account of it—we rushed into Court and I pleaded guilty in less than five minutes—I think I was in the witness-box about three-quarters of an hour—on one occasion, when I was at the prisoner's house, the man who called himself 'Rufus Isaacs "had a conversation with the prisoner in a language which I took to be French—I cannot speak French; I know a few words like "Oui, oui"—your suggestion that my first communica<lb/>tion with the prisoner either verbal or written was the letter on August 27th is wrong, and that the first time I ever saw him to speak to was Sep<lb/>tember 16th, <hi rend="italic">bar</hi> seeing him in the park—I asked a policeman the number of the prisoner's house—at that time I think I had a piece of paper with his address in my bag with my letters—I knew I was going to Knights-bridge and I did not look in my bag—I knew the number, but it had slipped my memory—I did not open the bag, because I did not want to stand I the middle of a crowd with a bag open—I may have said to Sergeant Fowler that I had omitted to bring his address with me—I appreciate the fact that if I asked a policeman it looked as if I did not know the address—when I wrote on August 27th saying," Not knowing your correct address," I had mislaid the little bit of paper—on September 16th, when I saw the prisoner, I did not say, "My name is Battle "or "I wrote to you," and he did not say, "You must see my solicitor"—I did not say, "I have come from Edinburgh to help you, and return to-night. I sent your solicitor a statement about three weeks ago. May I show you a copy?"; that is nonsense—I do not think that he and Lady Violet read over a copy of my statement to me, nor did the prisoner say, "Is it true?"and I did not reply, "Yes, every word of it"—I did not say I was hungry—I had dinner behind the cellar kitchen, where they dine—they told me their dinners were sent in always; I do not think they have any servants to cook any dinner; I don't think they have anybody except a general cleaner, who comes to clean up—whatever I eat they told me was fetched from outside—the prisoner did not say before I left, "I do not think your evidence can be taken until the case for the prosecution is closed, but I shall as my solicitor to let you know"—the motive which is influencing me in coming forward and giving evidence in this case is that I have done wrong and I wish to put things right in the interests of truth and justice and to let my friends in the North see bow I have been taken down by the prisoner—I have never been offered any advantage—if the prisoner says that on September 16th I said, "I am only coming forward in the interests of truth and justice," he knows well enough that he is talking rubbish—I did not, suggest to him he might pay my expenses; he gave me £5 freely—I never told him I came from Edinburgh—never at any time did I tell Mr. Palmer that I was in a good way of business in Yorkshire and my character would bear every investigation—the prisoner never gave me more than £5 at once; I had altogether from him £20—I have not yet remembered the name of the photographer who took me over to Paris—if I had been called as a witness I should have appeared as "Lightfoot"—I was staying in Paris in the name of" Kirtley "because I was used to it.</p>

Battle "and dated August 26th, 1905 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on my way to London in the train I made a statement to Sergeant Ball—I think he put a little bit down in a book, but not all of it—before I was sentenced in this Court I wished to have a counsel, so that I could explain the reason I had committed perjury—they said I had pleaded guilty and could not have one—I started to make a statement, but I thought I was wasting the time of the Court, and that I was doing wrong by making it then, and I stopped—it was arranged that I should write the letter of August 27th to deceive Mr. Freke Palmer—I want to write down the principal reason for my committing perjury for my own sake—I am very anxious to do it—it explains everything; it is most serious.

                  </hi>. I am now living at 32, East Street, Theobald's Road, and am a newsagent—for about ten years I had a newspaper stall outside the Hyde Park Hotel at Knightsbridge—I supplied the prisoner with newspapers—his house was two doors away from my stall—I saw Lady Violet occasionally—I used occasionally to go errands for her—I went about August, 1902, for her to a firm of solicitors at Oxford Circus—the same day, after I returned, the prisoner came to me and said, "Would you like to earn some more money?"—I said, "I don't mind, if I have the time and if it is in my way"—he said, "Will you meet me at 3 o'clock in Hyde Park at the back of my house?"—I said, "Yes"—I met him—he said to me, "You seem to be a fellow able to give a good account of yourself"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "You would not be afraid to strike anybody"—I said, "If anybody interfered with me I should try to interfere with them back again"—he said, "I mean this: I have had a woman following me about for a long time; she has had large sums of money from me and I intend to put a stop to it. I want you to go to White Hall (or White House) at Hampton Court and say you are an old servant named Howes, ask her to come out, and when she comes, give her a blow in the stomach as her inside is in a bad con<lb/>dition, and I will give you £10 for that—I said, "I do not care about" doing anything of that, as I have never done such a thing before"—he talked for a little while and then said, "In the course of your travels you meet with a lot of rough fellows"—I said, "Yes, I meet with all sorts"—he said, "Do you think you could get me two or three chaps; take them down there, give them about 5s. a piece and keep the rest for yourself"—I said, "I'd sooner not do anything like that, as it might get me into trouble"—he said, "You are missing a fine thing; she always carries about £70 or £80 worth of jewellery. It is <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> done; you can entice her to the river, which runs close by, you can give her a blow and clear, out and be done with it"—I said, "I don't care about doing anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110129"/>
               <p>of that"—he said, "Here is £5; take that and do the best you can. I will meet you to-morrow and if it is done I will give you another £5"—he gave me a stick that afternoon, saying, "Take this; if you cannot hit her hard enough give her a blow with this"—I took his stick—he told me the name of the woman was Seelieg—next morning he came to my stall and said, "How did you get on?"—I said, "Well, I sent <hi rend="italic">them</hi> fellows and when they got there they said that Mrs. Seelieg was not staying there "—after a while, having walked about and considered, he came back and said, "No, I think <hi rend="italic">them</hi> fellows have twisted you; they have not been there at all"—as a matter of fact, they had not been and I had no intention of sending any—after that I had to shift my business, on account of building operations, and secured a portion as a newspaper carrier on a bicycle—the prisoner had asked me for my name and address, and he wrote me a letter asking me to meet him—the letter is destroyed—I would have kept it if I had known this case was coming on—I was to meet him at 3 o'clock at the same place, but I never kept the appointment—some time after that as I was riding my bicycle I met him—he asked me how I was going on—I said, "Oh, very well"—he said, "Take this sovereign; I want you to go to the Howard Hotel, Norfolk Street, or to Courtfield Gardens, and find out if Mrs. Watt is staying there"—I was to let him know—I did not go at all—I again met him—he asked me, "Is she staying there?"—I said No"—I had not been to inquire—he said, "That is a d—nuisance. I shall have to put the private detectives on her track, and they are rather expensive; they cost £1 a day"—I left him and was to meet him on a future occasion when he found out where Mrs. Watt was staying—he said it would not do for me to be seen talking to him so often at the back of his house, he would meet me in the Green Park—I met him later on and he said he had found out that Mrs. Watt was staying at the Howard Hotel, in Norfolk Street, in the name of Watt—he said to me, "Have you still got that stick?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I want you to stop about there; watch your chance, if you see her to run into her, then give her a severe blow in the stomach and knock her down"—I said, "They might have me up for doing some robbery or violence to her; I would rather have nothing to do with that"—then after a little while he said, "Don't you think it would be a good idea if you were to hang about there with your bicycle, watch your chance as she is crossing the road to run into her and knock her down; I will give you £1 a week while hanging about on your bicycle; £50 if you knock her down and give her a severe blow, £100 if it leads to something else"—I found that "something else" meant if I killed her, so I said, "I will see what I can do"—I never troubled further—I was to make an appointment to let him know how I was going on—I did nothing—I saw him again some two or three days afterwards in Green Park—he said to me, "It is very funny; I have been to this place two or three times during yesterday and the day before and I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you"—I said, "Very likely, as I was riding about on my bike"—as it was cold, of course I was riding about—he said, "You will have to keep a closer watch; besides, it is essential that something should be done. I will tell you what I will do now: I will give you £1 a week while</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110130"/>
               <p>you are hanging about, £50 if you hurt her, and another £100 and £1 a week for life if you kill her, and I want this done as quickly as possible "—I had to make another appointment—I never troubled about waiting about the hotel—I met him—he gave me a sovereign occasionally and sometimes £2, but that was towards the end—he had said to me, "It is essential that something must be done; as soon as you write me the letter that you have knocked her down, put down in it the word "Done' and I will meet you and give you the £50"—I was not to put anything else in the letter and I was to address it simply "Mr. Watt"—this was about October, 1902—his address, I believe, was then 20, Albert Gate, but I think they have altered it to another name now—he said as soon as he received the letter he would meet me the same evening and give me £50—he met me the same evening and gave me a little bag with £10 in gold in it, saying," Take this £10; if I find out that she is seriously hurt I will give you the other £100"—he said, "Did you knock her down? Did you seriously hurt her?"—I said, "I did not stop to see, as I rode away"—he had said to me, "Don't stop to see; ride away if you can, then they won't make much inquiries, take not much notice of it"—two days after that he said he would go and find out how Mrs. Watt was—I met him two nights after that—he said, u I cannot make it out; I have been and inquired. Mrs. Watt is not confined to her room, and she is able to go out; this seems very funny. Did you really give her a severe hurt?"—I said, "I did not trouble to see"—he said, "Perhaps you knocked the wrong woman down"—I said, "Perhaps I have"—he said, "I want you to take this photograph. Of course you must not go by that too much; she is much stouter now. Study the features well and you will recognise Mrs. Watt by that"—I took the photograph—he said, "Don't you think it would be a fine thing if you were to dress yourself up really smart, go to the Howard Hotel, take rooms and watch your chance to get into Mrs. Watt's room, give her a blow and chloroform her; I can get the chloroform for you to give her when you have done it!"—I said, "I don't much like to have anything to do with it"—he said, "I have been good to you; do you think you can find me a man who has done manslaughter or something of that?"—I then thought of a man I had seen hanging about—I said, "I will do my best to see if I can find you a man"—when I found him I was to fetch him to Green Park, the same place where I had been meeting him—I knew the man I meant as "Nosey"; I did not know his real name—I saw "Nosey" after this conversation and took him to meet the prisoner—the prisoner said, "Is this the man?"—I said, "Yes, this is the man"—he said to "Nosey," "Have you done any time?" or something of that—" Nosey" told him he had—he said to him, "It is like this here; what name shall I call you?"—" Nosey" said, "Call me 'Jim'"—the prisoner said, "Well, Jim, I want you to go to the Howard Hotel, take rooms there and watch your chance; get into Mrs. Watt's room, give her a blow and chloroform her. It can be done, by getting all right with the housemaid and giving her a present. Watch your chance, secrete yourself in her room and give her a blow and chloroform her"—" Nosey" said, "Very well"—he gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110131"/>
               <p>"Nosey"£5 to go there to take the rooms and buy some clothes—the prisoner further said, "Shall I get the chloroform—I believe "Nosey" said, "Well, I will get it"—I did not listen to all their conversation; I left them together—out of the £5 given him, "Nosey" gave me £2 10s.—it was arranged that "Nosey" was to come again two days after to let him know how he was going on—we met the prisoner, who asked "Nosey" how he was going on—"Nosey" said 'Mrs. Watt was not staying there, she had gone to Harrogate'—the prisoner said, "The best thing you can do is to go to Harrogate, find out where she is; she generally stays at the Prince of Wales Hotel, Harrogate"—they had some more conversation after that, which I did not hear—the finish of it was that we had to meet the prisoner again two nights afterwards—we met him and he said, "I don't want <hi rend="italic">no</hi> more to do with this man; he is a liar and a scamp. She has not been to Harrogate at all"—he gave "Nosey" a sovereign that evening and "Nosey" went off—I did not see him again for eighteen months—the prisoner said that neither "Nosey" nor Mrs. Watt had been to Harrogate; as a matter of fact; Mrs. Watt was still staying at the Norfolk Hotel—I met the prisoner again after that—he said to me, "We had best let Mrs. Watt drop for a while"—he said at some time that he believed she had gone to Ascot House, Ascot; would I go down on my bike and find out if she was stay<lb/>ing there?"If so, you will have a fine opportunity there, because there is nobody about. You can knock her about and then fall on her, jump on her, what you like; there will be nobody in sight"—I did not go to Ascot, but I met him two nights after to let him know how I was going on—that day it had been very muddy and I was in a rare state—he said "I can see what it is; you have had a bad journey"—I said, "Yes, I, have had a bad journey"—he said, "I don't suppose you will be sorry when you are at home"—he said, "Did you go to Ascot?"—I said, "I went to Ascot. I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> her there, and I don't think she is staying there"—he said, "I think we will let her drop for a while; I have got something else in hand"—I think he gave me £2 that night—this was somewhere about November, 1902—I had, I should think, about £50 altogether from the prisoner—I have not got any of his letters—I kept them at home in a drawer for some time and then they got thrown away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known "Nosey" at that time for about two years—I had been in his company once or twice—I did not know he had been convicted—I knew him as a man hanging about—I never knew him to interfere with anybody or cause anybody any bodily harm, and I thought he would be just the one to take to the prisoner—it was not our idea to get money out of the prisoner; if he liked to give it, he would; but if he did not, he would not—I thought we would get money, but not by telling lies; we did not think anything of that kind—I arranged with "Nosey" to divide anything we got—it would not have been honest to have done what the prisoner wanted—he came to me because I sold newspapers and thought I would do anything for him, but he found out his mistake—it was not an honest way of getting money out of the prisoner—I know now that "Nosey's" real name is Shuttle—I said at</p>

               <p>the Police Court that the reason I selected him was because he never had the heart to work for a living and never had the heart to thieve for a living—I cannot say how many times altogether I obtained money from the prisoner by telling lies, as sometimes I never told him any lies at all—he gave me the money to keep the meetings, and as I was not doing <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for it, I took his money—the biggest sum I received from him at one time was £10 and the smallest £1—I thought he meant what he was asking me to do—I never Mentioned the matter to anybody but Shuttle—the prisoner had no character from me as to whether I was a betting man or addicted to violence—he did not ask me if I was pre<lb/>pared to assault anyone or willing to do so if paid for it—for all he knew, I might have gone straight away to a policeman and told him about it, but he was a man of position and a Member of Parliament, and I simply sold newspapers, and he might have got somebody to say different to me and nobody would have believed me—I never did inform the police; they came to me while I was at work, after the prisoner was charged—I am quit sure the prisoner gave me the stick on the first occasion I met him—it is lost—it was an ordinary dark brownish walking-stick, with a very heavy knobbly head—I do not remember saying at the Police Court about" running straight into her and giving her a blow with the stick in the stomach"—these things occurred three years ago, and I have had to think of all this by memory—on one or two occasions I took news-papers to the prisoner's house; he would ask me to leave them and I pushed them under the door—I do not know whether he was well known as living in the neighbourhood—he gave no reason for telling me to write him as "Mr. Watt," except that it might be noticeable—I say that having said "Nosey" was a liar and a scamp, he gave him a sovereign—" Nosey" was to write me a letter pretending he had been to Harrogate, but I do not remember receiving one—if you like, you can put it that it was for the mere purpose of obtaining money from the prisoner by false pretences—it was to show that he had been there when he had not gone.</p>

               <p>is a woman staying there in the name of Mrs. Watt. Here is £5. Get some chloroform, buy a jemmy and stay there. You can square the chambermaid to get the number of her room"—I said, "All right"—he gave me the number of her room as well, but I cannot recollect now what it was—he said, as regards the chloroform, "Put it in a handkerchief and hold it over her nose," and I said, "All right"—it was not the fact that I had done a term of imprisonment for killing a woman—as regards the jemmy, he said, "You want to burst open the door with the jimmy to get into the room. You can easily buy one"—he gave me £5 and said if I wanted any more money I was to let Worley know—Worley was stand<lb/>ing a few yards away, not within hearing distance—that was all that passed between us on that occasion—he walked away and left us and I joined Worley and gave him £2 10s. out of the £5—the next day I saw Worley and had a conversation with him and on the Saturday night follow<lb/>ing that we went again to Green Park, where we again saw the prisoner—I told him Mrs. Watt had gone to Harrogate"—he said, "She will stay at the Prince of Wales Hotel, Harrogate. Why do not you follow her?"—I said I had no more money, and he then gave me another £5 in gold—he then left us and I divided the £5 with Worley again—shortly after I went to Euston and gave a letter to the guard to be posted by him at Harrogate to Worley, so he could show it to the prisoner—I never went to Harrogate—I afterwards ascertained from Worley that that letter was Bent to him—shortly after that I saw the prisoner in company with a lady at Albert Gate, Knightsbridge—he did not speak to me; he looked at me—on the same day I saw Worley, and after that he and I saw the prisoner in Green Park at 6 p.m. on a Saturday—he spoke to Worley first—he said to me, "You are a liar; you have not been to Harrogate. I have had a private detective and proved she has not left London, and I shall not give you any more money until you have done the job. Go and stay at the hotel at once"—I said, "I have got no money," and he gave me a sovereign"—that was all the conversation—I kept the whole of that sovereign—I did not go to the hotel—he mentioned the name of it, but I forget it; it was the same hotel as before; she was still staying there—I did not see the prisoner till about the beginning of January, 1904—I went then to Walham Green to see Worley—I had a conversation with him and as a result of that I went to the prisoner's house, 20, Albert Gate, at 6 p.m.—he opened the door—I said, "Tom sent me. You want a job done"—he said, "Walk towards Hyde Park and I will be out in a minute"—I walked towards Hyde Park and after a short time the pri<lb/>soner joined me—he said, "What shall I call you?"—I said "Arthur'—he said, "Have you ever done time?"—I said, "I have just come out from doing five years for hitting a woman over the head with a bar of iron'—that was not true at all—he did not seem to recognise me in the least—he said, "There is a woman living at 15, Chapel Street, name of Mrs. Watt. I want you to do her in for me"—he said Chapel Street was at Grosvenor Place—he told me to get some operating chloroform and he gave me 2s. and told me to go and have a steak, as he said I looked bad—he said, "I will meet you at 9 o'clock at Hobart Place, Victoria"—he said, "Come</p>

When you go and see her, say you are a brother of Howes, who used to be my valet at St. George's Square"—I knew Chapel Street to be in Grosvenor Place—he told me Howes was in the Army in India—I was to say I was out of employment and ask her if she could do any<lb/>thing for me—he made an appointment for 6 o'clock the next night between Wellington House and Stanhope Gate; he said, "I will be there at 6 o'clock every night until you have done the job"—I did not go to 15, Chapel Street—I kept the appointment next night and told him that I saw a servant coming out of the house to post a letter, and that I had asked her if she was posting it to her lover and that she had said that she was posting it to Prince of Wales Hotel, Harrogate, where her mistress was—that was an invention; I had not seen any servant—he said, "That was very clever of you. You had better go to Harrogate at once and take a friend with you"—he said, "Where will you do it: in the train of the hotel? Doing it in the hotel would be best. I will go and get you some money"—he went indoors and came out and gave me £6 in gold and told me to go to Harrogate at once and stay at the Prince of Wales Hotel—he told me to meet him between Stanhope Gate and Wellington House at 6 p.m.; he said he would be there every night till I came back"—I met a friend of mine named Harvey, who was a tailor out of employment—I took him to "Gardiner's, Knightsbridge, and I bought two overcoats and paid a guinea each for them—I never went to Harrogate—we then got into a cab and went to the Tivoli Music Hall—I next went to Mrs. Watt at 15, Chapel Street, with Harvey—I saw her and had some conversation with her—on the day following Harvey and I went to Mrs. Watt's solicitors, Messrs. Russell, and we made a statement there to Mr. O'Malley—this is my statement, which was taken down in writing and signed by me in the name of "James Howes "(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—we got 10s. each—Harvey made a statement, but he would not sign it—I saw the prisoner next between Wellington House and Stanhope Gate, but I did not speak to him—Harvey who was with me, spoke to him, and on coming back to me showed me a sovereign—on the night after I and Harvey were again in Hyde Park—I had given him an empty bottle labelled "Chloroform" which I got from a</p>

Watt; to whom addressed: "20, Albert Gate, Knightsbridge"—I having read the letter, it would in the ordinary course go to the Governor or Deputy Governor to "be initialled, and then it would be handed out to the officer to post—it is impossible to keep a record of the letters that are posted.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The last time I was in prison was May 27th, 1904—between that date and August 28th I made no attempt to see or com<lb/>municate with the prisoner—I have known Worley on and off for years knocking about Knightsbridge with his stall—I was looking for work; I was not loafing about the streets—I had not been in the habit of going to the same coffee house with Worley; I have been in a coffee house while he has been there, but not regularly—I never told him what I was doing for a living, and he never asked me—he never said he missed me during some of the times when I went to prison—I do not know that he thought I was quite a respectable member of society—he knew I had to get my living somehow—he might have known that I was making my living by thieving; I never made any disguise of it—for fifteen months I have been living an honest life—it was not through Worley that I went to see the prisoner in January, 1904; I went to Worley in 1904, and I asked him the gentleman's name and he said, "You know; it is Mr. Watson," as I understood him—up to that time I did not know his name—I asked Worley in 1902, and he would not tell me—if I had asked the prisoner his name he would not have told me; I did not ask him—in 1904 I understood his name was Watson until I had a look in the directory—I appreciate that this interview in 1904 is almost precisely the same as I had with the prisoner In 1902—at the conclusion of my evidence at the police Court on September 22nd after I had been speaking of the interviews in 1902, I concluded with, "That finished what I had to do with Mr. Watt and Tom"—that had no reference to my account of the interview in which I said I had been to Harrogate and the prisoner said that I was a liar and gave me a sovereign—that concluded my dealings with the prisoner—T kept the sovereign on that occasion—I had agreed to go halves with Worley, but I had all that sovereign—in January, 1904, I apparently was a complete stranger to him—he did not ask me who "Tom" was—I am sure "done in" was his expression; I knew that it meant murder—it might be an expression used by criminal classes—as to the chloroform, both in 1902 and 1904 he said, "The best thing to do her in with is to get some operating chloroform"—he did not ask me in 1902 how much the chloroform would cost—in 1904, on his inquiring, I am quite sure I said it might cost £5, or words to that effect—I said before the Magistrate that I said "15s. or a sovereign"—I said a sovereign to the best of my recollection—there was nothing about a jemmy in 1904—in 1902 he said I was to square the chambermaid so as to get into Mrs. Watt's room—I have said before the Magistrate that, in 1904, he asked me whether I was going to do it in the train or in the hotel when telling me to go to Harrogate—in 1902 he did not ask to see the chloroform And jemmy that I said I had bought—he trusted me implicitly and took my word as a gentleman—in 1904 I got some money from him, but I did not share it with Worley, as he had nothing to do with it then—I had</p>

               <p>nobody in 1904 with whom I shared the money—I gave Harvey a few shillings, but not much—I knew that Worley got the letter that I sent to Harrogate to be posted to him, because he showed it to me—I have not heard Worley say that he never received it—I do not know where Harvey is now—I do not think he does any stealing—his father has got plenty of money—he is twenty-six or twenty-seven—I saw him last in March this year, and I have not seen him since—in January, 1904, when we first went to Mrs. Watt's, we got half a sovereign each—my convictions began in 1894, my first being for stealing from my brother's house; the next in 1900, for stealing behind a bar, where I was employed as a barman; another for stealing from a person in a cab; one in 1901 for stealing from furnished lodgings, and in July of that year one for robbing a person in the street of a watch and chain; we had all been drinking and there was a friend with me who helped in that robbery—he is leading an honest life now—I said before the Magistrate, "My <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> has done nothing since; it broke his heart"—in September, 1903, I was again convicted of attempted robbery of somebody in the street—on that occasion I gave the name of my friend, James Harvey—in March, 1904, I was convicted for assaulting a man who owed me some money; I gave him a hiding because he would not pay me—at Gerard Road I made an accusation against a woman of stealing my watch and chain and I had her locked up; for how long I do not know, and I do not care—it was not a false charge—I did not appear to prosecute her, because I was going to a race meeting the next day to back some winners, and for no other purpose—I know now that she was remanded in custody for a week—I did not say I was going down to the race meeting to get watches and chains; I said, "Also to see what I could find. I did not find anything. They did not catch me that time"—I had a watch and chain at that time—I was not living with my brother—I gave my brother's address when charging this woman—I said at the Police Court, with regard to the prisoner, "All I was after was money, and that was all Worley was after, I suppose"—I was not going to do murder; I went to get money—I did not go to Mrs. Watt the first time to get money; I went to warn her of her life—the last time I went to get money—I got altogether 30s. from her.</p>

               <p>besides the Monico, the Cecil, Prince, and the Savoy—I think we dined once at the Criterion, but it is a long time ago now; I should say that during the last year we have dined only at the Monico, from last January—we were in London from January to August, except when away for week-ends sometimes, but with those exceptions we have dined every night at the Monico down to the present date; almost invariably leaving the house about 6 or 6.15 p.m., the dinner lasting until perhaps 8 or 9—we dined at the Monico on August 24th—my memory had not to be revived as to who dined with us on the 26th—we did not often have people, and I re<lb/>member the people who dine with us well—I have carried that in my memory—on August 26th we dined at the Monico—the prisoner and I went to Maidenhead, but not for the purpose of calling on Bernard Abrahams—I cannot remember when we called on him last; I think it was the end of August; I cannot remember whether it was September 17th—I am not sure whether it was a Sunday—we got back to dine at the Monico on the day we saw him—I have spoken to him—a long time ago I paid visits to him at Maidenhead with the prisoner—some time ago on his introduction I met Mrs. Clarke—I should say I have seen him two or three times at Maidenhead—some time this year, I cannot quite re<lb/>member when, I saw him at Knightsbridge; some time in the autumn, I think, later than September—I have been very ill and I cannot remember all these things—I have no reason for fixing that as the time he came—he came with a message of business from Mr. Freke Palmer—I cannot say whether this was after or before the last visit to him at Maidenhead—on that day Lightfoot was in the hall, but he had no con<lb/>versation with Abrahams; he passed into another room; Lightfoot was not there with him—I was in the hall at the time—they were not together in the hall—Abrahams remained in the house for a few minutes—Light<lb/>foot was in the hall and Abrahams went through the hall, but did not speak to Lightfoot at all—the door opened and Lightfoot came into the hall—I was in the library at that moment the first time he came—the prisoner was at the door and brought him into the library; he said, "There is a man called 'Battle'. Would you see him?" and I said, "Bring him in; what does he want?"—he remained only a few minutes in the library—I believe he had a little cold meat, as he said he was hungry and had come a long way—he went downstairs, I believe, to have it—he had some cold meat, the remains of the servants', I believe—I do not think it was a pie—how many servants I had has nothing to do with this case—we had one or two; I forget now—I think it was two then—we had none who slept upon the premises—I mean women servants; we may have had one and we may have had two—I think the prisoner went down when Lightfoot was having his meal—he came up when he had finished and I saw him and spoke to him—he le't about 4.40 p.m.; I think he came at 4 p.m.—I should say he was there about twenty minutes—he handed me a docu<lb/>ment, which I looked at—I had heard about it already, because he had sent it some weeks before to Mr. Freke Palmer—I recognised the document he handed to me; it was recording that he had overheard a conversation—no more conversations occurred there between anybody—</p>

               <p>I believe he said something about going to Canada, but I cannot remember much about that—I did not go to Maidenhead the day after his visit—I saw him when he came to the house the next Wednesday—it was my suggestion that he should be put up for the night—I cannot be quite cer<lb/>tain whether I saw him on the Thursday when he came—if Thursday was the day when Bernard Abrahams came; I was there—I have never lunched with Bernard Abrahams anywhere, nor with a dark gentleman, Jewish in appearance—I saw Lightfoot when he came at 9 a.m. on Saturday—I had no conversations with Lightfoot and I never made any statement to him about the violence of the officers who had come to search the premises—I never said in his hearing that in consequence of their violence I had had a miscarriage—I would not speak to a common man on those subjects—this letter is my writing—it is written to the Chief Commissioner of Police, complaining of the results of the policemen's conduct, which had caused serious injury to my health; I have been more or less ill ever since—I do not wish to get other people into trouble, but I have an idea how Lightfoot had such an idea—I cannot invent a suggestion—in my hearing no mention was ever made to Lightfoot about a fruiterer's business—on August 14th I was in the room when Marshall was announced, and, as I was in my deshabille I went into the little side room—I did not go in there to overhear Marshall and the prisoner's conversation—the door of the little room is always open—he came about 5—the conversation then was entirely about trying to get Mrs. Watt to sign the agreement—on the 15th it was that I heard Marshall say, "If you don't pay me £250 I'll make it hot"—the £250 was for his expenses, but there were no expenses—I took it to be blackmail—I do not think I knew that Marshall was coming on the 15th—I always sit in the library, but as I was not dressed at that time I went into the little room—I did not go for the purpose of listening—I had my dressing gown on at that time—it was not the sort of dress to sit in with a stranger present—I keep my things in the little room—I never think about shutting doors—on the 14th the subject of the chloroform bottle was just touched upon—Marshall picked it up and said, "What's that?" and Mr. Watt said, "Chloro<lb/>form," and that was all—I think I remember something being said at one of the Marshall interviews about post-cards—I think it was said that they were funny post-cards, nothing more—there was no mention of my having been assaulted at either of those interviews—I was once pushed up against by some boys—I have not attributed that to Mrs. Watt—it was not said that the post-cards came from Mrs. Watt—the prisoner never said so—I never heard him say anything against his former wife, not to me—he has always talked nicely about her—her name was very rarely mentioned between us—I did not hear Marshall say at the August 14th interview, referring to the post-cards, "If these are your wife's I can get her twelve months"—I did not hear the prisoner say that one seemed to come from one of her clubs, nor did I hear Marshall reply, "There is a lady friend of mine at Sloane Street and I will send her up to test the machines"—I cannot remember much of what happened when the police came, as I was very much upset—I did make a communication</p>

What will my husband say?"—she seemed very low—Mrs. Cornish came in and went for a doctor—I stayed with the prisoner until a policeman came—I saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on the table with blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 9, Manor Road, Leyton—about 4.30 p.m. on November 9th I was called to 99, Park Road—I went into the back room on the first floor and saw Mrs. Bell, Mrs. Cornish, the prisoner and the baby—the prisoner was sitting in a chair against the wall and the baby was lying face downwards on the floor in a pool of blood dead, and there was a pool of blood round its head—I asked the prisoner whether she had done it and why, and she said she did not know and did not know what her husband would say—I asked her if she had been ill since her confinement and she said she had not been ill, but had had a very bad headache—I asked her if she had taken any medicine and she said, "No"—I saw this knife on the table; it is an ordinary sharp table knife, and the blade was covered with blood—I sent for a policeman, who took the prisoner away—she was in a very depressed and melancholy condition, but physically she was practically all right—after the policeman had taken her away I examined the child and found there was an incised wound extending from the back of the neck almost to the front from left to right—I said before it was from right to left, but made a mistake—the head was nearly cut off on that side; the spinal cord was completely severed—I think when that was first severed it caused instantaneous death—the muscles of the neck were severed—the child was probably face downwards when the wound was inflicted—it could have been caused by such a knife as this—I was told the child was three weeks old, but I think it was really nineteen days—it was a female child and when I felt the body it was warm—I think the wound had been caused at the outside half an hour previously.</p>

I have had the prisoner under my charge since November 11th, when she was admitted into the infirmary at Holloway—when she came under my care she was in a very dazed and melancholic condition and seemed to have lost complete control over her mind and could not talk connectively or give any account of herse lf and would begin a sentence and stop in the middle of it—she would lapse into a melancholic state with her hands in her lap and take no apparent notice until she was roused by a question—she did not sleep at all for some days and would not take her food and had to be fed artificially—she was violent for four or five days after she came in and tried to throw herself out of bed and damage herself, and we had two nurses with her all the time—she was moaning incessantly, and if you asked her how she was she did not answer—she apparently had delusions, seeing blood lying about—I think the delusions were real and I do not think she was feigning insanity—I have read the depositions very carefully, and from my own observation I consider she was insane at the time she came under my care and remained insane, but began to recover about November 25th—I made two reports, one on November 22nd, and at that time I thought she was irresponsible and insane—I think there was a physical cause for the increase of insanity</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman at present living at 39, Milford Road, Plaistow—on November 13th I came home from a voyage—on the 15th I cashed for £3 10s. an advance note for my wages with a man named Smith—I then went with Mr. and Mrs. Read to the Peacock in Freeman's Road—while there the prisoner came in with another man—they had never been, to my recollection, messmates of mine—they got into conversation with me—I treated them—when paying I was bound to pull out more money than was necessary to pay for what we had had, as I had only one trousers' pocket—I remained at the Peacock for about an hour—the prisoner and his companion remained the whole time—I gave them a shilling each—I asked the prisoner if he was out of a ship, knowing what it was to be out of a ship, and said, "Well, I will give you a shilling if that is any good to you"—I left with Mr. and Mrs. Read and took a tram to the Barking Road—the prisoner and his companion joined us on the tram—I paid their fare—we all got down at the Abbey Arms, Barking Road—we crossed the road and outside the Swan I asked the prisoner and his friend if they would have a drink there—they did not say "No"—I treated them and gave them another shilling and told them I wished to bid them good-night—I then went away with Mr. and Mrs. Read to Milford Road and found that we had been followed by the prisoner and his friend, who had been joined by two others—I asked Mr. Read if he would mind my asking them indoors to have a little re<lb/>freshment there—at first he demurred and then said he did not mind, and I asked them in to have some supper, which we had, also a few songs—about 10 o'clock the prisoner suddenly stood up and said, "Who is going to start the game?"—I had no thought of any treachery—I said, "I think it is nearly time that we broke up, because it is not my home, and Mr. Read has to get up very early in the morning to go to work.</p>

               <p>If you want to see me you had better come round to-morrow evening and we will have a little more enjoyment"—they stood up and thanked me for my kindness and so on—I unfortunately placed myself between the prisoner and the other man—on getting into the passage the other man suddenly turned and struck me a violent blow on the nose, then pushed me on top of the prisoner behind me, who threw his arm round my neck, caught me by the throat, and gave me the knee in the ribs, or struck or gave me a violent blow—they then' threw me on to the stairs—the prisoner tried to put his hand into my pocket—I was powerless to help myself; I could not gasp for breath—he could not get his hand in, so tried to tear the pocket out—the stuff was too strong to tear, so he tipped the money out on to the floor in the passage—the two of them made a grasp for it and one of them sang out, "Make a run for it," and they were then out of the house in a minute—I had £2 5s. in my pocket—the whole lot of it went—they never left a coin there—I next saw the prisoner at Stratford Police Court—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man who was with me that night and who caught me by the throat and committed that violence upon me—I was advised to go to the hospital, where I remained as an in-patient until November 22nd and after that as an out-patient—I believe my ribs were fractured—I could not go to sea—I am nearly well now.</p>

We only had a piece of chain; it was not worth a <hi rend="italic">tanner</hi>"—I sent him off by two officers to the station, where he was detained—I then went to 131, Bidder Street, where I saw Keat in bed—I said to him, "I am a police officer and shall arrest you for being concerned with two other men in assaulting and robbing a man at Manor Road at 4.30 p.m."—he said, "That's all right; that's what comes of mixing up with such chaps. It was not worth 2d. it was only little bit of chain"—I took him to the station, where he was detained till 8 a.m., when the prisoners were placed with eleven other men and at once identified by the prosecutor—when charged they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Lewis, who is an artificer at the Royal Mint, and has been employed there for some years—we live at 16, Wallbutton Road, Brockley, and in September last we had in our service, for quite a short time, a young woman named Marion Constance Phillips as mothers' help—she received 5s. a week—she came on Tuesday, September 19th, and left on Saturday, September 23rd, the reason being that she smacked my child—I asked my husband to dismiss her and gave him 3s. 8d. to pay her—on October 2nd I gave my husband a written character to send her—on the night he had given her notice he told me he was to have an apology—I only knew that he had sent her the reference, as I had asked him if he had sent it and he said, "Yes"—he called at the girl's lodgings before October 19th, but only saw the landlady—I knew of his calling—on Thursday, October 19th, I was at home about 1.15 p.m. and in consequence of a message brought to me I went into the hall of my house and saw the prisoner and a man whom I afterwards learned was named Egan—Phillips said to me, Are you Mrs. Lewis?"—I said, "I am"—he said, "Is Mr. Lewis at home?"—I said, "No"—he said, "What time will he be home?"—I said "Six o'clock"—he then said, "Can you take us into a room where we shall not be overheard, as we have a very serious charge to make?"—I opened the dining-room door and showed them in and followed them—Phillips said, "I think now I will write it; will you fetch me a piece of paper?"—I said, "Cannot you tell me? I am his wife "—he said, "Will you fetch the sheet of paper, when we will decide whether to write it or tell you?"—I went into another room and fetched the paper, leaving them in the dining room—when I returned Phillips said, "We have decided now to tell you—sit down and take it calmly, as we have no wish to punish you, only Mr. Lewis"—I said "Who are you?"—he said, "That does not matter; what we have come about is a young woman, named Constance Phillips who was in your service five days as mother's help; she left at five minutes' notice through the improper conduct of your husband"—I said, "It is a lie. I gave her notice through my husband for smacking my child and I also gave him the 3s. 8d. to pay her with"—Egan said, "There is a slight discrepancy here, as Constance acknow<lb/>ledges receiving 5s."—Phillips said, "That is of no consequence; what we have come about is the improper conduct of your husband"—I said,. "It is a lie, because she cried and said she wished now she had taken the engagement to go on the stage to play the violin, but she would have to wear tights"—Phillips said, "That is an illusion; she is not that style of girl at all Your husband is the biggest blackguard on the face of the earth, for he is not content with that, but he has also written her letters, making appointments with her, and has been to her lodgings to see her, and he has also written a letter to her landlord and unfortunately this letter has got into the hands of her landlord's governor, and he is likely to lose his situation for keeping a girl in his house who is of ill fame. This is not the first case of its kind; there was a similar case at the Mint some years ago, but we are content not to put it into the hands</p>

               <p>of the Public Prosecutor for a matter of £200"—I said, "We have no money"—they both laughed and Phillips said, "But we know better than you do what money your husband has"—I said, "Wait a minute while I send for my father" and I went to go to the door of the dining room but they went in front of the door and prevented me leaving the room And said, "There is no need of a third party; we have no wish for a third party, as this matter can be settled between you, Mr. Lewis and ourselves"—I had a speaking tube there which they could not see and through which I whistled very loudly—the charwoman came and I told her to go at once for my father and she went—they again repeated that there was no need for a third party and they would not wait—they kept on again about my husband being the biggest blackguard on the face of the earth, and the best thing for me to do would be to get a separation—I said, "Can't you wait; don't you see you are killing me?"—they kept on repeating the same thing and also said that unless they had the money my husband would have to leave the Mint, and I said, "Then the only thing for me would be to go out and work to keep myself and my child"—then my father came in through the garden casement—he is the caretaker of some schools belonging to the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, which are about 260 yards from my door—he came in through the French window into the room and I told him what the men had said, and he went up to them and asked what authority they had for saying it and they said they refused to say, but Phillips said, "We have the letters here," and pointed to his coat pocket—my father said, "Let me see the letters"—I said, "I know my husband's writing; let me see them"—Phillips said he would not allow us to see them, but he had seven or eight—my father asked them several times who they were, but they refused to say, so he said he would order them out of the house, and I also said, "Go out of the house"—after a short time they left the room and Phillips shouted in the hall that my husband was a blackguard and that he was going to the Mint, as he was in communication with the authorities, and Egan turned to my father and said, "You had better come to terms in this matter," and some<lb/>thing about their being reasonable men—they then left the house, but be<lb/>fore doing so Phillips said to me that he would return at 6 that evening—my husband does not have his dinner at home; he leaves at 7.15 a.m. to catch the 7.30 train and comes home at 6 p.m.—neither of the prisoners came at 6 p.m. and I saw no more of them until the next day—when my father came into the room I cried, because I said, "What shall we do? We have not £200," and I was upset when Phillips said it was a serious charge he had come upon because I thought an accident at the Mint had happened—my father was with me until nearly 3 p.m. that day and later on he came back and made a statement to me—my husband returned earlier than usual because I had asked my father to wire to him—when he returned my father saw him before I did—next morning my husband remained at home, and about 10.30 a.m. he answered the door and let in the prisoner and Egan—I was in the hall at the time—the prisoner said to my husband, "Are you Mr. Lewis?"and he said, "I am Lewis"—we all four went into the dining-room; my father was not there then, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110160"/>
               <p>I sent the charwoman for him—probably two or three minutes elapsed after our getting into the dining room and before my father arrived—during that time Phillips said to my husband, "We have an appointment with Mr. Dawson," and my husband said, "He is coming," and that was all—about a minute after my father came, Phillips turned to him and said, "What are we waiting for? We have already been here three minutes"—my father said, "We are waiting for a witness to hear both sides"—I called out, "It is a detective; I am going to have you both locked up," and Phillips said something about "That is right; if you don't, we should"—I was standing by the casement door; I turned round and saw the room was empty—I ran across to the door and they had just got to the outside door and I heard my father say, "Lewis, bring your hat; we will follow them "; I do not think Phillips could hear that—it was almost directly after I had mentioned the word "detective" that they left the room—at the inter<lb/>view that morning there was no demand by the prisoner to my husband for an apology or for an undertaking not to molest the girl—they did not show him any letters or refer to any; they did not even say the nature of the appointment or why they came—I followed them to the front door and saw them at the top of the street walking together very rapidly—I next saw them when they were in custody—I had never seen them before the afternoon of October 19th—Phillips never told me he was the father of the girl, and she had told me she had no father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I was not excited when you called in the morning, but I was excited after we had been talking—when you said there was a similar case at the Mint some years ago I did not know what you meant—I do not know that my father told you that my husband had been a great disappointment to him, that I had been spoilt as a child and was very extravagant and a great expense—I have not invented the tale about the £200—on October 19th I think my husband came home about 4—he had been laid up for a fortnight with a bad hand, but not while Constance was with us, as he did not come home with his finger poisoned until October 3rd—my husband was at home on the Saturday that the girl left, and I was there to breakfast, but I was so much annoyed that I went home to my parents and told them that I would not see the girl again—I went to the Crystal Palace about 2 o'clock, but I did not leave my husband with the girl; he was at my father's—he sent the girl away at 5 o'clock, the time we had arranged—I never told you that if the circumstances that you had told me were true, I would leave my husband, because I could always earn my own living—our first interview was solely between yourself and Egan, but I repeated the conversation to my father in your presence and you heard every word—my father was not with us that afternoon from 1.50 to 2 p.m.—I did not ask you if you were a solicitor and you did not say you had not consulted a solicitor and that you only wanted an apology and that if you did not get it you would consult a solicitor, to see if it was a case for a Police Court or a case I which there might be damages for libel which was contained in the letter, on that if it were brought home to my husband the Jury might give the young lady £50, £100, or £200—you did not ask for a promise that my</p>

               <p>husband should not molest the girl again and you did not say that if you did not get it a solicitor might regard the matter as a case for a Police Court in respect to molesting the girl—you simply said the letter was written by my husband—I only heard the one sum of £200 and not as damages for libel; it was only mentioned as hush money—I remember Mr. Elliott defending Egan before the Magistrate, and I then said that I only heard one sum mentioned, to keep the matter out of the hands of the Public Prosecutor—I signed a book at the police station; I do not know who else did—if I had given you that £200, you were going to hush the matter up—I have not sworn that all through the interview you were calm and gentlemanly—you begged me to be calm, but your manner was not calm and gentlemanly; it was just the reverse—I have not sworn that when I proposed calling my father you made no objection but said, "Certainly"—the speaking tube is at the side of the fireplace—before the Magistrate and at the trial here three weeks ago I admitted that the whole of this letter of October 1st was written by my husband with the exception of the word" affectionately"—I did not think my husband had written it, because he is a Welshman and I have never known him write the word in full, he always puts "Affect." and "Yours affect." and not "Affectionately yours," but that would not prevent him writing it to others—I have no old letters of my husband's written "Affect."—I cannot see much difference in the writing of the word "Affectionately" and the rest, and if it is not his writing it is very well imitated—my husband has said that the word "Affectionately" was not in his writing but admitted that he had written the letter (<hi rend="italic">Ex. A. read</hi>): "Royal Mint, E. Dear Miss Phillips,—I am sorry I have been so long in sending you your references. We have had some trouble at home; the old gentle<lb/>man, Mr. Fulton, has passed away. I herewith enclose your references, and I shall be pleased to hear from you at any time. Affectionately yours, T. Lewis."—I never saw that letter until it was handed to me at Greenwich Police Court, and I had to say there and then, did I believe it was in my husband's writing, so I could not have arranged with him whether it was his or not—this letter marked Al is not my husband's writing and I have never had since I was married a black edged sheet of notepaper in my house—at the last trial I was asked to write certain words at his Lordship's dictation taken from that letter—your name was not given until you were at the police station, when you stated you were the father of the young lady.</p>

               <p>coming to me, in consequence of which I went to my daughter's house, where I saw her, Phillips and Egan—I did not know them before—I did not know them at that time—my daughter made a statement to me—she told me that these two men had come to make a demand upon her on account of Lewis's misconduct with Constance Phillips, who had been discharged on account of smacking the baby, and that on account of the misconduct on the part of her husband, they had demanded £200, and she repeated that several times over in the prisoner's presence—he told me himself in her presence that Lewis had been writing letters to the young lady and had been annoying her by making appointments to meet her in the evenings in the streets, and said that Lewis had written a letter to the girl's landlord, which had unfortunately got into the landlord's employer's hands and was likely to get him discharged, and he said it was a very serious matter and they had come to see if they could settle things amicably—he also followed that up by saying he thought it was a very reasonable demand, considering the very serious charges against Lewis—I then asked him who he was, where he came from, and who had sent him, but he refused to give his name or say whom he was sent by, or employed by—I then said I did not think there was a word of truth in anything he had said, because I knew my daughter's husband's conduct had been very different to what he had said, and he then assured me that it was true and that he had got evidence in his pocket, in the shape of eight or nine letters which Lewis had written, a number of which made appointments with the girl to meet her in the evening—he also said that the girl had written a letter to Mrs. Lewis, asking her to keep Lewis away from her, so that she should not be annoyed—I asked him to let me see the letters, but he refused and I said, "Let me see some of them," but he said, "No, I have got them in my pocket; they are safe"—I asked him several times who he was and then said, "You must go; leave these premises," and I opened the door to turn them out"—when they got into the entrance he shouted in a very loud and boisterous manner that Lewis was a very great blackguard and ought to be exposed, and Egan then said, "Mr. Dawson, you had better be reason<lb/>able in this matter and come to terms; we are reasonable men and are prepared to meet you in an honourable manner"—I ordered them out and said, "You will have to see Lewis"—that was about 1.15 or 1.20—I was in their company, I should say, about fifteen minutes before I turned them out of the house—the same afternoon I was at my lodge, which I occupy as caretaker, and about 3 p.m. the prisoner and Egan called—I went to let them in and asked them to wait half a minute, as I was writing a telegram to send for Lewis at the Mint, and had got the boy waiting at the door to take it—I handed the boy the telegram, went into the room, and closed the door behind me, and as I went in the prisoner said, "Mr. Dawson, you asked to see these letters"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "We have thought this matter over and we are prepared to show them to you on one condition"—I said, "What is that"?—he said "That you bring in the headmaster of these schools to read that letter in this room"—I said, "I shall not do anything of the kind," and he said, "Well, another master who holds an important position in the school</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190512110163"/>
               <p>will do"—I said, "I shall not do that; this matter has nothing what ever to do with these schools, neither has it to do with me, only so far as it concerns my daughter, and of course my daughter's interests are mine to a certain extent, but you will have to see her husband. I have been in these schools now in this situation for nearly eighteen years. I will give you my word as an honourable straightforward man, if you like to put those letters before me, that I will not injure or destroy them or do anything to them and allow you to take them back without injury"—upon that he produced one letter and laid it on the table—I purposely did not touch it, but I read it; it was this one (<hi rend="italic">Letter A produced</hi>), and after reading it I asked him for the others—he said, "That is quite sufficient to justify our calling and making demand upon Mrs. Lewis"—I said he would have to see Mr. Lewis himself about it—there was a great deal said about Lewis being such a blackguard and other things—I made an appointment to meet them at 10 next morning, and I told the prisoner I would go over and see Lewis at his house with them—during the interview at my house the prisoner was rather violent and boisterous, especially at first, but he cooled down a little when we talked about the appointment—he said that n account of Lewis's gross misconduct the girl had been sent away to the country at a very great expense, and he also said that the anonymous letter was very likely to cause the landlord to be discharged from his situation, which was a very serious matter for a man with a family—that evening I saw Lewis and went with him to Brockley police station and made a communication to the sergeant in charge—the next morning, between 10 and 10.30, I went to Lewis's house four times, and as soon as I saw the prisoner and Egan there I entered the room by the back door and told Lewis in a whisper that I had sent for a policeman—I did not speak to the prisoner or Egan, but while I was speaking to Lewis, Phillips said, "Mr. Dawson, what are we waiting for? We have been here about three minutes already"—I said, "Well, I have got a friend coming in to hear both sides of the question"—my daughter said, "A detective has been sent for"—the prisoner opened the door and they made off in a very hurried manner, but before doing so the prisoner said, "Quite right; if you had not sent for one we should"—I pursued them for about two miles and gave them into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first came into the room when Mrs. Lewis called for me through the speaking tube she made a statement to me so that you and Egan could hear, and you said that you had come to demand an apology from Lewis for his gross misconduct to the young lady and to obtain a solemn promise that he would stop molesting her; and in addition to that you made a claim for money—I did not get back to my house that day at 2 p.m.—I do not know what time I first went to my house—I did not go back until some time after the boys had gone into school—when you and Egan were in my room no one else was there—I was not very indignant with you at first, as I wanted to know the particulars of the case, but I did not enter into a friendly chat with you or say that Lewis was a great disappointment to me—he had not promised to do many things when he was engaged to my daughter which he failed</p>

               <p>to do—he was originally on the temporary staff at the Mint and I may have told you he had temporary employment, but I do not know if I did—I said my daughter was paying for the house through a building society—my only object in telling you that was to show you that my daughter had not got the money you claimed—in my room you told me that my daughter was in a very hysterical state, but you did not say that she was not responsible for what she was saying or doing, and I did not say that she was greatly upset before I came in owing to a lodger running away or that she was a very highly strung woman—I said she had been upset a little previous to your coming because she had had an old gentle<lb/>man die in the house who had been there a number of years, and I may have said that my daughter was a highly strung young woman—I am not keeping anything back—Egan did not ask you to show me the first letter—when I saw the letter I read it through as carefully as I could—this letter is very similar to the one I read (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but I do not know if it is the same—at the trial three weeks ago I said I did not think it was the letter—I believe I said I thought it was a blue letter—I did not take the letter up or handle it; it was laid on the table—I did not have my glasses on—you said it was quite sufficient to justify your calling, because it was signed "Affectionately yours"—when I said I would be present at the interview with Lewis you said, "By" all means; I shall be very glad to see you"—I never said Lewis was a violent man—at the trial three weeks ago I said, "Phillips told me that he had sent his daughter away at vast expense"—when I disputed your word in regard to those letters you said "What can't speak, can't lie; I have got seven or eight letters here written by Lewis"—you said you would ruin Mrs. Lewis and make her bankrupt and get her husband discharged from the Mint—you did not make your names known until you gave them at Brockley police station, and it was then that you said you were the father of the girl—when you were arrested you asked what it was for, and I said it was for at<lb/>tempted blackmail and for demanding £200; that is what I told the policeman and you said it was a monstrous charge and that I must be as big a blackguard as Lewis.</p>

A</hi>) was written by me with the exception of the word "Affec<lb/>tionately," because I thought it was written on blue paper, and I say now that I believe it is my letter—at the trial three weeks ago I swore that this letter was not the original, and I thought that this was a copy of some other letter written on blue paper, but that was a mistake—I absolutely denied the word "Affectionately" because I thought the letter was on blue paper—at the trial Mr. Dawson repudiated the letter because I repudiated it and swore that it was a blue letter—at the trial I thought the letter was a tracing—the writing on this envelope (<hi rend="italic">Produced by the prisoner</hi>) is like mine. But I cannot be sure of it—I believe it is mine, but when I wrote it I do not know—I must have written the letter to the young lady dated October 1st with the word "Affectionately" in it, but I must have put that in by mistake, as I had been writing to one of my wife's friends—I was writing to the young lady for an apology and said, "I shall be pleased to hear from you," but I put it in bad English because I am not an Englishman—I wrote to get an apology and I sent her a reference—she promised to send an apology when she left and I will have it when she comes out of prison—I wrote the other letter because I was not at the Mint to receive the apology.</p>

               <p>—he said that he did not believe it, but that Lewis had been an unsatis<lb/>factory son-in-law; he did not seem very pleased with him—I do not remember his saying that Lewis had been laid up for a fortnight with a bad hand—to the best of my knowledge this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">October</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>) I showed to Dawson—I remember asking you whether there was any objection to showing it—he read it twice over, I think—he returned it, laying it was quite sufficient to justify your calling and demanding an explanation or an apology, something like that—he made no comment upon the letter—I took it that he accepted it, from his general manner—I do not recollect your saying, "What can't speak, can't lie"—you said nothing about asking to see the headmaster—I am sure you did not threaten to Dawson that you would ruin Mrs. Lewis, make her bankrupt, and have Lewis turned out of his situation—it is not true, as Dawson says, that you said that the young lady had gone away at vast expense or that anybody had been put to vast expense in sending her away—I did not hear that expression at all—it was arranged that we should call next morning at Lewis' at 10.30—Dawson said that he would like to be present, that his son-in-law was a very violent tempered man and he might be able to keep him under control—at the interview next morning nothing was said—we waited there about twenty minutes—you then left the room, saying you could not wait any longer—you said, "What are we waiting for?" that you had called to see Mr. Lewis for an explanation, that nobody seemed forthcoming to give it, and there was not any need to wait any longer—you then proceeded to the front door—I followed slowly and I then heard Mrs. Lewis say, "We have arranged for a detective to be here"—I was then half way out of the dining room and you were, I think, on the front steps—no answer was made to Mrs. Lewis' observation that I recollect—on the first day we went to Mr. Dawson's house at 1.50; it was not 3 o'clock, I am sure—we were there about ten minutes—I wish to flatly contradict that we ran away from the house, as put in one of the statements; we were most anxious to have the matter sifted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Constance Phillips about four years—I made her acquaintance at my father's house, where she was lodging with her mother—I was lodging there too, off and on—I have continued that acquaintance ever since—I do not know how long she lodged at Embleton Road—I was not a frequent visitor there—I suppose once in three weeks; perhaps not once in six weeks—I went there occasionally—I contradict most emphatically that I went there to see her every week—I am married—Constance Phillips knew that—she asked me if it was the fact—I did not say to her that I was unmarried—she knew all about my circumstances, my wife and children, and had for years—I have not led her to believe that I was single—she brought me the letters she had received—the prisoner I and both agreed together to go to Lewis owing to their nature, they were such bad letters, the defamatory one especially—I thought there was sufficient justification for going—I had known her for years and there was a platonic friendship between us—I thought I would go with the prisoner to see what truth there was in the allegations in the letters and also as a witness, as I have said—I suggested going and</p>

               <p>the prisoner agreed—I thought the matter should be sifted out—I used to frequently see her in the neighbourhood—I occasionally visited her house—I sometimes met her in the morning before I went to the office—there was no occasion to make appointments—occasionally she would come to my office at the Post Office—that has been going on, I suppose, for three or four years—when the prisoner and I went to Lewis, there was nothing previously arranged between us as to whether we should give our names or not—when we found Lewis was not there, the prisoner thought he would tell Mrs. Lewis about the matter—that was after a little hesita<lb/>tion; he asked me and I thought he should—we thought she might be able to throw some light upon it, as the girl had been employed there—Mrs. Lewis wanted to know what we had called about—I refused to give her my name, because it would have looked as if I took too much interest in the girl—I am very sorry I ever went there—Mrs. Lewis said she could telegraph for her husband—I made no reply—it had nothing to do with me; I merely went to hear what was said—the damages that a Jury might award in a civil action was the only reference by us to money—there was no reference by the prisoner to criminal proceedings—he did say that at a Magisterial examination the Jury might award damages; I do not know what he meant—that was in reference to the letters, if they were proved, the anonymous one in particular, as to taking the girl's character away—when. Mr. Dawson was sent for by Mrs. Lewis and was told what we had come about, I did think it a little bit funny, but not very, that the prisoner should not give his name and address, being the girl's father; then I thought to myself, "Well, he does not want to disclose his name and address, and I shall not do so either"—Dawson and the prisoner were very irate, and high words ensued between them—I did not interpose and say they should be reasonable—the next day, when we went to the house, there was a sort of silent meeting—Lewis said they were waiting for something; that may have been the reason of the silence—it was a comic sort of meeting, nobody said anything, except that at the finish, when the prisoner was half way out of the house and I was leaving the room, a detective was mentioned as being expected as an independent witness—the prisoner did say before that, "What are we waiting for?"—I do not think he said, "We had better go"—now that it is put to me, I think I did say at the last hearing that "Mr. Dawson appeared to hesitate a few minutes, and something was said about an in<lb/>dependent witness, a detective, I think, who had arranged to be there, but he had not kept the appointment; after this nobody said anything at all and nothing was done in the matter, as we were waiting for this in<lb/>dependent witness; after fifteen or twenty minutes you "(that is the prisoner)," said,' What are we waiting for? We had better go and we will consider the matter '" (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 214)—I did not pay particular attention to it—we did wait twenty minutes—when the detective was mentioned, I did not hurry away—the prisoner had gone out by then—he states that he did not mention about the detective—we walked away and had got some distance from the house when we were arrested—the prisoner said he was going to the British Museum or going to the Mint, I do not know</p>

               <p>which—I think he said he was going to both—that was when we left the house, I think, but I would not like to swear to that—he may have said in the house that if he could not get satisfaction he would go to the Mint or write to them, something of the sort—that was to get an explanation of the letter, to see if they were in Lewis's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot say that I know the distinction between a civil process and a criminal one—I have had nothing whatever to do with law—something was said by you, but I forget in what connection, as to your going to get a letter from the Mint or something of that sort—I re<lb/>member your saying to me that you were going to the British Museum—you said you had an appointment there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Eddystone Road, Crofton Road, Brockley—I am a traveller to the Hignett Branch of the Imperial Tobacco Company—I called at the defendant's shop in Chestnut Grove, Balham, on February 10th last—he wrote out this order for £12 13s. 3d., and signed it—the goods were supplied, and the invoice sent about three days afterwards—this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I have not received any payment for those goods—I called again on March 10th, when I saw the manager—I saw the invoices, but neither the defendant, the manager, nor anybody told me that the defendant was an undischarged bankrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is "Bought of Hignett Brothers" in large letters, and underneath in small letters, "Branch of the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland"—Hignett Brothers are part of the company; the smaller branches of the firm all form one family, or company—I cannot say whether there is one capital, but I get paid by the Imperial Tobacco Company—I often get letters from the head office—I have never been paid by Lambert &amp; Butler's branch—I cannot name the directors, but I think there are two, if not three, of Hignett Brothers' directors in the Imperial Company—the manager of Hignett Brothers has</p>

               <p>nothing to do with Lambert &amp; Butler, because he is the manager of his own branch—a customer of mine took her money due to Hignett Brothers to Lambert &amp; Butler's branch, and it was transferred, and though I cannot swear to the exact facts, I feel sure the books must have been put right—the accountant would adjust that, as the books are sent on to Bedminster, to the Registered Office of the Imperial Tobacco Company—I think the defendant knew of the combination of firms, but I have not asserted that he did—there is nothing mysterious about it; the scheme was put before the public, and the public took shares—the combination has existed five, six, or seven years—Hignett Brothers joined it at the formation, probably five years ago; I am not quite sure—I might have brought the dates, but did not think they would be wanted.</p>

                  </hi> I am a traveller to Rutter &amp; Company, tobacco manufacturers, of Lincoln's Inn Fields—the business is carried on by Mr. Arthur Rutter, who is the proprietor—some time before February 14th I had called at 2a, Chestnut Grove, Balham—when I saw the de<lb/>fendant he put up his hand, and said, "Holloa, old man, come in," and he pretended to recognise me, and said that he had known me formerly in business at Camberwell—I did not recognise him—I had no recollection of him at all—he gave me to understand his name was Brook—he said he was going to Open the shop as a tobacconist, and asked me to advise him what to stock, and so on—I marked certain goods which I thought suitable, on a list, and he said when he was ready to open the business he would send on an order—I asked him for references, and he said, "If you will refer you will find my name on your books at an address in the Camber<lb/>well Road," and he said, "Surely you remember me"—I said, No, I have no recollection of you"—I left the premises—the following day I looked up the ledger and found the name of "Mrs. Brock" in the Camber<lb/>well New Road, 100 something, I cannot recollect the number, and on the strength of seeing that I trusted him—he sent me this order in writing three weeks later, signed "W. Brock," which I executed—I sent the goods marked upon this invoice, amounting to £8 19s. 7d.—I afterwards got this order, signed "W. Brock, p.p. W. H. Willis, Manager," and in pursuance of that order I sent him this further invoice for £1 7s. 6d., dated 15th March, the order probably being given on the 13th—I called at 2s, Chestnut Grove, about April 16th—I saw the defendant—he instructed Mr. Willis to give me an order, but he did not stay the whole time, and I supplied goods in this invoice amounting to £11 8s. 4d., the whole amount<lb/>ing to £21 15s. 5d.—before I got the last order I asked for a cheque which Mr. Brock promised he would send on the same evening, so that I should get it the following morning for the two invoices—the cheque did not come—I received no references—I did call at the shop at a later date, but the business was then sold—about four weeks later I found a stranger in pos<lb/>session—I made various inquiries, but I could not find the defendant's whereabouts—when I called on him in January he introduced me to his wife, but I do not remember what was said—I believe he said, "Mr. Salisbury, my dear; Mrs. Brock"—I do not think the lady said she re<lb/>membered me—I did not remember her—he did not tell me he was an undischarged bankrupt—I did not know it, or I would not have trusted him.</p>

                  </hi>. In February last I was engaged as manager of a tobacconist's shop, 2a, Chestnut Grove, Balham, by the defendant—I was introduced to him in the City by a friend—I saw him first about February 10th, and began my duties as manager about February 17th—the shop was opened on February 24th or 25th—between February 17th and 25th I attended the shop daily, checking off goods and getting the shop in order—I had not been a manager before, but 1 had had two businesses of my own in the tobacco trade many years ago—goods came in from, amongst others, the Imperial Tobacco Company from various branches—I have seen invoices from Faulkners, Clares, Hignetts, and Ogdens—I checked off the goods with the invoices which were then filed—this is my proposed agreement of engagement, which I did not sign—I wrote it on February 13tb—this order is in my writing—I gave it to Rutter's traveller, Mr. Salisbury; it is signed by the defendant in the name of "Brock"—I knew him as Brocklehurst—asked him, "How is it this is in the name of Brock?"—he said he had done a lot of business with these people and had paid them a lot of money—the invoice came in the name of Rutter—on February 24th I gave this order to Faulkner's traveller for 13s. 10d.—I had the defendant's authority to order anything I required, but not to exceed £10 or £12—so far as I know the name of Brocklehurst was never mentioned to Salisbury or Rutters—I never saw the licence—this applica<lb/>tion for a licence signed "Charles Edward Willis" is in the defendant's writing—I do not know why that was done—it was not done with my authority—I first knew of this application for a licence since this case—I was never consulted about it—I never heard of any other name as the proprietor of the business until about a fortnight before the disposal of it which was about the middle of May, when the defendant said, "This busi<lb/>ness is no longer mine; I have assigned the business to my wife"—he resided on the premises with his wife—up to that time Mrs. Brocklehurst had assisted occasionally—I had never received instructions from her with regard to the business—late in May the name was put up, after the assign<lb/>ment to his wife, of "Ellen E. Brocklehurst" over the facial—the business was sold to Mr. Hooker about May 27th, and he went into possession with a manageress named Mrs. Hart, and I had nothing more to do with the business, only that I remained with him over the Saturday and Monday, as he asked me to do so—on the Monday I left the business finally—at that time arrears of salary and a commission on the sale of the business were due to me to the amount of £12 14s.—the commission was £6—the salary included a month's notice, and was at the rate of 30s. a week—I did not receive that money—there was some salary in arrear—I received £5 16s. from the defendant when the business was transferred to Mr. Hooker—there was a bargain between me and the defendant that I was to receive</p>

               <p>£20 when the business was transferred, but he said, "I cannot afford to give you £20 out of £120," so I said, "Very good, we had better split the difference"—the commission was 5 per cent, on the purchase price, £120—of that I received £5 16s., so that £1 4s. was still due for commission—the total sum due to me is £12 14s. up to the time I left—the odd 14s. is the balance of 25s. for some bags that 1 left—I never got the balance—I saw the defendant about it at Tooting—I knew that Faulkners, Hignetts, and Ogdens were connected with the Imperial Tobacco Company in one con<lb/>cern—I did not know that the defendant was an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was engaged by the defendant he said he wanted a manager because he was engaged in the glass trade—I was left in control of the business to a very considerable extent while he was away travelling in another business—he said he not want to increase the stock, as it was getting very large, and he gave me instructions to limit the purchases to £10 or £12 from any one firm—he signed the orders to the travellers when he was there—sometimes they were written by the traveller at my dictation, but they are mostly in my writing—the defendant did not supply the items; I made the orders out.</p>

This is all through a silly partner; I never ordered any goods, and they cannot prove it. This is nothing less than a conspiracy, but I shall see it through now, and get it over"—I was in Court when the defendant was before the Magistrate on three occasions—on the second hearing he said he had never been served with the bankruptcy petition—that was on November 14th, when Boyle was giving evidence as to the contents of the file.</p>

               <p>taken to the infirmary, where I remained three weeks—I discharged myself—on the morning of the day of this assault I went to the prisoner and told him that if he did not pay his rent I would go to the furniture people and tell them to take his furniture away, as I wanted my rooms empty—his furniture was taken away that afternoon—I tried to go up<lb/>stairs in the evening before the assault to ask for the rent, but my wife would not let me.</p>

When I put a penny in the slot I expect to get a pennyworth of gas"—I went off and returned with, the prosecutor and Roberts—the prosecutor said, "They threatened they would murder me" and the prisoner said, "Yes, you b—, I would like to kill you"—I took Roberts to the police station and the prisoner followed—when charged he said, "I was not near the place at the time"—he seemed to be sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical superintendent of the Camberwell Infirmary—about 2 a.m. on November 15th the prose<lb/>cutor was brought into me and I examined him—he had an incised wound on the right side of his head, about one and three-quarter inches long; a clean cut about an inch long on his right wrist that had severed the radial artery, and he had another wound on the fourth finger of his right hand; abrasions just above the right knee, and one abrasion on the dorsal surface on the third finger—the clean cut wounds were caused by some sharp instrument; it certainly could not have been caused by the fist—he was unconscious, when admitted, from the loss of blood and concussion of the brain—he was very dangerously ill for two days from heart failure through loss of blood—he was under my care until December 5th, when he discharged himself against my advice, having been twenty days in the infirmary altogether—these clean-cut wounds could not have been caused by a fall unless he fell on a peculiarly arranged system of sharp surfaces—the dangerous element was the great loss of blood caused principally by the cutting of the radial artery on the right wrist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blow which caused the wound in the forehead could have been delivered from the back by, I should think, a knife—falling on flint stones could not have caused that wound under any circum<lb/>stances—there were no bruises on the prosecutor's body; he had an abrasion on the knee—there would not be a bruise from a kick unless the force was applied to a part causing rupture of a blood vessel; he might have been kicked in a part where the blood vessels are well protected—if a man is kicked from behind it might leave bruises, but not necessarily—I said at the Police Court that the wound on the forehead might have been caused by a fall on a very peculiarly shaped surface; I did not say that it might have been caused by a fall—an ordinary penknife would have caused that wound, and it would not require a very hard blow.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Charles Kurz, and live at 79, Kirkwood Road, Peckham—I recollect Tuesday, November 14th, when I was at home with my husband—I recollect a man named Harding, who lodges in our house, returning home that night about 11 o'clock—the prisoner was with him; they drove up in a cab—I think the prisoner stayed outside the house—something occurred in the house and as a result my husband went to see what was the matter—I next saw that my husband was running up the street shouting out "Police"—I saw the prisoner run after him—I did not hear the prisoner call out anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer—on Tuesday, November 14th, Harding came home about 11 o'clock with the prisoner—they came in a cab—something occurred in the house and I went out; into the street—when there I was hit and fell—I picked myself up and ran up the street, followed by the prisoner—he called out, "I will murder you, you swine"—the blood was running over my face and I could not run very far—the prisoner caught me—I ran up Kimberley Road and said to the prisoner, "Don't hit me; I have never done you any harm"—he hit me on the back of the head—I knew no more—I was picked up and taken to the station—I there saw the doctor and they woke me up—I said Harding hit me once—I do not believe the prisoner would have hit me if Harding had not worked him up—I have nothing against the prisoner; he is a nice chap—I have known him two or three times—he hit me into the road and kicked me—at the station I was asked who assaulted me and I said, "Harding and Tom'—Tom is the prisoner—I believe at the time of the assault the prisoner was drunk, otherwise I do not think he would have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent at the Camberwell Infirmary—on November 15th the prosecutor was brought in and I examined him—I found he had three wounds, one on the right of his forehead running from the hair towards the nose obliquely, nearly three-quarters of an inch long; one on the right wrist, a straight one, about one and a quarter inch and a cat on the ring finger of the right hand; then he had an abrasion on the right knee and he was un<lb/>conscious from loss of blood and concussion of the brain—he remained dangerously ill and was likely to die from heart failure—he was under my treatment nearly twenty days.</p>
