               <p>at the Westminster County Court. I was present at the hearing of the plaint of Walstab against Allen, on 9th Dec.—after the evidence had been taken on the part of the complainant the defendant Allen was examined as a witness—I took down what he said—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a transcript in my own handwriting of what passed—I believe it to be perfectly correct—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "Henry Allen examined by Mr. Roberts. Did you ever give that gentleman (Mr. Green) an order for goods?—I do not know him. Please answer my question?—No, I never did. Have you ever seen him before?—I never saw him before this morning. Did you ever pay him any money?—No—(<hi rend="italic">Frederick Pitt came forward.</hi>) Now Mr. Allen, did you ever receive any firewood at any time from that man?—No, I have not received any at all. Now when you say you have not received any at all, what do you mean?—I mean this year and a half, since I disposed of the business. Have you not received any wood from anybody at all for a year and a half?—Not myself. Have you received any on behalf of anybody else, or any other person?—No, I have not. Do you know that young man's countenance at all?—No; I do not. Then you conscientiously swear you never saw him in your house before, I mean in your place in Great Wild-street?—Never, to my knowledge; I can conscientiously swear to that. Look at that signature, and tell me is that your signature?—No. You are sure?—It is not. Are you certain of that?—Quite certain of it. Are you also quite certain this man never presented his book to you?—He never pre<lb/>sented it to me (<hi rend="italic">Pickett called into the witness-box</hi>). Did that man deliver any goods to you?—No; I never saw him before. Is that your signature?—No; it is not. That you swear?—Yes, I will. You see that very gentle<lb/>man who states himself to be the plaintiff's clerk (Mr. Green), did you ever see him, and promise to pay him any sum of money?—No. Did that gentle<lb/>man ever call upon you in Great Wild-street?—No; not to my knowledge. Did you ever say you would look into the account, and pay it?—I never had any account at all. When did you first go to Great Wild-street to live?—About twenty-one years ago. How long did you live there, without any interruption, continuously, how many years?—Up to June, 1850. Did you dispose of the business?—I let the business. To whom?—To a person of the name of Husband. Where did you go to live?—I went next door. Did you, and do you, carry on business there still?—Yes; but only in the van and cart line. You say you opened a shed next door?—No, Sir. Do you reside in that place now?—Yes; I have resided there ever since the time I dis<lb/>posed of the business. And you persist in it that you never had these goods, and no one ever applied to you personally for payment of this account?—Yes, I do. When you let the business, did your name continue up?—It was up about a month or six weeks after I left. How came it to be removed?—To get a license for the beer. Yes; but that could have been done without your name. Did you at the same time you were there keep a coal-shed, and retail beer?—Yes. Did the license expire?—Yes, it did; it expired, and another license was got. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Plaintiff.</hi> Have you no idea where this Mr. Husband is?—A great many persons go there to know, but they cannot succeed in finding out. What is the Christian name?—Henry Husband. And the good-will, and stock, and fixtures, were pur<lb/>chased at the time, and there was no law expenses?—Only the good-will and fixtures were taken. And he only gave you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—That is all. How long did he remain there?—About three or four months. Come, let us have it a little nearer than that, say whichever you like; do the premises belong to you?—No; I let them to him on 25th June. Did be happen to go away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185201050003"/>
               <p>before or after next quarter-day?—He went away before quarter-day. Then it was not three months?—No, it was not; I do not know what be paid for it, but he was gone too." (There was not a question preceding that, 'Did he let it to somebody else.') "Did Mr. Jerry sell it to anybody else?—Yes, What was his name?—Jackson. Where is Mr. Jackson?—He is still there, and the name, I believe, is up, but I will not be certain; I really think Jerry's name is up. By the <hi rend="smallCaps">JUDGE</hi>. Did you, Mr. Allen, assist Hus<lb/>band in the business?—No, I did not. Then you were not occasionally much at the house?—No, Sir, I do not suppose I have been there much at all. By the <hi rend="smallCaps">PLAINTIFF</hi>. What sort of man in appearance is Husband?—He is a stoutish man. Like you?—Yes. And what sort of a man is Mr. Jerry, is he a stoutish man too?—Yes, Sir, he is; Mr. Jackson is a little man. The <hi rend="smallCaps">JUDGE</hi>. Oh! there must be a verdict for the Plaintiff, unquestionably; all these witnesses identify him, and it seems to me I must commit him."</p>

I knew the defendant—I saw him on the subject of Mr. Walstab'a account in the spring of last year—I cannot say the exact time—I called on him in Great Wild-street, and saw him—he is the man I saw—I delivered him an invoice of the two parcels that were owing for, delivered on 13th and 30th Dec, and told him I had come for the amount—he said he would look over it, and pay me when I called again—I think I told him the amount, I will not be sure—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I afterwards called again, but did not see the defendant; I saw a woman—I then called a third time—I think that was about a fort<lb/>night after the first calling: on that occasion I saw the defendant, and he told me he did not owe it, and would not pay it—I am quite sure he is the same man that told me he would look over the account, and pay me when I called again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Russell-street, Bloomsbury, and keep a coffee-stall, in Cornhill—I have known the prisoner about twelve or thirteen years. On Monday morning, 1st Dec, I was at my coffee-stall, in Cornhill, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I was warming myself over my coffee-stall, and fell asleep—I awoke, and saw the prisoner there—I said to her, "There you are, I see"—she turned round, and said, "And there you are, you b----vagabond"—I told her not to make use of that expression, but to come round, and I would speak to her—there was no one there but her and me—I heard the coffee-tap turned, and in turning round to turn it off, I received a blow at the</p>

I resided, in Oct. last, in the Old Kent-road—in Aug., 1850, I gave an order for one or two pairs of trowsers, I forget which, and a blue beaver overcoat, of M'Pher<lb/>son, which were delivered to me about six weeks afterwards—this is the bill I had with them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—with respect to paying the money, sometimes he would come to me when I was on the engine, and I would give him a sovereign—I have got the receipts—here is a letter which I received, demanding payment—I knew nothing of Mr. Varley—I thought I was dealing with M'Pherson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and carry on business in Tottenham-court-road and the Edgware-road—Hopkins entered my service about July, 1849, at a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I consented to allow him a commission of 5 per cent, on all orders he brought, when paid for, and gave him to under<lb/>stand that I did not allow him to do business on his own account—about four or five months afterwards he called me on one side, and said he had been speaking to a beer-shop-keeper respecting the formation of a clothes' club, if I had no objection—I said I had no objection; it was his business—a few days afterwards he spoke to me again, and said he had spoken to several per<lb/>sons who had joined the club, but it was necessary for the club to stand in his name, as they would not support a shopkeeper—I consented to that, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185201050009"/>
               <p>some orders for clothes were executed in Hopkins's name; "but it was not on his account—I received all the money, as far as I know—M'Pherson had previously worked for me, and he came to me in June, 1850, and said he understood I wanted a cutter—I asked him who told him so—he said Hop<lb/>kins did—he said he could bring a large trade to my establishment—I spoke to Hopkins about hiring him—he said he was formerly a foreman of his, and he believed him to be a thoroughly honest man, and in great difficulty and distress—I engaged him at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages, and a few days afterwards arranged that he should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, commission on the business he brought, on its being paid for—the arrangement about Hopkins's commission was altered just before or just after the clothes-club commenced, five or six months before M'Pherson came, when I abolished the commission, and increased his salary to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as I found two or three customers whom he introduced were previous customers of mine—both went on upon those terms till they left my service—in Oct., 1850, I had bill-heads printed—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told Hopkins that in future he was to make out the bills which he delivered to M'Pherson, on those invoices, instead of on plain paper—mine is a ready-money trade, and I had never had any invoices before—it was Hopkins's duty to receive from M'Pherson an account of the orders he had taken, and enter them in the book; and after M'Pherson had cut out the orders, to take an account of the quantity used, and enter it in the cutting-book; he was then to give the work out to the workpeople, and enter it in the work-book and in the wages-book—it was M'Pherson's place to take the goods home—it was Hopkins's duty to make out the invoice and deliver it to M'Pherson, to deliver with the goods; and if he brought home word that he had not received the money, Hopkins had a small memorandum-book, in which he was to enter it; when the money was brought home, he was to enter it on the other leaf; I gave strict instructions that I would have no goods left on credit—these two bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are in M'Pherson's writing—they are for articles supplied to a person named King—one it, "21st Oct., 1850. Mr. King to Thomas M'Pherson: 1 pair black trowsers, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; ditto blue, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."

Q.</hi> You have a great many people in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; at present I have only three at each shop—I have had as many as five at the Edgeware-road house, where the prisoners were employed—the name of Thompson is not up there at all; but if you want to know whether I carry the business on in the name of Thompson, I tell you at once I do—the name of Thompson is not over the door, or in any part of the building—Thompson is merely a fictitious name—I opened the business in that name eighteen months ago—Mr. Elman, my foreman, carries on the business for me—he does not have a commission; he has a poundage on all money taken beyond a certain amount each week; it is 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—it is merely given as an inducement to do business—I believe some of my men had the same at this time, but not the men at present in my employ; three out of five at the Edgeware-road had it, and I think two out of the three at the other shop—you may call mine a slop-shop, if you like; it is a tailoring and ready-made clothes shop—I do not know what is meant by the word slop—I should not call it a slop-shop—I made verbal arrangements with both prisoners about the commission—the names of the clothes-club are entered in this book—here are thirteen names down here—they were not persons in my employ at all—Hopkins was not one of the club; he carried it on—each member paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and there was to be a draw once a fortnight, and the party who was successful had a garment made to the amount—it is not a lottery; each member has his draw in his turn; the only question is who shall get the first—I gave Hopkins authority to cut out clothes for the club—I have got the orders entered in my books—I did not take stock before Hopkins left, I swear that—I swear I did not go over the accounts—I measured a portion of the piece goods; I did so because I missed a piece of cloth out of my stock, and my object was to go through the books at some future time, and see if it was correct—that was in the presence of Hopkins—I did not express myself satisfied—I do not think I went through any silks at all on that occasion—I have no private affairs—I have a book here containing an account of the moneys owing on account of these goods.</p>

               <p>goods, and I dare say other persons in my establishment have—they always said, "If you please, Sir, I want a pair of trowsers," or "a coat," "and I will pay you so much a week out of my wages"—after the first examination M'Pherson was discharged—Hopkins was not in custody at all; he attended in pursuance of a summons—I believe he was let out on his own recog<lb/>nizances twice—the proceedings have never been abandoned; I went on with them before the action commenced, as far as consulting my solicitor went—I did not get out the summons—it was not four months before I took farther steps, it was between three and four months—the summonses were granted by Mr. Long, in September, six weeks before the action commenced—my solicitor did not have them—we got the Magistrate's consent that the summonses should issue, but we did not take them out till after the action commenced—I never had them in my possession—I knew of their being taken out—I cannot tell how long that was before they were served on the prisoners; it might have been a week or a fortnight, I do not think it was a month—I do not know when they were served, I think it was only a few days from their being obtained to their being served—when Hopkins left me, he went into the employment of a person, at Brompton, in the same line as myself—I only saw him there once—after he left there, I heard that he took a situation as foreman in a clothing establishment about twelve or fifteen doors off me—I do not know whether it was before or after I heard that that I commenced these proceedings—it was quite Immaterial to me about his being there—I do not know that he was carrying on a little business for himself near roe, as a tailor—I do not know how he got his living after he left me—I do not think I have seen him above twice since, except before the Magistrate.</p>

I was on duty at the lower end of Romford-market, and saw Grant with a horse—I told him to move on, and, in consequence of something said to me, I followed him and the horse—I came up to it a second time, when both prisoners were together—Christie had hold of it—when he saw me coming, he let go of the halter at once—I was in uniform—I asked Christie where he had the horse from, and whose it was; he made me no answer—I then asked Grant where they had the horse from; he said, "We have only rode him down eleven or twelve miles"—I asked where he had him from; he said, "From Globe-lane, Mile-end"—I asked who it belonged to; they did not know—I took them both into custody, and the horse—Chambers afterwards gave me a description of the horse, which corresponded with it—he afterwards saw it—I showed it to the younger Chambers on the Monday following; they both identified it—there are a great many horses for sale every Wednesday in that market; but when I first saw Grant, he was not at that part of the market where the horses were selling, and I told him to go to the other part of the market, where they were selling.</p>

On 10th Dec. I missed my purse, containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a silver coin with a small hole in it, from the pocket of my dress, which I left on a chair in my sister's bed-room—on Saturday, 13th Dec., I went to my sister's to search for the money—I looked in the cupboard in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner's box there—I know it was hers because she claimed it—I found in it a purse, which was not mine, which contained at one end 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and silver, and my coin, and at the other end 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and this ring—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the coin I lost—I had had it about twelve months—I told the prisoner there was my money in her box—she made no reply—afterwards she said it was her own; that was about a quarter of an hoar before the policeman came.</p>

I came home, about 2 o'clock—my sister-in-law showed me a purse and a ring, which belonged to my daughter, who is twelve years old—I went down to the kitchen, and said, "Mary, this is a bad job; how is it you have been stealing Miss Julia's purse?"—she said she had not done so; it was her own money—I asked her if the ring was her own, and said she had better tell the truth—she said she found the ring when she was making Miss Rose's bed—this is the ring; it is of very trifling value—there is no mark on it—my daughter had not worn it—she only used to have it to play with—the prisoner's wages were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she had lived with us not quite three months, and had had about a month's wages—I had not paid her as much as 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but she had about half a guinea given to her in presents, when we had a party—we had a very good character with her.</p>

               <p>to look after her—I went to the Crow public-house, which it nearly opposite the court where I live, in Moor-lane—I saw her there, about receiving the change of the sovereign, and I noticed Oxley there, close to her—I did not notice anybody else—there were twenty or thirty people there, I should say—the front of the bar was full of people—I followed my daughter out of the door, towards my own house—I was not more than two yards behind her, and as I was about turning the corner of the court I was knocked down, by whom I do not know—I received the blow in my months—I should say there were two or three persons near me at the time—I could not say how many, as I was knocked down so suddenly—I should say there was more than one—directly I was knocked down I was kicked—I saw who kicked me; it was Oxley—I begged for mercy—that was while I was down—I called him a coward, and asked him what he was kicking me for—I was kicked about the head by Oxley; but it is nearly well now—I was also kicked, in other places—I said to him, "You have kicked my head nearly all to pieces, and now you are satisfied; you have broken my arm; what have I done to be served in this manner?"—I did not know at the time that my arm was broken; but I felt in sad pain—I felt a kick, on my arm—there was no one near me at the time but Oxley, and it was, under a gas-light—I had an opportunity of noticing him well—I became insensible, or nearly so—before I became insen<lb/>sible I attempted to get up—I had nearly got up, and Oxley kicked me in the front of the head, and I saw three men, rushing into my house after my son, and I heard one of them say, "Pull the b----out"—they were like beasts going into a slaughter house; they hardly knew which to get in first—I was taken to the hospital, and had my arm set—I have still got it in splints.</p>

I was with Oxley at the Crow when young Crispin came is with the policeman—it was between 8 and 9 o'clock—I was going to have a pint of beer, and in came two of them, and said, "This is one of them"—it was not a man with one eye—I should know him if I were to see him—it was not a boy—the persons who came in were a man with a broken arm, and another one; I believe it was his son, who said, "That is one"—I do not know the man with the broken arm—that is the man who came in (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the elder Crispin</hi>), and another man with him—the policeman laid hold of my collar—I said, "No, I have done nothing"—the man then said, "That is one." pointing to Oxley—it was not the man's little son who pointed me out—it was the son who was outside here with this person (<hi rend="italic">the elder Crispin</hi>).</p>

Oxley has worked for him five or six years—it is the same firm as Wright and Nash—they have two places of business—Oxley was absent on boxing-day—it was a general holiday—he is one of the best men I have, one of the most quiet and sober.</p>

I was on duty at Ponder's End, on 15th Dec, a little after 9 o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner in company with another man and a woman—I watched them; they crossed the road—the prisoner went down by the side of the Two Brewers, the other two went into the Two Brewers—the prisoner returned in about a minute, and he also entered the Two Brewers—I then spoke to the landlord, and asked him to get a light—I went with him to the place where I had seen the prisoner go by the side of the house—there is a shed there, a lean-to, and on the tiles of that I found a bag—I felt it—there was something like coin in it—I let it remain where it was, and I watched about an boor, and at a little before 11 the prisoner came to the place, and reached on the tiles, and walked away—I went to the place and the bag was gone—no one else bad been there—I then followed the prisoner nearly a quarter of a mile, I took him by the arm, and asked him what he had got in his pocket—he said, "What is that to you?"—is he broke from me—I took him again—he broke from me again, and strict me several times—I saw him put his hand in his right-hand pocket—he then struck me several times, and in doing so he threw something over my left shoulder, as if he was going to strike me again—I heard it fall, it sounded as if something fell heavily, but there was no Jink—I called on Davis to assist me—I took the prisoner, he was quite calm then, and I took him to the White Hart—after getting a light, I west back to the spot where this struggle took place—I there found this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear this is the bag I saw on the top of the tiles—I opened it in the presence of Mr. Bennett, and found in it thirty-seven counterfeit shillings, all wrapped up in separate papers—I found on the prisoner two good shillings, two duplicates, and four silk handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Two Brewers. I remember some persons coming to my house on the night of 15th Dec.—Hayes spoke to me—I got a light, and went by the north side of my house—there is a little lean to building there—I saw just such a bag as this on the tiles, I did not take it up—I left the policeman there to watch—after that I heard one of the persons in my house say, "Let us go," or "Be off"—I saw the prisoner go to the place where the bag was—he returned immediately, and went down the road with the other man and woman—the other man had been out of my house once or twice; but eventually they all went away together—after the three persons had gone I saw the policeman go to the tiles to look for the bag, and it was gone—that was almost directly after I had seen the prisoner go up there—I and the policeman then went towards Enfield High<lb/>way after the prisoner—the White Hart is on the way—we did not stop there—I saw the policeman go on, and soon after he returned with the prisoner and the woman—we had passed Adey on the way, and stopped him, and partly searched him—I said, "That is not the one that took the bag"—we left him and ran on—that was before we got to the White Hart—when we got to the White Hart I was outside waiting, and Adey came up and went in there—the policeman then brought back the prisoner and the woman—he gave them into our custody, took a light, went out, and in four or five minutes he came back with this bag—I saw it opened, and the bad money in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger to the General Post-office—the prisoner was a clerk there, and was on duty there on the morning of 31st Dec., from 5 till half-past 9—for reasons I had I was noticing him, and saw him feeling the letters as if to find out whether there was any cash in them—about half-put 7 I saw him crumple one up in his left hand, and then go on sorting—I told the President on duty, Mr. Graham—about half-past 9, when the prisoner had finished his division, he went down-stairs to the basement—his duty for that time was done—as he was coming up again adjusting his coat, I stopped him leaving the Inland-office—the men's coats are kept on the basement—I laid hold of him and said the President wanted to speak to him—he gave a slight pull to get away—I said, "He only wants to speak to you"—at that moment Mr. Graham stepped up and asked him to step into a private room—he then said he had been informed that he had something about him which be ought not to have—the prisoner made no answer—he is not deaf—Mr. Graham asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he faintly replied, "No" I then sent for Peak, the officer, who proceeded to search him—I saw him take a letter from his pocket along with his handkerchief, and afterwards he took another letter out of his trowsers pocket, I think—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they bear the Inland post-mark of that morning, and ought to hate gone off by the morning mail—they would have come before him that morning it the course of his duty as a sorter.</p>

Forward, on board the Defiance cutter, Weymouth, Dorsetshire;" and the other, "Rev. John Smith, Moravian-chapel, Devonport"—the prisoner said, "I am sorry you should see me in this position; I belong to a most respectable family, and I believe it will be the death of my wife; she has no other relation on earth but myself; I cannot think what induced me to do it, it must have been infatuation."</p>

They rejoined and conversed together, and on "God save the Queen" being played, I saw the prisoner Francatelli go up to a lady, and with his left hand feel her dress, and then put it into the pocket of her dress. The audience began to leave, and the prisoners turned round to go out, when I heard Francatelli say to Adam, "Push me." The other answered, "All right, Robert." I then saw something passed from Franca<lb/>telli to Adam, which appeared like a watch, as I saw it shine. Just before they got out of the door I took them into custody, telling them I believed they were there for the purpose of picking pockets. Francatelli said, "We have not robbed anybody."

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at No. 7, St. James-street—I am fifteen years of age—I accompanied Ernest Francatelli to Jullien's concert, at Drury-lane Theatre, on Wednesday 10th Dec—we got there a little before eight—I think it was past eleven when we were taken into custody—I was with Francateili during the whole of the time—he Separated from me at one time inside tie theatre—that was after we west in again—he was away from me two or three minutes—I then rejoined him—with that exception we were together all the evening—I did not in the course on the evening look very steadfastly at the pockets of ladies' dresses, or look at all at the pockets of ladies' dresses, for any purpose—I did not place my hand in the outside of any female's pocket, ox any<lb/>thing of that sort, and feel if anything was in it—I remember the time when the audience were leaving when "God save the Queen" was played—I did not at that time see Francalelli go up to a lady, and with his left hand feel her dress, and put his left hard into the pocket of a lady's dress; if he had done anything of the kind I most have seen it—I did not are bin do anything of the sort at any time in the cause of the evening—if he had I moat have seen him—I was walking with him and conversing with him—I had not been to Jullien's before—Francateili did not, just before we were taken into custody, or at any other time, pass something to me which bad the appearance of a watch, and which appeared to shine—he passed 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to me in tha refreshment-room to pay a waiter—that was not as we were going out—it was shortly' after we want is—he passed nothing else to me during the whole evening—a purse was found upon me when I was taken into custody—Francatelli had gives that to me to give to a sister—I stated that at the time I was taken into custody when they asked me where I got the purse from.</p>

               <p>in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. I am a cheesemonger. On 13th Dec. I went to bed about 10 minutes before 1 o'clock—I left the house all secure, the landing window was drawn down, I cannot say whether it was fastened—the shop-door was open—the back-door was bolted with two bolts—there is a small yard at the back of my house, and some small cottages which divide my yard from Devonshire-court—I came down in the morning about half-past 7—I saw the window open, and the blind tied up to one of the iron bars which go across to prevent any one getting in—when the win<lb/>dow is open, I should have thought no one could get in; but they must have got in there—the bars are about seven or eight inches apart—my little boy who is nine years old can get through, I should not think the prisoner could—I found the back-door leading into the yard open, which had been bolted the night before—the three tills were empty, and one stood on the counter—there was from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone from the tills, we cannot tell exactly—I had seen them the night before; and I missed two coats, one of my own, which was hanging behind the parlour-door, and my son's coat which was left in the parlour—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—a person could not have got in at any other place but this window, unless they had cat the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer; I carry on business with my father and brother, at 10, Spital-square. Mason was our foreman for thirteen or fourteen years—he had the management of the work, giving it out, and receiving it in—he had the general superintendence, and down to this time we had confidence in his integrity—on 18th Dec, about the middle of the day, I bad occasion to go up to the place where Mason had a desk, to ask him tone questions about business—he was at his desk, and the lid was resting on bis bead—he immediately closed his desk, and turned round, and I saw he was much confused—I did not intimate to him that I thought there was something irregular, but I came down stairs out of the room where he was—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after that he went to dinner—I communicated to my partners what I had observed, and I went up to the desk where I and seen Mason—I found the desk locked—Mason had one key of it, and we had another—I unlocked it, and found in it these eight pieces of silk—they are worth about 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are our property, and two or three have tickets on them—we have an engraved form for tickets—I saw this bag in the desk—I locked the desk again, and left the silk and bag as I had found it—Mason came sack from his dinner at the usual time, and he left at half-past 8 in the evening—my brother is the resident partner there—all the per<lb/>sons had left when the prisoner left; he was the last person—after he was gone I went to the desk again and found it open, and the silk and bag were gone—I searched about the premises, and came to a place we call the wicket-box, near the toilet—there is a counter before it; that is where the work<lb/>people employed out of doors come to et their work—it is like a box at a pawnbroker's—the workpeople receive and take out their work—we do not have weaving done on our premises—Walker was in our employ's a weaver, but she took winding home for some of her family—I found the same bag and silk in that place that I had seen in the desk—I put some marks on the silks, and left the bag and silk in the box where I found it—I communi<lb/>cated with the police—next morning I stationed myself with an officer in an empty house, which commanded a view of the entrance to our premises—I saw Mason come about 19 minutes past 8—his usual time of coming was 8; but for some considerable time past he had been nearly half-past 8 before he came—in a few minutes after, I saw Walker come—I still remained where I was, till I saw Walker come out in about ten minutes with this bag and the silk.

When Walker came out, I turned to the left and went' away; I did not want to be seen—I saw Mason that morning again after he was in custody—I afterwards went to where Mason lives in Thomas-street, Bethnal-green, with the officer—I found there these twelve yards of satinette, which I believe h off one of the same pieces that was in the desk—Walker Kves in Church-street: she is married.</p>

I was in a room nearly opposite the prose<lb/>cutor's premises—I saw Mason go in, and shortly after Walker went in and two other women—I then saw Walker come out with this bag, and turn to the left, and before I could get down I lost sight of her—I found her in the Pewter Platter, about 100 yards off—she was sitting down in front of the bar, and this bag by her side; I was in plain clothes—I stopped some time, and then I said to her, "What have you got in that bag?"—she looked at me, and in about a second she said, "That is like your impudence"—I then told her I was a police-sergeant, and I suspected she had stolen property, and she must come with me—she then said it was her work—I took her into custody, and took possession of the bag—it contained the silk now produced—I took her back to the warehouse, and as we were going along she told no the foreman had given it her to take home to her house till he called for it—when I got to the premises I sent for Mason, and told him he was charged with stealing a quantity of silk, the property of his employers—he asked us to let him go back for his hat; but not knowing the premises, and whether there might be a back way out, I refused to let him go—he then said, "You know too much for me"—Walker was there at the time—Mason said some<lb/>thing to his master, and he cried, and said he did not know what made him do it, and he said she was not the guilty party—he cried all the way to the station-house.</p>

On 29th Dec. he came to my place, and agreed to purchase a coffee-roaster of me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would either pay for it in goods or I could have the money—I said, "Well, as you profess to roast coffee so much higher, and turn it out so much better than any one else, you shall roast it out, and I will send you the roaster to-morrow morning, and some coffee"—the next morning I sent him 51lbs. of coffee in a bag, with the coffee-roaster, by my son James, in a truck—shortly after I followed the truck, having to go into the City, and found it at the prisoner's door—I saw the prisoner take a portion of the coffee, about half the coffee is my bag, put it into the cylinder, and commence roasting it—I stead till that first portion was roasted—I saw it taken out and put into a cooler—by that time my lad had come back from taking the took home—I saw the prisoner put the other portion of my coffee into the cylinder, and saw the lad commence roasting it—I saw the portion that had been roasted put into the bag—during the time it was cooling, the prisoner was standing against the cooler, and he said it was a good coffee, a splendid coffee; Rudelhorf could not turn out such a coffee (he is another roaster)—it was said, "This is rather a pale roast"—the prisoner said, "Yes, but perhaps the other might not be the same"—he said, "I will manage that for you by tying a string in the middle of the bag"—that would separate the first portion that was roasted from the second portion—as soon as I had seen the second portion put in I said, "I atn rather tied to time; I must be in the City at a certain time"—the pri<lb/>soner said, "It is all right; your lad will be here"—I left my son for fear of something being intended, by what the prisoner himself had told me before; he had told me that when the coffee was out in the cooler it would be</p>

                  </hi> I live with my mother, Mrs. Abrahams, at 5, Brook's-gardens, Bagnigge-wells. I recollect Mrs. Hans and Mrs. Bare living with my mother—they left on a Friday night, and I took two boxes for Mrs. Bare on a barrow, up to Marylebone—I do not know the name of the street—I think the number was 33—I remember the prisoner coming to my mother's on a Saturday night, and I went to the same house where I had taken the boxes—I showed the prisoner the way—we left ray mother's house about half-past 6 o'clock—it took us about three-quarters of an hour to walk—on the way, we went first to a public-house in Leather-lane, and then we went to one at the bottom of Holborn-hill; but he did not have anything tardiest there—he stopped at three public-houses; we went to one at the corner of the same street where I had taken the boxes, and to a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop a little higher up—at the public-house he said that public-house was too open for him to sit in, in case she might come in, and then she would not go home—he then went to the <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop, and had some ale—before we went to the house he said he would try to take the boxes home; that he would take one, find I should take the other—we then went to No. 33, and went into the parlour, where we saw the landlord—the prisoner bad some conversation with him—I went out twice for beer, and when I was coming in the second time, the woman who had been at my mother's followed me in—we had then been in the house half or three-quarters of an hour; during which time the prisoner had been in the parlour, with the landlord and landlady—when the woman came in, the landlord said to the prisoner, "That is her;" and he said, "Now, don't you <hi rend="italic">kick</hi> up any disturbance at all"—the woman went up stairs—she did not see the prisoner—the prisoner took the candle, and followed her up immediately—they had been up stairs a short time when the prisoner called to me and said, "My lad, come and fetch the boxes downs<lb/>tairs—I went up stairs and found them talking together, in a back room on the first floor, standing near the window—I did not hear what they said; they were talking very quiet, and appeared to be friendly—the prisoner said, pointing to a box, "Here, my lad, you take this box down stairs"—I took the box, and as I came out of the room the woman began screaming; and I saw the prisoner hitting her—I put the box down, went across the room to him, and said, "What is the use of hitting your wife like that?"—he said, "Trouble your head with your own business"—I saw him give her two or three blows about the breast before I left the room—he struck her in this</p>

"No, I have not"—I said, "You have"—he said, "If I have, you tell the policeman"—I told a policeman, who was on the opposite side, by the public-house—during the time I was in the room, when I went to fetch the first box, I did not see the woman strike the prisoner at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was done just before the man hit his wife, or what took place the moment before; what was she doing; how was she situated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were standing up, talking together—I did not hear any scream before he hit her; directly he hit her she began to scream—I saw the first blow struck—they were talking together before that by the fireplace, but I do not know what about—they were standing opposite to each other—I cannot recollect what was said—I did not hear her use any ill language to him—I did not hear him ask her about any man who used to visit her—I did not hear him mention a man named Thompson—she was angry about the boxes going, and when I went in to take them, she said, "Oh! you cruel boy to take them boxes away"—I did not hear her say she would not have them go—I only knew her by her living at our house—I know a person named Thompson, who lives in Bath-street—I never saw him with her'—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand, or the woman's—I was quite close to them, and looking at them—I saw the hand with which the prisoner struck his wife—if there had been anything in it I think I mast have sees it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house, 33, North-street, Marylebone—the deceased lodged at my house a fortnight, in the back room, on the first-floor—I knew her by the name of Knott—I remember the prisoner coming; I opened the door to him; the last witness was with him—the prisoner asked me if Mrs. Bare was at home—I said I knew no such name, and repeated</p>

               <p>the names of the lodgers till I said, "There is a Miss Knott and Mrs. Hans lodging together"—on my mentioning that, the prisoner said, "Knott is my wife's maiden name"—he went on to state that there was property of his in the house; that a daughter of mine had got his wife away to lodge in my house with her—that was false—I replied that I had daughters, but no con<lb/>nection of theirs—I told him Mrs. Hans was not my daughter—he said there was property of his in the house, and he would burst open every door but what he would have it—he said he had two boxes—I told him if there was property of his I would assist in getting it, but to have a policeman rather than burst the door open, because I thought it was not legal, being a fur<lb/>nished house and a lodging-house—I said if his boxes were there, this Miss Knott would be in at 9 o'clock; she was so regular I could depend upon her—I asked him to walk into the parlour, which he did, and sat down with me for a long time—I remained with him—he said a great deal to me, too much for me to relate—we were together nearly an hour and twenty-five minutes—he spoke in very bad terms of his wife, and said she and the other one were nothing bat two prostitutes, and did I know I had such character! in the house—I suppose by the other one he meant Mrs. Hans—I said as far as I knew I had never seen or known anything wrong—his wife came home at about five minutes to 9—I did not see any one with her—she went along the passage and up stairs—the parlour door was open, and the prisoner could have seen her, and I believe he did—while she was in the passage I said, "This is the good woman you want to see," and I put a candlestick and lighted candle in his hand, and he followed her up stairs with the candle in his hand—I then went out into North-street, in pursuit of a policeman, for fear of a disturbance—I did not think of doing that before; I was only afraid there would be a piece of work—when I returned with a policeman it was all over; I found my wife bathing the woman's temples—I believe she was then dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am last witness's wife. On Saturday, 8th Nov, the boy Bracks<lb/>ton came for some boxes, which I refused to let him have until proper authority was given—in a short time the prisoner came back with the boy, and sat with me and my husband in the parlour for an hour and a half—the woman came home, and went up stairs, and the prisoner went up after her—my husband went out for a policeman, and I stood on the mat at the foot of the stairs, and heard talking in the room up stairs—I believe the door was closed; I could not hear what passed; they were talking quietly—after they had been talking a short time I heard the prisoner call to the boy to come up stairs—I was in the passage at the time, and told the boy to go—the boy went up, the prisoner opened the door, and I heard him tell the boy to take the boxes down—I did not hear anything particular until that time—I went with a candle to the door, to see if I could see my husband, and then the <hi rend="italic">screeching</hi> began—I went back to the foot of the stairs, and heard great <hi rend="italic">screeching</hi>, and a fall, as if a table or drawers had fallen over—the boy was then bringing down the boxes—the screaming continued after the fall for</p>

               <p>about a minute and a half, or two minutes, and then the prisoner came down—I had not noticed the boy go up for the second box; I think be must have gone up while I was on the step—I was going up stairs when I saw the pri<lb/>soner coming down, and I turned back and opened the door for him—I noticed his hand was smeared with blood—he went out into the street—I closed the door, and immediately went up stairs to the woman's room—when I went into the room she was kneeling, as it were, on one. knee, over a chain which had been thrown across the fender—her hair was scattered about her face—I put my hand and put it back—her eyes were wide open, looking up<lb/>wards—she was resting on the chair; her hand was <hi rend="italic">clutched</hi>, about half open and half shut—there was a wound on her cheek, from which blood was flowing—she bad no bonnet on; I think it was in the fender—she half a victorine round her throat—I took it off, and put my hand there, to see whore the blood came from; I did not know at first—I did not see any blood there only on her face, and I took some water and threw it on her face—she did not speak after I got in; she struggled, and I thought she was in a fit; she made a noise, and threw her head back, but yor eyes never moved—the doctor, Mr. Davison, soon afterwards came, but she was dead before be came—I should say it was from five to eight minutes after the prisoner left that the doctor came—I had not, been into the room before; they had only been with me a fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just tell us how he said it; what did he say first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "I have heard yesterday my wife is 100 miles away, I don't mind <hi rend="italic">tramping</hi> 100 miles so long as I can trace out where the boxes went to, for revenge is sweet"—I said, "Why should you think wrong of your wife, did you ever find her doing wrong?"—he made this reply to me, "Why, I do not know, I have seen her making up some finery, and that is only fit for a loose woman in the street"—that was the remark he made to me—I said, "You know nothing wrong of her?"—he said, "No, I have always found her just, from the very first hour she met with me to the hour she left me"—he sent a letter to me the following day—he said he would not come any more—I could not tell him where she lived, because I did not know at that time—he wanted me, if I could tell him where she was, to come there for a few minutes—he wanted me to make some appointment—I said I could not tell, I knew where she was at work where I sent him, but she was only there for a day or two—in the course of that conversation, he said, "If I catch hold of her, she will repent it," he would lay his hand on her, and she would not forget it—I think the phrase was, "She will repent it," as near as I can say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Lynam, of Friars-street, Black<lb/>friars-road; he sells tools. I heard of the death of the woman in Marylebone from a policeman who called on a Monday; I forget the date—ten days or a fortnight before that, I cannot be certain which, a man, who I believe to be the prisoner to the best of my belief, came and bought a flat file—on the same day, about twenty minutes afterwards, but I am not certain, he came back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185201050068"/>
               <p>and said the file did not answer his purpose, and wished me to change it—I said, "No, I shall not change it; because I do not think you bought it here"—he pulled something out of his pocket, and said, "Yes, I did; I b ought this at the same time to convince me that he bought the file there—he selected another file, a triangular one or three-cornered one; I think they call it a saw-file—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sort of file, and it is also of the same magnitude—we had several of the kind at one time, and we had one or two left at the time this was bought—to the best of my belief, it was the prisoner who changed the file—I have not sworn that it was him—there is the maker's name on this file, and on others that we have—we had one or two files in the shop with the maker's name on them after selling a similar file to this—the policeman took one of them away; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, because it has a broken point—the maker's name is Robinson—that is not my husband's name—I cannot say whether the file I sold was sharp of blank, but it was rusty, because we never clean any tools.</p>

God Christ Almighty!"—he laid his head on the edge of the dock, and was excessively agitated for several minutes—when he recovered a little, he said, "Oh! that you could kill me now, but you have not the power; oh! that I could be hung this moment, but thank God I am now at rest"—while he was being searched, he said, "It is too late now, or I would have provided myself with a something, and then I should have saved you and everybody else trouble; I did not think I should lose it"—he was locked up in the cell at night; a constable named Hall was placed with him—I have got the victorine, it is pierced in several places in the right breast and shoulder, and other places, by a triangular hole.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is William Bennet. On 1st Jan., about 8 o'clock in the evening, I met a young man in Deptford, and went with him to a public-house, and had a glass of rum—the prisoner was at the side of the bar, and could see me—I took a shilling out of my purse, where I had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to pay for the rum—I put the purse back into my dress-pocket—the prisoner was about three yards off, and could see what I did—when I left the house she followed me, and asked me to give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not give it her—she said she was both hungry and dry, and asked me to give her a pint of half-and-half—we went to another public-house—she took me, saying it was a quiet house; I did not take her—we sat down together, and had a pint of half-and-half—I took twopence out of my purse to pay for it, and put the purse back into a pocket under my dress, not the same pocket—after I had drunk the half-and-half, I became insensible for about half an hour—when I came to I missed my purse—the prisoner was brought into the room, and said, "Will you give me in charge?"—I said, "Yes, you have taken my money"—I was sober; I had had nothing but the rum and half-and-half—I have been ill fifteen months—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But they are very different times; suppose a man had to make his defence, he might show where he was at a particular hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was be<lb/>tween 9 and 10 o'clock in the day, in Nov.—we are in the habit of shutting the shop at 11, and we take supper after we shut up on Saturday nights—it must have been about 9 when the prisoner was there—I was mistaken in saying it was between 7 and 8—on 17th Dec., about 6, I was called out of the parlour—I found the policeman and the prisoner in the shop—the police-man had a piece of neck of mutton in his hand—the prisoner had a piece of shoulder of mutton under her left arm—she dropped it—I looked round my shop, and missed two pieces of mutton off the front table, they were the same that the policeman and the prisoner hand—they were five pounds and a half, part of a shoulder and part of a neck; I had seen them safe five minutes before—the prisoner had been in my shop between 3 and 4 that afternoon; she asked the price of some meat on the table, I told her to leave the shop, because I remembered her face from the Saturday night of her taking the pork—I did not like to charge her with, it; I was quite certain of it, but as there was no pork on her then it would be hard to prove it.</p>
