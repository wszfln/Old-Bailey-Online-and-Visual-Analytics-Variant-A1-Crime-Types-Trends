On the 6th of April, between eleven and twelve at night, I was fool enough to go with the woman at the bar into a dirty alley, to have to do with her, and at the time she picked my pocket of my watch; I had just put it in my coat-pocket for safety. When I had done, she said she wanted to go to the necessary, and ran out of the dark alley. Before I put up my breeches I missed my watch. I ran up the alley, but could not find her high nor low. I searched the place, but had no candle. On the Sunday night I found her about the same place; I took hold of her, and said she had stole my watch. I took her to the watch-house, and the next morning before the justice, and swore she stole it. On the same day the man at the bar came with another man to the house where I had directed my watch to be brought, if found; I advertised it as lost. I let him know if he came with it on the Tuesday morning, he should have the reward I had offered. He came with it. I had got a warrant and took him up; the justice made me pay the money, for taking it out of pawn, one guinea and six-pence. (The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Jos. Jenkinson. I am servant to Mr. Murthwate, a pawnbroker in Great Poultney-street. On the 7th of April the man at the bar pledged a watch with me; it was like this, but I cannot swear to it. He took it out again on the 9th.</p>

I had laid them on the counter, thinking to send them to be cleaned, and he took them unknown to me, and I never saw them since.

When I missed them, the prisoner said he had taken some of them, and he brought five pair of steel ones and eight of silver again, and one pair I found in the drawer afterwards. I went to get a warrant for him, and he absconded, and could not find him till about two months after.</p>

               <p>My master fell down in the street and daubed his clothes on a Sunday night, and on the Monday morning I was told they were to be carried to be cleaned. One of my countrymen came, he told me, there was a friend of his in the Borough could do. them well, and desired me to let him have them to clean. I delivered them to him to carry; that friend is since gone to Amsterdam, and I forgot to ask him where his friend lived. I have given myself a great deal of trouble to find him, but cannot. I used to do the cupping business. I left these instruments with his patients one day. I found the cock-spurs in an old drawer; I pricked my finger with one of them. I put them in my pocket to enquire what they were, and was told they were cock-spurs. Master asked me for them; I went and fetched them from where I had left them, two doors off, and delivered to him all I had taken out of the drawer, I had never seen such things before.</p>

I was at work in the garret; he came up about ten o'clock and unlocked his box, and took some money out, (this was the Wednesday after Christmas.) He locked it again, and went out again. Sarsfield came about eight, and said, Are you at work? I said, Yes. He staid two or three minutes, and went away. In about a quarter of an hour he came again. I said, Sir, Where is my landlord? He said, I left him at the public house. I said, What is it o'clock? He said, It is just eight. That time he brought the prisoner with him.

I looked round, and saw the prisoner go to James Hall's box, which was just behind me, about two or three yards from me. He took the box in his arms. I said, Gentlemen, what do you mean? Sarsfield said directly, Not a word, by Jesus. The prisoner went away with the box. Sarsfield all the while was standing over me for two or three minutes after the box was gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when he took the box, or while he was in the room?</p>

Then I went up to my room, and staid there till my landlord came home, after twelve o'clock. I dare not go down stairs. My room is up three pair of stairs. I saw nobody from their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250005"/> going away till my landlord came home. I was a stranger in that part of the town, being lately come from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not mention a word of Lee on the trial of Sarsfield?</p>
               <p>Davis. I did not know his name then; I mentioned another man with Sarsfield. I knew his face, and know the prisoner is the man. When my landlord came home he missed his box; he came into the room where I was, and asked me where his box was; I told him Sarsfield and another man had been here and taken it away. There were some of the prisoner's countrymen and some of mine came to me last Monday and offered me seven guineas if I would go off. I am a Welshman. They said they would have a coach for me to carry me down to Windsor, or any other place. I saw one of them at the door as I came in.</p>

I fastened all the windows, and the door, and the area door, and gate, and the kitchen window. I went to bed a little after eleven on the Monday night; every thing was safe then. There were only me, the house-maid, and a little girl in the house. I heard no disturbance all night. The house-maid went down about seven; she and I went down almost together: I went into the butler's pantry, and saw all the plate was gone. I found a pannel of the kitchen door cut, and the bar taken down, and the sash of that window shoved up: the bolt of the window was cut in two; the shutters shut to on the outside, and bolt within. The area gate was broke open. I found they went out at the street door. The butler's drawer was broke: there was the mark of a chissel in several places, in all the places that were broke. I found two chissels on the dresser in the kitchen. They had taken down the tinder-box: I found that and some matches upon a chair in the kitchen: there was no tinder in the box, so they could not get a light there. The house-keeper's room was broke open, and three locks broke in that room. The top of the bureau was broke, and all the writings upon the floor; they took a gold ring and a breast-buckle from thence.</p>

            . Ford, Crookall, and Miller, were with me in this robbery. On the Monday, before I went into Hyde-park, coming back by this house, I saw some plate in the window: Crookall said to me, There is a good deal of plate in that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250007"/> house: then we fixed upon that house to come to in the night. At night we met all four of us, and set out from the Boot in Cross-lane about twelve o'clock; I there told the other two of it. I told them I was going to Grosvenor-square, to a house there, where was a good deal of plate: we found the iron gate locked. I had a chissel in my pocket, and one of them had another: I put in mine and wrenched the gate open. I then went down and got the farther window open, by putting the chissel under it; it gave way a little; then I put my fingers under it and got it open. I hoisted up the sash, and got in at the window. There was nobody with me: they were up at the top of the stairs. I went into the kitchen; there was a parrot cage. I called up to the window to give me a light. There was no fire in the grate. I found a tinder-box, but there was no tinder in it. I strove to strike on the brimstone matches, but could not get fire. Crookall brought me a light; he went to put it in under the shutters and the draught of air put the candle cut: he was about a quarter of an hour in bringing it. After that I waited a good while and nobody brought a light. I got out at the window, and found the bit of candle. I took it, and went and lighted it myself at a lamp, about fifty yards from the house. Then I went in, and up stairs with the candle, and opened the kitchen door; Crookhall went in with me. I had opened a little door out of the kitchen that came into the area: we could find nothing in the kitchen of any value. I tried the kitchen door and could not open it; then I took a knife from the dresser and cut a pannel out; there was a bar went cross the door that shot in with a spring; I put my hand in and felt something move. I shoved the spring on one side and the bar came out; then Crookhall and I went out of the kitchen into a room on the left hand, where was some china; then there was another bureau desk we broke open, out of which we took a breast-buckle and a ring: then we came back again. There was a little pantry like; I know not whether it was locked or not; Crookhall had got it open before I came to it; there was some silver, but I am not certain what. Then we went up stairs; going up we went into a parlour where were books: we could find nothing there, nor in the back parlour. Then we went up stairs, and found a place with empty drawers; there were some ivory things; we did not touch any thing there. Coming down, upon the kitchen stairs, there was a closet, and a window upon the top; Crookhall looked in and saw something shine; I put my back to it, and he shoved against me; and when the door opened I fell down: there was a small waiter upon the dresser, and another plate, I cannot say what: there was a small chest stood upon another chest: we took it off and put it on the ground, and opened the chest. I do not know whether we broke it open, or whether it was not locked. There was a great deal of plate in it; very large plate, butter-boats, sauce-boats, a large waiter, spoons, a punch ladle; the candlesticks stood in a little closet on the right hand: we broke open the cupboard and took all we found, and put them into a green cloth which Crookhall brought there: we carried them down and laid the parcel on the floor; the cloth would not hold it all; then I went and found a woman's gown hanging on a peg; I put the rest into that; then we came up stairs and opened the street door and went out; the other two prisoners were there; they asked what we had got; I said a good deal of plate; we were in the house about three quarters of an hour. We went to Piccadiily and got a coach, and told the man we were going to Tower-hill, and bid him make haste, fearing the waggons should be gone, as the things we had were to go out of town. We all four got into the coach, and got out on Tower-hill; then I went to Graham's at Salt-peter-bank, which is about half a mile from Tower-hill; I had had dealings with him before. Then Crookhall came after me and brought the plate; the others came; we all went in. The plate was carried up stairs. I went up; the other three staid below. There were a pair of scales brought and the plate was weighed; it weighed three hundred and thirty-three ounces. He gave us 3 s. 6 d. an ounce for it, it came to 60 l. he paid 54 l. and left 6 l. remaining. It was put upon a bed. I laid myself on a bed and fell asleep. I do not know how it was taken away. I staid there about an hour, or an hour and a half. The money was not paid till after I awaked: then I called them up and threw the money down upon the table; it came to 15 l. each: we have not received the other 6 l. yet. We all went away together.</p>

There was a bundle on Graham's bed, it would not go into a peck measure. Colby and Crookhall went up stairs. I was called up stairs. Graham's wife asked me if I would carry a basket for her; I said, Yes. I carried it into the Minories some where; she went with me; it was a fish-basket; she used to sell fish. It was near half a hundred weight. What was in the basket was tyed up in a coarse cloth. When I came back again I saw Miller; in carrying it my head went through the bottom of the basket. I was obliged to bear it on my shoulder. I heard some jingling in it like plate. Before I got to the house in the Minories somebody called, Morea! (I served a Man of that name, and have gone by that name ever since.) I imagine that was Graham that called me.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. serjeant Nares; it is my business to see that all the doors and windows are fast before we go to bed. On the last day of February they were all fast at going to bed. I got up a little before seven, on the first of March, and found that the window-shutter of the parlour forward, the ground room, was broke open by main force, and the closet in the passage was broke open; it appeared to be broke open by some very strong instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark when you got up?</p>
               <p>Stancliff. It was daylight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Nares. On Thursday, which I believe was the first of March, the night of that day my house was broke open. I was called as early as it was discovered, which was rather after seven, and I saw where they came in. There are two setts of window-shutters, the outward in the street, and the inward. The outward were to pull to, and bolt withinside; to the other within, there is a bolt comes down to fasten them. I perceived the outward bolt was wrenched by an instrument which we found; they had left it in my wife's dressing-room. The outward bolt was wrenched so that it was bent; the screws were drawn so far as to bend it so as to let the shutter come open. That on the inside came directly down cross the window. It was a very large bar; had it fell, it must have alarmed the whole house, but the curtain had catched it. There were marks of mens feet on the pallisades where they stood to wrench the shutter. My bureau was all broke open. They had come into my study, and there they had taken away (for I am certain it was there over night) a large silver ink-stand, and in that I had that night put an amethyst ring set with diamonds, in the hollow of the ink-stand, and there were some other things taken. They had left the glasses belonging to the stand. They had searched all the papers in my bureau and in my pocket book. We went up into my wife's dressing-room; they had taken away the childrens perquisites. They had emptied out the money, and left one purse there; these were taken out of the bureau in my wife's dressing-room. There were four, but they had left one, which belonged to my eldest daughter. I verily believe they were surprised by something, for they left their instrument just by the bureau, a strong iron chissel. (Produced in court.) I had seen a two guinea piece in one of the purses, I think it belonged to my son; I think it was of king James the second, a very remarkable well-preserved two guinea piece; and I had likewise a queen Ann's guinea, which my wife picked out of the money that was produced at Sir

               <p>Mr. Nares. I dare say there are many. I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nares. The purses were all in my bureau. There was about 30 l. in money; two two guinea pieces, both very fresh, but one more than the other; a queen Ann's guinea, and several guineas besides. There was a crown piece of king William. I picked out a two guinea piece at Sir

As much as any body can swear to money, I believe I can swear to this guinea being in the purse in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Nares. I verily believe this guinea to be mine; I can say no more. I remember there was a little piece of black upon the cheek of the head, and it was on when I saw it at Sir

            . About the first of March, Wood, Ogilvie, Shepherd Strutton, and myself were playing at skittles; we drank pretty freely, and staid pretty late; then we agreed to go to my room in George-alley, Shoe-lane, to supper. I had a fowl. We agreed to go out about twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250011"/> o'clock. We agreed to take a walk down the Strand. Coming by serjeant Nares's house, Wood (I believe it was) said, Let's try if we can't get this house open; it is near Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the house before?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had about a fortnight before, but had no intention then about breaking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you, or either of you, looked at the bolts?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, we had not. I went to one end of the street, and Ogilvie the other. By-and-by Wood came down the street, and said they had got something. I went home, and Ogilvie went home. It was Wood bid me go to one end of the street, and Ogilvie to the other. We went to see if any body came. We staid there about an hour.

               <p>Q. Where was Strutton?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I believe he was along with Wood; we were all four together when we stopped at serjeant Nares's house. I left Strutton and Wood together in Chancery-lane. I saw nothing done. The next morning I saw them about seven at

               <p>Q. Who were there at that time?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. Maguines's wife, I, Ogilvie, and Wood. Wood told me he had sold the things to Maguines for 22 l. He said he had sold him a pair of ear-rings, but did not say they were diamonds. Maguines was not at home when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. He lived in Hockley-in-the-hole; he is a turner by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the money had you for your share?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had five guineas in money; we divided it in Maguines's room. Maguines's was then at

            's, as his wife told us; she let us in. Wood was there before us. I think Wood took Ogilvie's share; he was not there. There was some ready money divided, that amounted to about two guineas each, that was divided at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wood or Strutton say where they had the things?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No; I went up to Lumley's from Maguines's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the money consist in?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. It was guineas. I had seen Ogilvie have a two guinea piece about a week before this robbery was committed. I saw it several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. He told me his mother left it him. He had a good deal of money, I believe 30 or 40 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned this before the justice?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see at Lumley's?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I saw Maguines there; he was sitting up stairs with a good many people; his wife told me he was there about seven in the morning. I heard there was a feast there the night the robbery was committed. I called Maguines out at the door, and told him, I and Mr. Wood had something to sell. He said, he had not heard any thing of it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you got them?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him they were stole?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had been acquainted with him some time before this, but I never sold him any thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to him then?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. It was Wood that was acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me understand you: Had Wood sold him any thing before?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I believe Wood had sold him the things before I saw him; but I do not know whether he sold them to him or his wife. He said, he had heard nothing at all of it; I thought he had bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to tell him there were some things to be sold?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I can't tell how I came to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen him before seven that morning?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I had not; I saw his wife about half an hour after six. It was Wood that sold them. I never saw the silver stand-dish, nor ear-rings. I never saw nothing but the ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go away from Carey-street?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I came away about two, and went home to bed; they all of them went to their homes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you appointed to meet at Maguines's?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250012"/>Bagnall. No, we had not. I had no notion of meeting them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I went down to see him as I often called there, but upon nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was divided first, the two guineas each, or the five guineas each?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. The two guineas each was divided first; that, they said, they took from Mr. Nares's house; the twenty-two guineas were divided not ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say Maguines was not at home, and you went and hid the goods in the ruins?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, never to my knowledge. I was taken up upon a thing I knew nothing at all about; and Sir John said, if I did not swear to this, he would indict me for something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this chissel?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I know nothing of it. I never saw it before now to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see it when they stopt at Mr. serjeant Nares's house?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I did not see any tools at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wood go with you to Lumley's?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. Yes, he did. He was in the taproom when I went up stairs to Maguines.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Maguines? Tell the very words.</p>
               <p>Bagnall. I said, Wood had some things. He said, he had heard nothing of it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any appointment with Maguines?</p>
               <p>Bagnall. No, I had been often out with Maguines at skittles, or a walking on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Will. Haliburton. I am a constable. I apprehended Ogilvie on a Sunday, I can't tell the day of the month, it was the day after the robbery, or a day or two after. There was a person with him that I knew to be an old offender. I found in Ogilvie's pocket either twelve or thirteen guineas, three half guineas, a two guinea piece, a twenty-seven shilling piece, a five and threepenny piece, and some silver. This is the two guinea piece that has been produced here. I produced that money at Sir

            . I live now in Hare-court, in the Temple; I was apprentice to Mr. Freeland, a stationer, in Carey-street, when Mr. serjeant Nares's house was robbed, over-against his house. I observed three young fellows about the house some days before the robbery, it may be six or seven days before. I believe I should know one of them, he was in a very remarkable dress. He lifted himself up upon his toes, and stood on tiptoe to look into Mr. Nares's parlour. They rather cast their eyes up and down, looking, I presume, at the bolts and shutters of the window. I think Bagnall is one of them by his face.</p>

            . Mr. Watkins and I were both in the shop together; I saw them first, and mentioned them to Mr. Watkins. There were three men walked by the door two or three times, and took particular notice of the window-shutters and bolts, and to the best of my remembrance, Bagnall the evidence stood upon his toes, and looked in at the parlour window. I can't say I know either of the prisoners.</p>

            . On the 7th of March, about half an hour after eight at night, coming towards London in my chariot, my wife and my sister were with me. I saw two men on horseback; I hardly saw the first. It was about two hundred yards from a house where they had called for some gin. They commanded the coachman to stop. One of them came up to that side I sat on, put a pistol in, and demanded my money. I was on the off side. I gave him a six-and-nine-penny piece, and about eight or nine shillings in silver. On his going off he fired a pistol; whether he aimed at the coachman or not, I know not; he had threatened to shoot him. When I came to town, I went to Sir

A highwayman rode up to the chariot; he was in a plain sort of a coat and a black mask over his face, and a round hat on; his coat was buttoned to him, and the cape pulled up round his face; his horse was a lightish bay, about 14 hands high. It was very moon-light. He threatened to blow the coachman's brains out: another man came up when he had done. He then fired at us. He said something; I just looked back, and the pistol went off within a few yards of me; I heard the ball whiz on the right side the carriage. I cannot swear to the man because he had a scarfe before his face. As we came by the Britannia they were calling there for gin. I saw the second man come up from the Britannia. He rode a brown horse.</p>

            . I am a constable. When Gew was stopped, I desired him to take his hand out of his left hand waistcoat pocket; then I took out this pistol and this crape, and this horn, with some powder in it. (Produced in court). I found a sword, broke in two pieces, upon the tester of his bed. I asked him if he had any accomplice with him; he told me he had, one Marshall, and described his clothes. When he was taken he had a pistol under his left arm, and a cutlass under his right. (That pistol produced.)</p>

            . I was at Sir John Fielding's office when Gew was brought in; his girl was brought also. She gave a description of Marshall; she said he was dressed in such and such clothes; that he had a cutlass under his arm and a pistol in his pocket, and threatened to blow any body's brains out that should offer to attack him. As I was going down Prince's-street, I saw him at the end of a court talking to a person. I looked very hard at him. I went and asked Mr. Gandall's man, whether he knew the man he was after in the morning; he said he did not. Then I went back to Sir

He went up to him, and asked him if his name was Marshall; he answered it was not; he mentioned some other name. I was up with them at the same time. The person said, I beg pardon, I thought you was the person. I must beg leave to look at your waistcoat (he had been described to have a striped linen waistcoat under another, and a cutlass under that) He took up the slap of his upper waistcoat, and said, Your name is Marshall, I am sure, and said to me, Mr. Taylor, Search him. I did, and found a pistol in his right side waistcoat pocket, and a cutlass under his left arm; the pistol was not loaded. I took a brace of balls and a white crape out of his pocket.</p>

            . I live at the White-horse in Castle-street, Long-acre. On Monday, the 5th of March, the two prisoners came and hired two horses of me for the Tuesday to go to Rumford together; Marshall was the person that spoke; they were to be ready by ten o'clock at their lodgings. I had them down at the time; they returned about eleven at night. On the Wednesday they hired two more; one of them was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250015"/> mare, which they did not choose to ride, and I hired one for them; they said they were to go to Greenwich: they went out about four, and came home about twelve at night. They ordered two other horses on the Saturday, and not coming in time I had let them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of horses did they ride the first day?</p>
               <p>Downing. They were two dark brown horses with swish tails.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they ride the second time, which was the 7th of March?</p>
               <p>Downing. One of them was one of the same horses, and the other a little chestnut, or rather a sorrel, with a swish tail.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was the sorrel horse?</p>
               <p>Downing. In good condition. They mounted first in Wych-street; the second day in Mr. Savage's yard where I live. I remember Marshall a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them together before?</p>
               <p>Downing. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they mounted the second day, which horse did Gew ride?</p>
               <p>Downing. He mounted the light-coloured horse.</p>

               <p>Marshall's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the fact. I own I had a pistol and cutlass upon me; the pistols I bought in Holborn, and took them down in my pocket. When I went to Sudbury we fired them off as we were going along. As to that caul which I had in my pocket, when I had my hair dressed I used to lie in it. We were at Rumford the first day, and the second we dined at the Bell at Dulwich. I was brought up a farmer, and had a fortune left me, a trifle a year for my life.</p>

I shewed him a silver one with an enamelled dial-plate. He did not like the plate. I shewed him another with a silver plate. He seemed to like it. He said, there is another that hangs up in the corner, let me look at that. It was hanging in the window. I took the frame down in which the watches hung; in the mean time he ran away with the other. I jumped over the compter, and called out, and ran after him, but he out-ran me.</p>

I have known him eight or nine years; and some of my neighbours hearing he had robbed me, came and told me he was drinking at the King's-arms alehouse in Bishopsgate-street, the night after. There I went and took him. I asked him, what he had done with my watch? He said, he had taken it, and given it to one

            . I am servant to Mr. Murral. On the 28th of March I took the things he has mentioned, out of Mr. Cinton's cart, three loaves and seven parcels, all separate things. I put them down on flats and hampers by the warehouse-door. I had a candle in my hand, weighing some things to put in the waggons. I heard a russling of paper and things behind me. I turned about, and did not see any body. I came nearer these parcels; then I missed a lump of sugar. I went behind some baskets; there I saw the prisoner with this lump, holding it by the string under his court. (Produced in court, Direction, J. Jackson, Newport-Pagnell.) He seemed to be in a great flurry. I took him by the collar; he dropped the sugar, and wanted to push away from me. The porter assisted me with him into the house. He said, he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>

There were twenty half crown rolls of halfpence in paper, when I went to bed on the 19th of March, in a box in the bar, which was nailed to the wainscot. I had seen them all there in the afternoon. I missed three rolls on the 20th. We suspected the prisoner; she was our servant. We searched her box, and found three rolls in it. She was present when we searched. Then she held up her hands, and begged I would say nothing about it, and said, she would stay and work it out. (Produced in court.) I can take upon my oath to say these are some of the rolls that were in my box; we make them up in a very particular way.</p>

The prisoner had been in my shop, and had bid me money for the petticoat. She cheapened several things besides. She bought some gloves and some ribbons, and other odd things. I never observed her to take any thing after this. Mrs. Holmes came to my shop, and asked me if I missed any thing? saying, there were some things found that had my mark upon them, and the prisoner was suspected. I got a warrant and took her up. Mrs. Holmes brought the things laid in the indictment, to me; I am sure I never sold them to any body. They are my property. The prisoner confessed she took them away at different times, but never would tell me in what manner she took them.</p>

I got up about six o'clock on the 4th in the morning, and found my kitchen window, even with the ground, open. There were shutters to it; the keys had lost their springs that key'd them to, and by turning the bolts round, they sell out, so that they opened the shutters and then the casement, and cut the wooden bar out on the inside. They broke two panes of glass, and untwisted the lead from the wooden bar, and took the light out; then there was room for them to get in. I found four locks broke in the house. They had opened a corner-cupboard in the corner of the kitchen, where I had happened to leave some cash, above twenty guineas to gold, and about 4 l. in silver. I missed a pint silver mug from the kitchen. I missed from other parts of the house, the other things, spoons, a tea-chest, tea-tongs, strainer. I never found any of my things again. The lads at the bar were taken up the night following upon suspicion, but they confessed nothing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter past twelve o'clock, April the 5th, I was in my stand in Hoxton-town, just at the bottom of the prosecutor's garden. I saw these three young chaps going by; I thought they were disorderly from their very looks. When they were got a little way from me, I was relieved by another watchman; and on my going round the town, I met them again, two on the side I was on, and one on the other side. My partner was on that side. I asked them where they were going? They set up a run; I ran as fast as I could. I could hear their feet. I bid my partner blow his candle out. I called out, Blunt, Blunt, war-hawk! He was ready, and held up his stick and stopped them. We took them all three to the watch-house. The next morning I found a dark-lanthorn, two hand iron crows, and a tinder-box. There was half a bunch of matches found in the cage where they were put; and there was another bunch of matches taken out of Darby's pocket before the justice. They were all of a length.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear them fling these things away?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. No, I did not: they were throwed over some pales into a garden. They had run by the place. We catched them near the corner of the garden.</p>

            . I live in the same yard. I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's bar, and put her hand into a bag and take out a quantity of halfpence and put them into her pocket. I told of this. She was searched, and to the amount of about four shillings in halfpence were found upon her; she had a six-pence in silver in her pocket. The account she gave of her having that money was, that she had bought a ribbon near Temple-bar over night, and changed a five-and-three-pence, and that was the change out of it. We went with her to the shop; the people declared they never sold her any ribbon.</p>

I let the clock down, and they made their escape, and I made my escape, and was taken in Cross-lane, by Little Queen-street. On the Tuesday following the prisoners were taken where they lived, and were at the Justice's when I was brought there, all three of them.</p>

I found the shutters of the parlour window wrenched open; I imagine with a chissel, and the sash was lifted up, and the blind taken away. I missed a silver watch from the mantle-piece, and two coats out of the same room. It was one o'clock before I left that room to go to bed; all was safe then. I went and informed Sir John of my watch, and on the 5th of this instant Sir John sent for me: there I saw it again. I was sent with a constable to Golden-lane, to see for my other things. (The prisoner was then in custody). There were two women in the prisoner's house; we looked about, and found other things, but nothing belonging to me. We went up into the old woman, the mother's room, and, in a box, I found the chain of my watch. I went to the prisoner in Newgate last Tuesday, and said to him, if he had pawned my clothes I would be glad if he would let me know, that I might have them again: he said he had sold them to an old clothes man, and I could not have them again.</p>

Sir John asked me where I lived; I told him directly. I told Sir John, if he would admit me an evidence, I could be of great service to the public. He has got a writing I drawed up: he told me if I could discover a robbery that had been done since I had been in prison, I should have great favour shewed me. The prosecutor asked me whether I had his clothes; I told him I bought them all together. I put the other chain to the watch. It is what I had had three years.</p>

On the Wednesday morning I was awaked by a violent rapping; between five and six the watchman called me to come down. I went down, and found the window, next to where the side-board stood, was broke open; the shutter was flung back; the iron bolt was broke in two, and three or four panes of glass broke, in order to unscrew the screw within side; the window is above the area. They stood upon the iron pallisades, in order to break it open. The only things I missed, were the knives and forks and the case they were in. After it was day-light, I wrote a letter to Sir

We went and took her back into the house, after she was got some distance from the street-door. The gowns are not yet owned. Then in looking about I found this box; there was those sheets, pillow-biers, and napkins in the box. Sir John ordered us to lock them up in a closet, and he sent to the persons that had applied to him that had lost things. The pillow-biers were marked with a coroner.

I entertained her all night, and in the morning she said, she had got some clothes come up in a vessel, and she would go and fetch them. I put my things on, and we went together for them. When we were in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, going along, she was stopped by a person to whom she had pretended to be related, and had robbed her of a cardinal. Then I desired she might be searched, and three of my tea-spoons were found upon her. She must have taken them while I went to dress myself. It would take up three hours to tell the story she told me. (The spoons produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. Simms lived with me two years and a half, till he was taken up. It is about six weeks ago, he came and knocked at my door; I let him in; this was between twelve and one in the night. I went to bed again. I then heard a rumbling in the kitchen. I made my girl get up and see what was the matter. She went, and said, there was a great kettle in the kitchen. Then both the prisoners were in bed together. I made them both get up and carry it away, or, I told them, I would send for an officer, and take them to gaol. They got up, and got a porter, and took it away. When I went to bed, which was about ten o'clock, the kettle was not in the kitchen.</p>

            . I do business for the ship Henrietta; she lay at Deptford at that time. There was a copper lost out of her; it was missed the 19th of March. The ship carried forty-five hands; the copper would dress for so many. It weighed betwixt seventy and eighty pounds weight. The ship is gone to Greenland.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harvey. How much did the copper you carried, weigh?</p>
               <p>Harvey. It weighed about sixty pounds, as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>There was a mate of a ship came on shore, and asked us to go and do a jobb; his hands were gone on shore. He gave us two shillings each to unmoor the ship; she lay off Prince's stairs. When we had done, Lawson asked me to go and lie with him. There were some men coming up the stairs, called Cole-stairs. As we were near them they dropped something, we picked it up; it was a little kettle. Then the watch was going past eleven. We carried it to Doyle's house, and laid it backwards; the next morning we carried it to Whitechapel, and left it there.</p>

               <p>Simms fell right over the kettle; then we took and carried it to Doyle's; he knew of our coming with it, as well as we. It was a bit of old copper that had not been used for years and years. Harvey was paid for carrying it to Whitechapel. It did not weigh above seventeen pounds, and we had but five pence a pound for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of them go to bed with you?</p>


               <p>Brooks. No; but after I was got in bed, Taylor asked me, if I had any objection to her lying with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say in answer to that?</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Brooks. We went to bed about nine o'clock. I know at that time I had my watch; I wound it up before I went to bed, and put it into my breeches pocket, and put them under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I had four guineas and eighteen pence in my handkerchief, in my breeches pocket, at the time I went to sleep, and awaked about one, and she was gone from me. I missed my watch directly, because I did not hear it go. Then I examined my pocket, and my money was gone, and a penny was put into my pocket. Then I sat up in the bed till it was light. Then I got up, and enquired about in the neighbourhood after these women. I did not know what they were till I enquired their character. I found they had been to a shop, and bought each of them a pair of silver buckles. I had no money left to advertise my watch; Mr. Welch advertised it. I never got it again. I took the two prisoners up the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge Rynce?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Because they were in company together, and lived together. The justice asked them, where they bought the buckles? They contradicted themselves in all they said.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say about the watch?</p>
               <p>Brooks. When I took up Taylor, she said, one Polly had got it. Rynce said, she knew nothing of it.</p>

Coming in again, I met the prisoner at the bar coming out. I said, Do you want any body here? He answered, Yes; and named a name which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work there?</p>
               <p>Peak. No; he did not. He had this jack-plane in his hand. I said, My friend, did you bring that plane with you? He said, Yes. I took it and looked at it, and said, You have been robbing the shop. After that, I found the hammer and adz upon him; then I secured him, and took him before justice Welch. He said, he never had done such a thing before, and was very sorry for what he had done.</p>

               <p>M'Donald. I catched him with my coat, coming out at the door. He had lodged at my house four nights, up two pair of stairs; my box was on the ground floor. I took him before a magistrate, and he was committed.</p>

Coming back, I went in at the Goldsmith's arms. There was the prisoner Garnan sitting on the coal-box, and another person asleep at the table. I said, we had had a robbery in the neighbourhood. A person there took me into another room, and asked what things were lost? I said, spoons; a salt-seller. He asked me if I knew the mark? I said, No. He said, the person sitting on the box had shewed him such things. I said, they are Mr. Mould's. I desired him to stay till I fetched him. (It was not above twenty yards distance.) We got a constable, and awaked the prisoner Garnan; and the spoons and salt-seller were taken out of his pocket, which Mr. Mould swore to before Mr. Welch. There he said;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250032"/> he and three more broke into Mr. Mould's house.</p>

After that Mr. Chapman came in; I told him of it. He said, Mr. Mould had been robbed of such things. He fetched him. The prisoner was searched, and the things taken out of his pocket. He was taken before justice Welch: there he confessed he and three more got into Mr. Mould's house, and took the things; but he would not tell their names.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the spoons and salt-seller out of Garnan's pocket. I heard him own he went into the prosecutor's house with others, and took the things; but he would not tell who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he got in?</p>
               <p>Wells. He said they went in at the slap of the cellar window; that they broke the bar, and took out other things (that had not been found); then they came out at the street door.</p>

They met me; one or more seized me; they tore my hat; I held it fast; then they went behind me and took my cloak. I said, You had better give me my cloak. Then Catharine Goodwin turned again, and with her double fist knocked me down, and cursed me, and said something very vile, but I can't remember the words. I saw one of the other three with my cloak at that time. (She produced her gown very dirty by the fall.) When I got up, I saw a poor-looking man; I told him what they had done, and told him which way they were gone; and desired he would pursue them: they were in the very next field. Soon after came another man: I told him of it. Another man was coming; he heard me tell him. They both pursued. When the prisoners saw themselves pursued, they left the cloak upon the ground. The young man took it up, and brought it to me. The two men were quite strangers to me. They took all the four prisoners at Kentish-town. When they saw me, she that knocked me down, said, Well, I am ready to answer it, if she (meaning me), would swear it. I am very clear the four girls are the four persons that took my cloak: they were carried before the justice that afternoon.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Pancras parish. About one o'clock that day, two young men came to me, and said, a young woman had been knocked down and robbed of her cardinal; and they are gone towards the fields. I was in my own house in Kentish-town. I pursued them the way that goes towards the Foundling-hospital, and overtook them in a field in the common path that goes to London. The prosecutrix had followed them back from Kentish-town towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them first?</p>
               <p>Balanger. I first saw them about half a quarter of a mile from the first field that goes from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250033"/> Kentish-town towards London. Two of them were running, and two of them walking. When I spoke to them, they made use of two or three oaths. When I stopped them, they seemed rusty, and would not go with me. I said, if they would not go quietly, I should use such means they would not like. I carried them back to Kentish-town to the boarding-school, and asked, who was the gentlewoman that was robbed? The prosecutrix turned round. I said, Do you know these girls? She said, They are the girls that robbed me; then she had the cardinal with her. I asked the man that took up the cloak, Did you see these girls do the robbery? He said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners say any thing to that?</p>
               <p>Balanger. They did not acknowledge it. One said, She knew nothing of it. Another said the same. Goodwin said to one of the other, You b - h, don't you turn pastry-cook *.</p>
               <p>* The cant word, Not to puff.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I returned again from the two men that went after the prisoners, to Kentish-town. The two men had seized them, and brought them back to me. The two men thought it would cause trouble, and they left me; then the prisoners walked towards London.</p>
               <p>Balanger. They were going towards London when I took them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Most of the people were for my letting them go: and some said, if I did not prosecute them, they would me.</p>

            . I went out of the Half-moon tavern, Cheapside, about two in the morning, on the 16th of February. When in Red Lion street, Whitechapel, I heard several people behind me, making a great noise. I immediately stopped and let them pass me.

               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>Langfor. There were three of them. I turned about, and asked, what they meant by that? One of them immediately replied, D - n his blood, down with him. I thought it time to prepare myself. One of them advancing, I knocked him down with an oak stick which I had in my hand. The prisoner then immediately collared me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Langfor. I did not. In the struggle we both fell down. While I was down they got my money and watch from me; I cannot tell whether the prisoner or the other took them. Then they immediately made off, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Langfor. I was sober; it was a light morning, and there were several lamps near me. The next morning I went to Sir

When I returned, which was betwixt eight and nine, before I opened my door, I observed my window was open, the glass was broke, and a short curtain was let down; I told my wife I thought my house was robbed. She immediately went over to my neighbour, Mr. Betley: he came, and followed me into the house. As soon as we were in, he said, I'll shut the door, to secure all that are in. I then heard a fort of a struggling behind the door; I was rather farther in the house than he. Mr. Betley mentioned the word thief. I turned round, and saw him struggling with a man. I called out for assistance; a neighbour came; we secured him, and brought him into an inward room. It was the prisoner at the bar. We sent for Mr. Sheene, the constable, who took charge of him. I found a looking-glass was lying under the window, which, at our going out, was hanging up; and a piece of stuff was taken out of a drawer, and laid upon the glass. I went up stairs, and observed another looking-glass, that did stand upon a chest of drawers, was put upon the bed, upon the quilt, and the quilt folded up, much the same as when in the drawer. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to). I am very sure the windows were fast when I went out, and the door double locked. I did not think of staying till dark, so I did not put up the window shutter. I was the last out of the room above stairs, and the last out of the house. The quilt was in the drawer where the glass stood upon when we went out. The constable carried the prisoner to the watch-house; and, on the Monday morning, we took him before Sir

Said he, You have more; I said, No. He immediately felt at my pocket, and snatched my watch and away he ran. It was a plain metal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250035"/> watch. I did not perceive he had any weapon. It was very dark: there was no moon. I cannot pretend to say I have any notion who it was. There were two men brought to me; I could not fix upon one more than the other; they were both lusty men. The man that robbed me was tall, and, I believe, a blue coat on; whether he had his hair, or a wig, I do not know; it seemed to be very full of hair. I was advised to advertise the watch as lost, as the best way to hear of it again, which I did that very evening; and the next day the watch was stopped.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hill, a pawnbroker, in Carnaby-street. The prisoner brought this watch to me on Monday, the 26th of February, about eleven in the morning. I had known him upwards of two years. He used to be dressed in different sorts of clothes; sometimes a laced waistcoat, sometimes plain; sometimes a long tail wig, sometimes a round wig; sometimes with his hair curled behind. He was a customer to our shop with his clothes and things; he asked eight guineas upon the watch. I went backwards, and told my master here was a man had brought a watch which he thought was gold, and it was not: then my master came with me into the shop. Master asked him what he wanted upon it: he said eight guineas. Master asked whose it was; he said somebody had sent him with it, but did not say who. Master asked him how he came by it, holding it in his hand; the prisoner took hold of it, trying to snatch it; broke the chain. Then I got over the counter, and laid hold of him, and told him he should go before Major

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I left my lodgings about six in the evening, and went to see an acquaintance at Westminster. I staid there till eight; I found this watch between Stable-yard gate and Spring-garden gate, going home. On the Monday morning I got up and got much in liquor, and did not know rightly what it was. I went to this man; he showed it to his master. I said I wanted eight guineas; he said, Is it your own? I said, That is no matter, if you don't like it, give it me again. He said, you must go before the Justice. I said, With all my heart. We went to Major Spinnage's; the Major knew me. I went to Tothill-fields Bridewell along with the Major's man, and no body else. The watch being advertised as lost, proves that I found it. (He produced the paper, with the advertisement in it).</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor has told the reason he advertised it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say before the Justice you never saw me before you saw me there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I might say so.</p>

            . I live in Union-street, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250036"/> top of Hill-street, Berkley-square, and am a mantua-maker. I have known the prisoner about nine months; he told me he had found a watch near Spring-garden, and went to pledge it, and it was stopped. On the Wednesday morning, going to see him, I went into a public house, and asked to see a news-paper; and, in the Tuesday's paper, I saw this advertisement. I took a pen and ink, and wrote it out. The prisoner said he believed the prosecutor lived near Northumberland-street. I was going along the King's Mews; I saw the master of a coffee-house; I asked him if he knew where the gentleman was that lost his watch. He said he lived at No. 4, in Northumberland-street. I went there, to know if he would take bail; the woman said no such-person lived there. As I was coming along Long-acre, coming back, I saw the gentleman riding down St. Martin's-lane very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you do to know him?</p>
               <p>M. Eubridge. I was at Major Spinnage's with the prisoner, and the gentleman was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined there?</p>
               <p>M. Eubridge. No. At the Major's the gentleman said he could not swear to the prisoner. I desired a person to desire the gentleman to stop; he did. The gentleman came riding back. I said I should be glad to speak to you, concerning the person in prison. He said he would be very glad to speak with me, and desired me to go to his lodgings, which I did. Then he said he was very lorry for the man, and that he did not miss his watch for ten minutes after. I said it was very hard an innocent man should suffer in prison; he said so it was, and he would use all his interest to get him out of confinement. I told him there was sufficient bail ready. He said he was going out of town for eight days, and should be in town the Tuesday following, and desired me to come again. I went on the Thursday morning by ten; he said he was sorry he should be confined; that he really believed he was innocent, but did not care to interfere in it himself; and could do nothing in it.</p>

            's, when the prisoner was there; then she passed for his wife. She came to me, as his wife, and cried very much, and said he had found the watch. I said it would appear upon the trial whether he had or not; and said to her, I am very sorry for you with all my heart; it is an affliction upon you. In regard to the man, I cannot swear to him, but as for telling her I did not miss my watch at the time, I did not say any thing to her at all about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Isnell. It was not very dark, and it was not day-light; it was dusk; between the two. As they came near me, I went to give them the way; one came upon my right shoulder, the other fronting me; just by the four cross roads, between two ditches, one of them said, I want your money; give me your money; stand: that I believe to be Green. I saw a pistol. He was fronting me: the other put his hand to my breeches pocket, and took out four-pence halfpenny; and took hold of the string of my watch and pulled it out. The inside case was gold; the outside was metal. The other asked me whether I had any more money; I told him, No, and desired they would not use me ill.</p>

He directed me to go to Mr. Brebrook, who had people on purpose to go after such people to take them. Mr. Gloucester went with me there: we got two men to go with us; they had a pistol and a cutlass. We went to Stepney church, and saw nobody. The next day I went to Sir

Then I went to Duke's-place among the Jews,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250037"/> and told what reward I would give for my watch, five guineas: I inquired at silversmiths shops and pawnbrokers shops; and, on the 9th of March I found my watch at Mr. Gregg's shop, a pawnbroker, in Barnaby-street, with a chain and seal added to it, not mine. (The watch produced and deposed to). It had a green silk string to it when I lost it. We took Green up that same afternoon in Tooly-street. A Jew had told me he had seen the watch in the hands of Clark. He described it. He directed me to a waterman that carried the prisoner's box, who told me where to find the prisoners. We went to where they lodged. I took Green first; Clark tumbled out of bed at our going into the room. We secured him, and charged the constable with them both. After that Clark owned where the watch was; but said he bought it of a sailor; then I went to Mr. Gregg's where he said the watch was, and there I found it. The prisoners never acknowledged the taking it from me.</p>

I went: there was Green: the prosecutor said that was one: we asked him where his companion was. He began to blast his eyes and limbs, and said, Would you have me go and search all Wapping, among all the thieves? I said, That is doing yourself no good. He asked us to go up stairs: we went up; there was Clark in bed. He got out of bed. The prosecutor said that was the other: then we laid hold of him.

I made the more haste to come up with them, thinking I should have company. When I came near them, I thought they were old men going arm in arm, with their hats flapped. I did not much like it; I did not know whether it would be best to run back again; I was within two or three yards of them. I thought if I did they might run back after me; it was very dark. I went past them, with my cane in my hand. When I was two or three yards before them, I heard them whisper something: one of them came up to me, and took me by the collar with his right hand, and pitched me against the rails, and put a pistol to my breast, and bid me stop. I asked them what they wanted; they told me to put my hand into my pocket, and give them my money. I desired them not to use me ill, and they were welcome to my money: I pulled out two half guineas, a five and-three-penny piece, and two shillings, and gave him; then the other searched the lining of my coat: he that had hold of me said, Look for his watch; they took it: then they turned round towards White-chapel, and wished me a good night.

One of the people that belonged to the prison in the Borough, came and asked me if I had been robbed. I said, Yes, of a watch. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250038"/> desired me to take a pen and ink and describe it. I did. He said he had seen it, and it was in the hands of Justice Spencer, and desired I would come over on the Monday, and I might see it and the people. I went on Tuesday, the 13th, and saw it and the prisoners at Margaret's-hill; I believe the prisoners to be the two men that robbed me, but I cannot swear to them, it was so dark. (The watch produced and deposed to). It was made for me; there was a very fine steel chain to it, and two gold seals; one of them my coat of arms.</p>

When we were before Justice Spencer, I told him one of them had a very fine watch in his pocket (he had shewed me the watch and seals before); that was Green; who said he bought it of a Jew in Wapping, for two guineas and a half.

            . I am servant to Mr. Strange, the keeper of the New-Gaol in the Borough. On the 9th of March, the prisoners were brought to our gaol; I locked them both up; one in one place, the other in another. One of them, upon unlocking in the morning, said, I have something to disclose to you. I said, What is that? Said he, I cannot tell you here, because I may get myself killed. He gave me an account of these five pistols being loaded, in the very room where they lived. I told Mr. Spencer of it: he said, Mr. Reynolds will be here presently; I will order him to see after them.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was there another woman lay along with the prisoner and you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was none but the prisoner lay along with me.</p>

He told me, the reason of his leaving England was, his friends were for forcing him to marry against his inclination, and that he had no money. He said, his name was Howard, pretending himself to be a relation to the Duke of Norfolk. I returned to England in the year 1769, about October; and brought the prisoner over with me. He lodged at an inn, and used to come every day to see me. I keep a warehouse. I lost a box of joining lace, more than 100 yards, and fifteen or sixteen pair of gentlemens Mecklin ruffles, in the year 1769. After I found the prisoner was not the man he pretended himself to be, which I found about the 6th or seventh of last February,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250040"/> I desired him not to come to my house. After that, may be he would come once a fortnight. He brought these Mecklin ruffles to me the 10th of February; (the very moment I saw them, I knew them to be mine.) He offered to sell them to me. I did not claim them then, thinking he might bring more of my goods that I missed. I think, the Wednesday following he brought some joining lace, which I knew to be mine. I said, Sir, I think you may make me a present of this piece of lace. He said, he would give me two yards of it; I said, I wanted it all. I said, This is mine; I shall keep it. He said, he did not understand that; he should send his sister for the money. I found at the bottom of the lace my own paper, with my marking, in figures, and my name on it. Then I said, Now, sir, I will stop it, and I will swear it to me mine. I desired him to tell me where he bought it. He said, he bought it at Lisle, of one Carpentear. I said, I should write to that person. Then he said, Carpentear sold it to one Clark. He went away, and came again about six, and told me, my husband was by when he bought the lace of Carpentear. He told me, it was very lucky Mr. Carpentear was in town; he had just met him; and said, if I would deliver the lace to him, he would bring Mr. Carpentear the next morning. I said, I should keep the lace till I saw him. Then I demanded the ruffles that he had shewed me. He said, they were at Mr. Child's, a banker, at Temple Bar; and he could not have them back again. I said, I would have them. Then he said to me, Send your son for them. I desired him to give my son a note to Mr. Child for them. He said, he did not know his hand-writing; but he bid my son give his compliments to Mr. Child, and ask for them. When my son was gone; the prisoner went away; I sent my maid to follow him, but she lost him. (The lace produced in court, sealed with Justice Spencer's seal, and the prosecutrix's.)

He desired me to go in his name, for the two pair of ruffles. I went: when I was near Mr. Child's house, he came and tap'd me on my shoulder, and said, We have no business to go there; let us go and drink a glass of wine. Then we went up the Strand; I think he said, Mr. Child was not at home. We went near the New Church; he there said, he would go and see if Mr. Clark was at home. He went, and soon returned, and said, he was not at home, Then we came to the Goose and Gridiron in St. Paul's church-yard: there we drank; I said, What excuse can I make for staying so long? Said he, You may say Mr. Child was not at home; and when I came home I did say so.</p>

            . I lived a little better than three months with Mrs. Compagnon. I have heard her complain of losing lace: at that time the prisoner used to come every day; he went by the name of Howard. The lace was kept in the dining-room, and he used to go there.</p>

I went to bed on the 31st of March, and awaked between five and six the 1st of April. My sister came into my room, and said, she was perfectly certain our new lodger had been in my room; and desired me to see if I had lost any thing. I had left my breeches at the corner of my pillow; I examined them, and missed four guineas. I went and got a constable. Then we went to the prisoner, and I asked him, if he remembered being in my bed-room? He said, No. I said, Look over your money, and see if you have not more than your own. I observed him take out four guineas from one pocket. Then he began to tell his money over, and at last he said. Here are four guineas more than I know of; if they are yours, take them. My breeches lay in the morning pretty near where I had left them. Then I charged the constable with him; he was examined at Guild-Hall on the Monday.</p>

            . I let the prisoner in a little after twelve at night; he seemed very much in liquor. I gave him a candle; he went up stairs to bed. I listened, and heard him make a noise. I went up to see what he was about; he was coming down, and said, he could not find his room. I went and opened the door, and let him in, and shut the door, and went down stairs. In about five minutes I went up again, and into my own room, and heard him open his door, and stand some time at the door, and then shut it again. Then he opened it again, and came out, and went to my brother's room, and pushed the door open. My brother's room is close to his room. I listened some-time, and heard him chink money in my brother's room. Then he came out, and went into his own room, and locked his door; and I heard no more of him. At about six in the morning, I went and awaked my brother, and asked him, if he knew what money he had in his pocket when he went to bed? He said, Yes. I told him, I thought I heard the prisoner in his room. He recollected, and said, he missed four guineas.</p>

               <p>I am conscious of my innocence in this affair. I had been in Ratcliffe Highway, and was in liquor. I met an acquaintance. How I came home, or whether he came with me, or who was in company, I know not; nor do I recollect one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250044"/> single thing till the next morning. Mr. Hunt came into my room, and asked me, if I was in his room that night? I did not know the room that I took of him; his door is just by mine. Who let me in, or at what time, I do not recollect. I heard the watchman call three o'clock, when I found myself asleep. Said Mr. Hunt, You had better look over your money; see whether you have more than your own; because I have lost some money. I took my breeches from under my head, and told him, I had got four guineas more than I can say how I came by. He said, they were his property; and I gave them to him. Then he charged a constable with me, and sent me to the Compter.</p>

I had not stopped above two minutes, before I felt a tug very hard at my left hand pocket, in which was a shirt, a neckcloth, and a handkerchief. I turned my head immediately, and saw the prisoner's hand go from my pocket, and whip it under his coat and run. I ran after him. There were no people passed till we came to the gateway under St. Magnus church. I saw him stop all at once. I told him, he was the man that robbed me. He never was out of my sight. I was going to search him. A man said, That man that you have hold of, I saw push a little bundle through the bannisters of the bridge. I looked through, and saw the water was low. The people looked, and said, There is a bundle lying on the ledge, on the outside, a little below the bannisters, where boys can run round. I got the prisoner near the bannisters, and looked through, and saw it was my bundle; I said, I would satisfy any body if they would get it me. A sailor jumped over the bannisters, and put it through to me; for which I gave him some halfpence. ( Produced in court and deposed to.) I charged a constable with the prisoner. When we were taking him away, he said, if I would forgive him, he would never do so more.</p>
               <p>W. Baker. Coming over London Bridge, on Good Friday at night, about nine, I met a man in full run. Just before he came to me, I saw him chuck something through the bannisters of the bridge. The prosecutor was up with him immediately, and took hold of him. There was no other man came near. I believe the prisoner is the man. The prosecutor looked through, and said, it was his bundle. A sailor got over and shoved it through.</p>

He breakfasted, and staid till twelve o'clock. He called me to draw him a pint of beer. While I went down to draw it, I thought I heard somebody in the kitchen; as I came up, I saw the prisoner going out at the door: he got out at the door before I went and got him to come back; when, in the tap room, I took my tablecloth from him. I asked him what business he had with it; he said he took it out of a joke. (Produced and deposed to). He paid for all he had. He is a butcher. I had seen him twice in my house before, but do not know where he lives.</p>

I had made a hole through a board, through which I saw him take some rough brass, newly cast; such as we break off from the good work, and melt down again.

He walked with me seven or eight yards, I believe, and then bid me stop, and put a pistol to my head, and said, If I spoke a word he would blow my brains out; then Milbank, the evidence, came up, and put another pistol to my head, and said the same; then up came Newman, and put a pistol to my head, and took hold of Milbank's pistol while Milbank placed me against the wall. (I had seen Newman before about the street). Then they began to take my money out of my pocket. Newman and Bowers held the pistols; Milbank unbuttoned my breeches to see for my watch. I had none. Then he took three guineas and a half out of my fob, a quarter guinea and sixteen shillings out of my breeches pocket; they felt in my other pockets, and found nothing else. They then bid me go about my business, and not speak a word, for if Idid, they would kill me on the spot. I went about seven or eight yards; they followed me, and bid me shop again, and placed me up against the wall, with the pistol at my head again. They cut off my waistcoat pocket, with seven shillings worth of halfpence in it, and a pen-knife: they then bid me go about my business, and not say a word. I went a little farther; there came a cart and three or four men; I hallooed to them for assistance; they did not hear me; the cart making such a noise, I imagine, prevented them. Then the prisoners called to me again. I ran as hard as I could till I got into the Crooked Billet alehouse. There was a fourth man, but he stood behind Milbank; I could not make any observation of him; he did not come near me. The prisoners were taken the same night, and the people came to me at the Crooked Billet for me to see them. I went to see them, and they had broke out of the Bail-dock in Whitechapel, and were not taken again till the last day of last sessions. I went upon the Sunday after to Tothill-fields Bridewell, there I saw Milbank, and knew him directly. I did not see the rest till they were brought before Sir

            . On the 26th of January I took Kellyhorn, about eleven at night, out of his lodgings in East Smithfield. I brought him about half way from Salt petre Bank; he said. Put a pair of hand-cuffs on me, and I'll go and shew you the others that were with me, that did a robbery this night: accordingly I did; he went where Bowers was in bed. I took him, and Newman came to see what was the matter; then Kellyhorn said, That is another that was with us in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Paggett. This was in Black-horse yard in East Smithfield. He said, Bowers, Newman, and Milbank, were with him; Milbank was in bed in Black-horse yard, at another house; he got off: we took them up to Whitechapel, and locked them up in the Bail-dock; Bowers and Newman broke out; we had Kellyhorn in another lock-up place, thinking he should be admitted an evidence; and he was admitted at the Rotation, and was out upon bail, on purpose to find Bowers and Newman again.

               <p>Paggett. I do not know whether he did or not; he was told of it afterwards; and he said he could not then go from it.</p>

               <p>Paggett. He was taken up upon Milbank's evidence for this robbery, by Sir John's warrant, and carried before him. I told Sir John what had passed, and produced the information. I think Mr. Camper was one that took the information.</p>

I went up stairs with the watchman, and found the window shutter broke open in the parlour, in the ground-floor; the fastening that the bolt goes into of the window was wrenched off: three locks of the drawers were broke, and the things in the indictment were missing; a linen gown and petticoat, a red and white linen gown and petticoat, a pair of stays, three linen shifts, a cloth apron, a muslin apron, a blue sattin cloak, four silver pins, set with stones, a gold ring, a pair of gold ear-rings, a pair of green ear-rings, a black sprig, a black silk handkerchief, a white linnen gown, and a dimothy petticoat, my property.

            . I am one of the patrol belonging to St. Ann's lower liberty. I believe it was about half past one o'clock that night, I was standing in Union-court, speaking to a watchman. The prisoner came past, and two companions with him; he had this bundle under his right arm. I seized him by the collar, and called for assistance. The watchman hit him on his head, and knocked his hat off: he hit again, and hit my hand; I said, Hold your hand. The prisoner dropped his bundle; one of the men behind him pointed a pistol at me, and said he would fire if I did not let him go. I said, You may fire away. He turned round and fired at one of the watchman; the pistol flashed in the pan, but did not go off. Then a watchman took hold of the other side of the prisoner's collar, and we brought him to the watch-house; the other two got away. One of my fellow-servants picked up the bundle, and brought it after us. As we were carrying the prisoner to the watch-house, he sumbled at his right side coat-pocket. He dropped a piece of iron. I called to a watchman to see in that place if he did not find a piece of iron. He picked up a chissel within a yard of the place where I told him. The prisoner was searched: there was a piece of candle, and a snuff box, he called it, but it was a tinder-box. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>- Crocker. I am a watchman. I was standing in Union-court, talking to Shaw; that is better than half a mile from the prosecutrix's house. The prisoner came by with a bundle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250050"/> and two men at a little distance from him; Shaw told him, he should detain him. The prisoner said, The watchman knows me very well, (I black shoes sometimes, and I have blocked his.) After he was seized, the two men that were about six yards behind him, stepped up, and with a great oath, said, they would blow our brains out if we did not let him go. I did not see the pistol. The third man snapped a pistol; it flashed in the pan, but did not go off. We took the prisoner and his bundle to the officer of the night; the other two went away.

I knew the prisoner by sight before, but did not know his name. The other of them presented a pistol to my head, and demanded my money. The prisoner put a pistol to my left breast, and demanded my money. They took from me 4 s. 6 d. some half-pence, and a Pinchbeck metal buckle out of my right-foot shoe, and an iron tobacco-box. They demanded my watch; I told them, I had none. They searched, but found none. Then they went on towards the turnpike, and I went home. I looked the prisoner full in the face, and knew that I had some knowledge of him. I cannot be positive to the other. I went to Sir

I took them in Black-horse-yard, East Smithfield, in his own room; there I found two horse pistols, an iron crow, two cutlasses, and two dark lanthorns in a box. ( Produced in court.) One of the pistols was loaded with a ball, the other with slug shot. They were examined the next day; the prosecutor came in and looked on the prisoner, and said, I am sure that is one that robbed me.</p>

            ; she was sitting at another table when I came in. I over-took the soldier on the steps. Riddal came and pitied me, and said, O poor woman! Are not you ashamed to use the poor woman so? D - n your eyes, said he; then she took me by one arm, and Holmes by the other. Then Soddi came up, and they all three of them dragged me down towards the iron gate. Riddal quitted my arm, and came and took my ear-rings out of my ears, and pulled my cap about my neck. Soddi took my necklace and ribbon off. Then they took my apron and stays, and my petticoat, a new one. They dragged my poor body about; they cut my lace and petticoat strings; they took one of my shoes and my two buckles, they were plated ones. They mauled and tore my gown to pieces; they left me one shoe, my stockings, garters, and gown, and my cap about my neck. Riddal gave me a drive, and knocked me down, and they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out?</p>
               <p>E. Pever. I did, to the centinel. Then the prisoners d - d my eyes, there was no centinel there.</p>
               <p>Q. How cam e you to go with this man which you had never seen before?</p>
               <p>E. Pever. He said he would see me safe home.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do for a living?</p>
               <p>E. Pever. I take in washing. I had been to see an acquaintance at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any of your things again?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250053"/>E. Pever. I saw my bonnet at Mr. Steel's, a pawnbroker at Westminster, the next morning. He is not here. I never got any of my things again. Holmes was taken upon the Parade the Friday following; the women were taken up last Monday fortnight. Riddal said before the Justice, she had an odd buckle and a broken one; and she met two young fellows, and they made her put my buckles in her shoes, and go and buy a lace, and they laced my stays on her; and she put my clothes on, and went and lay at Bloody-Bridge. Holmes said before the Justice, that I followed him to the Tilt-yard cellar. The waiter was put to his oath; he said, I said several times to Holmes, I wanted to go home; and that he offered my new bonnet for the two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>W. Jones. Last Monday was fortnight in the morning, I was carrying a pennyworth of beer from the White Bear, Park-street. The landlord said, there was a soldier taken for robbing a woman who was at Grosvenor Gate. I went there. The prosecutrix was there; she knew me; she was crying for somebody to secure the people that had robbed her. I took her to the Red Lion, Grosvenor Gate; there was Riddal. As soon as she saw her, she said, That is one of the women that robbed me; and cried, and made great lamentation. I told Riddal the consequence of it. She said, D - n it, as I am in the mess, I'll shew you the other, and go along with you. She went with me to the Magazine in Hyde Park, where the other girl was concealed by the soldiers. I went to the gate, and desired admittance. The soldiers were very rude, and refused me admittance at first. When I got admittance, I found her concealed in a hole. As soon as Riddal saw her, she said, That is the girl that was along with her. I brought them both down to Sir

            's; then Riddal said, she would tell all, and clear herself, as we were going along. She wanted to be an evidence before Sir John; but the prosecutrix swore positively to them all three. He would not admit her. The soldier was in custody a week or ten days before, and came up to be examined. Riddal said, it was not this soldier, but two other men. I never heard the soldier confess any thing.</p>
               <p>Holmes's Defence.</p>
               <p>I happened to go into a house in the Ambury, where this woman was. I never saw her with my eyes before. I called for a pint of beer; she snatched it up, and gave it to the other woman. I called for another, and paid for it, and went out of the house; she followed me to the Tilt-yard. I was some yards before her; I never kept her company. I got upon the steps, and was talking to a brother-soldier; she followed me, and had like to fell down the steps. I called for a pint of beer, and she came and sat down on the other side the table; then she went into other company, about ten or a dozen soldiers, all strangers to me; there she danced. I never drank with her at all. She went out up by the steps, and three or four soldiers with her. I never went nigh the Park that night.</p>
               <p>Riddal's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was up in Hyde Park all day long; I am an unfortunate girl of the town. I had had no business all day. We went to a cook's-shop, and had two pennyworth of meat each at night. Coming back, I heard a great cry in the Tilt-yard; there I saw four soldiers round the woman, taking her cloaks from her shoulders; we were afraid to come near them. I went in and got a pint of beer; the woman came in and sat down between seven soldiers. She pulled off her ring, and said to one of the corporals, she would pledge her ring for some money. A person took it up stairs, and brought it down in about a quarter of an hour, and said she should pay a gallon of beer before she had it again. He gave it her; she put it on her finger, and went up the stairs, and came down again, and called for a pint of beer without her bonnet, and her ring was gone. Then I and the girl with me, went out, and up into the Park; I believe it was then near about a quarter after nine. This woman came along, and two men with her; one had a black waistcoat on, and the other a white coat. We were just by the canal-side; one of them drawed a knife upon me, and said, if I did not stand there, he would run it through me to the heart. We did not stir; (that is, me and my partner.) They came by me with a pair of stay, a petticoat, and an apron; I never had them in my hand. They gave each of us a clout on the head, and went away; we both cry'd, and went to the Ambury to bed, at Mother Brown's. I never heard of it till I was going up the Park to see the recruits fire; then the woman came to me and said, I was one of the women that robbed her. I said, Pray call a constable; I'll go with you. Then she began abusing me, calling me all the whores, blasting my eyes and limbs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250054"/> then we went to the magazine, and took

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I was up in the warehouse, stowing some goods on the 24th: about six in the evening I came down to the bottom stair; I thought I saw a corner of a box upon a man's back at the warehouse door below. There was nobody in the shop at the time, nor no light; it was dusk. I went and overtook the prisoner in about one hundred yards, with this box of argoll on his shoulder. (Produced and deposed to as the master's property). I had packed it up, in order to be sent into the country. He flung the box down, and I flung him on his back. When I secured him he swore he never saw or touched it.</p>
               <p>Joachim Tco'Lewis. I, the prisoner, and two others, went out a stealing what we could get. The prisoner went into that warehouse, and took a box; there was a man with a white coat came and collared him. and we went away. I was tried here and acquitted last session. (See No. 165, by the name of St. Lewis).</p>

The prisoner and another Jew came into our shop; I think it was the 17th of April 1769, between six and seven in the morning, under pretence of buying old clothes; as I was shewing some, the prisoner ran away with a piece of white jean from off the counter; twenty yards of it: they bought no clothes. I missed it immediately after they were gone; I went out to see for him; the other was then in the shop. I found the prisoner in the church-yard. I brought him back. He threw the piece down, and got away. I never saw him since till now. (the piece produced in court and deposed to). The other person was kept in the warehouse till my master came down. He was carried before my lord mayor and discharged.</p>

            . One day I went with the prisoner past this house, along with the other man that was with him. I wanted to go into that warehouse; the prisoner said, Do not go in there, because it is dangerous; this is the house in which I took a piece of white goods, and was taken, and I left the goods and got away. These two men have been concerned with me in several other robberies.</p>

On the 18th of this month, there was a large piece of beef dressed on account of Mr. Alderman Wilkes's enlargement. I saw the prisoner in the kitchen about eight; he was helping Mrs. Hatton and the maid to spit the meat. He had had a quarrel with his uncle, who is of the same employ as I am. I indulged him to let him lie in my bed for three or four nights, and I lay out of it myself. I had lent him a cane the Sunday fortnight before: when I saw him below, I asked him for it; he said he would go and get it: he went out; I saw no more of him that day. I went out, and returned about eight at night. I asked if they had seen the prisoner: I was told he had been there, but was suddenly missed. I went to bed, and the next morning I awaked about six. I missed my watch, my money out of my left-hand breeches pocket, a quarter guinea and ten shillings: my keys were gone, and my drawers open; my silver buckle out of my shoes. I alarmed Mrs. Hatton: she and her sister got up; we went down stairs, and found the door was left upon the slip-lock; three bolts were left undone. I had heard a bad character of the prisoner; I suspected him. I went in search of him, and found him in a boat along-side a vessel, about eight o'clock that morning. I took him, and brought him home, and sent for an officer, and brought him before my lord mayor. I found one buckle, one seal, and the knife upon him there. He confessed my watch was on board the Nelly,

I went to the iron, and turned it about, to see if there was any mark upon the bars. One of them asked me what I did with it; I told him, I thought it was very heavy for them to carry. I asked where they were going to carry it; they said to one Gibbs, an ironmonger in Smithfield. I asked where they brought it from; they said from Mr. Wilson's, at the Steel-yard. We followed them to St. Paul's church-yard; then one of them beckoned to us, and said, If we would be peaceable and quiet, they would sell the iron, and divide the money among us. They pitched the iron there; it wanted then about a quarter to six. We followed them to Smithfield: then the young fellow that was with me, went forward and found Mr. Gibbs, to ask him if he had so much iron coming to his house at that time in the morning. They were not up; he rang at the bell: the maid looked out, and said her master was getting up. The servant came down first: the master came down by the time the men came with the iron; they pitched it against the window, and knocked at the door. The young man asked Mr. Gibbs if the iron was coming to his house; he said he knew nothing at all about it; he kept a cart and three horses to fetch his own iron home. They sent for a constable and took the prisoners before my lord mayor.</p>

               <p>Wil. Richardson. I shall be sixteen years old in June; I am apprentice to Mr. Rose. The prisoner used to black shoes for my master by the quarter, and would come in two or three times a day to ask how he did since he has been ill. She came in on that day, and went into a little room and lighted her pipe. She knocked with the heel of her shoe; nobody came: then she came a little farther: then she knocked again with her foot against the ground, to see if any body would come. She looked about, and saw nobody there. She took a looking-glass, and put it under her apron. I was behind a post, where I had used to hide myself, to jump out on a sudden to make her start when she has come in. She could not see me, but I could her. She went out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you let her go out with it?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I was rather frightened; and I thought I had better go back and call my fellow apprentice to be in the shop, before I went out: after he came, I went out to look for her, and, in about an hour after, I found her in Chick-lane, by Blackboy-alley, just come out of a public house where her daughter was. I said to her, my mistress wanted her: then she came a little farther. I asked her if she had not been in our shop; she said, Yes. I asked her if she had not taken a glass away; she said, No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rose is a quarterly customer to me. I went into the shop to ask how he did; nobody made answer: then I came out again, and went directly to Hatton garden, to deliver a pair of shoes. Then I went down and asked my daughter if she knew how Mr. Rose did: I met this lad at the door: he said, Mistress wants you; I said, I'll come directly; then they charged me with a constable. I don't know no more of the thing than this bit of green leaf that lies here.</p>

The prisoner said, he came to enquire for one Mr. Jones, a watch-finisher. There were people enough to have informed him, had he asked. There is a back-door to come in at, by which the boy and he must come in. The prisoner begged for mercy at first, and after that he behaved very insolently to every one that came near him.</p>

After that I missed my watch; I charged her with it, and wanted to search her. They said, I should not see her searched; it was not decent. Then Mr. Quick, the landlord, said he would search her. He came out, and said he had searched her naked, and could not find it. Then they said, I had no watch, and called me a good-for-nothing fellow. Then the landlord said, I had dropped it in the necessary. I insisted upon all being searched; but they would not stand search. I went to look in the necessary; when I returned, the landlord said, it was safe enough. I went home and enquired after it, on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Then I went to the sign of the Sun on that same hill, for a pennyworth of purl; the landlady there said, I should find it out by-and-by. The next day I was sent for, and told, a person pretended to have found it. He directed me to a pawnbroker where the prisoner had pawned it. I went to the pawnbroker and asked for it; he told me, I should not see it. I got a warrant, and took the prisoner up, and had her there; then my watch was produced.

            . We are much infested with pick-pockets on Holborn Hill; I being a constable, I saw the prisoner and two others, between the King's Arms and the Swan. We watched them. The prisoner took a gentleman's handkerchief from his pocket. He was laid hold on, and I saw him throw the handkerchief up against a house. I followed the gentleman, and told him his pocket was picked. He came back and looked at the handkerchief, and said, it was his own. When we got back to the end of Shoe-Lane, there were no less than (I believe) fifty; one said, D - n you, you shall not take him; another said the same. I was struck by three of them together. Mr. Bell, another constable, and several other people, came to my assistance, and we got the prisoner into a shop; had not assistance came, I had been used very ill; I know not but I had lost my life in attempting to secure him; but Mr. Bell and I determine if possible to break the knot of them.</p>

I lost two pieces of fir timber, about seven inches square, and thirteen feet long; they stood within my yard; I have a back-way to the yard. One of my men saw them there the day before they were lost; they were lost the 6th of March, we found them the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250061"/> day at Jesson's; he said, he bought them of the other prisoner. We took Dear up; he said, Jesson should go with him if he was transported. He did not deny taking them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jones. On the 6th of March, between ten and eleven at night, I saw two men take the two pieces of timber away. I followed them to a court at the upper end of Thames street. I did not know them, and we found them the next morning at Jesson's. Dear confessed he was one of the men; and Jesson said, he bought them of Dear. There were near twenty feet in all of it.</p>
               <p>Dear's Defence.</p>
               <p>One Edmonds brought it to me, and desired me to carry one piece for him.</p>
               <p>Jesson's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought the timber of Dear, and paid him two shillings in part, and was to pay him the rest the next day. I am no judge of timber.</p>
               <p>Jesson called five people, who gave him the character of a very honest poor man.</p>
