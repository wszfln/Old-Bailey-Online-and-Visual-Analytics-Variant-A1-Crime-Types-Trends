I am a licensed hawker, of Sunbury—on Saturday, 5th Feb., about two o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me to let him have a horse for a week to carry out a contract—I said that he might have one for three days—he said, "I will give you £1 for three days"—he was sober—we went to the Salthorne Inn, and had some drink, and a baker there drew up this document, but did not read it to me, or tell me what was in it; I cannot read or write; the prisoner put his mark to it:—"February 19th, 1896. Bought of George Johnson by Thomas Stone. If not suitable in three days Mr. Stone will pay £10: or £1, and return the horse to the owner"—I had the horse with me—the prisoner got on his back and rode away—at the end of three days I made inquiries and found the prisoner at Hounslow on Sunday, the 9th, sitting on Powder Mill Bridge—I said, "Good-morning"—he said, "Did you have that note I sent you?"—I said, "No; you must come to the Police-station with me"—he said, "I will come if you will forgive me for what I have done"—we went to the Police-station, where he said to the sergeant, "I turned the horse on to the moor"—the sergeant would not take the charge, and told me to go and see whether the horse was there, and come back and let him know—I went to look for it, and in consequence of what I heard I went to Mr. Brazier, of Staines, a horse slaughterer, and in consequence of what he told me I got a warrant—on Tuesday, February 11th, I saw my horse at Mr. Reynolds', at Han worth—the prisoner was arrested, and I charged him—I received no money from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old; I was living at 12, Greenside Road, with my mother and sisters—on Monday, January 20th, I was at school in the morning—I returned about a quarter to one; I had my dinner—about one, mother went upstairs with some dinner—about half-past one I was ready to go back to school; mother had not come downstairs again; I called out "Good-bye," and she answered, I think, from inside Mrs. Pearson's room—I did not hear any other voice in the room—shortly after I left the house my sister Mary ran after me and told me something, and the doctor and police were fetched—the other children are all younger than I.</p>

I am a widow, and by occupation a nurse—up to the 20th January I lived at 12, Greenside Road, Shepherd's Bush, on the first floor, as a lodger of Mrs. Chambers; the prisoner is my son—previous to the 25th September last year he had been away for over six years; I then found him in my room on my return—he did not recognise me; he stayed with me, sleeping on the sofa, for a couple of days or so—when he last left home I had a tumour on the side of my face, which had changed my appearance, and he did not know me—he had been to where I had formerly lodged to inquire where I was to be found—after I spoke to him he knew me—he did not tell me where he had been—I asked him one or two questions, but I got no answer from him; so I did not trouble—I did not know at all where he had been—he remained with me two nights, sleeping on the sofa—he went out during the day, and came back at night; I do not know at all what he did—I told him I had no accommodation for him—he did not seem to take any notice; he went away for four weeks; he did not tell me where he was going; I did not hear from him during those four weeks—he then came back; that must have been towards the end of October; and stayed with me again—I asked him once or twice where he had been, but he made no answer, or very little—he did nothing; he went out in the morning and came back at night—sometimes he would read a little, but he said nothing; he would sit there quiet—I spoke to him several times about the inconvenience of his stopping there, but he made no answer—towards the middle of November he would not eat his food; he was lying in bed for four days; I could not get him up; he would only just take a cup of tea—I asked my doctor what I could do with him; he said I had better have him taken to the infirmary—I have asked him what was the matter with him, but he did not make me any answer—I got an order, and he was taken to Fulham Infirmary for about a month, up to the middle of December; Mrs. Chambers and I went one visiting day to see him there—I asked him if he felt better; he said "Yes"—I told him he had better stay there for the winter, as I could not afford to keep him—he took no notice—I told him he would have to leave, for I was expecting to be called out every day—he came back to me about the middle of December, and stayed as before, and then I left for six weeks—I then asked Mrs. Chambers to attend to him, and left some money with her, and I called in occasionally of an evening to see Mrs. Chambers—on Friday, January 10th, I called and found the prisoner in my room—I got angry with him, and told him</p>

Why did you not open the door when I knocked?"—he made no reply to that—there was a tray in the room, and teacups and plates—I did not see any food; it looked as if food had been taken up—Mrs. Chambers said, "You see I brought him food on this tray, which he had yesterday; I have brought food up to him before, and placed it outside the door, but he has refused to eat it"—he made no answer—the constable and I then came away—he never spoke a word.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The Interpreter explained that "Piedmontese" meant all persons who were not Neapolitans</hi>). I hastily drew back, clutching his shoulders; and his necktie, which was loose, remained in my hand; I gave it to the police; this is it—his friends ran away, he stared at me a little while, and then ran away—I could not run after him on account of the bleeding—a friend of mine, who had been stabbed by the prisoner the week before, took me to the hospital—I was there four days, and have not been able to work yet—I feel the wound still when I cough.</p>

I am chief clerk at the West London Police-court—I was there on 3rd May, when James Saunders was charged with the larceny of a silver kettle, and other things, the property of Lady Hozier—on the hearing of that charge, Redfearn was called as a witness, and gave the evidence in this deposition; it was not read over to and signed by him because the prisoner was discharged; he said: "I live at 330, Edgware Road, and am a jeweller; I produce a soup-ladle and other articles, bought by me on 8th April from a man for 7s., about twelve noon. I do not recognise the prisoner; the man was much younger than the prisoner; there was also a grog-kettle and stand that I left on the counter after the man had gone, and it was stolen soon after I pur<lb/>chased it"—there was a remand, and ultimately Saunders and another man were discharged, as there was not sufficient evidence of identity.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 109, Coleshill Buildings, West<lb/>minster—Redfearn was my employer, at 330, Edgware Road, from the end of February, 1895, to January 4th, 1896—the Green Man public-house is about twenty yards from 330, Edgware Road—I know Saunders as bringing things to sell to Redfearn—I saw him first in April—I saw him in the shop ten to twelve times between April and July—I did not see him after July—the first time I saw him was Monday, April 8th, I believe; it was two days before Sergeant Wheatley came—I saw Redfearn pay Saunders some money that day—before that I saw this silver kettle at the back of the shop—I first saw that kettle on April 8th—I believe Redfearn said to Saunders the stuff was only plated, and he gave him the money—Redfearn asked my opinion about the kettle before Saunders came in—I examined it, and was dubious about its being silver at first—I believe it is not hall-marked; it is of foreign manufacture—I applied a test which showed it was silver of poor quality—Redfearn was present when I tested it; he said it was silver, and he could understand me not believing it was silver in the first place, because of the quality—he agreed it was silver, though of low quality—I did not price it—Redfearn did not say at the time where he got it from; some weeks afterwards he told me Saunders was the man he had bought the kettle of—I was present on the 10th, when Wheatley came and asked me if we had bought a lot for 7s.—I said I did not know—I called Redfearn in, and he produced this kettle, a soup-ladle, two sauce-ladles, some spoons and forks—Wheatley said he would have to produce them at the Police-court on his finding the thief—the things were left on the counter, and we expected the police officers back—Redfearn afterwards told me that the kettle had been stolen from the counter, and he sent a note to the police to that effect—I saw the kettle again in August at the shop, among the stock—Redfearn asked me if I would try and sell it—I believe it to be the same kettle—its weight is 41 oz.—I asked him no questions about it—its value as old silver, if melted down, would be between £4 and £5, I should say—I tried to sell it, but returned it to Redfearn, as I could not get enough for it—I was not at the Police-court in May—I submitted it to Mr. Arrowsmith, a private gentleman—he would not buy it—subsequently Mr. Sandheim had it—this postcard was written to him by Redfearn (<hi rend="italic">staling that he was willing to submit the kettle to him</hi>)—Mr. Sandheim took the kettle away and brought it back—I was Redfearn's manager—we kept the ordinary sale books—when we bought things they were entered on a slate, from which we entered the gross amount in a bought book—no details were entered there of articles purchased—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Sandheim Brothers, jewellers and curiosity dealers, of Ladbroke Grove—I have occasionally made purchases from Redfearn—in August last I saw this kettle in his shop—he told me it was a very fine kettle, and asked me 12s. 6d. an ounce for it, and wanted me to purchase it—I refused to buy—he then wanted me to take it on approval—I told him it was useless my taking it, as we had no customers in town in August for that class of article, but that if he had it later on in the season I did not mind showing it—he said that the people from whom he had it thought very highly of it—he de<lb/>scribed it as weighing 42 oz.—I subsequently gut a postcard from him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240026"/>
               <p>and I had the kettle and stand on approval at 10s. an ounce to me—I had no doubt about its being silver—I did not recognise the foreign hall-mark or test it, but I was satisfied it was silver without testing it—I was in<lb/>clined to think it was Norwegian, but I did not think it was Dutch—it is all hammered—I don't know if it is Dutch—an article of this kind is never made in white metal.</p>

As far as I know, it is unique—I deal in old silver and curios, among other things—I never before saw an article like this—I never saw marks before like those on it—I cannot say where it came from—the value of such an article would depend on its history and on the buyer's appreciation of it, and on its being a fine speci<lb/>men of its school—it only appeared to me as a fine specimen of hammered work, not as belonging to any particular school—to a collector it would not matter whether it was cleaned; both the kettle and the stand are silver.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant F</hi>). I received some information about this burglary, and a description of the stolen kettle—it was put in the police list—on April 10th I went to Redfearn's shop with another officer at 10.30 or 10.45—Redfearn knew me—I asked him if he had bought any plated forks and spoons, and a kettle from a man on 8th (that would be the previous Monday) for 7s.—he hesitated a moment, and then said, "Yes, I bought some odd stuff"—he went into the back shop, and brought out the kettle and stand, two sauce ladles, two tablespoons, five small forks, a pickle fork, a small bottle stand, and a soup ladle, etc.—I looked at them and said, "Is not this kettle silver?"—he said, "No, it is only plated, and of no value"—the other articles I knew were plated—I examined the kettle, but I could see no lion stamp on it—I said, "Did you buy any more property of the man?"—he said, "No"—the list in which was a description of the kettle would reach him in the morning of the 10th—I had another list, in which all the property was mentioned; I showed him that as well—the list he received was the pawnbroker's list; it should have reached him about 8 a.m., or before—this other is the police information; it included the toast-rack, and soda-water bottle stand—I drew the prisoner's attention to the fact that the kettle was in the list, and that it was described us silver; that the things were part proceeds of a burglary, and that no doubt I should arrest the thief shortly, and then he would have to pro<lb/>duce them in the Police-court, and that I would call back and let him know when to do so—I asked him to put them away in a place of safety, as they were stolen property—I asked him if the man who sold them had given his name and address; he said no, that the man told him he had bought them at a rummage sale, and wanted to get rid of them; and that he had given him 7s. for them, though he would have been satisfied with 5s.—I asked him if he would know him again; he said yes; and he described his age as between 30 and 40, 5 ft. 5 in. or 5 ft. 6 in. high, with dark moustache, and the appearance of a dealer—I asked if he had any entry of this transaction in his book; he said No; but that he had on the slate—he took down the slate, which was hanging at the back of his shop; there was a list of the articles in question on that slate; it did not contain the toast-rack or soda-water</p>

               <p>bottle stand—he made a rough list for himself at the time—I went away, and endeavoured to find the thief—the next morning a note was left for me at the station; it was on one of Redfearn's bill-heads: "Awaiting your promise to return yesterday that kettle got stolen off the counter. Please have it put in the list"—it was in the list already—I called at the shop immediately, but did not see him—I called again in the evening, and saw him, and asked for an explanation—he said his assistant had removed it from where he had placed it, and put it on the counter without his knowledge, and during his absence—I told him it was very strange, after being in<lb/>formed by the police, that he had not taken greater care of it, and that I should inform the Magistrate of the facts—he said, Very well; he had done all he could—subsequently Saunders was in custody—about five a.m. on May 2nd, I was sent for, and found Saunders detained in custody, and I told him he would be detained on suspicion of committing this bur<lb/>glary, and that I should get witnesses—I went to Burkiss's house shortly before six, and saw the son, and from what he said I got him to accom<lb/>pany me to the station—when Saunders was charged, he said, "I don't know anything about it; if you knew it was me, why had not you got me before? I have been about here. You will have to prove it"—I received this memorandum of the things from Redfearn on that afternoon; the kettle, toast-rack, and soda-water bottle stand are not on it—in the afternoon, when Saunders was brought up, Redfearn said the man was not there that he bought the property from—Saunders was placed with others—subsequently he gave evidence before the Magistrate—Mott was arrested, brought up with Saunders, and they were both discharged—there was no evidence against them except that of the boy—the Magistrate ordered the things to be given up 'to Lady Hozier—after that we received information, and we went to Redfearn's shop on January 10th—I was present when the kettle was found; I identify it as the same kettle.</p>

You know the one I mean"—he said "No, I have not seen it since"—I said, "Are you sure, as I have reason to believe you have that identical kettle on your pre<lb/>mises now?"—he said, "No, I have not seen it since"—Lady Hozier them noticed this toast-rack and soda-water bottle stand on a shelf in the window at the back part of the shop—I asked the prisoner to get them down; he did so—she said she was sure they were her property—I looked about for the kettle, and again said to him, "I still believe the kettle is on your premises"—he said, "No, I can assure you it is not here"—I then called in Wheatley and Collins, who were outside—I said "These are police officers as well as myself, and I am going to search your premises"—I ultimately got on a stool, and, looking round his shop, I saw this kettle and stand separate in the window, and behind a kind of picture clock, quite out of sight—no one could see it from outside or within—I brought it down and showed it to the prisoner—her ladyship immediately identified it—I said, "You hear what this lady says"—he said, "Yes, I hear what she says, but I did not know that was the article you were referring to"—I said, "You will now be charged with feloniously receiving this kettle and other property stolen from this lady, well knowing it to have been stolen"—he said, "I have an explanation to give"—I said, "How did you come by it?"—he said, "I don't know how I came by it"—I searched the premises, and in the fireplace of a bedroom on the top floor I found this apparatus for smelting gold and silver with two crucibles and two moulds—it would be used with gas—on lifting up a board I saw pipes, communicating with the meter in the base<lb/>ment which could be attached to the apparatus—there was an arrangement in a cupboard by which the burners could be lowered, and so more pressure got on the gas for the apparatus—I also found a considerable quantity of broken silver, consisting of the tops of pepper-boxes, scent bottles, cases of watches, and all sorts of articles-everything that bore a crest or monogram could be readily melted down; this is as large a smelting apparatus as I have ever seen—I never saw a jeweller have one like it; refiners have them—I did not find any articles from which the prisoner could have made silver jewellery after melting these things down—I found these mathematical instruments in a drawer in the shop, wrapped in paper—these two silver spoons I found in the prisoner's safe—the toast-rack and plated spoons with the initials J.B.D., and this lobster pick I found in a cheffonier in the prisoner's dining-room—the articles</p>

Pringle and Co. sell crucibles like it; this catalogue contains an illustration very much like it—before I went to Redfearn's I had seen Smith, and had a conversation with him—I did not know where to find the kettle—you could not see it from outside the shop—I was in the shop half or three-quarters of a hour before I found it, and then I did so by getting on a stool—he told me he had been for forty years a jeweller in the Edgware Road; that is not true—he has been there fifteen years—I never searched a jeweller's premises before—most manufacturing jewellers are refiners; they would have a larger apparatus, but they might have one like this—Redfearn was not a manufacturer, but only a retail dealer in old and new plate—this apparatus is not large enough for a refiner.</p>

I can prove I did not sell it. Why, he said it was stolen from his shop. I can bring witnesses to prove I did not sell it to him"—Red<lb/>fearn had given evidence at the Police-court to the effect that the article had been stolen from his premises, and Saunders would have heard that—I took possession of several books at Redfearn's place, among them a bought book—there was no entry of a purchase of a kettle in April—there appears every month an entry of the purchase of so many ounces of old gold and silver, with the price, without details—on April 13th the amount is £14 4s.—the lists were left by different officers during all this, time.</p>

                  </hi> (408 <hi rend="italic">X.</hi>) On Wednesday, January 29th last, about 12.50 a.m., I was on duty in Prince's Road, Netting Hill, and heard a disturbance in William Street—I found the prisoner and a woman outside 37, William Street—the woman said in his presence, "I charge this-man with striking my baby 'across the head with a shovel"—I said, "Fetch the baby down for me to see"—she went into the house and; brought out the baby; there were no marks of violence on it; there was a smear of blood on the forehead; the prisoner said, "That has come off her hand, where she has been scratching me; look here, see what she has done," and he showed me marks down his face and neck; they were recent marks, and they were bleeding at the time—I said, "Will you charge her with the assault?"—he said, "No"—I advised them both to go indoors—the deceased went in—he said, "It's no use my going in; I shall get no rest to-night"—she was standing at the door, shrieking at him—they were abusing each other; he outside, and she in—I requested him to go away, he refused, and I took him to the station and charged him with dis<lb/>orderly conduct and obscene language—after the charge was taken I found a razor in his inside coat pocket; it was taken from him—he was brought up at the Police-court the same morning and fined 4s., which he paid—the deceased was present at the time—I saw him with her after<lb/>wards, outside the Court—she commenced quarrelling with him, and said, "You deserve six months for bruising my body"—under my avoid he went away, and went into a public-house, and the deceased, in company with another woman, followed him—at his request the razor was handed to the deceased at the station after the charge was taken—it was subse<lb/>quently found in the room; this is it—on January 30th, about half-past nine at night, I saw the prisoner again, in Princes Road, at the top of William Street—he said, "It was through you I got locked up the other night; she is a wicked woman; if I leave her, and go away from her, and send her money, she goes to my old people's house in Chelsea and breaks the windows, and smashes the doors open! Oh, God! what am I to do?"—I advised him to go home—he said the baby fell off the bed undressed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240032"/>
               <p>when he came home at half-past six, screaming, with no light in the room—"She is a wicked woman; trying to put me away; if I go home there will be another row; perhaps she will bring a fellow home to sleep with her; then I and the baby will be pulled out of bed, and we shall have to sleep on the stairs, the same as I have had to do before, when she brought home a man, who gave her 6s."—I think he then left me, and went indoors—he was crying, and seemed very much distressed—he put up his hand to his head, and said, "Oh, God! what shall I do?" several times—about five minutes to one in the morning I passed the house—I heard them quarrelling, and using obscene language on both sides, but no threats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He told me that she had been locked up several times for assaulting his parents at Chelsea—that is so, because he would not go and live with her—after paying his fine, he came away perfectly peaceful and quiet, and she came up and commenced quarrelling and following him—he said, "I have given her £1, and sometimes 25s. a week, but she is not satisfied with that; I don't wish for her to go out."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw him with the scratches he did appear rather excited—I did not know that he had been charged and convicted at the Police-court; he looked excited and upset; he spoke quietly enough; he could walk all right; he told me he had been a seaman—the ale he had was 4d. ale.</p>

I live at 36, and am deputy of 37, William Street, where the prisoner and deceased lodged—I knew her by the name of Biles—on the night in question, about a quarter to one, I was in 36, and was aroused by a noise in 37—I got up and went in—I heard Maddigan and deceased quarrelling—they were swearing at each other in loud voices—the deceased was in her own room, with her door shut—I knocked at her door and told her to be quiet, and I told Maddigan to go to her own room; she was sitting on the stairs and shouting at the deceased—I followed her up to her own room—I then came downstairs and knocked at the deceased's door, telling her to hold her noise till the morning—I heard no other voice than hers—I then went back to bed—I stayed there from three to five minutes—in about ten minutes I heard a noise like a smash of china in No. 3 room in 37, on the ground floor, the deceased's room, which is on the same floor as mine in 36—I got up and dressed, and I heard a noise like a gurgling in the throat—I went out to the gate and saw the police sergeant—I said something to him, and took him to the prisoner's room—I saw blood on the ground—he was tracing the blood-stains—on going into the room I saw a great quantity of blood, the table upset, and everything disarranged and on the floor, and turning round, I saw the baby lying in a pool of blood on the floor—I saw a razor lying near the fireplace; a constable picked it up—the bed appeared to have been slept in—I saw some beer-cans on the front of the fireplace, and one at the back of the table, upset, and the table was on its side—I did not see any blood on the bed—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody—he had on a coat and socks, but no waistcoat and no boots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The door of the room was fastened by a bolt and a lock—the door had been violently burst open; the staple was forced out, the lock was off, and we could not fasten it again; crockery was lying all over the place; I noticed a small broken earthenware milk jug, such as cream is sold in; it was usually kept in a cupboard at the far end of the room; it would hold about a gill—that was near the side of the bed—there were splashes of blood on the top of the jug, but not on the sides—there were three cups; all the crockery in the room had evidently been thrown about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am attendant at the Lost Luggage Office, Great Eastern Railway, York—on November 1st, 1895, at 6.20 p.m., the prisoner came to the office, and said he had lost a black canvas bag, with a Union Jack painted on the side—I asked him where he had come from—he said, "King's Cross"—I asked him if he had come by the last train, meaning the train due at 6.5—he said, Yes; that he had not lost his bag by that train, but he came the day before from King's Cross, and he had it labelled for Middlesboro'; that when he got to Peter-borough he got out of the carriage, and went to the guards' van and asked the guards if they had a black canvas bag, with the Union Jack painted on the side, in the van; that they said, "No;" that he said he would go back to King's Cross to look for the bag, and that he did so on the same day, the 31st, and left particulars there, and they told him they had not got it there, and he had better pro<lb/>ceed to Middlesboro'; as it was labelled for that place it would go right through, and that they told him to call, on his way to Middlesboro', at York to see if we had it; and that on this day, November 1st, he came on to York—he asked me to take particulars of the missing bag, and I told him that, seeing he had left particulars at King's Cross, he had better go on to Middlesboro' and leave particulars there—I told him that I had not</p>

               <p>got any bag, and bad never seen such a hag—he said he had lost one or two bags before on the same line, and this time he would make them pay <hi rend="italic">for</hi> it—he came again afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the story about his going back to London was repeated on another occasion, the prisoner denied that he had ever said so—he said I had made a mistake, and that he had not said so to me—I was on duty between five and nix on October 31st in the Lost Luggage Office; I went off duty at 6.30—I do not remember his coming on that day, or anyone inquiring—I do not remember hearing through the porters of any inquiry on that day—I refused to enter any complaint in my book, because I understood he had been back to London to enter it there—I don't know if he staved in York on the night of October 31st—I did not see him during the clay on November 1st—I was on duty from nine a.m. till 6.30 p.m., except when I was at dinner, from 12.45 to 1.45—the Lost Luggage Office is open all night—after 6.30 two other men would be on duty—I don't remember his saying, when he came afterwards with his solicitor, that he had inquired of other people besides me at York—I saw no white, black, or other bag at York.</p>

I live at 42, Northampton Street, Clerkenwell—Agnes Frances Bunker occupied a room with her mother on the second floor at that address—the prisoner lived in the same room—he is an outside porter at the Central Meat Market—on the morning of January 2nd I saw the woman with her head bleeding; before that I had heard the prisoner in the house; I heard a good deal of talking; she had been talking all the morning, and I heard the prisoner—I knew him by the name of Jack; sometimes he was called Uncle Jacky—I saw him come downstairs that afternoon about half-past two—he said, "Good evening, miss"—three or four minutes before that I heard the deceased say, "Oh, Jack; oh, Jack, don't"—he turned back upstairs again and kissed her, only once—about ten minutes afterwards Greaves came down, and two or three minutes after that I saw McCarthy come down—she showed me her head; it was fearfully smashed, and on the left side I saw blood—I gave her a piece of rag—I afterwards saw her go away with Greaves to the hospital; I opened the side door for her—about seven the same night she came back; she was pretty well in drink then—the prisoner seemed to have been drinking.</p>

I live at 237, Northampton Buildings, Clerkenwell, and am a railway porter—on January 2nd I saw the deceased woman McCarthy; I went up to her room about half-past twelve; the prisoner was not there then—the woman was suffering from the effects of drink—the prisoner came in after 1; he was partly drunk; they had some drink together, a quart of beer and a quartern of rum—they were</p>

               <p>friendly at that time—they afterwards started quarrelling over the dinner, and the prisoner struck her over the head with a saucepan, only once, on the left side of the head; she fell back, and the saucepan broke—I saw that her head was bleeding very bad—the prisoner went out a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after he had done it—he endeavoured to stop the bleeding, both of us did; we were not able to do so—I said she wanted a doctor—he did not say what he was going for when he went out, that was about half-past two—I remained with the woman about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, trying to stop the bleeding—I then went into the street, and she followed me—we walked to St. John's Gate, and got an ambulance—her wound was dressed at the hospital—I left the hospital with her, and brought her straight home, and there left her—I did not see her into her room, I took her to the door, and she went in—she had some drink on her way to the hospital, and some on coming back—I did not see her strike the prisoner before he struck her—he took the saucepan off the hob, not from her—I did not see him fall down—the woman staggered back and fell in my arms—she did not strike her head on any<lb/>thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Bartholomew's Hospital—on January 2nd the deceased was brought there by Greaves; she was suffering from a fractured skull and a wound on the left side of the head, above the left ear; the wound was down to the bone—she was drunk—she did not stay in the hospital, she refused to stop; we kept her some time, trying to get her to stop, but she would not; she went away—next day she returned and remained till February 9th, when she died—an operation was performed on February 2nd—we removed a portion of the bone of the skull at the point of fracture, and found a small abscess underneath the bone—the cause of death was a cerebral abscess, and another abscess inside the brain—the abscess inside the brain caused death; the other had nothing to do with it; that was relieved by the operation—I think the fractured skull and the injury she had originally received caused the abscess—this saucepan would cause the injury—it would be more likely to be caused by a fall, if she fell against something projecting—I think a fall, unless a very severe one, would be insufficient to cause fracture in that, position—I think there would have been more injuries than one single wound, probably more bruising and laceration—our attention was not called to that, but we should have seen it, of course, because she was put into bed the next day—the injury, if caused by a blow, must have been a severe one—the skull was of natural thickness—a severe fall against a grating or anything sharp might have done it—a brick would hardly have been heavy enough.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On January 2nd last I went home and found this man in bed; not taking any notice, I got over on the other side, and fell to sleep; she said, 'You ain't going out; I said, 'I must,' as I had only 2s.; she said, 'You ain't going to stop here;' the next thing I found myself on the floor; she had hit me on the leg with the saucepan; I rolled over, she fell over me; I got up and placed her on the bed. I saw blood oozing from her head, and said to Greaves,' Good God! get the basin, and let us stop the blood; I said, 'Get a doctor.' I went downstairs and saw Mrs. Fox, and said, 'Come back and bathe her; I can't stop this bleeding.' I went out and met a man, and asked where I could find a doctor; he said,. 'They won't come without a fee.' When I came back I found they had been at the Cross Keys drinking, and was told she had been to the hospital and had her bead dressed; I did not think it necessary to fetch a doctor then.") I got this saucepan from the deceased's mother at 42,. Northampton Road, on February 13th, in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot manufacturer, of 4, The Broadway, Bromley, Kent—I started the business, and I am assisted in it by my wife—last year I wanted a loan of £100 to assist me in carrying on the business, and I inserted an advertisement for that purpose in some of the London papers—among the replies I received was one from the prisoner, dated September 25th, in consequence of which I called at his office in Queen Victoria Street—I had several interviews with him—he first suggested that he should insure me for £150 in one of the societies for which he was agent—he was to be the moneyed man who was going to find me the money—I said I was already insured, and did not want to be insured again—then he made a suggestion about my taking a partner—I mentioned that to my wife, but she would not hear of it—on April 8th he came to Bromley and suggested that I should draw a bill for £100, which he would accept if I could find someone to discount it—I could not find anyone to do so—he then drew four bills, each for £25, which I accepted; one was at two months, one at three months, and two at four months—my wife, who then had an account at the Birk-beck Bank, endorsed the bills—I handed them over to the prisoner to discount for me—he was to have 10 per cent, for doing so—he went away, saying I should hear from him in a few days—I gave him 15s. 6d. for his out-of-pocket expenses—I went to see him once or twice at his office in Queen Victoria Street—I received this letter on October 21st.

I replied, refusing to carry that out—I did not get the money—I saw him about a week after October 8th at 171, Queen Victoria Street; I asked him about the bills, and he said, "I am very sorry; I cannot find anyone to discount them at present"—I called again the following week, about October 21st, and saw him—he said he was very sorry he had been unable to get the bills discounted, but he was going to see a friend in the afternoon who he toped would be able to discount them for me—after that I received his letter of October 21st about the advertisement, and I replied—I received this letter on October 22nd. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was sorry the idea of advertising was abandoned, as he felt sure he could get a partner with money, and that if he intended to carry out the proposed arrangement as to giving bills to creditors, and wished him to come to Bromley on Thursday, he must know next day.</hi>) He did not come to Bromley—I next called, and saw him in town on the following Monday, about October 25th, because he suggested that I should give my creditors bills, which I strongly objected to—I was in town, as a rule, every Monday, and I used to call on him—I saw him at the beginning of November; he said he was sorry I had abandoned the idea of giving bills to my creditors—I said I was not pressed in that way; I wanted money to carry on business with at Bromley, and I would rather he cashed the bills he had—I received these letters of October 25th and November 1st from him. (<hi rend="italic">The first stated that he had not received a definite answer as to the bills; the second stated he would call next day with a client who, he thought, would do the bills.</hi>) He called on November 1st with Mr. Longman, who, after discussing the matter, said he would not discount the bills himself, but that he would draw up two bills on his own account, with the prisoner's signature on them, and cash them; he would not give me a definite answer then, but he said he would let me know in a day or two—afterwards, in November, I called on the prisoner with a friend, Mr. Wright—that was before I received a letter from Mr. Mount—I said, as the bills had been so long in hand, I thought he had better not discount them, but return them to me—he said one or two were out; that he was seeing a friend that afternoon who he thought would discount them if I would leave it—I wrote on November 21st, asking formally for the bills, and I received this reply of November 25th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that after many trials he had failed to get the bills discounted, and tluit he returned two, the other two he would procure and forward</hi>)—he enclosed two bills, one at three months, and one at four months—the remaining two I have not yet had—the next intimation I had was this letter from Mr. Mount, a solicitor, on December 12th. (<hi rend="italic">Giving notice that his acceptance, due on Thursday, was dishonoured on presentation, and that unless the amount were received next day, with</hi> 10s. <hi rend="italic">for charges, he would be proceeded against.</hi>) I called on Mr. Mount the next morning, and then I called on the prisoner—I told him I was very much surprised at receiving the letter I had from Mr. Mount, as he had distinctly given me to understand that the bills had never been discounted—he said it was a great mistake somewhere; that he had never received a farthing for the bills, and that it was being kept back for an account of the name of Schutte and Co., to whom he owed £9—I received this document at his office the same morning.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. I</hi> had a good many conversations with the prisoner as to how to raise the money—I said I would ask a friend, a hatter in the Commercial Road, to discount the first bill; he would not have it—the prisoner said he could raise the money for me—I instructed him to dis<lb/>count the bills as best be could, and give me the proceeds—he had authority to place them and discount them—I complain that he did not give me the proceeds—I did not know that Longman had one of the bills till almost the end of December—he told me Longman had the bill; he did not say for what purpose—he did not say he had placed one bill with Longman, and the other with Mount to discount—I had about fifty answers to my advertisement; I saw three of the writers before going to the prisoner—he only came twice to Bromley—he said he was making every possible effort to discount the bills, and I Relieve he did make such effort, and that if he could have discounted them on profitable terms, he would have done so as soon as he could—probably he did not find it very easy—he was not to have £25 out of the £100 for his trouble—no mention was made of a bonus—these were the only four bills drawn up; they were not in my possession—I never saw all four at his office, only three—he said one was in the hands of a friend, who, he hoped, would discount it—I could have had the three back; I did not object to his having them then; I did not ask for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. I</hi> asked him about twice for the bills—when I wrote on November 2nd, hoping for better luck next time, it was in reply to his letter in which he used the same words—he purchased some boots for his wife; he did not pay for them—when I saw him in town after November 2nd, he said he was doing everything he could to discount the bills.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 17, Grace-church Street—about October 9th, 1895, the prisoner called and asked me to discount this bill for £25 at two months—I told him it was no part of my business, and declined to do it—I remarked that the acceptor lived at Bromley—the prisoner asked me if I, knew Bromley, and many people there—I told him I knew Bromley very well, and some people there—he asked me if I knew anybody at Bromley who would discount the bill—I said I might, but I did not care to trouble about the matter at all—he said if I would discount the bill he would pay two instalments, amounting to £4, which were due to a client of mine, Schutte, under a judgment of the City of London Court, against the prisoner—he pressed me very hard, and as I wanted to get the instalments, I consented to do it, but I said I must first know how he came by the bill, as he was drawer and endorsee of it—he told me he had negotiated a loan of £1,000 for the acceptor, and that his commission was £25, the amount of the bill—I made inquiries at Bromley and two other places with a view to discounting the bill, and in the meantime the prisoner, who had frequently seen me, asked me, if I could not get the bill discounted, would I make him a cash advance—I ultimately wrote him this letter of</p>

               <p>October 23rd. (<hi rend="italic">This regretted that they had not succeeded in discounting the bill, but proposed that he should endorse the bill and hand it to them on the condition that they should pay to Mr. Schutte the</hi> £4 <hi rend="italic">due, and £4 for the November and December instalments, deduct</hi> £2 <hi rend="italic">for their charges, and hand him a cheque for</hi> £4.) Those arrangements were carried out; he accepted the offer in writing in our office paper, and I gave the prisoner a cheque for £4, which has been paid—I sued Mr. Stuttle on the bill—he was put to the expense of contesting it—judgment went against me—I did not discount the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe judgment went against the prisoner—I held the bill at first for the purpose of discounting it through someone else, but I was unable to do so—there are some very highly respectable tradesmen in Bromley—I have known people in small shops, such as there are there, who have had property worth many thousands—I found the bill was not negotiable—I did not call and see the prosecutor; I had no reason to believe there was anything wrong about it; I had known the prisoner for some time—he has carried on business in Fleet Street and Queen Victoria Street—I had had business relations with him—I had sued him in the City of London Court, and got judgment against him for a client—I tried to get the bill discounted in three quarters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shop and office fitter, of 5, Newman's Row—I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law—on several occasions in October I went with him to the prisoner's office—after Stuttle had received Mr. Mount's letter, I went with him to the prisoner; Stuttle asked him for the bills—he said he would get them and deliver them that night, so that we had them the next morning—we asked him if he had received any money for the bills; he said he had not—I saw him the day after the writ; he asked me if I had the writ; I said, "No"—he said, "You give that to me, and you need not trouble anything further about it; I will see that that is all right, and you shall have the bills to-night"—prior to that I was present when the bills were produced on one occasion; he did not let us have them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an architect, of Queen Anne's Mansions, West<lb/>minster, and 158, Cromwell Road—I was an architect in Cardiff and Swan-sea from 1881 to March, 1895—on March 25th I saw this advertisement (<hi rend="italic">This offered a good partnership to a smart young architect and surveyor in a good West-end office; capital required, about</hi> £600; <hi rend="italic">plenty of work advertiser just won large competition.</hi>) I answered it, and eventually I came to London, and saw Fryer on March 30th at Queen Anne's Mansions, where he had an office—he said, "I have carried on business for some eight years, since 1887," and he produced a long list of works he had executed and carried out—he said, "I have certain large works in hand, representing about £90,000 worth of work, contracts to that extent"—his commission would be five per cent.—he said he had earned a good living, that he was very much overworked, and needed a partner to assist him—I said, "I had had a fairly good practice for years; I have been careful; I have saved some money, and I can find the £600 capital named in the advertisement for the purposes of this business"—I said, "What is your position?"—he said, "Oh, I have had a good prac<lb/>tice; I have not been able to save much; I have always earned a good living and paid my way; I have furnished these offices, an you see; I owe nothing but current trade debts, and all these shall be cleared off before a partnership is entered into"—he had three rooms, an inner and outer, and clerk's, or drawing, office; they were on the ground floor, and were furnished luxuriously, much beyond the ordinary—he had four or five clerks in the drawing and outer offices—I remember he distinctly said, in reply to me, "I am solvent; there is nothing against me"—he did not</p>

               <p>mention there being a charge on the furniture; I did not ask him about that—he said, "I shall require £500 premium for a half-share in this business for seven years, and such a premium will cover the half-share of my belongings," the office fittings, and so on—it was a half-share of every<lb/>thing he had—I was to pay £25; five per cent, before the partnership deed was drawn, or any steps taken—I returned to Wales, and sent him the same night, or next day, a cheque for £25, which was duly paid—I thought it was a good concern, and I believed his statement that he had always paid his way, and was solvent, and that the office furniture belonged to him—there was corre<lb/>spondence, and then I came to London and went to the office on April 16th—on Wednesday night, April 17th, my confidential clerk, Mr. New<lb/>combe, made a communication to me about the prisoner—next day, after lunch, I saw the prisoner at his office, and asked for a private interview—I said, "On entering into partnership I wish no secrets or anything material to the business or ourselves to be withheld from each other. All men are liable to be misrepresented, and if ever you hear anything against me, I want you to come to me direct about it. A com<lb/>munication has reached me, and I come to you with it direct. I cannot believe it; but it is represented to me that you have been a bankrupt. Is that true, or is it not?"—he said, "It is absolutely untrue and that and other statements can only have emanated from a prejudiced mind"—the prejudiced mind he referred to was a junior assistant, Strong, who informed Newcombe—Strong was discharged from the office in conse<lb/>quence—I thanked the prisoner and shook hands—he thanked me for coming direct to him as a gentleman—the same day, April 18th, I executed this deed of partnership, and gave him this cheque for £475, which has been honoured—we did one job for the Surrey County Council, a contract for £4,500, upon which about £225 will be paid; and other business has come in, but there was no return from the prisoner's business until August—I brought my connection with me—the Surrey County Council job is just about finished—the prisoner had given a charge of £50 in respect of it to Crowe; I did not know of that till the prisoner was made a bankrupt a second time in January, 1896—I heard of it just before Christmas—the receiving order was made against the prisoner on January 3rd—there was no other direct business—we received the first money from clients, the Surrey County Council, in August—we had a case of finding a mortgage for clients, which resulted in a commission of £8 10s.—that was the only paying work there was at the time the partnership was entered into; some other work has come in since—several articled pupils have come to us through answering our advertisement.</p>

               <p>see a desirable site and prepare plans, and desire to interest a client in it—beyond the County Council work, that was absolutely the work for the nine months—I complained of the work being speculative; it was a question of making ends meet over and over again, of paying the office expenses, which were altogether about £30 a week—that £30 a week came out of capital; I did not take my drawing accounts—this balance-sheet was prepared from March 25th to January 3rd, by Mr. James, a chartered accountant, who was nomi<lb/>nated by the Official Receiver after the receiving order; he is quite independent—I did not sign the balance-sheet—I signed a statement of maximum outstanding moneys to come to the firm—there is an item, "Articled clerks' premiums, £475, and £100 contingent"—one of these clerks came in June, after I had had rather more than three months' experience of the business, which had then begun to turn—one of the articled clerks paid £150 by quarterly instalments of £25, another paid £128, and a third paid £150—we entered into a covenant (I have to take that burden now) to pay the clerks certain salaries, amounting to £2 a week, for five years—I considered we were acting honourably in taking those young men, because by that time certain. <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> business had come in, as shown by the balance-sheet—that was new London business, nothing that I had brought from Wales—I brought some business from Wales—we opened a branch at Richmond—I furnished two rooms there for an office—we kept two clerks there—the prisoner lived at Richmond—I do not complain of the business on the nine months' working—I did not suppose I was entering on speculative business—I object to the prisoner's bankruptcy, and to other matters since then—the partnership is now dissolved by process of law—I am carrying on the business as a tenant in common with the Official Receiver—I have the whole business, subject to what has happened, as the result of the bankruptcy—in consequence of the prisoner's second bankruptcy the credit of the business has been seriously injured, and business has been taken away, and I have to begin practically <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi>—I had to help the prisoner over and over again to the extent of £700—I advanced him money out of the business; I took nothing myself—I allowed him to over<lb/>draw about £650, and in respect of his overdrafts, he gave me a charge on his interest in the business—I did not assist him because I was pleased with the business, but because discredit was being cast on me—I proved under the bankruptcy for about £650; the prisoner was indebted to the firm £128, and I proved for the return of premium obtained by fraudu<lb/>lent misrepresentation—I had confidence in him up to January, and thep I discovered he was an undischarged bankrupt—discredit attached to me so much that I should have moved to dissolve the partnership on January 14th—I say the partnership is null and void; I have taken no civil action—I have only received £123 out of this business; the prisoner has taken all the. money—after my charge on his share is wiped out the prisoner is still indebted to the firm in £128—Mr. Emanuel, a solicitor, was acting for the prisoner in November; I asked him also to act for me—I told Mr. Emanuel something to the effect that I was very sorry for Fryer, who was a man of great ability, and that by March next he would be in a posi<lb/>tion to pay all his liabilities, as I believed at that time that he owed only a nominal amount—I was then and am now in sympathy with</p>

               <p>the prisoner, and am only driven to this painful action by the discredit thrown on me—I asked Mr. Emanuel, through telephone, when I first found out that the prisoner was an undischarged bankrupt—Mr. Emanuel said the prisoner had repeatedly deceived him, and he supposed he had done the same to me—I said I would help him to clear off the bank<lb/>ruptcy proceedings against him—the interview on March 30th did not last half an hour, as he was anxious to go to the boat-race, and I had to return to Wales that night—the conversation we had related mainly to the busi<lb/>ness he was doing—I remember his using the word "solvent," in reply to a question—he told me he had paid his way, and owed nothing but cur<lb/>rent accounts during the eight years he had been in business—I remember the conversation in detail—he produced certain plans and said, "That is the work we have in hand"—I saw the work that was in the office, and was satisfied—the work he represented amounted to over £90,000 in con<lb/>tracts, and all that has come into the office resulting from it is £4,500—he said he had paid his way, and was solvent—the £475 was paid on April 18th, in the private room at the office, not in the manager's room at the bank—we went to the bank to open an account on the following day—I did not give Clements instructions to discharge Strong; the prisoner wrote a letter—I had no control over Strong at that time—I told Clements Strong had made a statement in the office, and I had asked the prisoner to deal with him—that was immediately after the conversation; we called in Clements; the partnership deed being ready, I accepted his statement—Clements was a witness to the partnership deed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I allowed the prisoner to overdraw £625 because he was repeatedly getting into trouble, and to get him out of bankruptcy petitions—he gave cheques to Mr. Emanuel, of which I knew nothing until they were presented—it was all kept back from me—I was most anxious up to January 3rd to meet his creditors, and prevent his being made bankrupt—on three occasions I agreed to allow my share of capital and other money to go to save the prisoner being made a bankrupt—if I had known he was then an undischarged bankrupt, I should not have allowed him to make these overdrafts, and when I learnt it on January 14th I said, as he was an undischarged bankrupt, I could go no further—I was assured that the whole of his debts would be paid by these overdrafts—the item in the balance-sheet of £876 contingent is the amount for which we can send out bills, but from letters I have since received it is all subject to realisation, and it is very doubtful if we can get it in—the business has been wrecked by the bankruptcy, and I have lost the whole of my premium by it.</p>

I am clerk to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, Somerset House—I produce the file of documents connected with the registration of the World's Great Marriage Association, Limited, which was registered on January 26th, 1893—among the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association are John Abraham’s and Mortimer Skates, described as marriage negotiators—Mr. H. Vernon and Mr. Frank Gould are also members—the office is 40, Lamb's Conduit Street—the notice is signed, "Charles John Skates, Director"—there is a document of January 25th, 1892, between John C. Skates, 2, Montagu Place, Russell Square, and Norman G. Hennah—Mr. Skates is described as the pro<lb/>prietor of the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>, the copyright of which he purports to sell to N. G. Hennah, and the good will of a marriage negotiator, with the assets and the book debts—the purchaser to received £20,000, which he is to accept in fully paid-up shares; it is also stated that J. C. Skates shall be appointed managing director at £1,000 a-year—Mr. Hennah is described as the secretary of the company—on May 3rd, 1895, I had notice of the change of address from Lamb's Conduit Street to New Oxford Street—the last return of shareholders is dated June 19th, 1895; total issue up to that date, 4,007 shares; I find John Charles Skates, of 5, Mecklenburgh Square, the holder of 3,460 shares; Mortimer D. Skates, 11; Hennah, 6; Meadows, 3 shares; exhausting 3,891 of the total issue—the nominal capital of the company is described as £25,000 in £5 shares.</p>

We have arranged with three of them, and on your becoming an associate, we shall be happy to send you their names. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES BARRINGTON</hi>"—I did not go to Mecklenburgh Square—I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated May</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th, and stating that the present season of the year was exceptionally 'prolific in effecting speedy and advantageous matri<lb/>monial engagements, and requesting his decision as to being enrolled an associate.</hi>) I enclosed five guineas to Charles Barrington, and received this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the witness was entitled to an unlimited number of introductions till a marriage resulted. Another letter from Charles Barrington stated that they had written on his behalf to a lady, aged twenty-five, giving her description, and asking him to send her a letter to the care of the Editor, and giving the names and descriptions of three other ladies, and thanking him for his photograph.</hi>) I wrote to the three ladies whose names were given to me, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated June</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th, to the care of the editor, requesting him to inform the witness that, by the advice of her medical attendant, she was going abroad; and another letter from Miss Annesley, stating that the particulars did not correspond with her desire.</hi>) I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated June</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">and enclosing a pamphlet and a form of agreement to fill up as a free associate, fee</hi> £5, <hi rend="italic">or as an associate for a fee of</hi> £20, £10 <hi rend="italic">now and</hi> £10 <hi rend="italic">when he became engaged.</hi>) This pamphlet was enclosed, which deals with the advantage of becoming a free marriage associate—not answering that, I received this on the 12th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they were negociating with some eligible ladies on the wit. ness's behalf, but could not introduce them till he sent his subscription.</hi>) I returned the agreement sent me in the letter of June 8th, but enclosed no money, and on June 16th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Signed, "C. Barrington" acknowledging the receipt of the agreement, and stating that he might expect to receive some desirable introductions in a day or two.</hi>) That was followed by this letter of June 19th. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing the names of some very charming ladies, Miss J. Fergusson and Miss Bennett, with their descriptions and fortunes.</hi>) After that I went to 5, Mecklenburgh Square, and asked for Charles Barrington—the prisoner Abraham’s came—I told him my name, and said that I wished to get suited—he said no doubt I very soon should be, and gave me the address of a lady, but I was to write to her to the care of the editor—I did so, but do not remember receiving any reply—he said he had had thousands of ladies on the books—I then received this letter: "August 4th, 1893. Dear Sir,—Kindly let us know the result of your negotiations with the ladies; we congratulate you on your arrangements.—<hi rend="italic">Pro</hi> the Board, <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES BARRING<lb/>TON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Pres.</hi>"—immediately after that, I wrote, asking if I could have an advertisement inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>—I received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he could do so, and asking if he required further intro<lb/>ductions. Signed, "C.

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that his advertise ment had been received, and his letter forwarded to the lady. Signed, "C. Barrington.</hi>") That was followed by Barrington's letter of September 4th.

                  <hi rend="italic">Miss Mollie Egan, and Miss E. M.

(<hi rend="italic">Signed, "Daniel Mortimer," stating that he had decided to recommend the management to accent the case in their more select depart<lb/>ment, where it would have the more invaluable assistance of special and individual care and attention, and introductions from more eligible clientele, and if so, he would be just in time for their London and Holiday season negociations, which were proving brilliantly successful.</hi>) This was followed by another letter on different stationery to the others. (<hi rend="italic">Headed "Fashionable and High-class Marriage Department," and stated that the directors had decided, on Mr. Mortimer's recommendation, to give the witness the benefits of this department, which were set out, for which the preliminary subscription was</hi> £31 10s., <hi rend="italic">as in the pamphlet, but which they would reduce to</hi> £17 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on Mr. Mortimer's urgent recommendation. Signed, "Charles Barrington, Secretary.</hi>") This paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came about the same time—I do not know whether it was in the letter—I filled it up and returned it—I occupied at that time the proud position of being the champion draught player of England—I was particularly interested in games of skill, and was anxious that the lady should have similar tastes—I gave my income as about £400 a year; that appeared to me about accurate—I went on to say that the lady should have brown eyes, dark hair, good teeth and com<lb/>plexion, able to see and hear without artificial aid, a spinster of the middle-class, English, to belong to the Church of England, domesticated, fond of tennis, able to swim, income about £200 a year, and some definite amount of private property—about May 19th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the London season negociations were now in full operation, that many of the ladies were fond of games of skill, and as the witness was engaged in an international contest, it was a most favourable opportunity for him.</hi>) I sent no money—I then received this letter of May 26th. (<hi rend="italic">Front, Bar<lb/>rington, enclosing photographs of three ladies, asking him to select one, and to enclose his own photograph.</hi>) I selected the one which most appealed to me, and returned one of my own photos for submission to the lady, but sent no money—on June 5th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the photographs, and stating that the lady he had selected had an income of</hi> £730 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>, £80 <hi rend="italic">of which left her estate at death, and about</hi> £3,000 <hi rend="italic">capital, giving a personal description of the lady, who re<lb/>quested to be communicated with through this department only, and who very much liked the witness's photograph.</hi>—<hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES HARRINGTON</hi>.) I answered that, but sent no money—I said I hoped she would not be sent to the Continent, like Miss Marriott—believing the statement in that letter, I sent a post office order to Mr. Mortimer for seventeen guineas on June 15th, 1894, which was acknowledged by this receipt of June 18th, 1894, and this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Advising him to send a letter to Miss Alice May, age</hi> 22, £730 <hi rend="italic">per annum and</hi> £3,000 <hi rend="italic">capital, orphan, musical, vocal, nice face and figure, to the care of Special Negociator</hi>, 40, <hi rend="italic">Lamb's Conduct Street.

(<hi rend="italic">Thanking him for the photograph, stating that she was pleased with it, that he had an intelligent head, which was proved by his being champion, and being able to conduct so many shops, promising to conside the matter, and let him know.</hi>) I wrote again, and on July 12th I received this letter from her, "care of Editor" (<hi rend="italic">Stating that she was going to Jersey and St. Malo for some little time, but that the Negotiator would forward the witness's letters to her.</hi>) I went on writing, and on July 20th I received this. (<hi rend="italic">From Alice May, stating that unexpected business had called her to London, but that she would leave for St. Malo on Monday to visit a lady relative who was companion to a Baroness there.</hi>) That was the last letter I received from her—I continued to send letters to the Association, and to receive letters from them, giving me additional names, but nothing came of the correspondence—I believed in the existence of Alice May, and that the description given of her was correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi>. I am still a bachelor—my age is 25—I was about 22 when I first gave my mind to matrimony—this was my first venture—I am not fond of games of chance—I do not think I had any chance, although I had fifty ladies' names and addresses, and I think I wrote to all of them; I have no recollection of missing any; I thought it was not wise to confine my attention to one—when I was writing to Alice May I was writing to other ladies at the same time—I won the title of champion draught-player of England; I did not give it to myself—I have a hair-dressing saloon in London—I never, in the course of my long experience in London and Brighton, saw a woman like the one I described in my application; but the Association was to find her—I have kept all the ladies' letters (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>ducing them</hi>)—one lady died; this is her memorial card—I had two letters from her; and that was <hi rend="italic">near about</hi> all I required—I think this memorial card is genuine—I have no doubt this letter (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is genuine; it is written on paper with a printed address—I think that was her first letter; in it she says she should like to know the gentleman's habits—I wrote to her, and I think I sent my photograph—in this (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) the lady says she wishes the correspondence to cease; we had not had a tiff—I had not told her that I was corresponding with about thirty-nine other ladies—I had not seen her, but I think I saw this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had told her my position and occupation—this "Alfred Jordan, 1893, draught champion of England," on the back of my photograph, is my writing—I had a long correspondence with her; she wrote to me to send her photograph back, and she returned mine. (<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read several letters from a lady whose name he did not mention to the witness.</hi>) I met that lady at the seaside; she was Church of England—there was nothing the matter with her eyes; nothing was wrong, but we were not engaged; she would not engage me, but I had not quite made up my mind—I had not been showing a little coldness—I did not make the proposal on the sands; I had not made up my mind—I went down because I wanted to sec her—when I saw my photo returned I thought she did not wish to continue the correspondence—as to this other letter, I do not think I broke it off; I think I wrote last—I answered this lady's letter, and got this postcard: "The lady you have been writing to is very ill; she wishes you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240068"/>
               <p>to write again and send the photo."—I also received this: "Octo<lb/>ber, 1893. Dear Sir,—I like the tone of your letters; tall, dark hair, twenty-five, musical; income £100 a year, which is strongly tied on myself. If this is favourable, I should like to see your photograph"—I sent my photograph, and very likely it was that that put an end to it—I understood that to be a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> case—here is one letter from a lady abroad—I had about fifty-two ladies to correspond with; most of them answered, and it is not very likely that one remained un-answered—I could form an opinion by the replies whether they were worth looking after—I saw five of them personally—I saw the first lady once—I saw the next at Ealing, and had a correspondence with her—she gave me her address—I did not fancy her—I saw her two or three times—I thought at first that she might do—I saw her next at Margate, and came to the conclusion that she would not do—I did not see her again—she was a respectable lady living with her parents—I did not ask her whether she had the necessary fortune—I was visiting her shortly after paying the seventeen guineas—I was very likely still corresponding with Miss Alice May—at first she appeared to be worthy of my regard, but when I got to Margate things looked different—she wanted me to buy things wherever she went—she did not want an engagement ring—I do not know when I saw the next; they were all about the same time—I gave up a good deal of time to it—I met No. 3 in the National Gallery, by appointment, and we continued a corres<lb/>pondence—I did not tell her she suited—we did not meet again, because she did not make another appointment—I have no doubt that this was a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> answer to my letter. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to bring any more letters or photographs which he had to-morrow.</hi>) I met No. 4 at Burgess Hill, on my way to Brighton—I had corresponded with her; she was a respectable lady, and up to the average in looks; that seemed to be a genuine case—we had a long conversation, and took a walk together; I got on pretty well with her; I did not care for her, but I do not think I told her so—I do not remember telling her I would write to her and meet her again—I did not see her again—I saw No. 5 in Lowndes Square in the afternoon; she was about the same as the others, genuine, and, as I was living in London, I met her again; it was not bad fun, and it did not cost much—I met her two or three times, and she was to write and arrange to go to the theatre, but she did not write—I did not write and complain; I dropped her—all these ladies were within a few mouths—I think I liked the first best, but they were all pretty equal to one another—I had sent a special photograph to the Association of the sort of thing I wanted—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my sample—the ladies I saw were fairly up to the sample, but none of them were like this—I did not reject them for their looks—I would have taken one not beautiful at £100 a year, and one downright ugly at £1,000. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to write down the names and addresses of the five ladies he met, which he did.</hi>) I think I have got other letters here (<hi rend="italic">Opening a bag</hi>)—I think these are all—they are not all from ladies, but they are all connected—this one of October 5th is from me—it begins "Madam—Having been advised by Mr. Mortimer to write to you"; that is the way I generally began to write to them—I do not think I have any more, only a card—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240069"/>
               <p>this batch of correspondence is all in the same writing—I did not see that lady; I think she was the last I corresponded with—I am not in correspondence with any now—I asked some questions about her personal appearance; I do not think I asked if she had filbert nails. (<hi rend="italic">The lady's letter stated that tier nails were "filberts.</hi>") I have no reason to doubt that these are all genuine cases—when I met ladies they knew me by a flower in my button hole, or something like that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WARBURTON</hi>. I had over fifty letters—I went on some time, and then stopped till my financial position improved, and then I wrote again and said I should like some more letters—most of the ladies' social position was as good as mine—the questions were very minute. (<hi rend="italic">Thirty-one printed questions had been sent to the witness to fill up.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CANDY</hi>. I either asked for Charles Barrington or the editor when I had the interview with Abrahams—I did not go by appointment, only casually, as I was passing; I had paid five guineas and seventeen guineas—I had become an associate at the time of the inter<lb/>view, but had not been put into the high class—I saw Abrahams alone; the interview lasted about ten minutes; I only put down the address of a lady which I took with me—I asked for more introductions—I never saw Abrahams again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The interview with Abrahams was about July, 1893—about that time there was a correspondence about paying £10 down, and £10 when my marriage was effected, instead of the free marriage fee; but it may have been afterwards—the interview was not paid for—the ladies whom I corresponded with and met said that they had not any means—I think this second batch of letters belongs to 1894—this other batch did not go off on the question of money; but it was a long distance to go for an interview, and it did not come off—I made out the form of my requirements and accurately stated my position before I paid the fee.</p>

I live in Ireland—in May, 1894, I saw this advertisement in an Irish paper—"Matrimony.—A lady, spinster, orphan, of large independent fortune, having spent the last ten years in constant attendance on an aged parent, is now willing to correspond, with regard to an early marriage. Messrs. Penryn, 83, Gros<lb/>venor Street London."—I answered it, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From Daniel Mortimer, the World's Great Marriage Association</hi>, 40, <hi rend="italic">Lamb's Conduit Street, thanking the witness for his letter, enclosing a form of particulars for him to fill up, and asking him to send his photograph.</hi>) I replied to that, and on June 12th, 1894, received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the Association only introduced ladies and gentlemen who had enrolled themselves by subscribing ten guineas, but as there was a probability of a speedy arrangement, they would only charge five guineas.</hi>) I read the pamphlets which were enclosed, and then received this letter of June 20th, which I did not answer. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that arrangements had been made with three ladies on his behalf.</hi>) I then sent postal orders, value £5, to the Association—I had seen another advertisement, No. 45,605, in a paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240070"/>
               <p>they sent me—I do not remember the substance of it, but the lady had a good amount of means, because I was attracted by it—I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting him to write to the lady, and they would forward it, and enclosing the names and addresses of other ladies; en<lb/>closing a receipt for the money, which entitled him to an unlimited number of introductions. Signed'. "D. Mortimer.</hi>" I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">enclosing a form, and stating that he could become a free associate for</hi> £20. <hi rend="italic">Signed: "D. Mortimer</hi>"—I wrote to say that I would become a free associate, but did not send the money—I then received this further letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing photographs of two ladies, one with</hi> £1,200 <hi rend="italic">a year, and one with</hi> £1,800 <hi rend="italic">a year</hi>)—I wrote to Miss Cartwright. and I think I wrote to them both—I then received this. (<hi rend="italic">From D. Mortimer, stating that they should be pleased to hear from him, as they were waiting to introduce the two ladies to him.</hi>) At that time I had written to Miss Kershaw, whose advertise<lb/>ment I had seen in the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Signed, "Negotiator;" and stating that Miss Kershaw would prefer to wait a few days</hi>). I then received this (<hi rend="italic">Dated July</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th, thanking him for returning the photographs, slating that the ladies were anxiously wait in, and offering to receive subscriptions in two equal instalments, one to be paid now, and one a week after marriage. Signed, "D. Mortimer"</hi>)—I waited ten days, and then I got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Asking for a reply, and stating that the ladies were anxiously waiting.—Signed, "D. Mortimer"</hi>)—I then sent £10, and got this letter of July 25th (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the receipt, and requesting him to write letters to Miss M. Granville and Miss B. Masterton, and send them to the office, when they would be forwarded.</hi>) Those two ladies were the ones who had been pre<lb/>viously mentioned—I wrote to both of them, the one with £1,500, and the other with £2,000 a year, but got no answer—I had told the associa<lb/>tion that my financial position varied, but that I had nothing to count upon, and to let any ladies know that I had nothing, so that they should not cherish any false hopes—I had studied for the law, but had not been called as a barrister—I then received this letter, (<hi rend="italic">Recommending him to write, care of Editor, to Mrs. Morgan, without encumbrance, and with an independent income; also to Miss K. M. Smith</hi>, 6, <hi rend="italic">Tivoli Road, Kingstown, Dublin, and Miss M. J. D., care of Editor, both with inde<lb/>pendent incomes.</hi>) I wrote to Miss Smith and Mrs. Morgan, but got no answers—I inquired further about Miss A. J. O.—I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Advising him to write to all the ladies, and stating that Miss M. J. D. resided in Dublin.</hi>) Up to that time I had not got an answer from anybody. I received this letter in August. (<hi rend="italic">Giving another list of ladies' names and descriptions.</hi>) I do not remember whether I wrote to those—on August 20 I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing a copy of newspaper.</hi>) About that time I was writing in reply to advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>—I then received this. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing letters which had been specially forwarded.</hi>) I then let it drop—I was away yachting all the summer—on October 13th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing the names and descriptions and incomes of Miss Smith and Mrs. Shaw, and of Miss C. Cran<lb/>field, who had over</hi> £800 <hi rend="italic">a year and large expectations, daughter of a J.P., and stating that the witness's letter had been forwarded to Mrs. Morgan.</hi>) I had made a statement in my letter about my means</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240071"/>
               <p>—that was the first I had heard about Miss Cranfield—I think I wrote to all three ladies—I got a reply from two of them—this one purports to come from Miss Cranfield. (<hi rend="italic">Thanking him for his letter forwarded by Mr. Mortimer, stating that the particulars in it appeared satisfactory, and that she would be pleased to correspond with him, and asking for his photograph.</hi>) I then received this. (<hi rend="italic">Dated November</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th, stating that they had duly forwarded his letter and photograph to Miss Cranfield, and that they could not find Mrs. S. D.s photograph, which had probably been returned to her.</hi>) The enclosure to Miss Cranfield was a letter which I had addressed to her, and in reply received this letter from her. (<hi rend="italic">Thanking him for his photo<lb/>graph, remarking that he seemed to be at peace with all the world, postponing her answer to a question he had put to her, as there was such a thing as marrying in haste.</hi>) I wrote to her again; I had mentioned my position and means—I then received from her this letter of November 17th, 1894. (<hi rend="italic">Thinking him for his prompt reply, and using a great many French words; the witness having used French words in filling up the printed form as to his requirements.</hi>) I replied to that, but got no further letter from her; that bit of French was her final effort—on November 19th I got this letter from the Association. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him, if not engaged already, to write to Miss M. Taylor.</hi>) I cannot say whether I wrote to Miss Taylor, but I think I wrote to the Association, complaining that they had not sent anything suitable, and every time I wrote they sent me a letter—I mentioned Miss Cranfield, and told them not to send any names unless there was something definite about them—I received this letter of January 15th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Miss Cranfield was engaged, and giv<lb/>ing the names and descriptions of Miss Gertrude King and Mrs. Laura Min<lb/>chenton, widow, both addresses to the care of Editor. Signed "D. "Mortimer.</hi>") I received other letters and names but stopped corresponding in May, and had no communication with them till November 26th, when I wrote this letter to Mortimer. (<hi rend="italic">Explaining that as there seemed no chance of his getting any satisfaction in the shape of letters, only two ladies having acknow<lb/>ledged them, he should feel obliged by the return of his money, they keeping</hi> £2 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to pay them for the trouble they had had.</hi>) I got this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Dated November</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1895, <hi rend="italic">saying that owing to certain legal proceedings then pending their negociations were suspended, but that they hoped to resume shortly and would then give him introductions.</hi>) I found out afterwards that they were up at the Police-court at that time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the form I filled up before I paid any money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WARBURTON</hi>. I had about twenty names submitted to me—I wrote to them all pretty nearly, and described myself to the ladies in the same candid way as I did to the Association—I told them I had no private or professional income—I only heard of two ladies who had £250 a year or less—£1,800 a year was not the lowest I was prepared to sell myself at—perhaps I looked upon the £5 as rather A good joke, but not the £10, or I would not have paid it—it would be more difficult for an unprofessional person to do this, but I looked to the Association to do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi>. I got three answers from ladies I corresponded with, but did not see any—I always stated bluntly and honestly what my financial position was; a good many ladies did not answer—this is the photo I sent—I was never on the high class list, I</p>

               <p>was a free associate—I selected some of the names to write to, about twenty altogether—I could not say how many names were furnished to me—I made a judicious selection—at first I did not really mean business, but I thought if I came across any person suitable it might be desirable, if it did not it would be something to pass the time; it was a little dull in the country, and I wanted something to break the tedium—I answered the advertisement in a light-hearted spirit, but I was led to believe that something satisfactory would come out of it before I paid the £10—after paying the £10 I wrote to most of the names supplied to me—a lot of names were sent to me, but never anything definite—they sent me names, mostly to the Association, but very few addresses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor—in August, 1891, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> newspaper, and wrote to 40, Lamb's Con<lb/>duit Street, for a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>—I received this letter, enclosing a copy of the newspaper and a form of particulars to fill up and return at once—I filled it up, "A. Grunfeld, 30, widower, without encumbrance, under medium height, dark, tailor's cutter, £200 a year," and a note with regard to the lady is, "Not over 30"—on August 31st I read this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Signed "Mr. Mortimer" stating that the usual subscription teas</hi> £5 5s., <hi rend="italic">but in the witness's case they would reduce it to</hi> £2 12s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">to cover all expense till marriage.</hi>) In answer to that I went to 40, Lamb's Conduit Street, early in September, 1894, and asked to see Mr. Mortimer—I was given a card and directed to go to 5, Mecklenburgh Square, where I asked for Mr. Mortimer—I was shown into a room, and Mr. Abrahams came—he promised to find me a wife, and said he had thousands on the books—he produced a form, and proposed a sum which the lady was to have, and which I had left blank; it was about £150 a year, I saw it at the Police-court—he said that I should be suited very easily from the ladies on the books—I said, "I don't want money, but I want a good wife," he said he could satisfy me in any way—I paid the £2 12s. 6d. in cash, and he asked for 5s. for the inter<lb/>view, which I paid, and he gave me a receipt for each—he left the room, and brought them in ready written—I then left, and afterwards received this letter of September 7th. (<hi rend="italic">From D. Mortimer, strongly recommending three ladies, Miss Ellison, Miss L. A. Berwick, and Miss Markhouse, with their descriptions and fortunes, all three addresses to the care of the Editor.</hi>) I wrote to all of them, and received this reply from Miss Ellison. (<hi rend="italic">From Negotiator G. E., acknowledging his letter which had been submitted to Mint Ellison, and requesting his photograph, and enclosing hers.</hi>) I sent my photograph to the care of the Editor, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">From Negotiator L.

                  <hi rend="italic">Miss Ellison, she considers she is not suitable to you, "Negociator L. G.</hi>") Another letter said that the particulars did not quite satisfy Miss Berwick's requirements—I had no answer from Miss Markhouse; while this was going on I was receiving these letters from the Association. (<hi rend="italic">In<lb/>troducing the Free Marriage system to the wetness on payment of</hi> £12 10s., <hi rend="italic">signed "D. Mortimer.</hi>") That enclosed an agreement, which I signed and sent back, but sent no money—I then received this. (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the receipt of the agreement, and stating that they were preparing a selection of most valuable introductions for him.</hi>) I then received this letter, giving the names and descriptions of Miss Walker, Miss Lakin, and Miss Smith—I wrote to them, but cannot remember whether I got any answer—I had written to the Association, saying that I was not a very good English scholar, and I thought the correspondence had better be conducted by them, and on September 27th I received from them this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they considered that ladies liked to communicate with gentlemen themselves.</hi>) On October 16th more names were sent to me, but still with<lb/>out any definite statement with regard to means, and on October 20th a further letter, in which they suggest that I should adopt a <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi>; I agreed to that, and went on receiving letters of November 28th and December 30th, 1894; and January 15th, 29th, and 30th, 1895—I wrote to most of the ladies; nothing came of it; and I wrote to the Association, complaining that the ladies did not reply, and asking them to arrange an interview; they did not answer, but on February 4th, 1895, I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Expressing sorrow; and saying they had forwarded his letter to Miss Dyoll, and recommending him to join their more select department.</hi>) That was followed by a letter of February 9th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that a good many of the ladies were anxious to meet with a widower, preferably dark, and about thirty, and that the preliminary charge was</hi> £21, <hi rend="italic">payable on registration, but that, through the recommendation of Mr. Mortimer, the directors would reduce it to seven guineas.</hi>) I answered that, but did not send any money—I then received this letter of February 14th, 1895. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that it was impossible for the department to act without prepayment, as the ladies relied upon the guarantee which this fixed rule ensured them, and that they did not stipulate for gentlemen of large means, having ample means of their own.</hi>) I wrote, but did not send the money—on February 18th another letter came, very like the last—I received a letter enclosing the photograph of a lady, which I returned to the Association for further particulars, and then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the photograph, and enclosing fuller particulars of the lady, and stating that she had</hi> £340 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>, £90 <hi rend="italic">of which would go to a cousin at her death, and had also</hi> £1,000 <hi rend="italic">capital at her free control; that she was considered very good-looking, with pretty blue eyes, nice figure</hi>, etc., <hi rend="italic">affectionate, kind-hearted, musical, aged</hi> 24, <hi rend="italic">and the orphan daughter of a well-to-do tailor. Signed, "D. Mortimer, President.</hi>") I was pleased with the lady's description, and acknowledged the letter, but did not send any money—on March 30th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From Mortimer, stating that the lady was an associate of the Select Department, and that they could not introduce the witness until he had paid the reduced subscription of</hi> £7 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">as quoted to him, and that if he allowed this opportunity to pass, it would never occur to him again, and if he did not accept the offer they would introduce some more appreciative gentleman</hi>,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">as the lady would call on them on Monday.</hi>) Other letters passed between the Association and me and Miss Millen through the "Special Negociator"—I then received this letter of March 16th, 1895. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he might range the whole of England without finding a lady so suitable, and that it was only through their varied field for choice that such a selection could be made.</hi>) Then I wrote, engaging the services of the Association—still I did not send the money—on March 8th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">from Mortimer, pressing for his subscription</hi>). And on March 12th this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Complaining that the witness had not culled, and saying that they were glad the lady had not called on the Monday, or they should have been obliged to intro<lb/>duce tier to some other gentleman, and the witness would have lost her.</hi>) I had sent the money on the previous Saturday—the receipt is dated March 14th. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated:</hi> "You are now enrolled an associate of this de<lb/>partment, and we hope shortly to have the pleasure of congratulating you upon a satisfactory engagement.") The next is March 16th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the Association were negociating on the witness's behalf with Miss Nellie Millen</hi>). I answered through the Association—I received this letter of March 18th. (<hi rend="italic">Asking for a further description of himself before they for<lb/>warded his letter to Miss Millen.</hi>) I wrote this letter of particulars, a copy of which is on the back of theirs—the answer is from Miss Millen, of March 21st. (<hi rend="italic">Approving the particulars, and promising an interview when they knew more of each other.</hi>) Then I wrote: "You are quite correct in think<lb/>ing we ought to know a great deal of each other previous to an interview. I quite agree with you that matrimony is a solemn and sacred thing," and "If the heart does not feel affection the rest is mockery"—this letter of April 10th is from the Association. (<hi rend="italic">Promising to write to Miss Millen on his behalf, and let him know the result, but as ladies had whims and fancies, she might be corresponding with other gentlemen on her own account, and recommending clients to write to more than one lady in case of failure.</hi>) I continued to correspond with the office, because I had not the address of the lady—I received this letter of May 8th. (<hi rend="italic">From Miss Millen, through the Special Negociator, stating that she found the witness's letter on her return from the country, but could not name a rendezvous.</hi>) And this letter from the Association. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Miss Millen was about to return home.</hi>) Then this from Miss Millen of July 2nd. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that she was suffering from palpitation of the heart, and ordered to the seaside, that she had given up all thought of matrimony, and hoped he would get a nice lady, as he deserved one.</hi>) I replied to the lady, hoping she was not so bad as that, and that the correspondence might continue—then I received her reply of July 11th. (<hi rend="italic">Thanking the witness for his "exceedingly kind letter" that the doctor had advised her to go to Malvern, and hoping he had enjoyed himself in Germany.</hi>) I replied kindly, and received this letter of September 9th direct from the lady, who had had my address from the beginning—I had asked her to exchange addresses, but I had not hers. (<hi rend="italic">This was from St. Malo, stating that she was still suffering from palpitation of the heart.</hi>) I answered that I was sorry she was still poorly, etc.—that was all I had for my seven guineas.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi>. I sent one or two photographs to ladies—one to Miss Millen and one to Miss Ellison—I was satisfied with them—T generally received them back—the reply from two of the fifty ladies I sent letters to was, "I do not want to correspond"—I never had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240077"/>
               <p>the address of Ellison or Milieu—my correspondence continued about eighteen months, with about three ladies at one time—the addresses were sent me by the Association—most of the fifty ladies never replied—I destroyed the letters I had some time ago—I destroyed the correspondence with one when I "went on" with another—I did not express myself with regard to money; I wanted a good wife; but if there is money, I do not think anybody will refuse it—my first connection with the Association was through reading the advertisements of the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>—a large proportion of the ladies' answers came through the Special Negociator—some answered from their own addresses—I thought the concern was genuine—in the cases of the ladies I had seen, it was genuine; but they are only a few—the correspondence with each lady lasted a week or two; in Millen's case a couple of months—I went to look at a widow; I found her in a good house, and apparently in comfortable circumstances—I had an interesting interview, but did not go to see her again; I did not care to—I was told several times by the Association and by Mr. Abrahams that the widow wrote to them, asking for me; but I asked them not to recommend ladies older than myself, no matter how much money they hail, as I was not running after money—I think the widow's case was <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, and that she was willing to enter into negotiations with a view to matrimony—I met three ladies altogether—with the second lady I had a short interview at some railway station by appointment; we had previously exchanged a few letters—I did not see her again; I did not wish to—in those cases I was not willing; in others the lady was not willing; I could not compel them—the third lady I met accidentally when I went to Mecklenburgh Square to complain of not having re<lb/>ceived a proper answer from Miss Millen, nor her address—her name is Shellenburger—I have seen her again—she is away from London—she left me—I did not take her on—I do not know what you mean by "take on"—I did not court her—I paid her attention—I replied to her letters—her Christian name was Clara or Clarision. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of November</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1895, <hi rend="italic">addressed, "My dearest Clarision" expressed his disappointment at not having received a letter from his darling, concluding, "With best Love, yours affectionately, Albert.</hi>") Otto was her brother—I was introduced to her family as a friend—I wrote the same as she wrote—she was an exceptional friend. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter of November</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th stated, "I am very glad you enjoyed your visit on Sunday.</hi>") I had taken her to my friends, perhaps to the club—I did not introduce her as the lady who was about to become my wife—there was no definite conversation about that, far from it—Mr. Abrahams introduced me, and left us, and we con<lb/>versed about twenty minutes—I told him I had formed a good opinion of her, and he said directly, "Oh, no, she is nothing for you; we will do for you someone else better in a few days," and I received other letters, intro<lb/>ducing me to other ladies; in the meantime I received her letter, mentioning our interview, and so we started the correspondence—the 500,000 crosses in the letter is something not to be understood—I never saw a lady clerk in Mortimer's office; that was only suggested—I copied about the crosses from the other letters—she put millions in hers—you would be more sur<lb/>prised if you saw her letters—I have got them.

I did not become engaged to the lady—I dined, but not with my future mother-in-law, and I protest against it—perhaps the letters expressed my feelings at the moment—she wrote me the last letter—I had a letter yesterday—I wrote to her about a week ago—I have not her letter with me—the correspondence is still going on in a friendly way—not like you have read; far away from it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My visit to complain to Mr. Abrahams was at the end of August or the beginning of September, 1895—I still believed him to be Mortimer—I was introduced to Shellenburger accidentally, and Mr. Abrahams never spoke then about marriage; he only said, "Just have a chat"—I had not seen the lady before that—when I said I was pleased with the lady, he said, "Oh, do not mention it; she is nothing for you," and the next day I received three other in trod actions—I never asked her if she had means—I do not think she has—he said nothing about her being a client of the Matrimonial Association—I do not know what her occupation was—she is at present a governess in Ireland, I am told.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bow; I am a clerk—in March, 1895, I saw an advertisement in one of the morning papers; in consequence of which I wrote to 40, Lamb's Conduit Street, to which I received this reply under the date of March 9th, 1895. (<hi rend="italic">Signed, "D. Mortimer" ask<lb/>ing full particulars, and would no doubt satisfy his requirements.</hi>) In that letter was this form, which I filled up and returned. (<hi rend="italic">The lady to be from, eighteen to twenty-five, with approximate income, at least</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi>) I then received this letter of March 12th.

(<hi rend="italic">Requesting half the fee</hi>, £1 6s. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to be forwarded, and the balance as soon as an engagement should be effected.</hi>) I had in the meantime received certain</p>

               <p>testimonials—the correspondence then remained in abeyance till July 19th, when I wrote, enclosed the instalment, and requested a list of ladies suit<lb/>able to my requirements—on the back of that letter, under initials, sums of £300 and £800 were named, and on July 17th this letter came, giving the names of three ladies, named Burford, French and Mil ward, with incomes of £300, £180 and £2,000—I wrote to those three ladies, and on July 22nd a letter came from "Negotiator L. G.," stating that my letter had been submitted to Miss Burford, who requested my photo, and this letter of July 30th purported to come from Miss French at Reading—I received no answer from Miss Milward—on July 24th I received this letter, marked "personal and confidential." (<hi rend="italic">This was signed, "D. Mortimer," and requested the sum of £10 in order to become a Free Marriage Associate, according to enclosed agreement.</hi>) On July 25th I received this letter, purporting to come from Miss Burford. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that, for several reasons, she preferred to wait, before entering into correspondence.</hi>) On same date I wrote to Mr. Mortimer, requesting to be informed as to my liability in becoming a free associate, and I received this answer from him, that I should be entirely free of all liability; upon that I sent on the £10, which was acknowledged with a receipt on July 30th, and an introduction to a lady specially selected, desirous of arranging an early marriage, signed "Daniel Mortimer"—on July 31st I received this letter: "103, New Oxford Street. Dear Sir,—Agreeably with our promise, we enclose herewith particulars of highly desirable ladies, and trust same will meet your views.—For the Management, D. <hi rend="smallCaps">MORTIMER</hi>." (<hi rend="italic">This con<lb/>tained the names of three ladies viz., Miss L. A. Mousley</hi>, 12, <hi rend="italic">Bircumshaw's Road, Derby; Miss A. J. Hayes, care of Mrs. Godden, L. C. D. R., Station Road, Canterbury; and Mitt L. E. Carble</hi>, 2, <hi rend="italic">Queen Street, Peterboro', with description of each, as to personal attractions and position.</hi>) That was followed by a third letter from Negotiator L. G., on behalf of Miss Burford, to say that, after careful consideration, she is of opinion that she is not suitable—on August 26th I wrote, asking for further introductions, and on the back of that I received three further names with descriptions, to whom I wrote and received replies—on September 2nd I wrote again to Mr. Mortimer, stating that I had good reason to believe that the advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi> were <hi rend="italic">bogus</hi>, demanding suitable introductions, or the return of the sums obtained from me by false pretences, within seven days, or should take proceedings to enforce it, and communicate with Scotland Yard—I received an answer which, I believe, I handed to the police—after receiving the last answer I continued the communication with the Association, and they furnished me with further names, some of whom answered; they were chiefly without means; they were of no use to me, and only put me to trouble and inconvenience; and I wrote on November 7th to Mortimer that I had been instructed by the Commissioner of Police to take out a warrant, and that unless my money was returned, I could hold no further correspondence with them—that was answered by a letter of November 8th, expressing surprise, and stating that they would get three other ladies—I did not reply to that; there the correspondence closed, and the prisoners were taken into custody, I being one of the informants, and a warrant was granted.</p>

               <p>with the Association I was not privately commencing a negotiation on my own account; I am now making an overture to a lady of my acquaintance; I did so shortly after I wrote for the papers, before I paid my subscription; I had paid nothing then—I knew that my name was on the books; I had sent in my particulars; I had described myself as "tall, dark, slim, six feet, fairly educated, clerk in a drapery ware-house, wages 21s., amateur flute and piccolo player; lady must at least have £100 a year"—that was a consideration—twenty-five ladies were introduced to me, at least I received their names and addresses; I wrote to all of them; in many cases I wrote to their private addresses; I received replies (<hi rend="italic">these were handed in</hi>)—I did not carry on the corres<lb/>pondence with any of them for any length of time—I saw one in October, I think before the 28th—that was with a name that had been submitted to me; I saw that lady at Broxbourne, Herts—I was not pleased with her; I did not particularly like her; I don't know whether she took to me—I had no doubt she was a genuine person, willing to enter into an engagement with me; I did not see her again; I believe I had a letter from her of September 14th, 1895—I answered it; I had not then made up my mind to have nothing to do with her; I wanted to see whether she was suitable—I went down there to find out how the people had been cheated by this Association; I believe I went as a spy, I won't swear that I did; I did not answer the letter of September 14th as a spy, but as an honourable man—she had stated in her letter that she had no means; that did not conclude the business with me; I have no copy of my letter to her—I told her I was an abstainer, and a member of the Church of England; I really meant business, and sug<lb/>gested we should meet—she wrote, describing her dress, so that I might know her; I answered that, and then went down and saw her, but I did not care for her—she seemed to care for me; she appeared fonder of me than I of her, but I broke it off—I wrote to her when I got buck, about a week after, breaking it off—I have no copy of that letter—I think that was the longest correspondence I had with any one of these ladies—I think I wrote twice to others, not more, I think. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKWOOD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read other letters from ladies to the witness.</hi>) I corresponded with a great many ladies; I did not know that they were not genuine; they gave names and addresses, and I wrote answers—my private overtures came to nothing—I glanced over the pamphlets that were sent me—I corresponded with other ladies apart from the names sent to me by the Association; I got no answers from them—I wrote in September, demanding the return of my money, and the next week I wrote, requiring more introductions—I wrote to all the names I had—I wrote to a Miss Adams—she said her capital was £170.</p>

I am a forester, living at Clarkston—in August, 1895, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Herald</hi>, and in consequence I wrote to 103, New Oxford Street, and sent some stamps for a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Matrimonial Herald</hi>—I received a document with blanks to be filled up—on August 8th I received this letter, enclosing another form, and asking me to fill up the particulars—I filled that up, and sent it to Mr. Mortimer, 103, New Oxford Street—I correctly stated my income as about £60 a year—I wanted a lady with about £500 a year—on August 14th I received this letter signed, "D. Mortimer." (<hi rend="italic">Stating that from the particulars given they could fully understand his position and requirements, and had no hesitation in saying that they could at once place him in communication with a selection of most suitable ladies, and with excellent prospects of a prompt and pleasant result; that if not successful with the first selection they would send him a second and third if required, until he, was suited, and that they would reduce the subscription to</hi> £2 12s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">in hit case.</hi>) I read the pamphlet—I sent £2 12s. 6d. in cash by registered envelope, addressed to D. Mortimer, 103, New Oxford Street—that was acknow<lb/>ledged by this receipt of August 26th—I received this letter of the same date, signed by Mortimer, giving me three names with whom to cor<lb/>respond: "Miss C. A. Gilbert, c/o Negotiator, 103, New Oxford Street; age 21, orphan, rather dark, good figure, medium height, well educated, musical, £350 per annum. Miss E. Locke, c/o Editor, same address, age 24, nice-looking, 5 ft. 6 in., refined and musical, used to country life, £300 per annum. Miss "W. Ingram, care of Editor, same address; age twenty-five, dark hair and eyes, good appearance, fond of outdoor life, domesticated, £2.400 capital"—I believed in 'he statements made in that letter, and wrote to the ladies, believing I was writing to the ladies mentioned in the letter—I received this letter of August 31st, from "Negotiator," enclosed in another envelope with the post-mark of the next day. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that his letter and particulars had been submitted to Miss Gilbert, who would like a copy of his photograph before arranging for a per<lb/>sonal interview.</hi>) I wrote that I would send a photograph shortly—I re<lb/>ceived this letter of September 12th from "Negotiator," enclosed in another envelope with the post-mark of the next day. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Miss</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gilbert would wait for the photograph.</hi>) After that I sent a photograph to 103, New Oxford Street—I received this letter of September 18th from "Negotiator," enclosed in another envelope as before. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Miss Gilbert wished to thank him for the photograph, which the returned, and that she preferred to wait for a few days before deciding whether to enter into correspondence with him.</hi>) That was the last I heard of or from Miss Gilbert—I wrote to Miss Locke, who replied on September 10th, from Reading. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the particulars did not seem to satisfy her requirements, and although the editor had very warmly recommended the, application, the did not think correspondence would result in any favourable understanding.</hi>) That was sent to "care of the Editor, 103, New Oxford Street," and was not forwarded to me till October 16th—I received no answer from Miss Ingram—while the correspondence with those three ladies was going on between the end of August and the middle of October, I received a letter, dated September 5th, 1895, from the Free Associates' Marriage Department, signed by D. Mortimer, asking me to become a free associate upon the payment of £10; it enclosed an agreement form for me to sign—I did not sign it—I wrote to the Association about it—I received this letter of September 11th, signed "D. Mortimer." (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he need not sign the agreement if he became an associate.</hi>) I decided to become a free associate, but did not send any money—on September 27th I received thin letter from D. Mortimer. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they were very glad to learn he had decided to become an associate, and hoped to hear from him at his earliest convenience, at they had splendid opportunities of arranging a happy and advantageous match for him, and that when they received a remittance they would return the share he had enclosed.</hi>) I had a share in a gold mine, of the nominal value of £15, in September, 1895—I sent that to them to hold until I paid them, and I sold another share, and paid the Association £10, and took the balance—when I received this letter of October 10th the money had not been paid. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that they should be glad to have his reply, to that they might at once introduce him to the ladies who were waiting to hear from him.</hi>) On October 15th I received this letter, enclosing a receipt for the £10—I then received this letter of the 16th, giving the names of three ladies; Miss Bell, twenty-four, middle height, etc., with good capital; Miss Francis, in a good, sound position; and Miss Fiddler, with a nice figure, etc., and a good income—I wrote to those ladies, and got replies from them all—this is the answer I got from Miss Francis. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that she had no means, and worked for her living. "The letter from Miss Bell stated that she had no independence, and that it was useless getting into corres<lb/>pondence, as he wanted a fortune.</hi>) Miss Fiddler's answer is destroyed—she was no better than the others as far as means were concerned—that was the beginning and end of the matter.</p>

I am an expert in handwriting, of 59, Holborn Viaduct—I have had considerable experience in the examination of writing, and have given evidence in a great many cases in this and other Courts—I have examined the docu<lb/>ments in this case, and have had placed before me a number of examples of the writing of the different defendants, also the registration documents filed at Somerset House, and the Memorandum of Association, containing the signatures of John Abrahams and Mortimer Daniel Skates—also a notification of the registered address of the company, 49, Lamb's Conduit Street, signed "John Charles Skates," and the agreement between J. C. Skates of the one part and Norman Skates of the other part—also the signatures to the Limited Company, in January, 1895; a list of shareholders was returned in the writing of Pennall, and signed by him as secretary of the company—I have also seen the signatures in the books of the Bloomsbury Branch of the London and Westminster Bank for the purpose of opening an account,</p>

               <p>and among them those of Charles Harrington, John Charles Skates, Daniel Mortimer, and John Abrahams; the signatures of Skates and Barrington operating on their signatures, and the others on the account of Mortimer and Company—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a sample of Maddows' signature; it is a receipt for wages—a number of cheques were submitted to me, drawn on that account by Mortimer, and Abrahams—I have made a careful study of the five defendants' writing, and can identify a number of documents produced as being the writing of one or other of them; many of them are in Maddows' writing—I have had signatures of John Cecil, but not letters—these exhibits, 26, 29 and 35, are letters from Negotiator L. S. for Miss Burford, dated July 22nd and 25th, and all addressed to Mrs. Sutton are undoubtedly in the same writing, but I do not identify them as the writing of either of the defendants—exhibits 65, 112, 113, 120 and 162 are, to the best of my belief, all in the same writing, but not in the writing of any of the defendants—there are some distinct writings to that of Negociator L. G. which purport to be written by Mr. Sutton for his brother—exhibits 99, 100, 101, 102, 174, 175, 176, 134, 135, 145, 146, 147, 148 and 324 are undoubtedly in the same writing—to the best of my belief, exhibits 79, 114, 204, 204<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, 320, 325 and 326 are in one writing, but not that of any of the defendants—290 is not in the same writing—having in my mind the receipt signed by Maddows, with the date and figures, I can identify No. 19 in Button's case, 47 in Bacon's case, and 283 in Brockett's case—I believe this (283) to be a lithograph; it is dated August 8th—exhibits 31, 32, 33, 41, and 42 in Pennard's writing, are all in Sutton's case—in Bacon's case 59, 63, 64, 66, and 67 are in Hennah's writing, to the best of my belief—81 and 83, in Jordan's case, are in Hennah's writing, to the best of my belief—I believe 160, 161, 163, 164, 165, 166, in Driver's case, and 208 in George's case, and 293, 294, 266, 297, 298 in Brockett's case, to be in Hennah's writing; and also 314 in Willett's case—this cheque of October 2nd, 1895, signed "J. C. Skates," and this cheque of December 13th, 1895, signed "Charles Barrington," are, I believe, signed by he same person—this cheque of September 16th, 1895, signed "John Abrahams" and "D. Mortimer," is, to the best of my belief, in Abrahams' writing; they both correspond with the signature in the Memorandum of Association—those ten cheques (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 315) are all signed and filled up by J. C. Skates, and I believe the endorsement "B. Mortimer" to this cheque of May 13th 1895, is Skates' writing; also these cheques of May 1st, 1895, and September 24th, 1895, endorsed. "D. Mortimer"; also the second endorsement to this post-dated bill, and I think the first also, but I won't speak positively—the date to the cheque of December 16th, 1895 (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 313), signed "John Abrahams and Mr. Mortimer," is in Skates' writing; and so, I believe, is the date and the word "bearer," and the initials in this cheque of December 13th, 1895, and "J. C. Skates," and so is the date of this first cheque of December 19th, 1895, and it purports to be signed by him—I was not able to decide upon some letters, and put them under the head "unknown "; they bear a resemblance to Skates' writing—this receipt for salary and commission, signed "Penniker," is in the same writing as the memorandum—the two nooks, F. 1 and F. 2, found by the police at Mecklenburgh Square in November, contain the names of the com<lb/>plainants</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240090"/>
               <p>in this case—I find just such initials and just such descriptions in those books as I find endorsed on these two letters—although the books were kept in more than one writing, they were mainly kept by a person signing "W. Hellier."</p>

On November 9th I received a warrant from Bow Street Police Court, and on November 11th I went to 03, New Oxford Street, the office of the World's Great Marriage Association, which is a large building with a very large front-age, and the name in large gold letters—the only office was just a little room in front, where a youth was stationed to answer inquiries—he gave me a card, and I went with Sergeants McCarthy and Hail-stone to 5, Mecklenburgh Square, and asked to see Mr. Daniel Mortimer, whose name was printed on the card—I was shown into the first-floor front room, and after some time the defendant Maddows came in with a number of papers and one of these forms and a book of testimonials, as he was going to interview someone to take particulars of a marriage—I had given the name of Perkins—I said, "I want to see Mr. Daniel Mortimer"—he said, "He is not here, I am his representative"—I said, "well, what is your name?"—he said, "Oh, it is not usual to give names; what is your business?"—I said that I should like to know who I was talking to, and pressed him for his name—he refused, but said he was a director of the Association—I continued to press for his name, but failed to get it—he said that Mr. Mortimer was away ill—I then told him: I was Inspector Marshall, and had charge of the Criminal In<lb/>vestigation Department, that the other two were officers also, and desired to see Mr. Charles John Skates—he said he would fetch him; I sent Sergeant McCarthy with him, and they returned with the prisoner Skates—I said, "This is not Mr. Skates, this is Mr. Charles Barrington"—Skates said, "Oh! Mr. Marshall, I thought I explained to you before that 'Barrington' was the name I used in the business, but that my correct name was John Charles Skates—I said that I did not understand it so—I knew him in the name of Barrington, and also of Mortimer—I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest; is Mr. Hennah here?"—Maddows and he both said, "Yes"—I said that I had a warrant for Hennah's arrest, and sent McCarthy to fetch him, and he and Maddows came back with Hennah—I then said, "I want to see Mr. Daniel Mortimer," and Skates said, "Oh! that is my brother; his correct name is Mortimer Daniel Skates"—I said, "Oh! then he is one of the shareholders of this Association?"—he said, "Yes, and he is a director too"—I then sent McCarthy, with Maddows, to find him—I said to Skates, "Then you are the head of this concern?"—he said, "Yes, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189602240092"/>
               <p>am engaged in it"—McCarthy then brought in Daniel Mortimer, and I ex<lb/>plained it to all four of them—Maddows was not included in the warrant—I read the warrant as far as the name of Borrick, one of the complainants, when Skates said, "Oh, that man has got his money back"—I said, "Oh, yes, I am aware he has got the greater part returned since he lodged his complaint at Scotland Yard, and these proceedings were started"—I com<lb/>pleted reading the warrant, and Skates said that the persons who com<lb/>plained to us were simply outsiders—he asked me to read the warrant again—I did so, and he said that the complainants came there and wanted them to secure them wives at once, and that they did a large legitimate business—I said, "You know we have had complaints at Scotland Yard for many years; it is alleged that you have been inserting these bogus advertisements in newspapers all over the country, and also in your own paper," which I produced, "and so entrapped them into paying first registration and afterwards free Association fees, and that you had really no intention of getting them a wife at all; at any rate, you fail to carry out what you suggest you can do"—Skates was the spokesman generally; he said that they did a large business, and it was only the outsiders who complained—I placed them in charge of an officer, and then went over the house—I saw in Skates' hands 125 letters which had been received; another officer went through them—it is a very large house, and the stables at the back had been turned into offices with some little additions—I saw a great number of books, letters, and photographs, and took possession of the things we have here, and McCarthy took a few things subsequently when he arrested Maddows—I took the index book, the high-class register for men and women, and this book containing the sample advertisements in different papers in town and country; this was the one in use; there were a large number of them besides this—I found among them the one known as the Cecil advertisement—I found a large bundle of letters with the other advertisements on them; I found this advertisement, 317; and 377 is a reply to it, from females all over the kingdom—in the books there is an advertisement by Miss Huntly, of 83, Grosvenor Street; there are 163 answers to that from gentlemen residing in all parts of the kingdom. (<hi rend="italic">This was from a widow, with two children amply provided for.</hi>) I arrested Abrahams on February. 13th, at 63, St. George's Avenue, Tufnell Park; he addressed me first by saying, "Oh, Mr. Marshall;" I said, "Yes; you are Mr. Skates;" he said, "No; my name is John Abrahams"—I said, "Well, I always knew you as J.C. Skates, and Barrington, and Mortimer, and I have a warrant for the arrest of persons in those names," which I produced—he said, "I admit I have used those names sometimes, when Mr. Skates has been our, at 5, Mecklenburgh Square"—I read the warrant to him; he said he was simply a paid servant of the Association at a weekly salary—I said, "You are a director and a shareholder, and you have interviewed Mr. Richards"; he said, "Oh, you mean Mr. Ibbs"; I said, "Yes," and took him to the station—when I arrested the two Skates, Mortimer said that Daniel Skates was his brother, and Hennah told me that J.C. Skates was his uncle, who had married Abrahams' daughter—Maddows is no relation at all—I went through the books found, and between January 1st, 1895, and the arrest, the receipts in the registration department alone were £3,307 4s. 4d.; but there is a break of about a week, and in the Free</p>

               <p>Marriage Department the receipts were £2,095 3s. to November 9th, there being a break of a little over five weeks, which cannot be found—I find that the fee for the Free Marriage Registration department varied from 10s. to 10 guineas, and in the Free Association department from £1 10s. to £25—these are the two books which Maddows had when he came into the room—in one of them I find a registration for the almost nominal sum of £5 5s., and in another for the "almost nominal sum of £10 10s."—I could not find any receipts connected with the high-class marriage department, or of money received for interviews, other than counterfoils, which exist in great numbers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi>. I never knew that Skates assumed the name of Barrington for the purpose of some theatricals, and I have known him some years—he had told me on a former occasion that his name was Barrington, and Abrahams told me that he was Skeats—it was in 1893 that I had that conversation with him, and I rather think prior to that—I was not instructed to take proceedings against him in 1893, but I was instructed by a Magistrate to investigate the case—no investigation took place, but I made exhaustive inquiries, and made my report to the Magistrate, but there was no inquiry—they refunded the money, but the Magistrate did not know anything about it—I tried to bring the prosecutor forward, but he was kept away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COHEN</hi>. Hennah was not connected with the previous proceedings; J.C. Skates and Abrahams were the only men, but there were three or four women, whom I never could find—I said that Hennah was the secretary, and then the other officers fetched him; McCarthy will tell you from where—when he was brought in he admitted at once that he was the secretary—there was no attempt to detain documents, because I had sufficient strength to take all I required—he told me that he is Skates' nephew, and I heard it from his father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CANDY</hi>. The date of the warrant is November 9th, and I executed it on the 16th—his name is not in it—I did not know his name—I had seen him in 1893, in the proceedings at Clerk<lb/>enwell, and on other occasions—I understood his name was Skates; I thought they had been fencing with their names, as they had done before, ringing the changes—I never knew him as Abrahams, but as Mortimer, Skates, and Barrington—I had been to Mecklenburgh Square three or four times in connection with complaints which had been made against them year after year—I had asked for Skates or Barrington, and now I found it was Abrahams I interviewed, and not Skates—when I pointed out that he was a director and shareholder, he did not deny it, he rather assented to it—it is perfectly possible that either I, or someone on my behalf, may have called at Mecklenburgh Square and asked for Skates and seen Abrahams—if you called for Inspector Marshall at the proper department, and I was not in, somebody who was doing duty for me might come forward, but he would consider it his duty to tell you who he was—I had a warrant for Abrahams' arrest—I gave the name of Perkins, because I thought he would not see me if I gave the name of Marshall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Maddows.</hi> I found nothing connecting your name with them; you are the only one of the five whom I do not know—I think you said that Mr. Mortimer had sent a note to say that he was ill—I took the</p>

               <p>names and addresses of all the clerks, except a small boy—you took me upstairs and handed a bundle of letters as to marriages which had been effected through the Association; you said that they were of great im<lb/>portance, and I have kept them carefully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Maddows said that Mortimer was away ill, but Morti<lb/>mer came into the room, and it turned out that he referred to Abrahams, who was away ill; and, subsequently, Abrahams told me that he was away ill that morning, and sent a note—the proceeding in 1893 was a private prosecution as far as it went; process was applied for, but a monetary payment bought it off—we have had many complaints at Scotland Yard. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. I read some of the letters in the bundle Maddows pointed out to me—they will be produced; I had better not say anything about them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant E</hi>). On November 14th I received a warrant, and went with Sergeant Hailstone to 5, Mecklenburgh Square, and saw Maddows—I said, "Are you Mr. Maddows?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest for conspiring with persons in custody to defraud"—he said, "I suppose it is all right?"—I said, "The warrant is all right, signed by Sir John Bridge"—I took him to Bow Street—he gave his address, "Antony Maddows, 5, Meck<lb/>lenburgh Square"—I knew he was not living there, and asked him for another address; he declined to give it—I found a number of memoranda on him—he made no reply to the charge—he said that he sent down over-night to see Mortimer, and he was ill and unable to come—it was I who went with Maddows to fetch Hennah—I discovered a letter which said, "Omit Reading for the future"—that was in the office where Hennah was working, but I cannot say whether it was on the table he was working at—I find, among other receipts, one for wages, signed Maddows—No. 320 was found in the office, and 334<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The letter to Miss Burford.</hi>) No. 335 is one of the Reading letters to Miss Lock, dated October 8th; 336 is another Reading letter—I discovered a great number of letters addressed "Care of Editor," and considerably over one hundred un<lb/>opened—Miss Marshall's is dated June 13th, with the Reading post-mark; that was unopened; I opened it—thirteen index books were taken from Mecklenburgh Square; I have received them; they contain the names and addresses of persons answering advertisements—Hennah came to the station voluntarily when he came out on bail, and said that when a name had been obtained it was written in the index book with the address, and the person was then written to, a correspondence opened, and they were asked for a fee—he volunteered that, and said that if the fee was not forthcoming, a second letter was sent, and a tick, called the repeat tick, placed on the right side of the name, and if the fee was not then paid a smaller tick, called the hand tick, was placed on the left side of the name, and after payment the name would be transferred to the register—this letter (<hi rend="italic">Driver's, of the June</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1894) shows the repeat letter; the date in the margin will show—I do not know what C. F. N. means; they use manyabbreviations, and one book is kept entirely in cipher—the books contain about thirty-five names and addresses—I find the name of Jordan entered in this book (<hi rend="italic">The routue register</hi>), but do not find opposite it the names of MISS L. Byng Miss. S. Anslie, or Miss Marriott, I can only find the names of Miss L. Byng ✗ and Miss Anslie in book F I—I discovered Miss</p>

               <p>L. Byng in book C 3, described as a lady without any money—I am sure of that. (<hi rend="italic">She had been described as "to have a small legacy at twenty-one"</hi>) Two books were handed to me, called "<hi rend="italic">Nom de plume</hi>" books—those two ladies' names are not in them—the two books are similar; one is a continuation of the other—turning to "Jordan" in F 1, I find the names of those three ladies put opposite his; "Miss F. Byng" is written full, then comes "Miss S. A.," and then "Negociator 217"—I find here the description given to Jordan as the personal description of those ladies—I find the same names given a great many times with widely different descriptions—"Miss S. A" appears 105 times, with a different description as to ago, person, and fortune—I gave up the inquiry after letter H—the entry about Miss L. Byng is "tall, fair, good-looking, without"—in the ladies' register Miss L. Byng has no address after May 16th, and shortly after "Will come to see us, May 16th"—the last date is May 19th—under the head of "Correspondence," F 1 and F 2 give the initials which were supplied, with the description of each lady—this is a memorandum book by which the Association knew the particular description that had been given, to aid them in conducting their correspondence—I find Miss Alice May as the first lady introduced to Jordan; I do not find her name entered in any books; I include in that answer the <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> book, but I find a reference "Miss A. May equals Miss A. M. Austin," and, turning to C 1, of 46, I find Miss Ada May Austin with the <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> of Miss A. M. Stewart; I follow that lady to the high class register. C 9, 40, and find her description there, but she does not tally with Miss A. May; the entry is "Miss Ada May Austin equals Miss Stewart;" she is described as being 25, but Jordan's name does not appear opposite to her—I find that thirty-five names were submitted to Jordan subsequent to June 18th, and only one is a high-class lady—out of the other thirty-four names there are four which I have been unable to trace in the register book; one was Miss Rich—prior to Jordan paying the high-class fee he had two ladies from the high-class register, so that he got a larger number from that register before paying the fee than afterwards—Miss Rich had no money, although she was on the high-class register; that is quite common—the name of Miss Penryn which was given to Mr. Driver, does not exist in any of the registers; I only found it in the advertisement—I cannot find Miss A. W. Cart-wright in any of the books; there is a Miss A. B. Cartwright—as to Grunafeld's case, I cannot find Miss Ennison, Miss Borwick, or Miss Markhouse in any register, always excepting F land F 2—I only found Miss Nelly Willcox’s name in pencil in the high-class register, and attached to that in pencil is "tailor's daughter"—I have gone through the introductions given to Grünfild, and out of twelve names sent to him after he joined the high-class register only two are from that register, all the 'others are low class.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. LOCKWOOD</hi>. This is the ladies' high-class register—it begins about October, 1893; there are about 215 names in it to October, 1895; most of them have private addresses, some are "Care of Editor," the private address is necessarily entered in the register—there is an analysis of the Roman Catholics, the Irish, and the Scotch—I have not communicated with any of them to see if they are genuine, for aught I know they are—there are only 187 ladies, not 215—Jordan had six names given him, exclusive of the first three—I have referred to the register, and eight of them, including Alice May, cannot be found—I find the details and private addresses all except seven, and I should say that they are genuine—there are about 6,000 names on the register, more men than women—in the ladies' register there are 3,735—in book L to Z, folio 2, I find the name of Neville; she is described as 23, well connected, good old family, £500 per annum, wants a <hi rend="italic">gent</hi>, highly connected, with £10,000 per annum—she is not married, she was transferred to the high class, and is still there—she first appears on the routine register in 1890—Miss Hayhurst is not on the high-class register, she is still routine—she has not been married—"Married" is generally written on the entry—in L to Z, folio 93, Miss A. McNeil is transferred to the high class, and marked "married"—A. May is marked "daughter of a woollen merchant, will have a dowry; no tradesman, not less than £100 per annum settled income"—Miss Gibbs was not transferred; she wanted a gentleman with £300 per annum, and she has got him—I can find no real record of her marriage; sometimes they are marked "Married" when they are not. (<hi rend="italic">The names, ages, descriptions and fortunes of other ladies were fare compared with the descriptions in the books A to K and L to Z, which differed in many particulars.</hi>) Driver never had sixteen names exclusive of the five negociated with; I found them, all but two, in the register, with their private addresses; those are apparently genuine cases—Grunfell had thirty names sent; I found them in the register, with private addresses given, and apparently genuine—sutton had thirty-three names sent, and I found all except one in the register, with addresses, and they are apparently genuine names—only three were recommended to Bacon, I searched for them in the register; they are genuine as far as I could judge—the references of those supplied to Brockett are correct—I find the entry "Married" in a great many cases.</p>

               <p>custody—he said, "This is a monstrous thing; this is a respectable business; we have thousands of ladies on our books"—subse<lb/>quently he said, "I do not see how you can charge me; I have had nothing to do with the business for the last two or three years"—I found this bundle of 230 letters, of which 167 were addressed, "Care of Editor," some to Lamb's Conduit Street, and some to 103, New Oxford Street, the dates ranging 1892 to 1895; about half of them were unopened, among which was one signed "Gertrude Abbot," November 9th, 1892, and another to Miss Bur<lb/>ford, dated October 19th, 1895; and this letter, purporting to come from Miss Marshall, dated June 13th, 1895, and a letter from Miss E. Locke, dated "Reading, June 13th, 1895"; the two last were in envelopes with the Reading post-mark on them—I found a number of books there, but no minute book recording the doings of the directors or the company, and no books relating to the Limited Company—I found in no book any resolution ordering any reductions—Mr. Folkard is the printer of the newspaper, and Mr. Brown is the advertising agent—this letter was found by the police. (<hi rend="italic">From Miss Locke, stating that she had received Mr. Bell's letter, which was exceedingly favourable, but as a former correspondent had approached her again, she did not feel at liberty to proceed further in the matter.</hi>) That is headed "Special letter to the care of the Editor"—when we first went there we found these two pamphlets, the violet one and the brown one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COHEN</hi>. I have received the testimonial pamphlet, there are some letters of thanks in it some of which purport to come from people who are on the books of the Association—they are all put forward as testimonials to the Association—I find in folio 2, "From an heiress of social standing who married into the peerage and who was given away on her marriage by an English Duke" then it goes on "Dear Sir, matters have been satisfactorily arranged with—, therefore do not send any further introduc<lb/>tions"; another is "From the son of a peer (English) of the realm and late Cabinet Minister upon his marriage with an heiress in<lb/>troduced by the Association,"—I have found the original of that—I have no doubt of those being original letters—on page 92 I find "From a mem<lb/>ber enclosing newspaper cutting respecting marriage of a peer's son brought by the Association. I send you the enclosed out of the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> be<lb/>cause I know it will interest you"—that is addressed "Dear Mr. Barrington, March 19th, 1885—I have found the original of that and the cutting with it—on page 98, I find this, headed "High-class Profes<lb/>sional," I am much obliged to you for the manner in which you have conducted the matter, and shall be pleased to recommend the services of the Association to anybody requiring a wife"—I have found the original of that, and believe it to be genuine—these letters are from 1884 to 1889, and are put in pamphlet form, I have compared nearly all of them with the originals, but some letters are missing, the date of the last is August 7th, 1895—I have examined the books, they show that a large business of a kind has been carried on since 1884—I have looked through about 700 letters, out of which I found about 182 engagements have resulted, and I find the records of 48 marriages—in the bundle of 125 letters which I found, 19 were complaints of making false promises and of not getting answers to letters, and that the advertisements in the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The book of testimonials is certified as containing correct extracts from the letters examined by E. L. Ernest and Co., chartered accountants, 63, Queen Victoria Street—in the headings to extracts 238 and 271 the writer is stated to have married a poor person, or it is a poor person who has married a rich person, they are from, the same person—Nos. 249, 197, 365, and 226 come from two persons named Paul and Tudor, and they are made to show that those two persons have contracted four marriages—I find a description in each, and in the marriage register I find them differently quoted—in another case, 54, 96, and 420, are from two persons, Whiting and Owen, and, by the heading. 54 is from a small fanner, married to a lady with means; 96 is the marriage of a farm attendant, to a female teacher, and 420 a farmer marrying a young heiress, I have turned to the letter, and Mr. Whiting says that she had no means—in 429 and 431, from a Mr. Wren, he is described as a well-to-do widower, and in the letter the writer says that</p>

               <p>he is out of employment, and in a state of poverty—25 and 68 are from one letter divided, the heading of each testimonial being different, and the marriage register is quoted so as to show that there have been two marriages—in the bundle in Maddows' bag, I found the names of Mr. Walrond, and the Rev. Mr. Adams, and I find in the marriage book a Lieut. Adams connected with the same lady, and an entry on the other side of the book "Settled"—that purports to be a record of the marriages effected by or through the Association—I also found this correspondence in Maddows' bag; this is information supplied through Stubb's office, "Confidential. In answer to your question, respecting the Rev. F. A. Adams; he has, it is said, recently married a daughter of G. W. Sprules, Esq., of Manx Field, Wray Common, Reigate; his income is between £600 and £700 per annum"—I also found this letter from Mr. Adams: "What do you mean by your repeated suggestions that I was married to Miss Sprules, of Reigtae, through any influence of yours; she was never introduced to me through any of your agents, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi> You can take what action you like, but, if you claim to have had anything to do with my marriage, I shall not merely reply that it is false, but that on the falsehood you attempt extortion, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi> It will surprise me if an English jury does not give me exemplary damages.—F.

                  </hi>. I am a widow—in December, 1894 I was living in Delancey Street, Regent's Park—my husband had been dead then not quite twelve months—about six o'clock, on Monday evening, December 2nd, I was in Bond Street, dressed in widow's weeds, when the prisoner came up and said, "You must be a very young widow?"—I said, "I am; I am only twenty-one"—he said, "Tell me all about your husband, and how he died"—I told him all about him—he eventually asked if he might call—I wrote down my address and gave it to him—I said I was not in the habit of receiving gentlemen, but he might call, as he said he would be such a friend to me—he said he could not stop and talk to me that evening as he was going to a grand dinner, but that he would write, and let me know when he would call—I was talking to him for about a quarter of an hour—he did not give his name—next morning I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was on paper with the printed heading," Grand Hotel, London," and stated, "Please expect me to-morrow, Tuesday, between one and two o'clock.</hi>) Next day, between one and two, the prisoner drove up in a cab—I let him in; he took off his coat, and sat down in a chair by the are—he said he had got a nice house in St. John's Wood; would I like to be his housekeeper? that he was just sending the lady who had been living with him away to Coventry; she had no money whatever, and he was not going to give her any; she had got about £18,000 worth of jewellery, which he had given her; that he would give me £5 a week to begin with, to be increased to £10 if everything went on satis<lb/>factorily; that he had estates in Lincolnshire, and he would be having some grapes sent him next day, and would forward me some—I was to give up my apartments—he wanted to go away in his yacht to the South of France before Parliament sat, and was anxious to get me settled before he went—his umbrella bad a rather massive silver top, with some mono<lb/>gram or initials on it—I thought he was quite a gentleman; he was dressed as such—he said he would make out a list of dresses I should get, because I must leave off my mourning—he said he would give me some jewellery—I gave him my writing case, and he wrote out this list of dresses and other things. (<hi rend="italic">This list was marked Q.</hi>) I did not suggest the items to him—he made out a list of jewellery I was to have, rings, brooches, bracelets and a watch; he took that list away with him—he specified the various shops, at which I was to get the things—he gave me a cheque for 15 guineas, with which I was to pay a deposit of £10 at Redfera's—he had two cheques, one for £10 10s., and the other for £15 15s. in his pocket, already written. (<hi rend="italic">The one produced was on a promissory note form.</hi>) He put it into an envelope, and addressed it in my presence to the Union Bank, Belgrave Mansions—I did not see him write anything on the cheque—I said, Could not I get it changed without going to Belgrave Mansions, as it was such a long way off?—he said, No, it would not do for a gentleman in his position to have a cheque changed anywhere"—I said, "I cannot get there to-day"—he said, "The bank keeps open to six o'clock at Christmas time"—he asked me what jewellery I had—I told him not much; I was wearing my rings—</p>

               <p>he said he must have a ring for the size of my finger; he wanted one to take away for my size, and he would buy me a more massive wedding ring—he took my wedding ring for the size, and another one; I was wearing two of my husband's rings at the time on my little finger—he put the two rings into an envelope and put them in his pocket—he said he would return them about five o'clock by a commissionaire, with one arm, from the Grand Hotel—the value of the two rings would be about £5 or £6—he said he would call again the following Thursday to make final arrange<lb/>ments—he took a brooch, worth about £1, from my dressing-table without my knowing it—I missed it after he had gone—later in the day I saw my brother, and showed him the cheque; and, in consequence of what he said, I never presented it—I did not communicate with the police; my brother said it would be no good—in January my brother showed me a newspaper report, in consequence of which I went to Westminster Police-court on January 19th, without previously communicating with the police—I went straight into the Court, and found the prisoner standing in the dock; I saw his back—I should know him among a thousand—I recognised him at once—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was on the Balham Branch of the London and South Western Sank.</hi>) He said I could cash it at the South Belgravia Branch—I gave him an envelope to put it in, and he sealed it up and addressed it—he said also that he would give me some jewellery, and asked me to let him have one of my rings to get the size of my finger—I asked him to take the size in cardboard—he said he preferred having the ring—I was wearing some rings, but I did not care to part with them, so I borrowed a diamond horseshoe ring, worth £7 or £8, which I gave him—he was with me about one and a quarter hours—before he left he said he had a pensioned-off coachman who lived near me, and he wanted to take him some money, and he had not any change; could I lend him £2?—I believed about the pensioned coachman, and lent him £2—he said I could deduct it out of the £30 cheque—he said a commissionaire would bring the ring back that evening—the ring did not come—I did not see the prisoner again until lately—I took the cheque to Sloane Square, and was referred there to the Balham Branch of the London and South Western Bank—I presented the cheque there, and it was dishonoured and returned—I then went to Albany Street Police-station, and reported what had happened and described the man who had robbed me—at the beginning of February, this year, the police came to me—I went to Westminster Police-court and saw the prisoner with a number of other men in the court yard, and identified him at once without difficulty—he wrote both the body and the signature of this cheque in my presence—he spoke with a slight foreign accent.</p>

I am a widow—in March, 1895, I was living in a flat in Shaftesbury Avenue—on March 6th I was walking with my little daughter in Piccadilly about 1.15 p.m., when the prisoner asked me if I was Lady somebody (I do not remember the name he used)—I said I was not, unfortunately—he asked me then where I. was living, and if I knew Lord Aberdeen—I said I did, but I knew his brother, better—I thought by that that I knew the prisoner, and had met him at</p>

               <p>and suggested that I should go to it—I said I was very happy where I was—he said he should like to buy me some better dresses and jewellery, and asked for a piece of paper on which he could write out a list—he wrote out this list—he arranged to call the following Monday to arrange matters—he said I had better pay a deposit, and he wrote out this cheque for £35, which he put in an envelope, and addressed it to a bank in St. James's Street—he said I should want a ring, and asked me for a ring to measure the size of my finger—I gave him a small diamond ring, and also a gold bracelet which was dented, and which he offered to get repaired at Streeter's—he said a commissionaire with one arm in a sling would bring them back in an hour—I fetched from another room, and showed him, a marquise ring in a case; I left that in the room in which he was—I went out of the room twice, once for matches to light a cigarette, and once for a photograph—after he had gone I missed my ring out of its case; the ring is worth about £15, it was given to me—I valued all he took at £15, but the marquise ring I find is worth a good deal more than I said—I went to St. James's Street, but could not find any Union Bank there—on July 9th I went to the Police-station and gave a descrip<lb/>tion of the man—on December 16th I was sent for, and went to the Police-station, and there, among seven or eight men, I recognised the prisoner after he took off his hat—he had his hat on; I asked that he might take it off, and when he took it off I knew it was him—I say now he is the man—he was in my apartments three-quarters of an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was influenced by his taking off his hat in identify<lb/>ing him—I could tell him better with his hat off—there is nothing remarkable about his hair; he is slightly inclined to be bald on the top of his head; but I was influenced by his whole appearance—there is a peculiarity in the shape of his face—I did not mention that in the description I gave—when I met him in St. James's Street, he spoke to me first, and then to the little boy with me, "What a nice little boy"—I had never seen him before—I think he must have known me, because he lived in Victoria Street—I found out at the Police-station where he lived—I don't know how long he had lived then at Victoria Street—I saw him write in his pocket-book my address at York Street, Westminster—I know now that my name and address were not found in anything belonging to the prisoner—the lady with me in St. James's Street did not glance at the man when he spoke to me; she walked straight on; she was not with me when he called—she did not go to the Police-court—when he called he had on a frock-coat, with white lining to his waistcoat, and white spats, a heavy gold chain, and ap<lb/>parently a gold watch—I think he had a pearl pin; I do not remember—I described the man as between fifty and sixty, rather short, about five feet two, rather fat, with a dark complexion (I have not a good memory) moustache cut short, brown, turning grey; it was a tawny sort of moustache, with a lot of grey in it—I remembered more then than I do now—I law his watch—he wrote everything but his name in the ordinary way; he wrote his signature to the cheque with the pen between two fingers—I did not notice him write the list so much—I was sent for an hour or two after the prisoner was arrested, and had not time to read any description of him—Miss Meissonier was at the Police-court when I got there—I had not seen her before—she spoke to me of him, asked me</p>

               <p>what I had lost and that sort of thing—none of the men among whom the prisoner was placed was like the prisoner so far as I saw—my attention was attracted to him at once—I looked round and saw him, and said I should not like to swear till he took his hat off; I did not notice any other man—I should not like to swear that there was another well-dressed man there—there was another man with a grey moustache, but he was too tall and had a ruddy face—afterwards at the Police-court I heard his address and came to the conclusion that he must have followed me as he lived round the corner—when he spoke to me in the street he had on a low round hat—I cannot remember if he had on a light or dark suit of clothes; I think it was a brown sort of coat—he was dressed quite differently when he called upon me—the things I lost I could easily identify.</p>

I live at Fulham, and teach music—I am German—on November 26th I was passing through Victoria Street, going to a flower show—I met the prisoner who passed, turned back, and lifted his hat, and said, "Oh, pardon; are you Lady Everton?" or "Illington"—then he asked my. pardon, as he said he had made a mis<lb/>take, and asked me where I went; I said I went to a flower show—he said it was not worth while going there, because the flowers were very poor; and as he kept ten gardeners in Lincolnshire, his flowers were much better—I said I had that very morning received a box with some chrysanthemums, and as they were very beautiful he asked permission to come and see them—I gave him my address—he spoke in English; I remarked that he was a foreigner, and he said no, he was an Englishman—the following day he called—my servant, Harvey, opened the door—he said his cousin was Lord Salisbury; that he had a very great estate in London, nearly all the property round West Brompton belong<lb/>ing to him; and that he had £180,000 a year—he proposed that I should join him and six other people in a trip to the Riviera, because I was musical and spoke several languages, I should be very useful—I speak three languages very well, English, German and French, and Italian and Portuguese a little—at first I declined, and then I thought I ought not to throw away such a good occasion, and I told him I might manage to go for a fortnight, but not longer—he thought my toilette was not good enough, and he wrote out this long list I had to stop him, he wanted to make it so long—he told me to go to Redfern's—he wanted me to order a riding habit at Cobb's, of Baker. Street; as it was a yachting trip I asked him what I wanted it for, and he said when we landed he had always his own horses there; to pay for the things he gave me this cheque for £40, to open an account—he wrote out the body in my presence, I think the signature was already written—he held the pen between the second and</p>

I am chambermaid at the Buckingham Hotel, Strand—Beck was there when I went there in, I think, February, 1894—Beck stayed there till last September—I saw his clothes—he had his things washed there—I never saw him with a gold watch—I saw him with a black one, like that produced, and a gold chain—I never saw jewellery in his rooms—up to May or June, 1895, he was rather shabby, when he began to brighten up—after that he had good clothes—I never saw him wear a white waistcoat—I never sent any to the wash—I never saw him wear white spats—he had a black overcoat lined with fur; he wore it a good deal—I looked after his room—I was in it every day—I have never seen elephants' tusks or a mandoline there—I have seen him writing; letters I believe—he wrote very badly and slowly.</p>

Jenkins, Baker and Co., solicitors, St. Michael's House, Cornhill—about the middle of January, 1895, Beck came to the office practically every day, sometimes before I got there at ten—he was there sometimes all day—he was introducing a mine, the Hannen's reef—then he went to Ward and Chandler's—he was paid considerable sums of money in respect of the mine—one cheque in September, 1895, was for £282, one in October for £100, and he had 3,500 shares allotted him—his dress was "medium" the early part of the year, but afterwards he was better dressed—I never saw him with a massive gold chain, gold watch, nor pearl pin—he had an oxidised watch—I should say this is the one he was wearing—I did not see a chain, he used to take it out of his ticket pocket—I have seen him</p>

                  </hi>. I was living at 2, Jedbro' Road, Plaistow, with my father and mother, and six other children; the youngest, Arthur William, was about six months old at the time of his death—I and my two sisters used to live in the back room, and in the other room my mother and three other sisters slept besides me—on the night of February 4th we all went to bed in that way—on the morning of the 5th I got up about half-past seven to get father's breakfast ready—I went down to breakfast, and father came in with my sisters, and had breakfast; mother remained upstairs with Arthur—during breakfast, a little before eight, I went upstairs to ask mother if she would like some tea—I met her dressed, just by her bedroom door—she said, "I am going down into the back garden"—she looked very white, her face was drawn, and her eyes glaring—she went downstairs, and after a minute or two came into the</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor is my son; I live with him—on January 21st, about a quarter-past nine, a knock came to the door—I went and called my son; he opened the door, and three men entered the house. (<hi rend="italic">Being asked if she saw one of them in Court, she looked round the Court.</hi>) I have not my glasses—I went to the Police-court the following day; I saw one of the men there, and identified him (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner</hi>)—that is one of the men; I never looked that way before—the men demanded money and keys, and seized my son; I escaped into the garden and called out, "Murder! thieves!"—one of the men came to me and pulled me off the fence—he held a pistol at my head and said, "Dare you speak one word!"—he pulled me into the kitchen, where I found my son with a rope round him—all the three men wore masks, and next morning I found them behind some things; these are them; I burnt one, and I was going to burn these, when I saw the holes in them—the man only held me tightly; no other blows—the prisoner is one of the three, but not the one that held me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When my son opened the door the tall man entered first—he presented a revolver at my son—they made a very bad remark; I escaped; I did not stop when I saw three ruffians come in—I did not see the revolver presented; they pulled down the masks as they were coming in; they came in one behind the other, and the last one stooped</p>

I am a greengrocer, of 20, Lewis Grove, Lewisham—on the night of January 21st, about half-past nine, I heard cries of "Murder!"; I ran out of my shop—the back part of 97, High Street is in Lewis Grove—when I ran out I saw a crowd running from the front of the shop round to the back—I heard cries, "There he goes!" as I was trying to help a policeman over the back way, and saw the prisoner and Fletcher, the prisoner was first, and Fletcher after, running towards Belmont Road—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I gave chase, too—the prisoner turned to the left by the Mews; I followed him through the Mews into Granville Road; I did not see him stopped—I lost sight of him at the corner of the Mews—I saw him as he was passing a lamp-post—I did not see him stopped by Crisp and Fletcher; I saw him being held by them—after that I went towards where I thought I heard a sound go as I was running, and I found this jemmy in the gutter in Belmont Road—the prisoner had not passed by that place—I should say he was between eight and ten yards away from it when he was held by Crisp and Fletcher; they dragged him on to the pavement by the iron railings; that would be further away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman to Cohen and Co., pro<lb/>vision merchants, Tooley Street—in September, 1894, I bought and sold to the prisoner—the last date I sold to him was April 9th, 1894—on September 3rd, 1894, I received sixty-six boxes of cheese, and on the 6th more boxes—before receiving them I advanced £260 on them, and eventually sold them for £333 0s. lid.—our charges amounted to £13 10s. 4d. at 6d. commission, and there was discount on this item—they have not been paid for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision merchant, of the firm of Lovell and Christie—on September 5th I spoke to Mr. Clark through the telephone; he was in Pennall's office. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Clark here stated that he was in Pennall's office, and spoke to the witness through the telephone.</hi>) He made me an offer of 49s. for 1,000 boxes of cheese; a price I was not willing to take—I asked what credit Pennall would give; he said, "Two months"; I said, "No"—he said he would refer to Mr. Pennall, which he did, and then said that Mr. Pennall would take the cheese at 60s.—that was keeping cheese; it would not require immediate sale—I said, "I cannot send the delivery orders to-day, I am very busy"—the reply was that it was of no consequence—I gave instructions to Mr. Clark—I was not at business on Thursday, but I learned on Friday that the delivery orders were sent for on Thursday morning—the cheeses were at the railway station—I have beard that the consignment of those cheeses went to Messrs. Dotteridge—I have been in business over forty years—it is not the custom of the trade to deposit unpaid for goods for an advance; if a merchant was known to do such a thing, we should not trust him, and it would destroy his credit entirely—profits are cut very close in the provision trade, it will not stand two profits—the carriage from Liverpool is 25s. per ton on the gross weight; the purchaser has to pay the carriage, the commission, and the discount, but he would get discount allowed if he paid cash.</p>

W. Dotteridge came to the prisoner's office and asked if he had any lard to offer—the prisoner said, "What is the quantity? I have 1,500 pails come from Liverpool"—he said, "What do you want for them?"—the prisoner turned to me and said, "Get me the particulars"—I went into the office, and got this very con<lb/>tract—the prisoner gave Mr. Dotteridge the marks and he said, "Why, this is the very lot of lard I have been trying to buy through Travers," and they walked out together—the lard is entered to Mr. Dotteridge on the 6th, but not in my hand—it had not arrived; it was not forwarded for two or three days—I cannot say whether the contract notes arrived on the 5th or the 6th—later on in the afternoon the prisoner said, "I think I shall sell that lard to Dotteridge, the 1,610 pails"—I said, "I don't think I should sell it to Dotteridge if I were you"—he asked why, I said, "If you sell it to Dotteridge he will very like put it contra account"—the prisoner owed Dotteridge £4,000; he said, no I am going to make other arrangements with Mr. Dotteridge—on September 7th the prisoner came to the office and said, "Have you got the balance-sheet made out?" I said, "Yes, I have." he said, "How do I stand?" I said, "You can pay 12s. in the pound"—he expressed surprise, and asked for the balance-sheet—we could only pay 10s. in the pound after we had paid off Dotteridge—he did not look at it in my presence—I told him we had £1,600 to meet that day, and he told me to look in the ledger and see what accounts were due, where we could get any money from—I did so and went to Smithfield, and tried to collect one or two accounts, but did not succeed—I went back between twelve and one, and told him I had not got any money—we were holding a cheque for £700 of Mr. Wears, next door, in the prisoner's</p>

I am a broker in the wholesale provision trade of Liverpool—I have acted for the prisoner many years—I have taken orders for him on August 17th and 28th and September 4th—I received the letter just read—I made no inquiry about what was meant by "don't make too much fuss about the money; I will send you a wire on Monday"—I saw the prisoner when he came about September 7th—I received a telegram <hi rend="italic">from</hi> him, and bought 1,510 pails.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sometimes bought goods for him without stated instructions, and I have deposited them for him with provision dealers for sale, and had them sold, and realised a profit—I have done, that for some years; those were goods that had not been paid for—I placed them in the hands of provision merchants for sale, to realise a profit for him—I recognised this letter when shown it at the 'Police-court—by "When October comes," etc. I understood that he had £4,000 worth of butter, and it would be in the market in September or October; and owing to the fact of the money being looked up he would realise, and be able to pay, and have more money at his disposal—his letter commences: "I enclose cheque for £100"—he owed me a little more, and that was on account—he says: "I am keeping level with Weir, he has been hit hard"—the prisoner was not contemplating bankruptcy then to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not know that there was a large consignment of butter all pledged—I have more than once put goods unpaid for into the hands of provision merchants, to sell on the prisoner's account in Liverpool; some of them would not go to him at all; I should deliver them immediately to people in Liverpool, and they would sell them, or I might sell them; it would. depend upon the market; I should do that on a rising market; that would apply only to perishable goods—I don't buy anything else—keeping cheeses, are not perishable goods for six or nine</p>

               <p>months, nor is lard—my practice would not apply solely to perishable goods; where a man has over bought they might be in a condition in which he might be justified in doing it—I have frequently invoiced to merchants in London, and placed their goods in the hands of the pro<lb/>vision dealers to sell—it is not the custom of the merchant to agree to a sacrifice—you put that question to me at the Police-court; you asked me if it was customary to place foods, which had not been paid for, in the merchant's hands, and I said it did not come within my experience; I know the fact; but I say, if it is customary, it would not interest the man who was advancing the money—it is commonly done by the original seller who has parted with his goods on credit, passing through the medium of another merchant in the same trade; I don't say it is done every day, but it is frequently done; the prisoner has done it largely; I think I could name firms in London and Liverpool who have done it; I will not say on a large scale—there have been a good many failures in Tooley Street in the provision trade, and I know of one case of a pledger; I do not know that the failures are all of pledgers.</p>

If a man has no available, balance at his bankers, it is customary to buy goods on credit and get money on them—if he is the seller, of course he would not give credit—if a man has no balance at his bankers and buys, it is rather a case of "Heads, I win; tails, you lose."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the National Provincial Bank, City office—the prisoner had an account there—I produce an ex<lb/>tract from it, between August 28th and November 16th, certified by the manager—on August 30th the balance was £599 20. 3d.—after a conver<lb/>sation between the manager and the defendant, the reserve was increased on September 4th from £800 to £1,000; it was not kept at £1,000, but it should have been—the account was closed by a cheque for Mr. Berry for £63 1s. 5d. on November 9th—on September 7th, the credit balance was £828 11s.; it should have been £1,000—I included a cheque for £697 3s. 5d. on the evening of the 7th; it was paid in in the morning, but we had our doubts about it, and sent it out to be cashed; otherwise it would not have gone out till next day—our balance of £828 was after crediting and debiting him with that cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> So the balance was the same in the evening as in the morning—we have a credit of £800 without Weir's cheque—there is no statement in the certified copy when that cheque was presented; but it must be in the books—we received notice not to pay in cheques—if it was presented on the 6th, it would be paid on the 7th; there would have been sufficient money to pay it, but I do not know whether we should have paid it out of the £800 reserve—we received orders not to pay it, and probably we had not the money there—we should put N.S. or "Orders not to pay"—we might put both—there are three bills which we did not debit the account with, because they went towards the £1,000.</p>

I took the prisoner in Waterloo Road, on February 11th, about 8.30; and told him it was for robbing a gentleman at a coffee-stall, he said, "I know nothing about it, but I will go with you"—he was placed with seven or eight others, and identified by the coffee-stall keeper, who knew him well.</p>

I am a musical composer of the New Kent Road—about 1.15 a.m., on February 11th, I was at a coffee-stall in the London Road, having a cup of coffee—I was alone—a man asked me to stand him a cup of coffee, which I did—three or four men who were standing round, seized me by my throat, and one of them said "<hi rend="italic">Down</hi> him"—was not thrown down, but I was throttled, and £3 in gold, 5s. in, silver, a cuff, a bunch of keys, and some studs, were taken from my pockets—my throat was painful for a week—I went to the station and picked out one man, but I was not certain of him.</p>

I keep a coffee-stall in the London Road—I was there on the morning of February 11th, and the prisoner and three others came up—Marriott was there, he treated one man, who I should know again—the prisoner seized Marriott by the throat, he crushed his throat and threw back his head—I shouted out, and they let go, and all walked away, including the man to whom Marriott had stood a cup of coffee—I have known the prisoner twelve months as a customer—I am quite sure he is the man who seized Marriott—I went to the station and picked him out at once, without any hesitation.</p>
