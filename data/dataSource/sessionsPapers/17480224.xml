               <p>St. Andre. I had this boy upon trial, and I suspected my Journeymen and apprentices, but I did not suspect this <rs id="t17480224-3-deflabel17" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>Q. When did he tell you so?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. He told me so several times, and before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he sold them for?</p>
               <p>St. Andre. He said he sold some for a shilling, some for 9 d. and some for 6 d. they were all sold for seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they worth?</p>

            . I have seen the Prisoner frequently coming in and out of Mr. St. Andre's shop; and on the twenty-third of January, in the morning, I saw him in Austin-friars, under a gateway, with an old clothes man; I asked him what he had been doing with the man; he said he had been selling a wig to him for sixpence that he had bought of another boy for three pence, and I saw the old clothes man give him six pence. I asked him whether he had shewed that wig to any of his own people at home; he said no, what signified shewing such an old wig to any body.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner did not deny the fact, but said the old clothes man told him he might as well bring two or three as one.</p>

               <p>Q. What door was broke open?</p>
               <p>Burnell. That which comes into the street. The cellar door is made of inch and half deal?</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find your cellar door?</p>
               <p>Burnell. One of the boards was broke off it on top, and the top staple drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that it was fastened?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first observe that it was broke open?</p>
               <p>Burnell. On Sunday morning when I first got up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you suspected the Prisoners to be concerned in it?</p>
               <p>Burnell. I could not suspect any body; but one of them being taken, he impeached the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Robert Wilson, the accomplice, sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes; and I have this to say, Stevens got a knife from his father's. in order to break open the shop, and he attempted to break open the groove, and broke the knife in three pieces; when he found he could not do that, he took a board off the cellar door, went down into the cellar, and brought up two gallons of brandy, a gallon of usquebaugh, and sixteen papers of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Who broke open the cellar door?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Stevens did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I was at the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do there?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Hill and Stevens bid me stand there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what they were going to do?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Not till I saw what they were doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this done?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We began to endeavour to get into the shop about two o'clock, and we got into the cellar about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover this?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Last Saturday was sevennight; I was taken up, and then I discovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the Prisoners taken up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Last Saturday night was fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you taken up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Last Saturday morning was fortnight.</p>
               <p>Pris. Stevens. I know nothing of the robbery no more than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Hill. I was hired to carry it, and I carried it, not knowing that it was stolen. It is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>Thomas Ind. I am a chairman. When the witness was taken, he told me where to go to the gentleman who bought the brandy.</p>
               <p>Paul Gossett. The Prisoner, Hill, came to my house one night when I was very busy, and desired me to take a little brandy of him; I told him I would not take any, and turned him out of doors; (I have known Hill a great while, for he was a customer to me, and paid me very well) he came within doors again, and importuned me to take it: I asked him the price, he said he would have 6s. 6d. a gallon; there was a gallon and half a pint, and I gave him 6s. 9d. for it: He drank a pint or two of beer and went out of my house, and I never saw him since that I know of. I always found Hill to be a very civil fellow, and always thought that he worked hard for his bread.</p>
               <p>Pris. Hill. My Lord. I always worked hard for my bread, and never did any such thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Richard Mascall. I am the constable who took the Prisoners. I took all three, two on the Saturday and one on the Sunday morning, and both Stevens and Wilson confessed the breaking open of Mr. Burnell's cellar, and taking out the brandy and usquebaugh.</p>
               <p>William Smith. This Robert Wilson confessed, that he in conjunction with Stevens and Hill broke open a cellar of Burnell's and company, the corner of <placeName id="t17480224-4-crimeloc23">Newtoner's-Street</placeName>

               <p>Smith. He did not confess any thing of this; the Prisoners have confessed other robberies to me.</p>

             . Mr. Partridge (partner with Mr. Barnston) came to me, and said he thought he had a thief in the house, and wanted to consult with me about it. He said their journeyman had told them, he had missed money out of the drawer, and they pressed him to tell who he imagined to be the thief, and he said he believed it was their porter: They contrived to mark some money, and I marked four shillings and two sixpences, and gave them to their journeyman to put into the till.</p>

               <p>Turvill. They were marked on the back of the head with a stroke, and a little one under that, with a mark under the chin; these three pieces I marked; the next morning I called, and the man was gone to the Compter.</p>

             (journeyman to Mess. Partridge and Barnston .) I had missed money out of the till, and I was particularly sure that I had lost some. And in order to find the person out, I saw two shillings and four sixpences marked, and I put them into the drawer: When I first came down in the morning there was only one shilling missing, and I said to him tha t I would go and get a pennyworth of purl. I did this to try him, for my master desired I would give all the liberty I could, and then I missed two sixpences. When the Prisoner was taken he pulled the money out of his pocket; he said he had never wronged his master but once before, and that was of eighteen pence, and had never robbed him of five shillings in his life.</p>

               <p>Ball. Watts came to my house to desire me to go to the club; it is a fudling sort of a club, and I did not care to go, but he persuaded me; and when we came from the club, we all agreed to go together to do this.</p>
               <p>Leadley. Watts put his foot upon my shoulder, and so he got up.</p>

               <p>Jones. I was going by, and she was standing at the door, and asked me to give her a dram; I went up stairs with her, and in five minutes time my watch was gone; she took it out of my Fob. The Prisoner offered the watch to the woman of the house, and the woman told her she had robbed the young man of the watch [meaning the Prosecutor]; the Prisoner came up stairs again, and the watch were sent for, and she was carried to the Gatehouse; and after she was committed, the constable and beadle said they believed it was in her stocking, for they thought they saw something stick out: The constable said to her, be so good as to deliver the watch, and she said she would not; afterwards she told the constable he should have the watch, if he would let her have it again, and the keeper of the Gatehouse was forced to take the watch from her, for she would not give it to him.</p>
               <p>The keeper of the Gatehouse's man produced the watch, which was sworn to by the Prosecutor.</p>

             . On the twelfth day of the month I was busy in my shop with four customers, the Prisoner Cuthbert came into the shop with a servant maid to buy some cloth, and Mrs. King was in the shop too.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Bell. Because my girl knew her afterwards; Cuthbert went out and came in again (it put a sort of a damp upon my spirits, for I thought she came to steal something) and after she had been gone about an hour I missed a piece of long lawn of thirty-two yards; the next day the young woman, the maid, who came with Cuthbert, and had bought some cloth, came to change it, and I asked her where the young woman lived who was in the shop with her yesterday (King;) she said she lived in New Hermitage-street with one Mrs. Cuthbert; and my boy said he would go and find her out, and he went to Cuthbert's, and saw something under her clothes, and he took this printed cotton from her, which was tied under her petticoats, after struggling with her for it, which is my cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your long lawn again?</p>
               <p>Bell. Yes, I found it at a pawnbroker's, but there were six yards cut off; I did not find it through her; I got a search-warrant and took up Mary King on suspicion, and she confessed where the long lawn was, but she did not confess that she was concerned in the taking it, and she denied before the Justice that she had a farthing of the money the long lawn was pawned for a guinea.</p>

            . Mrs. Bell said to me I have lost a piece of long lawn which cost me 4 l. 16 s. I said , Madam, perhaps you have mislaid it; no, said she, I laid it behind these dowlas: the next day the maid that came along with the Prisoner Cuthbert came to change the goods she had bought the day before; I asked her where the young woman lived who was in the shop yesterday; she said she lived with one Mrs. Cuthbert in New Hermitage-street : I went to Mrs. Cuthbert's and enquired for her; they said she was gone out, and might not be home for a month for what they knew; I said I would have her if she was to be found: the Prisoner King was there, she was drunk, and abused<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240009"/> me very much: I said it did not signify any thing, for I would have Mrs. Cuthbert if she was to be found. After I had been there an hour and an half, Mrs. Cuthbert came down; I told her Mrs. Bell wanted to speak with her; she said Mrs. Bell might come to her and be d - d if she would, for she would not wait upon her: I said if she did not come, I would get somebody else to fetch her; and by seeing a bulk under her petticoats, I said, I fancy you have got Mrs. Bell's goods under your petticoats; so I forced her down upon the ground, and I could not find any thing under her first petticoat: I felt under her second petticoat, and there I found this printed cotton, and she had this in her bosom, which was cut off the other; I heard she had cut this off with a design to give away to make a child's frock; I got four men, which cost three shillings, to bring her up to a Justice, and, with a great deal to do, we got her to Justice Duckenfield's , and he committed her. Mrs. Bell asked her where she had the cotton, she said she bought it for a gown at a shop on Tower-Hill; said Mrs. Bell, how came you to buy nine yards, when six is a good pattern ? said she, I have bought fifteen yards, and what is that to you? I am sure this cotton is Mrs. Bell's, for I had it in my hand that morning , and laid it upon the shelf. Then I took up Mrs. King, and carried her to Justice Manwaring; she said she was a young woman, and was drawn in, and told us, that the long lawn was at Mrs. Green's, a pawnbroker, and was pawned for a guinea.

The Prisoner came into our shop one night, towards dusk, about three weeks ago, under pretence of buying a shift; there was another with her, and the other kept us in discourse while the Prisoner, as I believe, took a piece of check off the shelf. As I was going down Rag-Fair I met this woman and another , each with an apron of the same check; I had not missed it above an hour before.</p>

               <p>Evett. Thirteen yards of yard and half wide<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240010"/> cotton check. I missed it the next morning, about an hour before I went out.</p>

               <p>Evett. I seized them, got a constable, and took up this woman; she was in many tones; first that she bought it for two shillings and three shillings; and several tales she was in, and at last she owned the taking it, and where it was sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she sold it?</p>

I live next door to the Crooked Billet, in Rosemary-Lane; the Prisoner at the bar came, with a person she called her mistress along with her, to my door; my maid called me, and told me two women wanted me; they asked me if I would buy a remnant of check; I asked them what they would have for it, they said twelve shillings, and that there was better than eight yards: I told them I would give them eight shillings ; they said they had brought it out of pawn for nine shillings ; I told them to pawn it again, for in my way I could not afford any more: They went away once or twice, and came back again, and took eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the eight shillings?</p>
               <p>Linstead . I laid it on the counter; I do not know which of them took it.</p>

            . I am husband to the East India Company.

I know nothing of the Prisoner, but before my Lord Mayor he confessed the taking the tea.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he drive any cart with tea?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes; and the chests were generally pretty much broke, and the tea run out; they are often broke when they come out of the carts by rubbing against the ships.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned the tea to run out?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Because the corners of the chests were broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner do any thing in order to get the tea out?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Yes, I have seen him take the tea out several times, by making little holes on the top of the chests, and so shook the tea out into his hand, or into the cart, and then take it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him do it in the month of August last?</p>
               <p>Roberts . I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he take away?</p>

               <p>Q. How much did he take at a time?</p>

               <p>Roberts. Yes, there are two in a cart to load it.</p>

             was just gone by with a mug, which they supposed to be silver, so drunk, that he could hardly stand; he went into an entry, and endeavoured to put it into his pocket. This is the mug. I asked him whose it was, and he said it was his. The Prisoner is a silver-smith, and I did not know but he might have it to do something to; I looked at it , and found no fault but a bruise on the side; and I suppose he hit it against something, in order to get it into his pocket. I saw a Castle upon it, and I went to Mr. Broome's, who keeps the <placeName id="t17480224-11-crimeloc63">Castle at Cow-Cross</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Broome. This is my mug.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green (Constable.) This mug was delivered to me at Justice Poulson's, and he ordered me to keep it till it was called for.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see it in the custody of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Green. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not hit it against any thing to bruise it, but I run against a post and bruised it . I did not know whether it was silver or pewter.</p>

               <p>Pris. I was going home with a pint of beer in it, and was very drunk.</p>

            . On the thirtieth of January my chimney was on fire, and I got the Prisoner to help put it out, and in a few minutes time she took the coral and necklace out of my room: She owned she pawned the necklace and locket to Mr. Paine for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say they were yours?</p>
               <p>Cole. I fetched Mr. Paine, and she said so before him; he is not well, and could not come . The Prisoner said she gave her mother the coral to sell, and she sold it to a silver-smith in East-Smithfield for twelve shillings and nine pence. She paid Mr. Paine the money for the necklace , and she said Mrs. Sanders pawned it again to one at Greenbank for fifteen pence; the pawnbroker delivered me the coral necklace, and did not take any thing for it. I do not know his name. Mrs. Sanders is not here; she said she would come if there was any occasion. The Prisoner owned she took these goods out of my house on the thirtieth of January, when my chimney was on fire . and that she gave her mother the coral to sell. I saw my coral hang up at a silver-smith's in West-Smithfield with my name upon it; I asked the gentleman whether it was to be sold, he said yes, and he told me he bought it the day before: I asked him what he would have for it, he said he would have fourteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240012"/> shillings ; I asked him what sort of a woman it was that brought it, he said a comely lusty woman , who said that a child was dead, and she sold it that the child might not lie above ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the silver-smith here?</p>
               <p>Cole. No, but I can fetch him. I paid the silver-smith for the coral again, for he said he bought it at a market price.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cole. The Prisoner was at the fire; (she is an acquaintance a few doors off;) I missed them out of my drawers, and found the necklace and locket pawned at Mr. Paine's for a shilling. She owned she took the coral and necklace the night the fire was.</p>

             . The Prisoner lodged two nights in my house, and in that time I lost money, and dispatched him out of the house, and some time afterwards I missed linen and this coat: I saw him in the street with this coat on, I followed him into a publick-house, charged a constable with him, and carried him before a Justice. He said he would give me any thing that would content me, if I would not carry him before a Justice; he said at first he bought it in Monmouth-street , and afterwards he said he bought it of a man in the street, who had it upon his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Hendey happened to see me in the street, and she said that was her husband's coat that I had got on; but I bought it of a man in the street who said he had a coat to sell; he asked 18 s. for it, and at last the bargain was made for 11 s. there is a man at the French Horn in Holborn who sitted the coat on. I told Mrs. Hendey I would make her any satisfaction if I did not find the man out in ten days time , but if I was committed to prison my name might be put into the newspapers, and then I thought I should never be able to find the man.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hendey said her husband was ill of the rheumatism , which was the occasion of his not being there.</p>

            . I missed this tea last Monday out of my compting-house; there were two large canisters there, but whether it was taken out of one or both I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gifford. The Prisoner came at two o'clock in the morning to wash, my man was to let her in, and I ordered him, when he went to bed again, to lock the shop door, which he neglected to do, as he tells me; I got a search-warrant, and found in the Prisoner's cellar about three pounds weight of that tea: She confessed it was my tea before the constable and the justice, but said that my servant gave it her; and she accused my servant of carrying tea home to his mother, but I could not find any there.</p>
               <p>There were three half pound canisters produced, which were found in her custody, and some in a paper, which Mr. Gifford said he believed to be his tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gifford. She has washed for me ever since I lived in my house. I have not lived t here above half a year. It is a hard thing upon a young beginner .</p>

            . On Monday, the fifteenth of February, I let the Prisoner in to wash about two o'clock in the morning. My master ordered me to lock the shop door, when I went to bed; but being heavy with sleep, I neglected to do it. The Prisoner had an opportunity of going in there till six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her taking it?</p>
               <p>How. No.</p>

               <p>How. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury (to Gifford) How far did these canisters stand off his bed?</p>
               <p>Gifford. They were in another room, about three yards off his bed, but if he was a sleep a person might come in and he not hear it.</p>

               <p>Holbert. Twice, and took out money both times. Mr. Keys came home about ten o'clock, and he said he believed he had robbed him, and bid him pull his money out, and the Prisoner pulled 4 s. 6 d. out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked ?</p>
               <p>Holbert. Some were marked, and some were not marked.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mark?</p>
               <p>Holbert. I do not know the mark because I did not see them marked.</p>

My son seeing a crest on the spoon called me ( he had weighed it); I came into the shop directly , and asked the young woman how she came by it; she told me she had bought it: I asked her what she gave for it; she told me eighteen shillings: Said I , my girl you have been imposed upon, it weighs but two ounces and a quarter, and, at six shillings an ounce, comes but to thirteen shillings and six pence. I asked her where she bought it; she said at a pawnbroker's: I said I would see her righted: Said I, what is his name ? she told me he lived in Somerset Street [by Whitechappel-bars ]. As we were going to the pawnbroker's, she tugged me by the sleeve, and said I will tell you the truth. This spoon is not mine, it is a young woman's who sent me to sell it. I said you should not have told me such a falsity . I went to my neighbour's, and he said there was no such thing taken out that day. (I went for my own satisfaction to know the truth of it) When I came from the pawnbroker's I had her back to my shop, took her name down, and where she lived, and I enquired what the person's name was that she had it from, and she said Calabar; I do not remember the christian name. I said I would take care of the spoon, and told her she must look after Mrs. Calaber, for her own security and character; and I found that Milner's mother went to inform Mr. Lee who had the spoon.</p>

               <p>Holloway. About Christmas time.</p>

               <p>Q. What condition was the girl in after this last beating?</p>
               <p>Holloway. She kept her bed several times; she was out of doors the day before she died, and the day after she died she had not a free place about her head, and her body appeared black and blue.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this?</p>
               <p>Holloway. It was told me by a woman who stood by when the girl was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The Prisoner had a horse died, and she laid the cause of it to this child, and said that this girl should not be long after him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner . I desire to know of her, why I took the girl to her house?</p>
               <p>Holloway. To shew me her nastiness, and how she was bedaubed with dirt* and water.</p>
               <p>* The deceased had an infirmity of nature, that she could not hold her water, &amp;c. and the Prisoner knew it before she took her, for the parish gave her six pounds with the child on that account .</p>
               <p>Pris. Would she ever let her shoes be tied? did not you see what a slattern she was?</p>
               <p>Holloway. The child was a slattern .</p>
               <p>Pris. Did not she deny every point of this the day after ?</p>
               <p>Holloway . Yes, she did, my Lord, but I was told, it was because she was beat so, that she durst not speak of it.</p>

These goods were exposed to sale by Coyle's mother, and I found the goods in Mrs. Coyle's house. Mr. Kitchin went along with me, and took my goods from Coyle's house: the Prisoner confessed he took 3 s 4 d. out of the till .</p>

               <p>Stacey . This is the same ring the Prisoner took off my finger,</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been to see a young woman an acquaintance of mine who was very ill: I went into this cellar and had a pint of beer; I had not been there long before this chairman came down; he sat down, and said I should drink with him ; I said I would not; he said if you will not drink part of a pint of beer, you shall drink part of a pint of hot: he sat me down upon a bench, and called for some bread and cheese, and then another pint of hot . He asked me whether I could help him to a lodging , for he was locked out of doors; I said I could not say but I had a bed, and he said, my dear , let me go along with you; I said I did not care that any body should lie in my room, but as he was destitute of a bed, he should lie in my bed, and I could lie with a young woman in the next room, and he lay in my bed; he let me have the ring for a shilling that he had of me: he asked for the ring, and I said I will not give you the ring till you give me the shilling, for he had not a halfpenny piece to show after he came out of the cellar. He threw me against the door of my lodging, and broke the door open by throwing me against it; and I said, young man, give me the shilling, and you shall have your ring; he went away, and I never saw him again till he brought the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove any thing of this?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have none here now, but I have very good housekeepers to appear to my character; it will go very hard on my side if I have them not here.</p>

I pursued her, and took my own things upon her: I asked her how she came by them, she said, do not be angry with me , and I will go back with you; I said, so you shall.

               <p>Q. When was this done?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Yesterday was fortnight .</p>
               <p>Q. That was the eleventh of this month?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come to your house for?</p>
               <p>Marsh . For relief.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Page?</p>
               <p>Marsh . He is one of the overseers of the poor. My master was not at home, and my mistress sent me with these sailors to another overseer, and one of the sailors said, I will go and bid our shipmates go along. There was a woman going along the road.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this that you first saw the woman?</p>
               <p>Marsh . It was when she was with a soldier .</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Marsh. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, one of the four <rs id="t17480224-31-viclabel175" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

                        targets="t17480224-31-victim285 t17480224-31-viclabel175"/>s said he would go and bid his ship-mates go along; so he parted from you, and you and the other three went on.</p>
               <p>Marsh. I went along with them to shew them the way, and I saw a soldier preventing the woman's going along.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Nothing, but prevented the woman from going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner, is that the <rs id="t17480224-31-deflabel176" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Marsh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this to prevent her going with the sailors?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Yes; and they went up to the soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between them ?</p>
               <p>Marsh . I could not well understand their language, but I understood that they said, if one could not lick him they all could, and they set up a run as fast as they could; and as soon as they came up to him he drew his sword, and said, if they did not go away he would stick them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner, was he the man that drew his sword?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Marsh . The sailors stepped back, but they did not offer to run away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the soldier to draw his sword, had any words passed between them?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came up close together, did you hear what they said?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240023"/>Marsh . No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard words spoke, though you did not know what they said?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Yes. When the soldier drew his sword, they stepped oack , and t hen the Prisoner put up his sword. There was another soldier in the road, said the Prisoner to the other soldier, as he was coming along, they have misused me, and then the other soldier got off his horse and run after them with a stick; then the Prisoner drew his sword again and run after them, and as the sailors were running along, one of them fell down, and then the Prisoner fell a cutting him as fast as he could?</p>
               <p>Q. Did the sailors run away?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Yes, they run away as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did all the four sailors run away?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Yes, they all run, but

             could not run so fast as the rest, and he fell down. I saw him tumble down, but I do not know what was the occasion of it .</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner cut him first, or did he tumble first?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I believe he tumbled down before the Prisoner struck him , and when he was down the Prisoner cut him, and laid on as hard as he could, and did not mind where he hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cuts did he give him?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give him two, three, or four?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Oh! several; he kept cutting him for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Until the other soldier came back.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the other soldier ?</p>
               <p>Marsh . But a very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be that he was cutting him?</p>
               <p>Marsh . About a minute or better.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave off then?</p>
               <p>Marsh . This lad, [ pointing to the next witness ] who was along with the other soldier, said he believed the Prisoner would kill the man, and desired him to assist him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave off then?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Why, the other soldier struck him two or three times on the head, in order to make him leave off.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he leave off then ?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the sword here?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No.</p>
               <p>Coroner . His comrade carried off the sword?</p>
               <p>Q. What sword was it?</p>
               <p>Marsh. It was a broad sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut him with a broad sword?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was cutting him a minute, how many strokes did he give him in that minute?</p>
               <p>Marsh . I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see at any time any of the sailors strike him?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What, never a one of them?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased do any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Marsh, No , I did not see him do any thing at all to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Marsh. They talked pretty much, but what they said I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether any of the sailors did or did not give him a stroke?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I cannot tell indeed, they might, for they were all round him.</p>
               <p>Coroner. The deceased had but one arm, his right arm was cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you did not see any one of the sailors strike the Prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Marsh . No. I did not see any one of them strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the Prisoner did not leave off striking him, till the other soldier struck him on the head with a stick to make him leave off?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Yes; and then the other soldier got upon his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner do then?</p>
               <p>Marsh. He took up his sword again, and went to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What house?</p>
               <p>Marsh. To Brown's Well, an alehouse on Finchley-Common .</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quartered there ?</p>

               <p>Q. What became of this poor man that was cut?</p>
               <p>Marsh . He lay there till such time as Mr. Newsham's man came.</p>

               <p>Marsh . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What, after the Prisoner was gone away?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240024"/>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Marsh . A couple of minutes. He lay in the place where he was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to lie there so long?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Indeed I cannot tell; perhaps he could not get up any sooner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to get up then?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Mr. Newsham's man that keeps the alehouse came up to him, I ran down to the house along with one of the sailors.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of his death?</p>

               <p>Marsh. At Brown's Well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these wounds afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I saw three wounds after he was in the house, but they were dressed that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these wounds?</p>
               <p>Marsh. There was one upon his left arm, one upon his left eye , and the other upon the back part of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what sort of wounds they were?</p>
               <p>Marsh. They were all very great ones, and all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them dressed?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you imagine he died of any of these wounds?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Q. What, before he cut ?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Yes, and then he put it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the sailor do when he laid hold of his sword?</p>
               <p>Marsh. He did not do any thing, but only desired the Prisoner to put it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it to wrest it out of his hand, or to prevent him from doing mischief?</p>
               <p>Marsh . No, it was not to get it out of his hand, but to prevent him from doing mischief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swears what is not true; I would ask him, whether when one of the sailors laid hold of my sword, that it was not to wrest it out of my hand, in order to use it against me?</p>
               <p>Marsh. No, I did not think so.</p>

             (a post-boy .) I was riding to Barnet between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see then?</p>
               <p>Harper . I saw four sailors round this soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Harper . On the bank just by Brown's Well, on the left hand as you go from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this Brown's Well upon the road?</p>
               <p>Harper. It is a house by the road side on Finchley Common: the Prisoner's comrag desired me to go up the bank along with him; as soon as this man got up the bank he got off his horse, and said he would clear the coast of them: as soon as he lighted off his horse he lifted up his stick and ran after the sailors, and then the Prisoner (seeing him come to his assistance ) drew his sword, and then all the four sailors run away as fast as they could: this sailor that the Prisoner cut so, could not run so fast as the rest, and the Prisoner catched him; as soon as he catched him, the man that died finding he could not get away from him, turned round, and begged of him not to strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his sword drawn then?</p>
               <p>Harper . His sword was drawn, my Lord: the Prisoner did not take any regard to what the man said to him, but he laid on him any where whereever he could strike him, under the arm or over the head.</p>
               <p>Q. How many strokes might he give him?</p>
               <p>Harper. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it with that he struck him?</p>
               <p>Harper. With his naked sword; when the sailor turned round , and begged that he would not strike him . The sailor was upon his legs then.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240025"/>Q. Did he fall down before the Prisoner struck him?</p>
               <p>Harper . No, after he struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the blows the occasion of his falling down?</p>
               <p>Harper. I cannot tell whether he fell down by the blows, or whether he fell down accidentally in turning back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see more?</p>
               <p>Harper. The deceased begged of him, while he was down, not to strike him any more, and cried out murder; but the Prisoner never minded that, but laid him on, back-stroke and fore-stroke, or any way that he could hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many strokes did he give him?</p>
               <p>Harper . He laid on as fast as he could; I could not tell the blows. Afterwards his comrag was coming up as fast as he could, and I seeing the Prisoner lay on him in this manner, desired him to go to the assistance of the deceased; his comrag came up , and struck him on the back part of the head with a stick , but the Prisoner did not leave off his blows . I desired him to leave off, but he did not mind me: Then his comrag struck him again .</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike him for?</p>
               <p>Harper . He struck him, because he observed that he had used the deceased so barbarously.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the deceased lie upon the ground?</p>
               <p>Harper. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Harper. The Prisoner went to the house at Brown's Well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not endeavour to help the deceased up?</p>
               <p>Harper. No, he left him on the ground. Then the other soldier got upon his horse again, and went with me to Brown's Well, and then he hit him again with the stick, took his sword from him, and threw it into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to this poor man's relief?</p>
               <p>Harper. There was a man came up to him, whether he helped him or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not endeavour to help him up?</p>
               <p>Harper. I was on horseback all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased brought down to Brown's Well?</p>
               <p>Harper. The deceased walked down to Brown's Well, after he had received his Wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him then?</p>
               <p>Harper . They tied his head up with his handkerchief , and he went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again afterwards?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did not see him till after he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Harper. The Sunday night following.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he die?</p>
               <p>Harper. About six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his naked body?</p>
               <p>Harper. No. I saw him after he was laid out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the wounds?</p>
               <p>Harper. I saw that his arm was cut, but I did not see any of the wounds opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came by his death?</p>
               <p>Harper. I do not know whether he died of the wounds, or as it pleased God.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would desire you to recollect yourself, whether, when the sailors came up near him, you saw the sailors, or any body else, strike him?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing that passed between them?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did not hear any thing that passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not see any body strike him?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any ill language between them?</p>
               <p>Harper. No.</p>
               <p>Pris. I know that neither this witness nor the other lad were there at the beginning of it, for there were several blows passed before they came up. Did you see the beginning of it?</p>
               <p>Harper. I speak what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner's sword twice out?</p>
               <p>Harper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it sheathed, till you saw him give these cuts?</p>
               <p>Harper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he laid on as fast as he could, and struck wherever he could; how many strokes might he give him? recollect yourself.</p>
               <p>Harper. I cannot be positive; but there might be ten or a dozen for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear or see any provocation given by the sailors to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did not, my Lord.</p>

             (a surgeon .) On the 11th of this instant I had an order from one of the overseers of the poor of the parish of Finchley to go to the assistance of a poor man who was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. What overseer?</p>
               <p>Bailey. One Jordan. I went to a house called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240026"/> Brown's Well, on Finchley-Common . The overseers were informed, that there was a man there who was wounded in a very terrible manner, and in a very dangerous way. I received the letter between seven and eight at night. According to the account I had, as soon as I had made up proper applications , and dressings, to take with me, I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in London?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I live at Highgate. When I came to the house, I went into the room where the de- y, (he lay upon straw) and upon enquiry that the wounds he had were upon his head .</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was he in?</p>
               <p>Bailey. In a sort of an outhouse. I got some were in the room to assist me in get- p. (The Prisoner was in a room by under the care of a headborough.)</p>
               <p>dress him on the straw?</p>
               <p>got him into a chair.</p>
               <p>wounds did you find?</p>
               <p>first place I began to examine the principal part, and the on the frons , or fore part from the forehead below the eye , and the skull, which is (the skull is divided into two tables and sometimes the outward table shall be broke and not the other) was divided, as if a butcher had taken a chopper and divided the skull, so that the brains lay open.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you judge this wound to be mortal?</p>
               <p>Bailey . Yes, Sir, I judged the wound to be mortal ; and upon his head being shaved, there appeared six other wounds upon the head, which went through the skin, but not into the skull; but the bone was bare, and I dressed them all. Then I made an inspection into the arm, and I found as many wounds there, from the wrist to the scapula, as I did upon the head. Upon the back part, what we call the scapula or shoulder bone, there were two wounds more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these deep wounds?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Especially three of them, and the bone of the arm was fractured by the incision, as if it had been done by a sword.</p>
               <p>Q. What arm was this on?</p>
               <p>Bailey . On the left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say on which side of the forehead the wound was.</p>
               <p>Bailey . The same side as those on the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you further observe of these wounds ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I then dressed all these wounds .</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have reckoned up fifteen ?</p>
               <p>Bailey . I believe there were fifteen, and they were all at that distance from one another, that they must all have been made by separate strokes, and from these wounds the man must be in a very weak and languishing condition, and I found him so; for he was so weak, that I thought he would not have had strength to have undergone the fatigue of dressing them. The man had no further bad symptoms, as one would suppose he might have, from a nervous part being thus wounded, for he had no convulsions. I got him to bed as soon as we could, and then I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you visit him again?</p>
               <p>Bailey. The next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dress the wounds the next morning ?</p>
               <p>Bailey . Yes, all of them, and I found him stronger than he was the night before. It was concluded by the officers of the parish to send him to the Hospital, but I had a message on the Saturday, that the man was not capable of being removed, and I was desired to go to dress him. I went on the Saturday, and when I came to him he was in a violent agony; he was in such agonies, that I was forced to get three or four people to hold him down, and I dressed him as well as I could, considering the agonies he was under I carried a cordial, what we call a Nervous Cordial, to give him a little comfort in his nerves, but he was hardly capable to receive the cordial, he was so weak. I left word with Mr. Newsham, the man who keeps the house, that if he was alive on Sunday, to send me word, for I very much doubted whether he would live or not, but he did live till Sunday evening; and the people of the house thinking they might be blamed sent for me; and when I came there, I found him dying , and it would have been of no use to dress his wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him die?</p>
               <p>Bailey No. I was told he lived but a very little while after I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Now please to give the Jury an account, which of those wounds was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Bailey . The mortal wound I take to be on the forehea d, where the brains were laid open. All wounds, from pain, occasion a fluxion, and from thence arises an inflammation, which sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240027"/> is carried off by a digestion, or matter running; but the brain was inflamed , and I believe a mortification ensued, for on his arm there appeared a tendency to a mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other wounds that would have been mortal?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I do not think the wounds on his arm would have been mortal, if it had not been for the weakness of body.</p>
               <p>Q. So you are of opinion, upon the whole, that some or other of these wounds were the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes, Sir, for in all other respects, except these wounds, he appeared to be in good bodily health.</p>
               <p>Jury . Had the deceased one arm or two ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He had but one arm.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. Have you any questions to ask this witness?</p>
               <p>Pris. I went to him the next morning , and gave him a guinea, and desired he would take all the care of him he could.</p>
               <p>Bailey. My Lord, I did take the guinea, because I thought it would be an ease to the parish.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not the soldier who was his comrade ?</p>
               <p>Parkes. No, I am a picture maker and cleaner; and when I came to the woman's house who keeps the Royal Waggon, I saw some sailors, who said they were going with a brief; there was a man among them with a stump arm, and there was a quarrel between them and a soldier. I saw a sword drawn, and I heard the man with the stump arm say, if I cannot do for you, I will bring three more that will , belonging to me. They were all dressed like sailors, and the soldier had a knot upon his shoulder like a corporal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man with the stump arm do any thing?</p>
               <p>Parkes. I saw something like a stone in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing done?</p>
               <p>Parkes. I did not see any thing but what I have told your Lordship , for I was frightened at them; and the soldier said, if you come upon me I will draw my sword upon you; and when the three sailors came up, he drew his sword.</p>

            . As I was coming from Barnet with Parkes , who was going to my aunt's with some pictures;</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Adams. I cannot say whether it was three weeks or a month ago. I was coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you coming?</p>
               <p>Adams . Half a mile on the other side of Highgate and I saw a man with one arm, and he had something in his hand; and I saw a soldier there , and the man with one arm followed the soldier first , and the other three followed him; there were words between them, but I could not hear them, and I saw the soldier draw his sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man with one arm do any thing?</p>
               <p>Adams. I saw the man with one arm throw at him, but whether he hit him or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Adams. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner, is that the man that drew his sword?</p>
               <p>Adams. Yes, and he made a full stop, and turned round twice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Adams. About five minutes after the man with one arm threw at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after the one armed man threw at him that he drew his sword?</p>
               <p>Adams. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he threw at him?</p>
               <p>Adams. Yes; he threw at him, but the soldier had the heels of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the soldier off him?</p>
               <p>Adams. The soldier might be as far before him as it is to Fleet Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What, when the sailor threw at him?</p>
               <p>Adams. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What arm did he throw with?</p>
               <p>Adams . I cannot punctually say which, but I think it was his right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was his right arm?</p>
               <p>Adams . I cannot be positive which arm it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had thrown with his left arm he might have hit him at the distance he was from him?</p>
               <p>Adams . Yes; he was not so far distant but what I think he might have done it?</p>
               <p>Q. So you cannot say whether he had lost his right arm or his left?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240028"/>Adams. Indeed I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>[ The watch, shoe-buckles , and knee-buckles, were delivered to the Prisoner in Court the day before his trial.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Our regiment lies in Flanders, I was sent there for recruits and young horses. As I was going along Finchley-Common , I met a countrywoman of mine, and as the woman and I were walking upon the green swerd, four sailors came behind me and abused me very much, and they beat all my fingers with their sticks; says she, you could cut them all in inches, and they said they would lick me; I said it is not in your power. The deceased struck me first. I did not know whether they were footpads, or what they were, and there was a great oak stick left there that they beat me with. I have been in the army several years, and have been at three battles and one fiege, and always behaved with courage. [ The Court told him, it was not a sign of courage, but cowardice, to use a naked man who had but one arm with so much barbarity.]</p>
               <p>Jury . Where is the woman you walked along with?</p>
               <p>Pris. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Richard Newsham (the master of the house at Brown's Well) called by the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blows given to the deceased ?</p>
               <p>Newsham. I saw no blows given to the deceased ?</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no blows given to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Newsham . None but what were given him by his comrade: He struck him over the head with an oaken stick, and I think, to the best of my knowledge, he struck him twice on the neck towards the shoulders; and he said, you rascal, you have done murder I am afraid, and therefore, says he, do what you will with him, for I will be no more concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Newsham . On the 11th instant, pretty near five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Pris . Was not there a stick there?</p>
               <p>Newsham . I will speak of that afterwards. Then his comrade took his sword from him and threw it into the yard, and afterwards he gave him a back handed tip, and tripped up his heels, and laid him in the road, and did all he could to keep them apart, that no quarrel should ensue upon it; afterwards the Prisoner got up again, and went a little way, and one of the sailors said, Now, you dog, as you have not your sword with you, I will have a stroke at you, and the sailor struck him, and knocked him down; he was down upon his backside, but I do not know whether his head was upon the ground or not; he went to take his sword up again, and I took it from him, and prevented him from doing any further damage; what, said I, do you want to do more mischief? That is all I know.</p>

               <p>Somerfield Wright. The deceased came the twenty-second day of January to drink a parting pot with me and the Prisoner, for he was going the next morning to his ship, and we had three quarts of beer between five of us; the Prisoner and the deceased fell into a discourse about the fighting men that fought at Broughton's Booth , and the deceased said he believed he could fight ever a one of them for a guinea; and moreover, he said he would fight the Prisoner at the bar for a guinea; the Prisoner at the bar said done, and pulled off his clothes; the deceased rose up, and took out two half crowns , and put them into my hand; the Prisoner had no money, but he pulled a ring off his finger, to bind the wager of a guinea, and they were to fight the next morning; then I stopped between them, and said let us have no more of it; then I went to give the deceased his two half crowns again, but before I could do it, he gave the Prisoner a little sort of a push; with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240029"/> that the Prisoner gave him a slap on the face, and they went to fighting directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many blows exchanged?</p>
               <p>Wright. There were not many blows exchanged, for they did not fight above two minutes; there might be about a dozen blows exchanged between them: The deceased had two falls, and after the second fall the deceased gave out, and said he would fight no more; with that the Prisoner insisted upon his ring again; I told him I had none of it: I looked about the house for the ring, and while I was looking for it the deceased went out of the room; presently a woman came into the room and brought word, that the deceased lay dead in the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased make any complaint before he went out of the room, of any blow that affected him?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any marks of violence upon him?</p>
               <p>Wright. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been out of the room before the woman came?</p>
               <p>Wright. About six or seven minutes . I went out to see for him, and the deceased lay upon his back in the entry at full length; then we brought him into the room and laid him upon the bed, and I went for a surgeon to bleed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bleed him?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, the surgeon pricked him in both arms, but he would not bleed at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him upon the floor, did you think him to be actually dead?</p>
               <p>Wright. I cannot say he was actually dead when we brought him into the room, because there was some movement in him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take off his clothes, to see whether there were any marks of violence, or any wounds on his body?</p>
               <p>Wright . I did not take his clothes off at all, for his coat and waistcoat were off before, and I did not take off his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his face and head, to see if there were any marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Wright. Not that night; the next day I saw he had a blow under his left ear, and there was a little bruise.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your opinion, that the deceased came by his death by that blow?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, I cannot think that at all; I cannot think that was the occasion of his death in any shape. I did not see any other blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he had been out any where, between the time of his going out of the room and your seeing him in the passage ?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, unless he went into the yard; for the knees of his breeches were dirty, and one side of his face was dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine he had any fall any where?</p>
               <p>Wright. He must have had a fall by the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible, that the bruise which you saw under his left ear might proceed from the fall?</p>
               <p>Wright. Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look like street dirt?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I help to lift the deceased in upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, you did, and I went for a doctor to bleed him, and he bled as free as could be, about a spoonful out of each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now, he would not bleed at all.</p>
               <p>Wright. He bled a little drop.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun . Were they not old ship-mates?</p>

               <p>Wright. They were old acquaintance.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the body at that time?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, not till the next day, and then I perceived a little bruise under his ear, one side of his face was all muddy , and his back was dirty and the knees of his breeches; there was no dirt upon him when he went out of the room, and I cannot tell how he came by the dirt; he must either have got it in the street or in the yard, and I suppose by a fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he went out for?</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence or bruises upon him?</p>
               <p>Wright . Yes, there was a bruise under his left ear, a very little one, but not likely at all to be his death's wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any wound or bruise about him that might be the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Wright . No, but he was an aiding man a long time, and the falls might hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have got that bruise by a fall, you suppose he got the dirt by a fall ?</p>
               <p>Wright . I do not know whether he could or not; there was a surgeon came, and he bid us take a looking-glass and put to his mouth, but there was no breath in him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a good harmony between the deceased and the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, there always was, they were as loving as two brothers, they went to school together .</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive any bruises?</p>
               <p>Holder. Yes, I perceived a bruise under his left ear , and when we brought him in he had dirt upon his back, dirt upon both his knees, and dirt upon his left cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you think he could get this dirt?</p>
               <p>Holder . He must get the dirt either in the yard or in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he could get all this dirt without falling?</p>
               <p>Holder . No, he must have a fall to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw no wound or bruise but under his left ear?</p>
               <p>Holder . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any particular hurt after he had done fighting?</p>
               <p>Holder . No.</p>

             (a surgeon called by the Prisoner.) I examined the body when the Coroner's Inquest sat upon it; when they viewed the body they perceived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240031"/> a bruise under the left ear, which they thought was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take that bruise under his ear to be the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>James. I take that under his ear to be a settling of extravasated blood, as there was in his back and sides, but I do not take that to be a bruise, neither could it be the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you scalp him?</p>
               <p>James. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was there any dangerous wound on his skull ?</p>
               <p>James. There was no hurt done to the skull that could occasion his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any wounds on any part of his body ?</p>
               <p>James. There was a mark on his breast, but that was an old wound.</p>
               <p>Q. So you did not find any wound or bruise that could occasion his death?</p>
               <p>James. No, not in the least.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you think he came by his death?</p>
               <p>James. He was out of the room five or six minutes, and it is possible that a person being drunk, or through passion, or in a fit, may drop down dead, for I am sure that his death was not from any blow; I have known persons to have fallen down stairs, and have died in a fit .</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take it to be?</p>
               <p>James . I take it to be a fit of the apoplexy .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take those places where there was extravasated blood to be a sign of an apoplexy?</p>
               <p>James . Yes, Sir, I believe it was from a stoppage in the small vessels, and that was the occasion of his death.</p>

             . On Saturday was sevennight I happened to be out of town, and when I came home my wife was in a great disorder about these two pair of shoes; she said, this Joe the black had been at my shop, and asked her to shew him some shoes and pumps, and desired she would go along with him to his captain or lieutenant; so he led her up to the Gun at the Hermitage, and he said he would fetch his master; instead of that he came to my shop, and said to a little girl, who is here, that her mistress sent him for a pair of shoes and a pair of pumps, and she would not let him have them; but he put his hand over and took them out of the shew-glass, and about half an hour afterwards I found the goods upon him, and he was offering to sell them. These are my Goods. Not only that, but he came back again, and took a hat, pretending that he had left his hat. He owned before the Justice, that there were two more concerned and a woman. He was asked what he had to say, and he pretended he could not speak English, but he spoke very good English before the Justice. The gunner of the Wager man of war said he could speak English very well, and that he was a very great rogue.</p>

            . Last Saturday was sev'night in the morning between eight and nine o'clock I was behind my counter pretty near the window, the street was remarkably thin of people, and I saw Mr. Platt cross the way; the Prisoner at the bar and another person followed him at a little distance, and before he came to his own door, within four or five steps, the Prisoner stepped up to him, and I saw him take the handkerchief out of his pocket; the Prisoner turned about very suddenly, and I believe he put the handkerchief into his breast .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket?</p>
               <p>Tredway . I did, I am positively sure of it; and I said with a little vehemence my man, that fellow in the blue coat has got Mr. Platt's handkerchief. The Prisoner ran into the beef-hall, and I ran to Mr. Platt's door, and said, Sir, you have lost your handkerchief, and he said so I have: we went under the gateway, and about half way under the gateway there his handkerchief lay. My man had given out the cry of pick-pocket, pick-pocket, and a butcher said if you go such a way you will meet him, and my servant got him secured, and delivered him to Mr. Platt and I, and then he fell down on his knees, and said he was a young man, and if Mr. Platt would forgive him he would never do so any more. He was in a blue coat, I cannot say it was that blue coat he has on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They say I acknowledged the thing, and said if he would forgive me I would never do so any more; but I said I never was guilty of picking any body's pocket, but I desired him to forgive me.</p>

             . I am apprentice to Mr. Foxall, who is partner with Mr. Floyer, but they do not live in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Prisoner's coming to you at any time?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . Yes. On the fifth of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the Prisoner came to my master's shop in Oat-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . He gave me a letter, which he said he brought from Mr. de Lamerie , in Gerrard-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any such gentleman that used to trade with your master, and lived in that street?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . Yes, and I had a suspicion of its being a counterfeit, upon account that neither Mr. Foxall's name nor Mr. de Lamerie's name were spelt right.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon that order, is that the order you received from the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Roumieu. Yes . I gave it to Mr. Foxall, and he ordered me to acquaint Mr. Floyer with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that discovered to be a forgery, and not Mr. de Lamerie's hand?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be his hand?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . I do not; I know his hand, and I do not believe any part of it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Floyer?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . I went to him, and he came immediately to our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say when Mr. Floyer came?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . I was not present, but Mr. Floyer is here, who can inform you. I went to Mr. Scott's and some other refiners , who had been defrauded, to know if it was the same person. When I came back, Mr. Floyer had stopped the Prisoner; the Prisoner said he had the letter from Mr. Giles, Mr. de Lamerie's Clerk, and that he had known him several years; and afterwards he said it was given him by Mr. Giles, or somebody very much like him; the Prisoner was carried before my Lord Mayor, and committed.</p>
               <p>The order was read at the request of the council .</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say, that this order was delivered to you by the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . I saw my master open it, and I can take upon me to say that it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner tell you whether he knew the purport of the contents?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . He told me it was to deliver two hundred ounces of sterling for Mr. de Lamerie.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. de Lamerie write his name with an a or an e ?</p>
               <p>Roumieu . He writes it de Lamerie ; it is wrong spelt in the order, and Mr. Foxall's name is wrong spelt; there is an h more than is needful.</p>
               <p>Peter Floyer sworn .</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. de Lamerie use to deal with you?</p>
               <p>Floyer. Yes, many years. Our servant came to me, and said there was a man wanted me; I went to Mr. Foxall's, and seeing nobody in the passage I went to look for him, and I saw a man peeping in at the door; I asked him what he wanted, and he said he came for two hundred ounces of sterling, and had a letter with an order for it; and he said Mr. Giles, Mr. de Lamerie's clerk, gave it to him, at the Faulcon in Holborn; he hesitated a little, and told me the contents of the letter exactly. I was willing to keep him a little, and I told him our silver would be ready in about ten minutes; he said he would step into Wood-Street and come again; I took him by the collar and said, I believe I have somebody that wants to speak with you; then Mr. Foxall came up. The Prisoner said he had known Mr. Giles a great many years, that he had a weakness in his eyes, and was willing to get a little money as he could, and so came on this errand.</p>
               <p>Q. How does Mr. de Lamerie spell his name ?</p>
               <p>Floyer. In the forged Letter it is ry at the end of the name which should be rie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Floyer delivered into Court the letter and order that the Prisoner brought him .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acknowledge the bringing the letter or note?</p>
               <p>Floyer. He acknowledged the bringing the letter, and an order, for the delivery of the two hundred ounces of silver enclosed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take this to be Mr. de Lamerie's hand?</p>
               <p>Floyer. Neither the letter nor the order are like Mr. de Lamerie's hand, and Mr. Foxall's name is not spelt right. Afterwards he began to vary in his story, and said, that as he had a weakness in his eyes, he could not tell whether it was Mr. Giles that gave it him or not, but if it was not Mr. Giles, it was somebody like him. I said I would go with him to the Faulcon in Holborn; and when he came to a house, which he said was the sign of the Faulcon , the house was shut up, and seemed to have been so for a considerable time, for the sign was very blind, and he seemed to have as good eyes as I have, for he saw the sign sooner than I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240035"/>Q. to the Prisoner. What questions would you ask Mr. Floyer with respect to this transaction?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has given an account of every transaction, and he says right.</p>

               <p>Giles. Never, nor never saw him till he came to offer his service to Mr. de Lamerie, but his character was not approved of. I never spoke to him in my life that I know of, but I am sure I have not spoke to him for seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was a little out of business at that time , and there was a gentleman like sort of a man very much like Mr. Giles, with a white coat and brass buttons, gave me this letter at the door of the Crown alehouse.</p>

               <p>Goring. Because he worked with me, and was concerned in laying up the wool. I cried a reward of five guineas to any one that would impeach his accomplices, three times in Uxbridge on a market day, and I heard nothing till the Monday following, and then one

               <p>Everett. I believe there might be six or seven and twenty shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do more?</p>
               <p>Everett. About a fortnight after that we went and got seven more sacks full, and carried them in the same cart to the same house, and sold them for fourteen shillings a tod, and about a fortnight afterwards we had the same quantity again.</p>
               <p>Q. What, seven sacks?</p>
               <p>Everett . I do not know whether there were five or seven sacks, and we sold them for fourteen shillings a tod to the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money was divided between you, the Prisoner, and Miller?</p>
               <p>Everett. Yes. We went once more, and had five sacks, and sold them to the same Person. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Goring. My Lord, I desire the accomplice may be asked, whether he did not hear Collins say, that he took more wool, and carried it to Brentford, and sold it?</p>
               <p>Everett . Yes, I heard him say he had been once at Brentford with wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the wool he took out of the lost?</p>
               <p>Everett. I do not know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Goring. What sort of a lost is this?</p>
               <p>Goring. It is a strong lost, and boarded on the sides, and I keep it generally locked with a padlock. I constantly kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What use do you make of that lost?</p>
               <p>Goring . It is to keep wool in, and no other use.</p>

            . I was before Justice Perry when the Prisoner acknowledged he ordered these sweepings to be put into a cart, and said he thought there was no harm in it: he kept out of the way a month or five weeks before I could apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray who was by when I said this?</p>
               <p>White. It was before the Justice and his clerk , and the waterman was there.</p>

            (to White.) Is this true?</p>
               <p>White. I have been puzzled a good while to get Scott to come to be an evidence, and have been his security for his coming to give evidence, because I would not have this mate escape; so I went for him, and went to his father's, and said I do not know how the Court may take this, it may be taken as if he was an accomplice, and it may be a great damage to him, and desired he might come; and I said if he did not appear against the Prisoner I would transport him.</p>

            . The Captain of the Duke of Cumberland was bad, and not capable of doing his duty, and I went on board to get it dispatched, and I went to one Claghorn that keeps an alehouse for the sugar; and he said I should not have the sugar; I told him I would have it, and I went to the ship for an officer, and sent it on board the ship again: the waterman confessed he carried it on shore by the Prisoner's order. The sugar was carried to the Custom-house, and I petitioned for it, but before I petitioned it was condemned and sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carried this ship out, and I brought her home, if I had a mind to have been a rogue to my King and country, I might have got more than by taking a little dirt. I hope, my Lord , and the Court, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, will take this into consideration; and that as I have belonged to the sea a great many years, I hope they will not believe that I would be a thief for a parcel of dirt and sweepings: he that swears against me wanted to get a friend of his in, in my room.</p>
