On Monday morning the prisoner came to my house again; there was no one at home but myself at the time, and I could do nothing with him; he was very bold, and asked me what I intended to do, if I meant to advertise them; I said no, why should I advertise them when I knew where they were, that he was the man that had taken them; he said I must be mistaken, for he was not the man. My sister then came in and said, I am surprised you should say so, you know you are the man; I said I would swear that he was the man; he said that they were his things and that he valued them at three pounds; I told him I valued them at thirty shillings, that he had taken them from me; I knew they were his things, the woman told me so when she brought them to pledge.</p>

I said so upon my oath.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell the prisoner you would advertise them when the man was present that took them away, and you knew he was the man that took them away? - I did to be sure say it to him, because I had said it to Cardwell.

               <p>Which of them called upon you to drink a pint of beer? - Mr. Church, and Mr. Ashton was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Did Ashton speak to you? - No, not till after I went in.</p>
               <p>Did the little girl with you go in? - No, he called her in, but she said she would not go in.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - We went into the Plough, and another young woman that Mr. Church knows that lives close by our house.</p>
               <p>What is her name? - I do not know now because she has been lately married; her name was Peggy; he sent a letter by her to give to me. When we came in he gave me some punch to drink. He said Nanny, will you take a little walk; I said no, because chapel would soon be open, and I must go to chapel; he said never mind, only come round the brook, that will bring you in your way home again. I said I would.</p>
               <p>Where was Ashton? - He was along with him.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - Yes, I went round the brook with him.</p>
               <p>Who was with you? - Nobody but Mr. Church and Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>What became of the other young woman then, Peggy? - She went home with her husband. She said she could not take a walk with him because she had company at her house. Then he took me to the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat, as you go to town in the field.</p>
               <p>Did they both go with you? - Yes; then he gave me some more liquor to drink till past eight o'clock; I said, Mr. Ashton, what is it o'clock; he said eight o'clock; I said it is more, let me go home, chapel is done, my master will be uneasy; he said you shall not go home, come a little way with me; I said I could not, chapel is done; he made answer, if you are not at chapel you are at Church, and that is all the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not it occur to you that it was eight o'clock, and chapel was over? - I said Mr. Ashton, Mr. Church, let me go; they said I should not, it was too late to go home, and chapel was over.</p>
               <p>Court. But did not you think chapel was over before that time? - I did and said my master would wonder that I was not gone home; he said he did not care.</p>
               <p>But you was with him from three to eight o'clock? - I was.</p>
               <p>What happened next? - When we came from the Shoulder of Mutton and cat; it was past nine o'clock, and from thence he took me to another alehouse, somewhere in Spitalfields; I do not know the name of the alehouse.</p>
               <p>What happened there? - We drank something there; it was past ten o'clock I think going on for eleven. When we came from that alehouse, Church said to Ashton, Nanny and I shall go to my summer-house.</p>
               <p>What did he call you? - Nanny. We went to the summer-house; when we got into the summer-house, Mr. Church whispered to Ashton and went out; I did not hear what he whispered to Ashton. Mr. Ashton said something to Mr. Church, and then Mr. Church went out. Then Mr. Ashton carnally knew me against my will and consent.</p>
               <p>Immediately after Church went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was in a summer-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was it from any other house? - It was in a wild place.</p>
               <p>How far from any other house? - I do not know because I was a little in liquor, but my father and mother went the next day and found the summer-house out.</p>
               <p>Did not you know where it was? - I did not, it was in a place I did not know; I was not used to London. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070007"/> never go out from one year's end to another, without going out to church or chapel.</p>
               <p>Did Church leave the door open or shut. - There was no door to the summer-house.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation together? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing? - We did not speak together.</p>
               <p>Neither of you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - I said, Mr. Ashton leave me alone; he said, no, I will not, Nanny. When Mr. Church came in, Ashton went out to get some beer.</p>
               <p>Which of them wanted the beer, Church or Ashton? - Ashton; he went for it.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any thing? - No, I had none, I could not drink it, because I was in liquor, and I was reaching all the time.</p>
               <p>When Ashton came again, did Church and Ashton drink together? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>How soon did they go home from thence? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did they see you safe home? - No, they took me into a tavern in Goodman's Fields.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Church; did you ask him where he had been? - He went round the place in the time Ashton was with me.</p>
               <p>Did he say he was going round the place? - Yes, he whispered to Ashton.</p>
               <p>You said he whispered something that you did not hear; but did you hear him say he was going round the place? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he ravish you more than once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often? - Twice.</p>
               <p>Both times before Church came back? - No.</p>
               <p>Was one time at a tavern? - No, it was on the Monday he did it again; he took me to a tavern on Sunday night to lie all night.</p>
               <p>And did you lie together all night? - No, he went home to his wife.</p>
               <p>When he took you to a tavern did he say you should lie all night with him? - No; he went to the house, and said, can you let this young woman lie here all night; the man said, yes, I can; he said, very well. Mr. Church went up stairs with me; he undressed me; I had no night-cap to put on; he gave me a handkerchief to put round my head.</p>
               <p>So they put you to bed there? - Only Mr. Church came up, Ashton staid below.</p>
               <p>What was Church an old acquaintance of yours? - I never saw Church before but once.</p>
               <p>How came you to treat one another so kindly, he called you Nanny, and you called him Church? - On Whitsun Monday I went out two days; he and I were going into the Blackmoor's Arms, by Rosemary-Lane; he said to the landlady at Goodman's Fields, dont let this young woman go away till I come and fetch her. Mr. Church came about a quarter after ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>You had lain a bed till that time, had you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you they would come again next morning? - Mr. Church did.</p>
               <p>What time did the other come? - Not before three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did you stay there till that time? - No, Mr. Church came for me in the morning; he said to the waiter in the tavern where I laid all night, can you get any breakfast for this young woman? Yes, said the waiter, I can. He brought some breakfast; it was then half after twelve o'clock as I had done breakfast.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - Mr. Church came; I said I must go home; he said you shall not go to day; I said I would go home. He said you shall not, come along with me a little way; I said I would not; this is the street where my father lives, and down I will go, you shall not keep me. He said, I should not go; come a little farther, and this will bring you straight home. I said, very well, in the name of God, let me go. He said, come a little farther, and I will give you a little beer that shall keep up your spirits, that your master and mistress may not be angry with you. I said that would not satisfy them, for they would go to my father and mother. He said, I should not go home that day. He went a little farther, and went into an alehouse, and gave me some beer; he said, Nanny, it will chear up your spirits. I said it was not used to drink, it would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070008"/>Where did you meet Ashton again? - We went a little farther, near the London Infirmary, there was Ashtop drinking some beer at a publick-house.</p>
               <p>What was the sign of that publick-house? - I do not know; but it was facing the London Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Did Church tell you that he intended to meet Ashton there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect to meet Ashton on the Monday morning? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not expect to meet him at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What the sign of the house was you cannot tell? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>That was about three o'clock? - Yes, it was. Mr. Church said to Ashton, Ashton, we have spent half the day, we may as well spend the whole with Nanny. I said, I will not; I wish to God I knew my way home, I would go. He said, you shall not go home to day nor to-morrow. I said, I will go home, you shall not keep me. Mr. Ashton said, very well, Church, I will tell you where we will go; we will go to Clay Hall. I said, that is not going home with me; I wish I knew my way home. He said, you shall not go home to day nor to-morrow. Ashton said, Nanny, live with me two months, then your master will forget you, and your father and mother, and I will turn my maid away, and take you.</p>
               <p>Did you agree to that? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What else? - Then he took me to Clay-Hall; we went up stairs into a dancing-room; Mr. Ashton said to Church, let us have something to drink; I said, I want nothing to drink, leave me alone, or I will go and drown myself; he said, for my sake, you shall not make an end of your life; he went down stairs to the waiter of the house, or else to the master, I do not know which; he asked the master if he would let me have some tea to drink; I was almost a dying, I was so bad; they had some beer to drink; I had some tea; the woman brought the tea up; the woman asked Mr. Church if she should came and fill the tea-pot; he said, no, you need not come up into the room, I will fill the pot. When I had done tea, Church whispered to Ashton; Ashton went down stairs, and lit his pipe. When he was gone down to light his pipe, he stood upon the stairs to hearken.</p>
               <p>Who did? - Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>What was he to hear there? what was he to stand upon the stairs to hearken to? - To hear what Mr. Church did to me.</p>
               <p>What passed between you? - Mr. Church said to me, Nanny, come here; I said, no, I will not come there; he said, you shall come here; I said no, I will not; he got me up in his arms; I struggled from him, and ran down stairs, and Mr. Ashton was upon the stairs hearkening; he said to Mr. Ashton, keep Nanny up, for she is going down to drown herself. Mr. Ashton said, you shall not make an end of your life, so come up stairs, so they both came up stairs. After that, Mr. Church went down stairs, and walked round Clay-Hall, and Mr. Ashton was up stairs in the mean time, and Mr. Ashton said to me, Nanny, come here, I have got no wife, I should like you; I said, no, I want not to be married, I am not old enough; he said, that is nothing at all, don't tell me these things; I said, let me go home; he said, you shall not; I said I would go down and drown myself; he said, you shall not make an end of your life for my sake, and then in the mean time Mr. Ashton did lie with me also in that dancing-room, and then when Mr. Church came up -</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you have a particle of doubt, I will go on. If the cause strikes you as it does me, there is not a colour for the prosecution from her own account; she goes with him a second day, opportunities are given her to discover it; she sits and talks with him in the room, and permits indecencies, if you have a doubt, I will go on with it.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts are the stairs that go up to that dancing-room? - It went first up stairs, and the dancing-room looked out of window into a pond.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you go into to that dancing-room? - I went out of the garden.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are satisfied.</p>

               <p>One of the prisoners? - Yes; I met the prisoners at a door in Ratcliffe-highway; I had never seen them before; I asked if there was a publick-house open near; I was faint and tired; they said, if I would give them something to drink, they would show me one; I said, agreed, and went with them. They were going to take me up a street; I said, I would not go out of my way; it did not signify; they then took me to a house in Bells-street; I said, this is not a publick-house, I will not stay; they said, if it was not they could get me something to drink. I gave Hope all the halfpence I had to fetch some beer. When I gave her the money, she threw her arms round me, and began hugging me. I felt her hand in my pocket; I pushed her from me, I did not think she had time enough to take any thing. They then both went out, and left me sitting in the room. I sat about five minutes; they not returning, I began to suspect they must have robbed me; I then felt, and missed my studs and money. I thought it not safe to sit there, left they should send somebody in to ill-use me. I went to Justice Sherwood's and was directed there to go to St. George's watch-house. I went, and got two watchmen, and came and found the door fast; they had got in; I heard their tongues and a man in the room. The watchmen took them in bed together, about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was Hodget near when Hope took the money and studds? - I believe about two yards; I believe she was innocent enough of the matter.</p>
               <p>When did you see the four guineas and a half? - In Tower-street; I had five guineas; I changed a half-guinea at the Ship in Tower-street.</p>
               <p>They were apprehended by your information? - Yes; the watchmen took them in bed together. When we came before the justice, the party I alledged the robbery to have been committed by behaved audaciously.</p>
               <p>Was that Hope? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - Yes; when they took her out of bed there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>From Hope. Had not you been in other company before you was in company with us; with two women, and gave them three-pennyworth? - No, I deny it.</p>
               <p>Hope. He wanted to give us a dram; we did not want it, he would give us some.</p>

The prisoner used to bring bread to my mistress; he asked my mistress, on the 9th of February, to let me go and pledge this watch for him. I pledged it for 15 s. and brought him the duplicate of it; he redeemed it himself, I believe, he brought a watch to me again to pledge in March; he said it was the same, I pledged it for 18 s. he was arrested at the time. He gave it me before the bailiff, and desired me to get a guinea upon it; I could get but 18 s.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There was a watchmaker owed me some money; he said business was very bad, and asked me to have a watch of him. I gave the prisoner authority to bespeak a watch of him; I suppose that was the watch he pawned first.</p>

I went and met them; I let one of them pass me, and laid hold of the other. Some of the turnpike-men came up and we secured the two prisoners; the other got off. We took them to the watch-house, and the last witness searched them and found the things upon them.</p>

I can only swear to the black woman. They all of them ran away.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I had seen her two or three times in Chick-lane, but I had never seen any of the others.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I laid an information directly at Justice Girdler's, and the prisoner was taken up last Thursday by Roberts the constable. I gave a description of her at the justice's. I should know her from a million.</p>
               <p>You are sure the prisoner is the woman? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you get your money or any of your things again? - I got nothing again. Somebody came to me and offered to make it up, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - The woman of the house where the robbery was committed. I believe she was concerned in the robbery, but I cannot positively swear to it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was in the lane; I saw him come out of the house in a flurry; I asked him what was the matter; he said he had been robbed; we said if he had been robbed he had better go home.</p>

               <p>To. the Prosecutor. Did you ever say if you could not find the other people that robbed you, that you would make this woman pay for all? - I never said such a word. I swore the truth. I told the alderman I could swear to her, but could swear to none of the others.</p>

The prisoner came on the third of June to our shop, and asked the price of a piece of lace that hung in the window; I told her the price; she thought it too dear; I said I had several others that would come lower. Being engaged with a customer, I put down a box, and called a young man lately come to the shop to attend the prisoner. He turned his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070013"/> back upon the woman; and at the same time I saw her take a piece of lace and put it under her cloak; I went immediately to her and asked her if there was any lace that would suit her; she said no; she went out; I followed her and brought her back. The lace was concealed under her clock under her arm. She had a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. How could you see me take it? - I had my eyes on her all the time the young man was serving her. As she was a stranger I thought it was possible she might attempt something of the kind.</p>

I went out about seven in the evening, and returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at most. There is a great gate; as I came in I saw a man sitting down at the door; I said it was an indecent place to ease himself in; I staid till he came away. When he had buttoned up his breeches the prisoner came over the gate, upon which I looked in at the parlour window and saw the drawers were all open; I clapped my hand on the prisoner, and said he had robbed me; he gave me a knock and ran away; I cried stop thief! and Mr. Distan pursued him and took him by the wooden rails at Fleet-ditch. There was a pair of silk stockings found upon him; I then went in and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

On Friday the 18th of June between nine and ten o'clock in the morning I was called into my shop, the prisoner was in the shop looking over the thread lace edging box. When I came into the shop she asked for some blond edging; I shewed her some, and she had a yard and a half cut off, and she bought a yard and a half of blue twopenny ribbon; she then begged me to cut her out the pattern of a bonnet; that she was going a little farther, and would return for it in a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Did not you miss it while she was there? - No, the pieces were put into the box together, and we did not take notice then.</p>
               <p>What did you miss? - A piece of thread edging thirty-four yards.</p>
               <p>What was it worth? - Two shillings a yard.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of it again? - No.</p>
               <p>How are you sure it was there when she was in the shop? - A person in the shop showed it to her, I do not know it of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Be so good as to recount the progress you made from thence to town, and the different places you were at? - At about ten o'clock we set off from Mr. Long's; we took a boat at Cherry-Garden Stairs; that waterman carried us to Billingsgate; there he set us on shore; that was near eleven o'clock. We walked from thence to the Old Swan; there I took another boat, he conveyed us directly up to Hungerford Stairs.

               <p>(The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. I suppose you was upon the bed with her? - I do not know that I was; I believe I was not; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Was you in any situation that the watch might drop out? - It might be, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to ask the pawnbroker whether I brought that watch to his master's house?</p>
               <p>Edwards. She is the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen her before? - Yes; and am positive to her person; she had, not five minutes before, brought a shirt to pledge. She came from a publick-house opposite us to bring the watch to pledge.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Are you certain that this is the woman you picked up in Brewer-street, and went to Peter-street, in Carnaby-market with? - I am; and do swear she is the person I was with.</p>

After this I went to make the bed, and found the watch. That was after he was gone.</p>

               <p>I did not observe at first what it was because it was covered with a coarse cloth; I followed him to Bloomsbury-market; there he took the cloth off it and I discovered it was lead. He took it up again and carried it along. I said to him, How came you by that lead? he said I had no right to ask him for it was his own lead. I said I could find a better owner for it than he was, and took him into custody. When he was in custody, Mr. Watkins, Mr. Nash's foreman came and claimed the lead as belonging to Mr. Nash. It was a whole piece of lead. I took the dimensions, and found it answered in point of measure; then I desired it might be more certified as to its being the lead coming off that house; I took it up to the house and compared it with the nail-holes where it was fastened, and it exactly corresponded with those holes.</p>

               <p>On Thursday night the 27th of May last, I was robbed by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>At what time of the night? - I cannot tell; in the course of the night.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep alone? - I went to bed alone.</p>
               <p>Did any body sleep in the room with you? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Had you the watch when you went to bed? - Yes, I put it under my bolster when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>At what time did you find it gone in the morning? - It might be between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose the prisoner took it? - When I waked in the morning I saw the prisoner in the room. She went out directly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did she sleep in the house? - I learned afterwards that that was her apartment.</p>
               <p>Had you known her before? - No; I staid in the room till she returned, then I charged her with robbing me; missed my silver shoe and knee buckles, my money out of my pocket, and my watch. She seemed not pleased when she came back, at finding me in the room; I charged her with robbing me. At first she denied it, but afterwards she produced me my shoe and knee buckles, and said she hoped I would be contented; I charged her with my watch and money; she would not own to the taking of them; I went home and put some money into my pocket, and came back again to her apartment. There were some of her neighbours in her room when I came back. She sent them out of the room and shut the door and fastened it. She came to me then with seeming compunction for using me so ill, and told me she had taken my watch and pawned it for a guinea; and that if I would let her have as much money as she had spent of that sum, she would go directly and fetch me the watch. I gave her a crown towards the redemption of it; I did not mean to proceed any farther, if I got my watch. She went out, and would not let me go with her. Instead of redeeming the watch, I found her a little after spending that crown at a publick-house. I made a demand again of my watch; she made game of me, and asked me for more money. I went to one Master's, a pawn-broker, between the Bull and Gate and Little Turnstile, Holborn. I described my watch, and it was produced. His shopman,

               <p>That gentleman met this girl and I as we were going up Holborn; he asked if we could direct him to a lodging, he had no money but twopence halfpenny; he sent out his silver buckles to get something to eat and drink.

After that he came in and wanted his watch; he flung the duplicate at me, because he said he had no money to fetch it; he came again, and I gave him his duplicate.</p>

I went with her to her lodgings; she told me there that the other prisoner was her servant; I agreed to lie with her; she was going to supper; she asked me if I would have any supper; I informed her I had supped; then said she you will give me leave to sup, if it is agreeable to you you may go to bed and I will come to you presently, upon which I stripped off my clothes and got into bed; I put my coat and waistcoat on the back of a chair in the bed-room, which was adjoining to the room where she was at supper with the other prisoner. I waited some time, but she did not come. The same candle gave light to both rooms. I asked her if she would come; she said she would presently; in the interim she came twice into the room; it could not be half a yard, I suppose, between one room and the other. I saw her come into the room a second time. I saw

               <p>Was your pocket-book in your coat pocket? - I had the same clothes on that I have now; it was in the inside pocket of my coat; the memorandum book was in the same pocket; they were both gone together, with a toothpick-case I had in my waistcoat pocket, the toothpick-case was found the next day in a place they put their coals in, in their lodging. I charged her with taking my things; she then gave me a multiplicity of words, of blasting and swearing, and said I should not stay there; I said if she did not discover the pocket-book to me I would call the watch. Finding she would not discover where the pocket-book was, I lifted up the sash and called out for the watch; four or five patroles I believe came; they felt about her with her clothes on, but nothing could be found, neither pocketbook, memorandum book, nor toothpick-case. I then directed the patrole to go for a constable, which they did. The constable came and I gave charge of the two prisoners; they were carried to St. Martin's-lane-watch-house; the next day, Wednesday, the 30th of June, they were committed by the justice.</p>
               <p>Was the pocket-book found again? - I have never seen any thing like it nor any of the contents; unfortunately the note for 18 l. belonged to a client of mine, which he gave me to sue for; I sued out a writ upon that.</p>
               <p>You are certain you had your pocketbook and toothpick-case in your pocket when you went into her lodging? - I am very sure I had, because it was so near my breast I know it.</p>

The next day the constable was sent for by Mr. Lester in the morning; he said, the gentleman is not satisfied with what has been searched last night, I should be obliged to you if you will come up stairs; let you and I search.

               <p>How long was you down staias before you thought of the watch? - About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in the house at the time? - I cannot tell; he has owned that he took the watch off the stairs; I did not see him till eight o'clock at night; this was between twelve and one; he was there in the morning; I cannot tell what time; I believe he went out about eight or nine o'clock. (The watch was produced.) That is my husband's watch; his name was on the dial-plate; it is scratched out.</p>
               <p>Do you know it by any thing else? - Yes, by the number; I am very sensible it is the watch.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say he took the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - Before the Justice; when I taxed him about it, I said I would give him half a guinea if he could tell where it was, and if he had pawned it, I would redeem it; he said he knew nothing of it; he told my chairwoman so; I did not hear it myself.</p>

               <p>How long has the prisoner lodged at your house? - He came the first day of March.</p>
               <p>You did not see him in the house the day this watch was lost from eight o'clock in the morning till eight at night; and this was between twelve and one o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know that watch from any other watch? - By his name upon the dial-plate.</p>
               <p>But there is no name upon the dial-plate? - He has scratched it out.</p>
               <p>Is there any other mark you know it by? - I cannot say I know it by any thing but the number; I am sure it is the watch.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by else? - I think I have given a plain account of it; there was a silver seal to it; he has sold that from it.</p>

He then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and pulled out a watch; he said he would sell it to make up the money; he said it was his own; he had had it seven years. I cannot swear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070025"/> the watch. As he was determined to sell it, I told him I would endeavour to help him to a customer. We went to a stable-house, and asked some of the post-boys to buy it; they would not. We took it to a pawnbrokers; he asked twenty-five shillings upon it; the man hesitated a little, and then said he must go to the Rotation-Office; and a constable came in and took him; I went with him to the Rotation-Office.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Oxford-street. On the 25th of May, the prisoner brought this watch, and asked twenty-five shillings upon it. I looked in the book, and saw it was advertised the day before. I asked him how he came by it; he said it was his own; that he bought it at Manchester, and gave five guineas and five shillings for it eight years before; I said it was very surprising that he should have had it eight years, and yet it was exactly described in the paper the day before; he said he did not know as to that. Upon that I said he must go to the Rotation-Office; it answered the advertisement in the christian name, sirname, place where it was made, and silver watch cock and steel chain.</p>

I went out to work in the morning; I came home to fetch something about two in the afternoon; I went in, and left the key on the outside; when I came out the key was gone. I tied the door with a string. When I returned at night I found the door open, and the things gone.</p>

He went up stairs to the lady, who was in a room opposite my bed-room, where the watch was hanging at the bed's head. I saw it there between five and six o'clock that evening. When I went to bed at ten o'clock the watch was missing; immediately it occurred to me, that there had been nobody up stairs but the prisoner, and I had a suspicion of him. I got up at four o'clock the next morning, and went to his lodging and examined him, but did not search him; he was to come at eight o'clock to dress the lady; he did not come; that gave me a greater suspicion that he was the person. I went again about eleven o'clock, and found him in the room, and searched him, and found the watch upon him; he had broke the chain all in pieces; it was wrapped up in a handkerchief or dirty towel.</p>

               <p>Was you the last up over night? - No, Mrs. Benton went to bed last.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the fastening of the doors that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you lie at home? - Yes; as the watchman went past two o'clock; I heard two men under the window where I lie, which is over the shop. I heard one say to the other the hatch is open, it is well if the people are not robbed, we will call the watchman. They called the watchman to take care of the house. I jumped out of bed and said my lads what is the matter; they said your hatch is open, it is well if you are not robbed; I went down and found the door was broke open, and the glass case opposite the door wrenched open and a great number of things taken away; among the rest these mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) which are only what has been since found.</p>
               <p>When did you discover any of the things? - Not for some time after. I was obliged to go that morning to Gravesend. Some bills were sent to Justice Sherwood's.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was taken? - No; I saw him when he was in custody? he had a pair of my buckles in his shoes; I saw him take them out and give them to Justice Sherwood's man; he was in the dark cellar at that time. I then went with them to the prisoner's house, and there I saw Mr. Sherwood's man take a pair of silver buckles off his wife's feet; they found a pair of child's set shoe buckles, and a pair of set knee buckles at his house; they also found a parcel of skeleton keys in the house. Just as we were come out one of them said he would have another look, and went back and in the coal-hole found the things that my house had been broke open with; there was a stock and center hit.</p>
               <p>How did they get into your house? - A hole was bored just above the bolt of the door, and the bolt pushed back.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that hole was not there the day before? - I am sure it was not there that night.</p>

On the 4th of May at night, I met the prisoner and another man in Shadwell, seeing them there at that time of night I asked them what business they were about, that it was time for them to be at home, and if they did not go home I would take them to the watch-house, upon which the prisoner said I seemed to be civil, would I go and drink with them; I went into an alehouse with them to drink, and stayed about ten minutes; the prisoner went out and left the other man drinking with me; the prisoner was taken that night; he had a light coat on, and to the best of knowledge, a light corded silk waistcoat.</p>

             was then with me. I am sure the prisoner is the man who robbed me; his coat was buttoned, and his hair down his neck. The prisoner and two more jumped out upon us; they stayed with us near a quarter of an hour. The prisoner pulled me away from the gentleman I was with, and threw me down in the grass. One of the men when he came up first said, stop, d - n you, and asked us what we had got. When he threw me down in the grass he looked to see if I had any buckles; I screamed out; the prisoner said if I did it again he would kill me. He presented a pistol when he first came up, and demanded my money. I had four shillings and two pence; he took that, d - d me, and said is that all? I said it was; he called me b - ch, bid me not look at him, and went away. I never saw his face till he told me not to look; I just saw it then, that was all. The next day I saw him at a publick-house at Shadwell. Mr. Mullings came for me, I knew him directly.</p>

             on Friday night from Vauxhall; walking in a field near Vauxhall, we were met by three men; one said stop, let me have what you have got. The other two men took me by the arm whilst the prisoner robbed Mrs. Rowell; afterwards the prisoner came up to me searched my pockets and took out some keys I had in my pocket; whilst he was taking the keys out I observed his face; I am certain the prisoner is the man. The next day I made an information at Justice Sherwood's, in consequence of that I was sent for to the prisoner's mother's house; there I saw him and knew him; I immediately charged him with it; he neither confessed it nor denied it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and another young man came last Friday and hired a couple of horses of me about two o'clock; they brought them home some time after ten, and paid me for their hire; and they went from our house much in liquor as I thought; the watchman had gone ten o'clock; but I cannot tell how long. When they indicted them at Hicks's-Hall, I saw this gentlewoman and the gentleman (Rowell and Mullings) at Hicks's-Hall. I asked Mrs. Rowell, whether she could swear to this man; she said Yesterday, I thought I could swear to him, but to day it touches so near death, I think I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of a night was it when he came home at ten o'clock? - It was after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - I could not have discerned them if they had been strangers to me; the prisoner was a stranger to me at that time; the other was a neighbour's child, I knew him very well, and had no doubt they would bring the horses home safe, or I would not have trusted them with the horses.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - Adjoining the New Road, St. George's within about three hundred yards of the place this gentlewoman swears to being robbed at. I asked Mrs. Rowell whether she could swear to that young man; she thought she could not swear to him; I asked her, whether she could swear to the other young man; no, said she, if I was to see him, I do not know whether I could swear to him or no; I replied, aye, you could swear to me now you see me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070031"/>Court. How came you to say that to her, now, you may swear to me now you have seen me? - She said there were three men, and one was six feet high; and I don't know any body thereabouts that is near that size but myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You was saying that Mullings said something? - I asked Mullings the day before yesterday at Hick's-Hall, if he could describe any thing of the other young men; he said, he could not, only that there were three of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was with you at Hicks's-Hall when this passed? - Both of them.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - No, not in company at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mullings say any thing about this man? - No, he said he had given a description of him to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask him any questions about this man? - He would not satisfy me about the other questions I asked him; therefore, I did not ask him any questions; he said he could not describe them, nor he would not.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you heard him say before whether he knew the prisoner or not? - I asked him; he said he thought he could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now you did not ask him about this prisoner? - That is the first question I asked him about, that he said he could swear to him; then I asked him about the others that I knew.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you say you asked him first about this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What answer did he make you? - He said he thought he could swear to this man.</p>
               <p>Court. He was not positive? - He did not say he was positive to this man; he thought so.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any thing more about this man? - No, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Court to Mullings. What passed between you and

               <p>Court. Was that the first thing he asked you? - That was the first thing he asked.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him positively yes; or that you thought you could? - I told him yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Positively so, not that you thought you could? - No, I told him positively that I could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any thing more to you about the prisoner? - No; he told me the other men were neighbours of his, and asked me if I could give any description of them. I told him I had given a description of them to Justice Sherwood's clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give any description to him? - No; I gave none to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you refuse to give any to him? - He did not ask me after I said that.</p>
               <p>Did you in terms refuse to give him any? - Not in direct terms.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say you would not describe them to him? - No, I said I had given a description of them to Justice Sherwood's clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you tell him you could not describe the other men? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Or that you would not? - No:</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this? - At the Two Lions, by Hicks's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any body else with you? - Mrs. Rowell was in company, but we spoke very low.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it, and what time of night was it that you was robbed? - On Friday the 2d; the clock had gone ten.</p>

               <p>Did you tell him that you thought you could swear to him the day before, but could not now? - I said no such thing; I said that when his coat was buttoned and his hair was down it occurred to me directly that he was the person.</p>

On last Friday night, while I was drinking a pint of beer at the Gun in the Back-Lane, about two hundred yards from the New-Road, Butts the prisoner and another came into the bar; it wanted about five minutes of eleven o'clock; they came in in a great hurry, and drank a glass a piece, and went out again directly. I heard some body at the door, but one person did not come in; I said to the landlady they are in a great hurry about something; but I knew nothing at all then. I went down to the office at Shadwell in the morning, and heard there had been a robbery committed in the New-Road; I said I saw Butts and another together last night; therefore, I took him up upon it; we went to his mother's; he was sitting in a chair; I asked him who it was that was with him last night; he said, one Rusty.</p>
               <p>Court. How was he dressed that night? - He had a great coat on then; he was not dressed as he is now.</p>
               <p>Court. How was his hair? - I did not take much notice of his hair; I had not time; though I knew him, I did not take so much notice as to observe particularly his hair; Mr. Fletcher and I took him; I said where is this Mr. Rusty who was along with you last night; he said he was at Mr. Jortin's brewhouse; we sent the servant maid for him; we bid her make use of Butts's name; the maid came back, and said he was gone home; we went to his home in Mill-Yard before we got down to the house Butts's mother was standing at the door, and the door was last locked.</p>

This young man ordered the maid to draw him a pint of beer; and he took the pint of beer over in his hand to one Rusty; and there he supped and layed all night. I will be upon my oath he had that coat on that he has now, and had the same hat; his hair was curled up as it is now, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned.</p>

They came back again in about a quarter of an hour; it might not be so much; I cannot speak positively to the time; but I am certain it was no more than a quarter of an hour; they did not stay long; I said to the other young fellow, make haste home, your mother will be uneasy on account of your being absent.

About seven o'clock Mr. Murray came into the yard, walked by me, and asked my man for Mr. Spencer; he told him I was there; he came to me, and said he wanted to buy some saddle-horses; I said your name is Murray; he said it was; he desired to look at some horses in the stable; he looked at one that was lame, then he looked at another which I recommended to him very strongly; he said he should want another saddle and two phaeton horses; he asked if he would go quietly with the saddle on, and desired I would put one on; I bid my man put the saddle on; he did and the prisoner rode the horse out of the gate; I was surprised he rode out of the gate without asking my leave. I desired my man to get on a horse and ride after him; he did, but missed of him. The prisoner returned, and said he went very gently, did I know whether he would go quietly among carriages; I said I did not know; he then desired me to let him ride it in the street; I said he might; I desired my man to get a horse and ride after him, but not to keep too close to him. My servant returned and said he had missed the gentleman with the horse. The prisoner not returning, I went to Lord Molesworth's to enquire his character, and heard a very bad character of him. I went the same evening to Sir

               <p>Did you receive any directions about this horse? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay? - Till Thursday; then he desired me to take it to Plaistow in the name of Morris. I took him to the Green-Gate; they said they did not know Morris; I said they might book it in my father's name.</p>
               <p>Did you give any orders to cut his ears? - Yes, to cut his ears off; that was on Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>He desired you to take it to grass at Plaistow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who gave orders for the ears to be cut off? - Morris; they were cut off by one Bradshaw in our yard.</p>
               <p>ALMOND JOHNSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a Marshalsea-Court officer. I arrested M'Kenzie on the 14th of June, in the name of Brett; and Doyle, in the name of Villers; I then took them to a lock-up house in Wych-street; they desired me to let my man go for one Morris.</p>
               <p>Which of them desired you to let your man go for Morris? - M'Kenzie; I said he might go; but he could not be bad for him, as he lived in the city; I left them; when I returned, I found Morris and the prisoner together; Morris asked what the debts were; I told him, one was 8 l. 11 s. the other 7 l. 8 s. he said they were about agreeing for a horse, would I take his word for Brett's coming back again? I told him, no; I would not take any man's word; if he would leave the money, I would deliver it when he came back; he did not know he said whether he had so much; he pulled out seven guineas, and asked me to trust him the rest; I said I would; he then said let Captain Brett go with me, because he has a horse I am about agreeing for.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Half after six or seven o'clock; they went out, and Morris returned in about an hour; I asked if they had agreed; he said he believed they had; and in about a quarter of an hour M'Kenzie came back on horseback; Morris went out and spoke to him, and then said he would come back and pay me the rest of the money; I went out about some business; I returned about nine o'clock; and then the person I had left them in the custody of was giving them a receipt for the money for me; he gave me the money, and they were discharged; M'Kenzie said, that he had a horse of his own, that he bought of a person in the King's-Bench; and that if he had been on the horse, I should not have arrested him, for the horse, would have plunged at me.</p>
               <p>M'Kenzie. Do you know that I sold the horse? - I do not know; Morris said he had agreed for the horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070040"/>You did not know from Brett whether he had sold the horse? - No.</p>

               <p>I have not much to say, further than that I did not sell the horse; I went to Mr. Spencer and asked to look at some horses; I had a horse of Mr. Spencer; it was by his approbation I rode it; I took the horse to Mr. Morris, and left it for 17 l. to redeem this man from the spunging house. I never sold the horse; when it was advertised, I sent to the man to send the horse; I thought to redeem it; he said he could not send the horse, for that he had disfigured it; he had cut his ears off.</p>

I took the ear-rings to the coach, a pair of which he bought. He then gave me a guinea to change, which I was obliged to send out to change; he then asked to look at some gold watchchains, which I likewise took to the coach. He offered me eight guineas for an old fashioned watch-chain, which I asked nine for; I said I would go and look in the stock-book for the lowest price; I said he should have it for what it cost. On my going to get the stock-book down, he got out of the coach, and came into the shop; he agreed for a watch-chain, and told me he would call at night; that he had not money enough about him to pay for it. My mother seeing he had the appearance of a gentleman, desired I would go for the change. I went out, but could not get any, nor could my lad. When I returned, I saw the two show-glasses open, and my mother speaking to him.</p>
               <p>Were they open when you went out? - They were not, when I went in for the watchchains; nor did I see them open when I went out for the change; he afterwards found silver enough to pay for the ear-rings without changing; they came to five shillings; just as he was going away, a beggar woman came to the door to beg of him; he put his hand into his pocket and gave her something; he then got into the coach; he was hardly in the coach, when the beggar woman said to my mother that gentleman has taken something; I believe she said a pair of buttons, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>You heard her tell your mother that? - I did; upon that my mother called to me to run and stop the coach, for he had certainly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070043"/> taken something. I said it was a dangerous thing to stop him, as he had the appearance of a gentlemen, I would look first and see if I missed any thing; I looked among the buttons, but did not miss any thing; in a few minutes after, I missed the diamond stud.

I afterwards heard M'Kenzie was taken up; I went to Sir John's to see him; and when I saw him, I immediately knew him to be the person that was in our shop. The jewels are taken out every night, and put up in the morning; nobody had seen them before he came; I never found the stud again.</p>

               <p>I am a jeweller; I work in Mr. Bellis's house. On Monday morning, the 26th of April, I saw the diamond stud in Mr. Bellis's show-glass.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one there? - There were two paste studs in the same showglass, but never another brilliant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellis. There was never another brilliant stud there.</p>
               <p>To Verdier. What time of day was it you saw it in the show-glass? - As near as I can recollect, between nine and ten o'clock; I was waiting to receive some orders, which occasioned me to look over the show-glass.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bellis. Have you any doubt of the person? - No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, he came into our shop on the 26th of April. I saw nothing of him while he was in the coach. When he came into the shop he asked to look at some gold enamelled fancy buttons; I took the two show-glasses out to him.</p>
               <p>Did he look at any buttons? - He put his hand in both drawers,</p>
               <p>Was there any thing besides buttons in the drawers? - Yes; ear-rings and fancy things.</p>
               <p>Was the diamonds there? - Yes, this brilliant stud was in one of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you had observed the diamond stud there that morning? - No, I did not, I am but seldom in the shop.</p>
               <p>Are there more show glasses in the shop? besides these two? - Yes, a great many.</p>
               <p>But the diamond stud if it was there was in one of these two? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not buy the buttons? - No, my son returned, he could not get change and the prisoner paid for the ear-rings with silver, and immediately went away.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a woman begging of him while he was in the shop? - Yes; when he was gone out the woman said that man has taken something out of the glass like buttons.</p>
               <p>You cannot find that woman out? - No. I called to my son to stop the coach; he said he had the appearance of a gentleman, and it was a dangerous thing to stop him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before your son missed the stud? - A few minutes.</p>
               <p>What was the value of that stud? - 60 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellis. It cost me 63 l.</p>

I insisted he had another watch; he said he had not; the gold watches are tied with blue strings, the silver watches with catgut. I undid all the parcels of watches to see if it was not in some of them, but could not find it. I thought then it might by mistake have got among the silver watches. I undid them, and saw a watch with a blue string, upon which I concluded that was the watch. We can only see the strings, the watches are all in leather bags; but afterwards when we came to take the watches out of the cases I found it was a silver watch. I then went to Sir

               <p>I live in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>You had a horse stolen from you by M'Kenzie, on the 14th of June? - I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070045"/>You found it in Plaistow Marshes on the Friday following? - Yes. I brought him to town to my own stables. I gave the man a note that I would be answerable to him for it. It was booked in the name of Barrington. I enquired the character of Barrington; I heard an exceeding good character of him.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Barrington's? - Yes; and Mr. Barrington told me that Morris bought the horse; and he took me to Morris's; Morris was not at home; we came back and found him in Mr. Barrington's yard; I asked the prisoner Morris if he knew any thing of the person he bought the horse of; he said he did not know him, he wished he did, for he had given 35 l. for him, and if I would go home with him he would shew me the receipt he had from him; he wanted me to go with him; I refused it; I said I had no business with that; I told him he need not be at any trouble to go to the marshes for the horse, for I had found the horse and brought it home with me; he said he thought it very hard, and wanted to know who was to lose it; I said he must unless his friend would return the money; then I left him.</p>
               <p>What time was the horse taken out of your yard? - I believe about seven o'clock on Monday the 14th of June.</p>
               <p>Morris said he did not know the person he bought it of, did he mention his name? No. I then shewed him the letter I received on Thursday. I shewed it to Mr. Barrington; he said it was the same hand that signed the receipt.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you certain you shewed it to Morris? - I am not certain that I shewed it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him you did not tell him you had got the horse? - I asked him first about the man; we were not together above two minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>He told you, the first time he was charged, that he had bought the horse, and the price he had given for the horse and offered to take you home to see the receipt? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was Barrington present? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>


               <p>What was the first thing you said to Morris when you saw him? - I asked him whether he knew the person he bought the horse of, he said he never knew any thing about it being my horse till he saw it in the advertisement that morning.</p>
               <p>Was the horse in the same situation when you found him as he was when you lost him as to his ears? - No, his ears were cut off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you remember I told you the horse was in Plaistow Marshes before you told me you had got the horse?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I believe not; I am very clear in it you did not. He certainly did not tell me so till I had told him I had got the horse.</p>
               <p>What reason had you to say he need not give himself any trouble to go to the marshes after the horse, if he had not said any thing about it? - He had not said any thing about its being there.</p>
               <p>Court. Something must have passed about the marshes before he said that? - Mr. Barrington had been talking to me about it as we came into the yard.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this before he was apprehended? - I suppose above a week. Sir

               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him but once or twice before.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I never heard his name till that night; he said his name was Murray.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070046"/>What day was it? - The 14th of June.</p>
               <p>How long after was it before you saw Morris? - In the course of about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them together before? - I had seen them together but once before.</p>
               <p>What business did they come about? - Buying this horse.</p>
               <p>Who sold it? - Murray; they desired me to write a receipt; I bid my son write it for 35 l. Murray signed it and Morris put his hand into his pocket and pulled out something and said there is a pound, or, a guinea, I do not know which; that is all I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How long did the horse remain at your house? - From Monday to Thursday as I was informed.</p>
               <p>Were any directions given by Morris? - None, only to take care of him in his name.</p>
               <p>Did you see the horse when Spencer got him home? - Yes, it was the same horse.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it when you first saw it? - A bay horse, with his ears on, he was a fine horse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Yours are publick stables? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were no orders to conceal it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you understand horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he set his ears well? - I thought it a clever gelding; it was about nine at night, it was almost dark; I went out of town the next morning early; I did not return till Thursday.</p>
               <p>Jury. If it had been your horse would you have had it cropped? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had it not a large head?</p>
               <p>Spencer. It had a larger head than some have.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They crop them when their heads are large, do they not?</p>
               <p>Spencer. They do,</p>
               <p>Jury. If it had been your horse would you have had it cropped? - No; but that depends entirely on fancy.</p>

               <p>What was it? - To go to Mr. Morris and tell him that Brett wanted him; we asked him whether he knew him by that name; he said, describe me, that I am a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070047"/> tall likely man, and he will know me; he went once or twice, but did not find him; he found him at last; Morris came to them to the lock-up house. Morris asked me what sum was due, and asked what Brett's sum was; I told him I believe it was 8 l. 7 s. he asked me if I would take his word for that; I said, no, I don't know you; he put his hand into his pocket, and gave me seven guineas; I consented then, as that was so near the sum, to let him go; and Morris said, if I bring him back, you will return the money; I said I certainly should do so; Morris said that he was going to look at a horse; and if they agreed, he should find money to discharge both.</p>
               <p>Did they go out of the house at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time did they go out of the house? - At about half after six or near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see Morris? - About an hour; I asked him where Brett was; he said he would be there in two or three minutes; in a quarter of an hour or ten minutes after, he said, I believe, we have dealt; but if he should not return, I shall be robbed; but I will pay you the deficiency.</p>
               <p>How soon did he come back? - In ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; he came back on a bay gelding; M'Kenzie was on horseback; Morris went out and spoke to him; Morris said, now I will fetch you your money for the debts and costs. I looked upon it that was the horse Morris had purchased; M'Kenzie said before that (as I told the court yesterday) that he had a horse of his own.</p>
               <p>Did these people seem to be acquainted? - They seemed to know each other; but I cannot take upon me to say as to that particularly; I thought they seemed to know each other.</p>

               <p>Then so far from this being a secret, they talked of it before you, before Mr. Clipson, and other persons that were in the lock-up house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And so far from being concealed, the horse was brought to be paraded before the lock-up house; you said, before you saw Morris, this man said he had a horse of his own to dispose of? - Before he came, he said he had a horse to dispose of; that he gave thirteen guineas for him, and he would not take thirty for him.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to buy it yourself? - No.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>What were the debt and costs he paid? - The whole debt and costs I received, paid by Morris, amounted to 19 l. 5 s. 8 d. I received them in the presence of Morris; as I locked them up at Clipson's house, I went in just as Clipson and he were present; he saw the money paid.</p>

               <p>Had he been sent for up to grass, or was he in the house, because you spoke of sending for some up? - This horse was bought on Holy Thursday; I bought thirteen horses of the same man.</p>
               <p>Holy Thursday was the 13th of May? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was bought at that fair? - Yes, by a country dealer; I bought him from that man.</p>

               <p>Was he well footed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Would you at that time of the year have turned that horse out to grass? - No.</p>
               <p>He was in a right state then to be continued in the house to go to market for sale? - I never had a horse more fit for sale than he was.</p>
               <p>Then as a horse-dealer you would not have turned that horse out to grass? - Certainly I should not.</p>

               <p>What would you sell him for now? - I should have thought him worth 45 guineas when company was in town to buy horses; but trade is not now so brisk as it was then. We do not reckon it right to turn horses out in fly time with fore places about them.</p>
               <p>Court. Would you turn a horse out to grass immediately with his ears cropped in fly time? - I should think it not reasonable; but in all my business I never had but one horse cropped.</p>

             a receipt; I keep a lock-up house; Mr. Johnson brought Mr. Brett and Mr. Villiers to my house as prisoners. He came out and said, I might let Mr. Brett go; I did. They came back sometime after; Mr. Brett came with a likely bay horse; he seemed to stand well upon his legs; Morris went out in the street, and looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070049"/> at the horse; I observed the horse; I think I should know him again if I was to see him. Mr. Brett and Morris went away together; they were gone two hours, I believe, before they came and discharged the other person, (who was Villiers) then he came and paid me 9 l. 9 s. 4 d. for Villiers; he paid for a bottle of wine, I believe, and four shillings besides; Mr. Johnson came in before they went out of the house; I paid the money in the presence of Mr. Johnson and Villiers, and here is Mr. Johnson's receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Are you a horse dealer, or a judge of them; now from the observation you made of that horse, was it a horse that it was highly improper to crop his ears to make him handsome? - I thought him rather a Roman nosed horse; I observed that particularly of the horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Was M'Kenzie called Brett is the presence of the prisoner? - I believe he was, to the best of my recollection; when the horse stood at the door, I said it was a likely horse; Villiers said it is the best hunter in the kingdom; I said it is a likely horse; he stands well upon his legs; it is very clean. Villiers said Brett had refused forty guineas for him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Villiers say in the presence of Morris, Mr. Brett has refused forty guineas for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Morris in hearing at that time? - No; he was examining the horse in the street; he said he had had him two years, and had refused forty guineas for him when he was hunting with him last season, and he was the best hunter in the season.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Barrington knows my character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrington. During the time I have known him he has had horses of me, and dealt with me; he is an honest man.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long has he lived in your neighbourhood? - He lives near the Fleet-Prison.</p>

When we came there, we knocked at the door; no body came; we knocked harder; we found we could not get in without breaking it open; I think my brother got in first; we found a quantity of half-pence, part in papers, and part loose. In the cellar we found a cutting engine, and a large stamping engine; there was a candle burning, and the dies which were in the engine were warm. There was a large quantity (I suppose half a bushel) of halfpence; beside the engine, several of the halfpence were warm. On the Britannia side of the halfpenny, there is a little slaw upon the die, which flaw is almost upon all the halfpence struck with it. The moment we were getting into the house, there was an alarm, that a man was on the top of the house; there was a trap door at the top of the house. When he was taken to the Counter, I found these pieces of lead ( producing them) with the impression of a halfpenny upon them; the use of them is to try whether the dies are set perpendicular and true.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else in the house? - Yes; materials to take the colour of the half-pence, brimstone and those kind of things.</p>

I went to Smithfield to get a coach; when I returned the man was gone. The woman was lying on her back still in a fit. I stayed some time till she came to herself; she lost her cloak and shoes; I asked her if she had any money; she said she had fifteen shillings; she felt in her pocket, and her money was gone; I did not know what to do with her; the constable came, and we took her to the watch-house; there she lay till two in the morning; one of the watchmen learned where her husband lived, and sent to him, and he came at two o'clock and took her home.</p>

               <p>On the first of June, going down Snow-hill, I met that woman; she appeared to be very much in liquor; she took hold of my arm, and desired me to see her home. We had not gone far before she went up a passage, and said she would go no farther. I called to the watchman to go and get a coach. I then went down to the Fleet-market to buy something for supper, and when I returned the woman and watchman were both gone; and I picked up a cloak and a pair of shoes and buckles. As I was going home, the watchman laid hold of me. I intended to have had the things advertised the next day.</p>

               <p>At that time you thought it a fair bargain? - I said if you do not meet with a person that buys it for his own wear, you will not make your money of it.</p>

             offered this watch to me for sale. By an advertisement I knew it was a stolen watch. I stopped the watch and him. I am certain it is the same watch.</p>

               <p>At about two o'clock in the afternoon, as I was coming past Chancery-lane, I met an acquaintance, a Mr. White. I said to him, how do you do; he said, Lazarus, I am glad to see you, if you will go home with me I have a suit of clothes to sell you. I went along with him; a man came to me and said you buy old clothes; I said yes; he said he had a watch in his pocket, he wanted money, and would sell it; I asked Mr. White, might I buy this watch; he said yes, I think you may venture to buy it of him if you can get a shilling by it. I gave him 23 s. for it, and a laced hat that stood me in 9 s.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>


               <p>- WHITE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he buy some clothes of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day? - Not exactly; it was sometime about November, I believe; I overtook the prisoner with this bag, he had some hats and clothes; I told him I had got a suit of second mourning clothes to dispose of; he might see them, if we could agree for them. I knew him when I was in the publick way. I kept a publick-house between Chancery-lane and Shoe-lane, on the right-hand side, near the bar. A man met him and said I think you are in the dealing way; I have got a watch to dispose of, let me look at it; he pulled it out; they had some little talk together; he bought the watch of him, and the man took a hat in change.</p>
               <p>What was the money? - 23 s.</p>
               <p>You are not a Jew? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. What age might the man be that he bought the watch of? - He appeared to be about thirty-five.</p>

               <p>Says she, my dear, I hope you'll be so kind, You shall ever enjoy me when you are inclin'd; Tho' I'd have you take care; for if we are found out, It will certainly cause a most terrible rout.</p>
               <p>My dear, such a scheme I have got in my head; Which, if follow'd, will lead you secure to my bed; [smile, And whenever I give you the nod, wink, or Then I mean to retreat to my chamber a while.</p>
               <p>You must know that I lie near the top of the house, Where there's none to molest us, no, not so much as a mouse; In at the garret window you easily may get. Then into my room you I quickly will let.</p>
               <p>Where we safely may lie, and fulfil our designs, And none to suspect us or rifle our minds; No girl half so happy or joyous as she, [be. And wish'd that such frolicks ne'er ended might</p>
               <p>But her father has lately found out their fun, By which I'm persuaded, his daughter's undone. Her mother cries, Hussey, how could you do so? And Betsy says, Mammy, you very well know,</p>
               <p>When you was in your youth you the like game did play, Then be not so angry, dear mother, I pray; It is said that one P - in the Borough did dwell, A man that you loved most wonderous well.</p>
               <p>It is well known that you both to a tavern did hie, And call'd for a bed there all night for to lie; And after you had revell'd the night unto day, P - gave you the bag, left the reckoning to pay.</p>
               <p>Since then, my dear mother, your frolicks are known, I hope you will always be ready to own, That all have their failings, tho' a difference in crimes; And you've had your tail-n-gs some hundreds of times.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude, I have only to say, It is a fatal disorder that will have its sway; But since its found out, it is a folly to pine, Since your case is my case, and my case is thine.</p>

How do you sell them? a halfpenny a piece; how many have you got? three; I bought the three songs of him. Wright came up almost close to us; I said where might you get these songs? Cooley said; I bought them of

            , did not I? Wright made answer, yes you did. Wright turned about to me, my daughter stood close to me, he pointed at my daughter, says he there is the young lady, there is a pretty maid for you, only look at her. He said that before twenty or thirty people. I believe he said you let them in at the garret window you know. My daughter fell a crying, and went in; he said I will sell you five or six dozen if you want them; I said I would have them; he said does the cap fit you? if it does you must wear it; I said when I have done wearing it I will make you wear it; he said now I would not have your daughter if you would give me 500 l. nay, I would not have her at all now. My daughter went in; she cried and said she would not stay in the house, and should be glad if we would send her into the country.</p>
               <p>Look at this song and see if it is one of the songs that you had of Cooley? - Yes, this is it, I set my name on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Is this one of the songs that Wright admitted he had sold to Cooley? - It is.</p>
               <p>I need scarce ask you, whether this has or has not occasioned great uneasiness in your family? - Any body that has children will I dare say take it into consideration.</p>
               <p>How long have you been married? - Twenty-five years. I pay 60 l. a year for the house I live in, and about 16 l. a year taxes.</p>
               <p>This thing has become publick in your neighbourhood? - Yes; it has done me a great deal of prejudice among my customers, but I do not prosecute for any profit but for the sake of publick justice, that we may be cleared from such an infamous libel.</p>

               <p>Was the girl two years old? - No; the girl was between three and four.</p>
               <p>Do you live near Stepney Church-yard? - In White-Horse-street. This man came up to me, and asked me the way to White-Horse-street; I said I was going that way, and would show him; but thinking he would walk faster than me, I showed him a cart, and said that was going there.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Past fourteen? - Yes; he told me he did not want to know the way to White-Horse-street, and asked me to go of an errand for him, and said he would give me a guinea; I said I would not go for two guineas; I told him I could not leave the children in the Church-yard; he said then he would give me three guineas if I would leave them in the Church-yard; I said I would not, they did not know the way home. He then desired me to take the children home and come again; I said I would; but I did not intend to come again. As I was going home from the Church-yard, I met my brother and sister.</p>
               <p>Were those children you were with your brothers and sisters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many did you meet? - Only two; they stayed by the way, I went home with the youngest.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you had taken the youngest home? - I saw the other little girl at the door going of an errand; she said she was going to call a washerwoman for her aunt, and asked me to go with her; I said I would go, and went with her.</p>

               <p>What age is she? - Going of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner at this time? - We did not see him; when we came into the Church-yard, I saw him standing at a burying, with his hat off; I said to the other girl this man will follow us, let us go home. We went as far as Stepney alms-houses, and this man followed us.</p>
               <p>That is in the way home? - Yes; only we stopped to talk to two little girls as we were going home, and this man came up to us.</p>
               <p>How came you to stop, when you expected he would follow you? - I did not expect he would follow us then, I thought he would if we went through the Church-yard; he came up, and asked us if we would go of an errand for him; he said he had some smuggled goods he had left with a boy of thirteen years of age at Rhodes' Well, and he was afraid of the custom-house officers, and would be obliged to us if we would go and fetch them for him.</p>
               <p>What, did he say he would give you then?</p>
               <p>He said three guineas, a piece of muslin, and a yard of lace a-piece.</p>
               <p>This was to each of you? - Yes, a bit of muslin to make a gown a-piece. I told him I was not willing to go; he asked me what I was afraid of; I said I was afraid he did not mean any good; he put his hand to his heart, and said He wished God Almighty might strike him dead that precious minute if he wished us any harm; he said it would be better for us if we would go. The other girl said, let us go a little way. We ran a little before him, through a field to Rhodes' Well. I then said to the other girl, let us go home; the other girl said, let us stop and hear what he says; by that time he had got up to us, and asked us what we were afraid of, because we seemed to be afraid and timorous.</p>
               <p>What was you afraid of? - We thought within ourselves that he meant some harm; but he spoke so fair that we did not think he could do us any harm; we told him we thought he did not mean any good; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070061"/> again, Here is my hand from my heart, and said, he wished God might strike him dead if he meant any ill; that he had children of his own as big as we were, and he would scorn to hurt us. There were two gates; he bid us get over one in the beginning of the road, the other in the middle; they go into the fields to Rhodes' Well; he says to one of us, you get over one gate, you over the other. I said, no, we would get over together; he said, the custom-house officers would take notice of two; we both got over into the field together; we seemed afraid; he said, what are you afraid of and pulled out a great parchment, and said this parchment is 1000 l. property, you need not be afraid; so we went across two fields. I said to the other girl we shall not know our road home again; he said, yes, you shall, for I will put you safe into the road again, as soon as I have got the bundles. We came up to a five-bar-gate; he wanted us to creep through; I said I would not go through that field for ever so much. A man came by on horseback; he said, look, here is a custom-house officer; I said if there was a devil-officer, I would not go into that field; he said, then he should loose his bundles; I said I did not care, I would not go into that field for all the bundles in England. Then he says, if you won't go I will get some body else that will; then we went to go home. I said to the other girl I was afraid we were not going the way home; he said, yes, we were. He then took us down to the side of a hedge, and then he said, If you do not submit to what I like, I will cut your throats; and he fumbled about in his pocket for his knife, and took hold of our throats, and throwed us down, and said, God d - n you, and bugger your eyes, if you do not submit to what I like I will cut your throats directly! then I screamed again.</p>
               <p>Did you scream before? - Yes, when he threw us down we both screamed, and he put his hand before our mouths.</p>


               <p>One on each mouth? - Yes; we were both down on the ground; he put his hand on both our mouths, and there we lay a little while; and then he said he would lie with the eldest first. He asked which was the eldest; I said, for God's sake, have mercy on us, I said I would submit to any thing if he would not touch the other girl, because she was so young.</p>
               <p>So you owned you was the eldest? - Yes, I told him I was the eldest.</p>
               <p>How old was the other girl? - I thought she was younger than I; but when I came to hear her age, I found we were of the same age; I thought I was turned of fifteen. When I came to ask my father, I found I was only turned of fourteen. Then he threw me down on the ground, and swore if I offered to stir he would cut my throat directly; and he took hold of the other girl by the clothes, and held her down while he was indecent with me.</p>
               <p>Remember you told us you was down before - We were down once; we got up again, and he knocked us down again.</p>
               <p>You said at first you screamed again the second time? - We screamed twice the last time; he put his hands on our mouths, and said, if we screamed again he would c ut our throats directly.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, was you down twice or three times? - Only twice; it was the second time he put his hand upon my mouth.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that after he put his hand upon your mouth you got up, and then he knocked you down again? - I said, after he knocked us down the second time we screamed, and he put his hand upon our mouths.</p>
               <p>Then he did not put his hand upon your mouth the first time? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he lay with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And held the other girl down at the same time? - Yes, with his elbow; she untied her apron, and thought she might get away from him and call help.</p>
               <p>How came you to observe what she was doing while he was lying with you? - I kicked and tumbled about; I heard every word she said, because she was close to me.</p>
               <p>I should think you was so frightened you would not have observed what was done to her; did you observe what he said and did while he was lying with you? - See, I did not, but I heard; I was afraid he would do her some mischief or another.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070062"/>How long was this about? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>He was not half an hour in lying with you? - Yes, he was as near as we could guess; we were frightened, and thought five minutes was a great while.</p>
               <p>What became of the other girl? - He held her down. When he had done with me, I got up directly; as we were going home I downed on my knees, and said, pray don't touch her; he said he would not; but as we walked along the field, he said the other would tell of me if he did not serve her the same; and I told him (not as I thought to keep it in from my father and mother) I told him she would not, because we had lived together so many years; he bid me not to tell any body; I said I would not (because I was in danger of my life, not that I intended to keep it in); the other girl was walking along. In the mean time he said, whenever I come down White-Horse-street, if I don't serve her the same you will take me up and put me into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the road? - A field off; there was not a person in the road to call to. Then he throwed the other on the grass; I said, for God's sake! don't touch her; he said he would, by God he would; says he, I know she will tell; she will hit it in your teeth whenever you quarrel. I said we never quarrelled; he said, we could not live without quarrelling. He took her by the shoulder, and throwed her down; instead of holding me, he let me go; I ran a little way off from him. As soon as he saw me got away from him, he fetched me back, by holding my shoulder, and struck me on my breast, so that it was black for several days. After he knocked me down, I thought I should not have risen any more; I had not power to speak for two or three minutes after.</p>
               <p>Did the other girl see all this? - She got up and attempted to run away.</p>
               <p>Then you walked away at the time he had got the other girl down? - I ran towards the road.</p>
               <p>Did he get up from the other girl and follow you? - She got up; she had not power to move for fright; she thought I was run away from her. I thought if I could get to the road I could call some body to my assistance. He ran very fast; he seemed rather to fly than run; he said, what, are you going to call some body to your assistance; what do you think of it; why, I could have run five miles off with this poor girl.</p>
               <p>Did the other girl get up while he was running after you? - Yes, she did; he took me back to her again; she offered to run away; he called out, and said, if you don't stop it shall be worse for you; there was no place for her to run away; he snatched her, and threw her down again; he held me by the clothes, and swore, I will serve you the same as I have done before, and I will beat you like a sack of wheat:</p>
               <p>Did he hold you down while he held her down? - Yes, he held me down as he did the other whilst he was with me, with his elbow.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - The other said what do you think will become of you, you will surely be hanged as you are born; he said he did not care; I said here is somebody in the field; I said there was a press-gang or one thing or another, in order to set him to run; he said he did not care if the devil was in the field, he would have his will. I did not hear any body, I only told him so, to try if I could make him run away; by that time the other got up.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing to do with the other at that time? - He was with her then when I told him there was some body in the field.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing to do with that girl? - Yes, all the while he was with her; I think I may say pretty near three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>This was all in the same field? - It was.</p>
               <p>Was there any path there? - No path at all.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the gate? - A good distance; we went through one field, then the other; we went over a bank to it; I really don't know, for I did not mind.</p>
               <p>Did you go over a bank into this field where this happened? - Yes, a pretty high one; but it was trod down, there was no path at all in it; there was a cow and a calf in the field.</p>
               <p>You went out of another field into that? - Out of the first field into that; the field that we were to go through to go home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070063"/>One field you said you would not go into? - That was the other field that we said we would not go into it; we did not go into that field at all; but we went into two fields; he wanted us to go into three fields; it was a great high wheat field; the wheat was fit to cut that he wanted us to go into. When we refused to go into that, he took us as if we were going home; we had been across two fields.</p>
               <p>Did he make you to get over the bank? - Yes, he said, come over this bank, and it will not be ten minutes walk there.</p>
               <p>How long after he had thrown you down was it before he threw the other down? -</p>
               <p>Not five minutes. I forgot to tell one thing; when he got to the field where the wheat was, he beckoned his boy, and said, Jack, come here; he said Jack could not hear him; I said I would not go through that field, for I mistrusted some ill then.</p>
               <p>You say it was not five minutes after he lay with you before he lay with the other; are you sure of that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you lie very still, or struggle with him? - We both struggled a great deal with him; but it was all to no signification; he swore at us so that we downed on our knees six or seven times, and begged he would not kill us; he swore at us so that we were quite frightened at him; he was above our strength a great deal. We did not know our way home; I said to the other, I am sure we do not know our way home; I said to him, what do you think our fathers and mothers will say when we get home; he said he did not care. We asked him if he was not ashamed of himself; he said no, that he had served younger than us so. As he walked along with us, he said we should go home and we were very thankful he spared our lives; we were going home; he took us over into the last field which is next the road; then he said to the other -</p>
               <p>Did he give you any thing? - No, nothing in the world.</p>
               <p>How long did he walk with you? - About ten minutes; then he took hold of the other, and said he had not done with her; I downed upon my knees, and said, for God's sake, don't hurt her any more, you cannot ruin me more than you have done, kill me, or any thing, but don't touch the other girl; he said he had not done with her.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - He throwed her down again, and swore by God, if we made any resistance, or tried to run away from him, it should be worse for us. He made me sit down again, whilst he was concerned with her, and he held me the same again. There was a cart went by, we were pretty near the road, and there was nothing but two boys in it; he held our heads both down against the grass. If they had been two men instead of boys, we should have called to them if we had been killed; but the boys would have been nothing in his hands.</p>
               <p>So you did not call out because they were not men? - Yes; when he had done with the other he got up again.</p>
               <p>Did he lay with the other then? - Yes, he lay with her twice.</p>
               <p>He did not meddle with you then? - No, he never touched me any more; he said he did not like me; but when we were together he offered me a guinea; I said I did not want either him or his guinea, and he never spoke to me afterwards while we were in the field.</p>
               <p>Did he meddle with the other girl any more? - He did, twice; he said he would give us a guinea; I said I either wanted him nor his guinea; he said he did not like me, the other was the best natured girl, because I was so timorous to go with him, the other seemed to have a better heart than I had; and she said she did not think there was that in him, he spoke so fair that he knew so many folks in our street that I knew, that I thought he would not have that behaviour.</p>
               <p>Did he give the other girl a guinea? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he offer it to her? - He said he would give it us between us.</p>
               <p>Did he leave you then? - We went over the bank into the road, and we walked on first, and he returned to a bit of water; said he, I must wash my shirt or else I shall be blowed.</p>
               <p>Did you see him wash his shirt? - I cannot say I saw him, because I walked on; we tried to get up to Sunderland's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070064"/>Did you see any thing of his shirt? - Yes, at Justice Sherwood's.</p>
               <p>Did you go home directly? - He said he would go to Sunderland's to get something to drink; instead of that he ran away; I never saw any more of him; we went home by ourselves, and my father and mother and people were coming to seek for us; we met them; because we never were girls that went out with fellows, or were out late at night; we told them immediately what had befallen us.</p>
               <p>Did your mother come? - The other girl's father and mother did and two or three neighbours; my mother did not come, because she has a young family at home.</p>
               <p>What are their names? - Her name is

               <p>But you could see whether there was a path in it or not? - There was no path in it I know.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there a gravel-pit in the field? - The field is begun to be cut as if it was to be ploughed; there was no gravel-pit in it.</p>
               <p>How far was it off the road? - There was a field and then a road, and then two fields more. It was on the left-hand side of the way as we went down the road leading to Limehouse church.</p>
               <p>You are you say turned of fourteen years of age? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to be persuaded, who knew the way home so well as you did, by a man that that was the nearest way, when the Gentlemen of the Jury know, and every body must, that it was the farthest way you could go? - It was not me that asked the way to White Horse-street; I said the man asked the way to White Horse-street.</p>
               <p>I do not understand that the man laid hold of you to pull you over, how came you to go over that bank? - He asked me the way to White Horse-street, I did not ask him; I said I was going there, if he would follow me I would shew him; I said there was a cart going if he went by that cart it would take him directly to White Horse-street.</p>
               <p>What size girl is the other girl you speak of, is she as lusty as you are? - No, she is quite thin.</p>
               <p>I understand you that you swear that he laid with you half an hour together?</p>
               <p>Court. That he was half an hour about it, and held the other girl down with his elbow.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath did not you consent rather than the other girl should be abused? - I did not, I only said so.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which elbow did he use to hold the girl down? - The left elbow.</p>
               <p>How came you to find out the man? - Dr. Hatton's maid told my father that she had been assaulted by such a man, and he offered her three guineas, three yards of lace, and something else if she would go and get a bundle, the same as he did us; she said she would not; he said if she did not like the things he would give her five guineas to go; she said she had been of an errand, had over stayed her time and could not stay to go; he said he was a captain of a ship, that he was going away the next morning, and that his name was Williams; he told me so, and that he lived in Tooley-street; I asked him two or three things because I thought we should find him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070065"/>Did he shew you any knife? - No, he only felt about.</p>
               <p>You did not call out to the people in the road or the field? - There was nobody but the two boys.</p>
               <p>Was it the Limehouse road that you saw the boys in the cart in? - I do not know, it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>You used another expression, that after he had taken the liberties with the other girl he said he did not like you? - He said he did not like me because I was ill-tempered; that was in the field.</p>
               <p>But the other girl was very willing? - Not to do what he did; she was willing to go into the field, because she thought him a good sort of man.</p>
               <p>She was willing to go out of the way with the man as well as you; I understand you she was more willing than you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So she was willing to go out of her way? - We were not both together when this man met us.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath was the guinea offered to you after he said he did not like you? - When he was with her he said he did not like me; it was afterwards the guinea was offered, when he was great with her the second time.</p>
               <p>What did he offer you the guinea for? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>I should have thought it was for you to hold your tongue? - I would not have held my tongue.</p>
               <p>When the girl was held down by his left elbow did that girl struggle at all to get from him? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he offer you the three guineas? - In Stepney Church-yard.</p>
               <p>He did not give it you? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say for deceiving you, for not giving you the three guineas he promised you? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did he make no excuse? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not he do it? - I do not know. I did not go for the money; he said it would be a friendly action if we would go for him; he seemed so much in trouble to us; I did not go for the money but it was a friendly action.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him so? - He said it would be a friendly action, and would be better for us if we would go: he said that before we went.</p>

               <p>How many days after was it that you took him up? - This was on the Wednesday, we took him up on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>You told Mrs. Monk first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell your father and mother? - I do not know; I believe she told them. I told my mother myself the next day when we were together by ourselves.</p>
               <p>You never told your father of it? - No, for he was in a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether you told the story to the father and mother of Stone, and the neighbours that met you? - It was the father and mother, Mrs. Wilson, and two or three more met us together.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your story to them? - We did not tell them then directly, because we were in the street; we only told them how we had been used, but did not tell them the whole truth of it because we were in the street.</p>
               <p>What did you tell them? - We said a man had behaved very indecent to us and that was the reason they took the other gentleman up; that was all we said till we got home, and then we told them; the little girl and I.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the whole story to Stone and his wife? - I did not to Stone and his wife, but his daughter did; I went home directly.</p>
               <p>Did Stone's daughter tell them what happened to you as well as to her? - Yes, she did as soon as she came home.</p>
               <p>How do you account for that, you said a man behaved indecently to you and therefore that was the occasion of the other man's being taken up? - Because they thought that had been the man that had served us so, and for that reason they fell upon him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you describe the man? - We were confused and frightened, we had not power to speak to them, we only said that was not the man; they said we only said so; they took hold of the man because we were confused and did not know the man, and because this man came out of Sunderland's, and they thought he had been the man and had changed his clothes, and therefore they took him up, for they said we might be deceived.</p>
               <p>Had that man when he was taken up the same sort of clothes on as the prisoner? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Upon your oath did not Stone's daughter describe a man? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>And you was by at the time? - I was at home; I went to bed directly as soon as ever I went home; I was not by but I described him the same she did, as they said.</p>
               <p>When did you tell Mrs. Monk? - My father bid her take me and ask me questions as soon as ever I went home.</p>
               <p>So you went to Mrs. Monk's to tell her by your father's directions? - I did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Your father was angry with you for staying so late? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. And what did you say to your father that your father should bid you go to Mrs. Monk? - I did not say any thing to him, he saw how we had been used, and bid her ask me a few questions.</p>
               <p>What had your father seen that induced him to send you to Mrs. Monk? - I do not know any more than they asked me whether the man had served us so and so; I told them yes; that was the same night, and so I suppose it came to my father's ears.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not your mother at home at that time? - Yes; but she was like to be in sits, and for that reason they sent her to another house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the father of the girl. I was eating my supper between ten and eleven at night, and word was brought me that the children had been decayed out, that a man had ill-used them, and that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Do you remember who told you so, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070067"/> it any of Stone's people? - None. A person came running in, who it was I do not recollect from the confusion I was in; upon that I went immediately and I found two men had a man by the collar; a peace officer went along with me; they said what is the matter here, is this the man who has used your child ill? The peace officer said who gives charge; Stone said I do. There were several women buffetting the man about. I said to the women stand off good women, if the man has done any thing he is amenable to the law, and let the law take its course, but he shall not be hurt. They led him on; I followed; they took him to the watch-house. The children had declared that he was not the man; but the neighbours thought it might be from the confusion the children were in; some of the people even said they were drunk. They were drunk with terror and with the fright. That child had been beat about the mouth; her mouth was swelled, and she had been very severely beat.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any blow in any other part besides the mouth? - It was not fit for me to examine, some other neighbours said she had had a blow upon her stomach. The man was taken to the watch-house. I had heard that the children had said before that was not the man; but however I went in. As the man was going by, my child said O father, they have got the wrong man; I said I do not know. I persuaded them to let the children go down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>(The girl falls into a strong fit.)</p>
               <p>Is she subject to fits? - I never saw her in one till since this affair; she has had one before. She is a strong hale child. She said that was not the man; I let the children both be taken to the watch-house; and said do not keep the man if it is not the man. Every body was of opinion that in the state the children were in then, that it might have been as much against the man as for him, for in their terrour and fright they might as well have said it was as not. I did insist upon it the man should not be let go till the matter had been before a magistrate and investigated, for which I have a paper in my pocket to be brought to Westminster for insisting upon that. When I went home a neighbour, one Mrs. Monk, came in and said, take her and examine her and see whether she has been injured; they very foolishly and inadvertently only examined her by asking her a few questions, when they ought I think to have proceeded to a much stricter examination; they came and told me she had been injured.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not say what they said? - When she came home I said go to bed and compose yourself. That was all that I said to her.</p>
               <p>What questions did you put to the child? Not one. I could not suppose the girl would have courage to reveal such a thing to me.</p>
               <p>This woman should be here. - It was told me before the magistrate that there was no occasion, as she had not made the examination that I expected she would have made; she only verbally examined her; I meant a different examination. She was carried the next day before Mr. Sherwood, and this Mr. Broadwater was there; he separated the girls, put one in his parlour, and the other to the bar; as soon as the children saw him; they severally declared he was not the man. Mr. Sherwood asked if they thought they should know the man; they told him they could pick him out from a thousand, they should know him to the latest day of their lives. Upon a description that I learned from these children, and a corroborating testimony of the cook maid belonging to Dr. Hatton, the minister of Stepney, though Dr. Hatton smothered the evidence, for he would not suffer the servant to go before Mr. Sherwood till he knew who was to pay her. Dr. Hatton's servant gave me a description of that man.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No, she would not come. Before the justice she gave me a description of this man; her description of the man's person so corresponded with the children's that by means of that I found him out. When I found him he answered to the description. I did not send for my own child, for particular reasons, lest they should say I tutored<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070068"/> her; I sent for Stone and his daughter, and bid Stone go with another person to a publick-house the corner of King James's Stairs, where the man was. When they came there Stone went in; I took the child over with me, and said be cool and deliberate, a man's life, at least his character, is at stake; if you fix such a thing upon him it is one of the worst crimes you can be guilty of in the sight of God and man; now look steadily into the house when you go in and point me the man out. There were between twenty and thirty people in the house. I said to the father, Mr. Stone, how do you, will you drink. Just as I said these words the child catched me by the arm and said, that is the man, the man that did it; he said did what? she said that injured me in Stepney-fields. I collared him directly.</p>
               <p>Was you by when your own child saw him at any time? - I was following the man, and the rest came up into Shadwell-market, just as they turned the corner of Griffin-street my daughter, who was thirty yards from him, said that is the man! that is the man!</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before yourself? - Never, to my knowledge, in the whole course of my life.</p>
               <p>Was you with your child before the justice? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did she fix on him then? - She did identify him directly.</p>
               <p>And you had heard a description from her, and the description she gave before corresponded with the person of the prisoner? - It did; but though the prisoner has not got the same clothes on now, I could pick him out from ten thousand people.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>As you have told your story very honestly and faithfully, I would ask you a question; had you any warrant to take the prisoner up? - I had no warrant.</p>
               <p>Had you any constable with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he go voluntarily with you? - He did not; he would not have gone at all if some of Mr. Sherwood's people had not come in; I told him if he was an honest man; he would not be afraid to go to Justice Sherwood. When I laid hold of him I told him I would not quit my hold if I lost my life. I wanted no warrant, for I think when the man was pointed out, any man had a right to seise him.</p>

             ran after me and asked me where I was going; I said for a washerwoman for my aunt, and asked her to go with me; she said she would, and told me about this man; she said that he asked her the way to White Horse-street, that she told him she had three children with her, and if he would go with her she would shew him the way, but it might be he would walk faster than her, and told him to follow a cart; he said it was not that I wanted, will you go of an errand for me, I will give you a guinea; she said no, I would not go for two guineas; then he offered her three guineas to go, and bid her leave the children in the Church-yard; she said she told him she would take the children all home, that they did not know the way home.</p>
               <p>Did she say she would return again to him? - Yes she said she told him she would return again after she had taken the children home. When I was coming almost against the church-yard, she came to me and said Polly, where are you going; I said over the church-yard for a washerwoman. I asked her to go with me; when we were about half over the church-yard, she turned and said that is the man that asked me to go for some smuggled goods for him. He was standing at a burying. She said she would go back, for he would follow us, and we turned back again and stood a little farther by the yard, and he followed us; says he, well, have you a mind to go; Nancy said no, I do not like to go; I said do go a little way with him, and so we went.</p>
               <p>You did go a little way? - Yes we got a little way. Every now and then she stopped and said she did not like to go; I desired her to go, and at last we got to Rhodes' Well.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070069"/>Did he desire you to go on when you stopped? - We stopped to speak to two girls at the alms-houses, and they wanted to go with us he said there must not be so many, people would take notice of it.</p>

               <p>You went on without them? - Yes; he said if only us two went, either we must go first or he must go first; so we went over Limehouse fields, and crossed over till we got to Rhodes' Well. We walked first and got to

We had got to a lane, and were turning down to go homeward; he called to us and asked us what we were afraid of. He was a good way behind us. Then he called us for to stop, and asked us what we were afraid of. Nancy said, I am afraid that you are about no good; he said here is my hand to my heart, I wish God may strike me down dead this minute if I mean any harm; says he I have got children of my own bigger than either of you, I would scorn to hurt you, or to use you ill; said I, well then we will go with the gentleman; says he, I wish one of my daughters was here now, I would not give you the trouble to go; he said it is not far now, I will shew you the place, and he pointed between two trees; there, he said, is my boy waiting with the bundle for you to fetch it; we went with him over two fields; we came to a great high gate, where there was a field full of corn, so he wanted us to get over there; she said she should not go. There came a man by on horseback; he said here is a custom-house officer, I am sure it is; get through this gate, the holes between the gate are wide enough to creep through, creep through, says he, if you will not creep through get over; she said she would neither creep through nor get over for 1000 l.</p>
               <p>All his discourse was directed to her? - Yes; he said well if you will not get over nor get through I will get somebody else, and I will see you safe home.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to see you safe home of his own accord or did the other girl say she did not know her way home? - She said she did not know her way home; he said I will see you safe home and I must get somebody else; then we went to the bottom of the field, and she said she was sure we were not in the way home; he said we were, and took us both by the hand and said you are going home, and then he took us by the neck and knocked us both down.</p>
               <p>How did you get into that field? - Over a gate.</p>
               <p>At the bottom of the field was it? - At the bottom of the field.</p>
               <p>How did he knock you down? - He scratched me; you may see the mark in my neck now; he took us both by the neck, one in one hand and the other in the other and knocked us both down.</p>
               <p>Describe how he took you both by the neck? - Thus (describing it).</p>
               <p>You say there is the mark still? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say to him then? - She cried out and he said d - n your eyes, you bitch, if you offer to make a noise, I will cut your throat, and shuffled about for a knife.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out? - We both screamed.</p>
               <p>He fumbled in his pocket, as if feeling for a knife? - Yes; making believe to frighten us. When we got to the gate he pulled out a roll of parchment.</p>
               <p>You got up again? - This was before we got into the field. He got over the gate first, and pulled it out and said, my dear, this is worth a thousand pound property.</p>
               <p>Who did he say that to? - He shewed it to us both; so then he took us to the lower part of the field and knocked us both down.</p>
               <p>When he knocked you down did you get up again? - We tried to get up again and he held us fast, we could not get up again.</p>

               <p>Did he lie with her? - Yes; then he walked down the field with us, and said, he would see us home; he did not offer to touch me. When we got almost through the field, he said to her, if you have any quarrel this girl will throw it in your face, I must serve her the same.</p>
               <p>Did he? - Yes, he laid hold of me, and laid me down.</p>

               <p>What became of you then? - He got up from me to fetch her back; I got up, and we walked along; he said he had not done with me what he wanted.</p>
               <p>How far had you gone before he said he had not done with you? - Not above a yard.</p>

               <p>To Taft. Is that the same shirt you saw? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher. That is the same shirt you showed the woman? - Yes; it appears to have been washed. I have this to observe further, that on the Saturday evening, before we took him to gaol, he behaved very bad; he layed down on the floor, unbuttoned his breeches, and showed his private parts to several women present, and said, You bitches, is not this enough for you?</p>

               <p>I am as innocent as the child unborn. I was at home at my own house at half past nine o'clock at night the night it was done.

               <p>To Fletcher. Was this man kept in custody till his wife was sent for? - He was.</p>

               <p>Was it while he was before the magistrate? - No, while he was at the publick-house, after he came from the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did he make it his defence that his wife was out of order? - He did say so; he was very loth to let me look at his shirt; when he found I would, he showed it me.</p>
