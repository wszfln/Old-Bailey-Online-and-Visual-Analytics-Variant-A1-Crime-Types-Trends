I will do them in the morning the first thing"—she said she must have them to put on the bed, but they were hardly dry enough, and she would go home and finish them—I left my room between six and seven o'clock—I locked my door, and took the key with me—I left nobody in the house at all—I was absent ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I have one room on the ground-floor, and one up<lb/>stairs—I had left the lower room when I went out—when I returned, on coming up the garden, I thought I saw more light in the first floor room than I had left there—I had left a rushlight—I unlocked the street-door—I went in, and said, "Who's there?"—the prisoner called out, and said, "It is me: I thought you were asleep"—she was up-stairs with a candle in her hand—I went up stairs to her, and said, "What do you do here?"—I found her in my room, and saw my drawers wide open—the door was wide open—I said to her, "What have you been to my drawer for?"—she daid it was not her—she turned round, and I saw the vallance of the bed had been lifted up, and saw a pair of sheets, a flannel waistcoat, and a napkin, which had been taken from my drawer—I took them up, and brought them drawn stairs—I said to her, "What do these do here? you have taken them out of my drawer"—she did no, she had not touched them—I brought them down stairs, laid them on the mangle, opened the door, and called my son, who was next door but one—he came in—I said in her presence, "George, I have been robbed"—he went for an officer—I am sure I had left these things safe in my drawer before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Green, who keeps the Duke of Cumberland public-house at the corner of Bryanston-street, and Cumber<lb/>land-street, Oxford-road. On the 11th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a male friend—they walked into the parlour—I followed them—the prisoner asked his friend what he would take to drink—he did not give a decided answer, and the prisoner called for a glass of gin and water himself, saying, that was always the way he treated people who did not give a decided answer—he called for pen and ink—two woman and a child came in, and they also ordered a glass of gin and water—I took it in with the pen and ink—the woman paid, but the pri<lb/>soner did not—his friend went out, and in a few minutes the woman went away—I went and looked round the room—the pictures were all safe then, and the prisoner appeared to be asleep, with his head reclining on the table—a third man came in, and joined him, and in two or three mi<lb/>nutes the prisoner got up and went out—I said, "You have not paid for your gin and water"—he said "No, I shall return in a minute"—I went into the parlour then, and the pictures were there—the third man sat at the table—the prisoner returned in a minute with 6d in his hand—he paid me and walked into the parlour, rang the bell, and called for another glass of gin and water, and change for a shilling, which I took him—he said he felt rather dirty and uncomfortable; he bad been travelling in his own buggy about sixty miles that day—he asked in what direction Park-lane was—I told him—his friends came back, and were in and out several times—the prisoner came out, and ordered a third glass of gin and water, and put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the bar door—I sent my potboy in with that glass—I am certain the pictures were all safe when I was last in the room—at last the three men all came out together—I went into the room, and the pictures were gone—the prisoner, on coming out, came in front of the bar, and said to me, "Pray, in what street does Mr. Russell Harris live?"—I told him—I suspected something was wrong, and put my hand on the bar door—at that time the other two were going out—I missed the picturess the moment they were gone—I ran out, and took the prisoner at the corner of Cumberland-street, about forty yards off—he seemed agitated—I said, "You have stolen my pictures"—I called a policeman—he burst from me, and ran away and fell down—he was then taken and brought into the house—he then said to me, "Mrs. Green, what do you want, is it me or your pictures?"—I said, "The pictures"—he said, "I am not given into custody yet, and if you will allow any two men to go with me, I will pay the men their expenses, and you shall have your pictures returned" if I would not give him into custody—I had nobody to go, and my friends advised me to give him into custody—I have never found my pictures, nor heard any thing of them—I am quite sure he ran away and fell down.</p>

What!" and was greatly agitated—your companions had no cloak or apron, under which they could conceal the pictures that I saw—were in gilt frames 14 inches by 16—nei<lb/>ther of the other men were tall enough to reach them down—you were in the room about a quarter of an hour—there was nobody else in the room heart the woman, who appeared very respectable—they had nurse with them—my bar is close to the street-door—nobody could go out on the off<lb/>side without my observing them—nobody has been to the house to inquire for my potboy—the waiter was not in the room when you came out—I swear the pictures were in the room when you were there, and when you left they were gone—you said at the office, you were certain your two friends would not allow you to be in such a situation as you had done them many benefits, and merely came in to write a note for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live directly opposite Mrs. Green's, with my fa<lb/>ther, who is a fruiterer. I was standing in the shop between six and seven o'clock, and hearing a cry of "Stop theif," or "Police," I ran outside the door—seeing seven or eight people up Upper Bryanstone-street, I ran up there, and found Mrs. Green holding the prisoner by the collar, and a young man by the side of him—I went up close to him, and followed them into Green's parlour—after the door being shut, and the prisoner regaining his breath, he said, if Mrs. Green would allow me or the young man who assisted in taking him, to go along with him, he would produce the pictures—he said, "Do you wish me to go to prison, or wish to have your pic<lb/>tures back?"—those were his precise words—he appeared very much agitated when I first saw him, in fact, it was five minutes after he was in the room, before he spoke—Mrs. Green said, "I want my pictures"—I advised her to wait for a policeman—she refused to allow us to go with him—I said, "He had better be taken to the station-house"—he made no observations about that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Gentleman, the policeman would impress your minds with the idea that I refused to tell where the two men lived—my object in refusing to answer further was, because I was not in a fit state to ex<lb/>plain myself, so that what I said, might not be open to future prejudice—it is evident I acted with propriety, for what I did saw about following the men, has been explained differently by all the witness—I had really been serving those men, by giving one money, and writing a memorial for the other, and treating them—one of them I had not seen for four years, and he was then butler to the Duke of Wellington—I know no more of taking the pictures than you do—if these men took them, it must have been while I was asleep—I asked for two men to go with me with a view to overtake them, if possible, in order to clear myself—one of the witness says, I made use of the very words, but when I asked him if he was certain of my exact words—he said, "How is it possible for people to be exact?" if so, is it not likely that one word being added, might make a material alternation—they have all forgotten the word "endeavour"—if they had stated that, it would have removed any unfavourable impression—it is true I ran, and was much agitated, but Mrs. Green did not charge me with it—she said, "Where are your two friends? they have taken my pictures"—I said, "Indeed I know nothing about it, but I think I can overtake them"—she then called "Police," and I did run, trying to es<lb/>cape—situated as I was, being some hundreds of miles from home (as I came from Jersey) it is not surprising that I should try to escape—it is to be re<lb/>membered, the most eminent characters the world have known, both in ancient and modern history, have been susceptible of fear without guilt—had I been aware of what the men had done, I could have run three or four times the distance I was from the house when she overtake me, and is it likely I should hold a conversation with her at the bar, had I known what had been done? when two men were passing with two pic<lb/>tures, fourteen inches by sixteen inches, and remember they had nothing to cover them; it would appear that I had attracted her to the spot where she must have seen them go out—if I had been aware they had been taken, is it likely I should call for an extra glass of gin and water, and detain the waiter while I gave him some halfpence?—the fact is, I had met one of these men, who asked me to draw up a memorial for him, to a member of His Majesty's government—I went to sleep, leaving the memorial on the table before me—when I awoke it was gone, and he said he had taken it—it is possible that the three females had better means of hiding these pictures than the men, for they had nothing to cover them with—I cannot be res<lb/>ponsible for the actions of others while I was asleep, and it appears the men went in and out during that time—the room was very full of pic<lb/>tures.</p>

I am a farmer, and live at Ashford, in Middlesex, On the morning of the 24th of December I missed a cream—coloured, long<lb/>stailed gelding from my straw-yard there—I afterwards saw the same geld<lb/>ing at the stable of the Griffin Inn, at Kingston, in Surrey—Ashford is about fourteen miles from Hyde-park corner—I afterwards attended before the magistrate, and saw the horse—the magistrate's clerk, Mr. Horne, took down the evidence—but he is not here.</p>

On the night of the 23rd of December, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock I met the prisoner at Kingston, leading a cream-coloured horse—I stopped him, and asked where ha was going with it—he said, "To London market"—I asked him, "What for?"—he said, "To sell it"—I asked him where he brought it from—he said at first, "From Staines"—then he told me brought it from Weyhill, in Hamp<lb/>shire—I told him I should detain him and the horse, as his story did not satisfy me—I should take him before the mayor and if they were satisfied, I should be—I put him into the watch-house, and looked the horse up at the Griffin Inn; and on Thursday, the 24th, Mr. Sherborn came and owned owned it—I went before the mayor that day at Sunbury, which is five miles from Kingston.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shapman to Mr. Simeon Browne, when lives in holborn. On the 22nd of December, about five o'clock in the evening. I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner at the door with a piece of ticking on his shoulder—he took it out of the shop, and I followed him—as I turned out of the door I saw him placing the ticking against the door of the next house and he was moving gently away from it, as if I had seen him—I went after him, and brought him back, and told another man to bring the piece of ticking—I should not think he had any opportunity of seeing whether I observed him—when he placed it outside he pretended to look into watch<lb/>maker's shop—I noticed two or three men outside, who appeared to be connected with him—he had got about five yards from the door—it is a private house, and rather a dark place—I should think it would be heavy to carry—there are sixty-five yards of it—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of these men came up to me, and had I been a little further I believe he would have struck me—they did nothing to the ticking—the prisoner was carry<lb/>ing it out as softly as any cat would have walked—it had been it the win<lb/>dow, four or five feet from the entrance—he had lifted it over a pile of hearth-rugs, and some druggets.</p>

My mother came down on Thursday night for thirty pounds of potatoes—she was going out to work the following days, and was not going to be paid till she was done—she was coming down then to pay the bill—she did not like to come to Mr. Walker to ask him for any more potatoes she came and asked them to take them, and pay for them out of my wages, on Sunday morning—she came to the door, I weighed them and turned them into her basket—she went home with them—I went in, and meant to put them down but Sarah was washing the slate; she asked me to run over the way and get one penny worth of horehound—before I came back Mr. Bradsell came and said I had stolen a basket of potatoes.</p>

Wheeler, Card-manufacturer"—there is a shop door, with "H. Wheeler, Card-manufacturer and Printer" on each side—I went in with my companions, at the shop door—I asked for Mr. Wheeler—I went down stairs into a cellar-kitchen, and there saw the prisoner—I asked him who he was—he said his name was Wheeler—I asked if he was master of the house—he said, "Yes"—I told him I had got a warrant to search his house for a forged ace of spades—I do not ex<lb/>actly recollect what he said, but he requested I would let him look at the warrant—I read it over to him, with the exception of the name of the in<lb/>format—he made no particular observation at that time, and I went up stairs—he afterwards said some person had done it (laid the information) out of spite, or something to that effect—I left him and his wife, two sons and daughter, in charge of Mace, and went up stairs with Stowell—we just took a cursory view of the different rooms, and I returned back and found the prisoner in the cellar—I had left him in the kitchen—I told him I must go and search the house, having searched the shop in his presence—I told him I would go up to the top of the house to begin—he said, "You had better begin at the bottom," or something to that effect; but we went to the top—I went first into the attic, which was partly divided into two, but part of the partition was down—in the back part of the attic, I went through a trap-door into the roof part, and there found a quantity of playing-cards, some loose, and some in packages—unfortunately, after taking the prisoner away, all the cards I found got mixed—I handed the cards I found there down to Stowell—the prisoner was present—I then went into the front part of the attic, and found a hole in the ceiling, through which I got into the roof of that part, there being no other way to do so—I there found a quantity of cards—there might be ten or twelve packs—I also found this bag—it is in the same state as I found it—I gave the second parcel of cards to Stowell, and dropped the bag down to him also—I examined it (<hi rend="italic">opens it</hi>)—I found in it these papers—I believe they are all the same—there are thirty-four sheets with ten impressions of the ace of spades on each sheet—being three hundred and forty impressions—I also found in the bag thirty-eight impressions loose—I tied them up together, and am sure these are the same—they are in a state to put on cards—some of them are pasted on cards—I then sent for a coach, and took the prisoner into custody—I searched the house afterwards, and found a great quantity of cards, and materials for making cards—there were a great many more packs of cards in the bag, consisting of fifty-one cards each—those wanted the ace of spades—they were loose in the bag—I also found this parcel, which con<lb/>tains ninety-nine aces of spades, some on cards, and some on papers—here are thirty-seven aces of spades without the stamp—they were in the bag—I also found some blank cards, some old spade aces, some stamped, and some not—these were in the bag—I found a great quantity of papers and cards in various parts of the house—in nearly every room—here are the materials for making them, which I found—here is a block for printing, with the knaves and kings and queens, and other materials for card print<lb/>ing—here are some cards in the process of manufacturer, not finished—alto<lb/>gether there are one hundred and eighty packs wanting the ace of spades.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the thirty-eight impressions of the ace of spades</hi>) these are forged—the circle round the garter is very dif<lb/>ferent; the genuine one being engine-turned—it is the custom of card manufacturers to send paper to the Stamp Officer for the ace of spades to be stamped—the Commissioners provide a stamp for that purpose—they send plain paper to us in reams—the Commissioners sometimes provide a stamp with the manufacturer's name on it, at his request—there was such a plate provided for a manufacturer named Thomas Creswick—there is a book kept at the Stamp Office with impressions of the plates which are prepared—I have it here—it has impressions of the plates prepared for Creswick—the date is on the impression; "14th of June, 1828"—these aces of spades appear to be a forgery of that plate—the other aces found in the bag are all forgeries of other plates, of other manufacturers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The card you call a forgery, appears in no respect a resemblance of Creswick's plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very bad—it would certainly not deceive any body in the Stamp Office, nor any body else who examined it, I should think—there is a great variation between the lion and unicorn, and the crown; and in the ring encircling the motto—I have reason to believe all the cards produced are forgeries—Creswick is still a card-manufacturer—this old ace of spades is a genuine one—some of these old ones I have not seen before—I am not able to judge whether these are genuine or not, not having seen them before—I believe them to be forged, but I am not positive—this one I am sure is a genuine one—it is a very old ace, which was used previous to my coming into the Office—here is one genuine, and one which I have no knowledge of—the rest are blanks—the one with Creswick on it is genuine—this other pack is also a stamp used before I came into the office, and I cannot speak positively about them—I never saw Thomas Wheeler—there was a person of that name, a licensed card-manufacturer—that was not the prisoner—I do not know whether he is alive or dead—in 1828, when the stamp-duty was altered, the impression of the aces of spades was also altered—I was in the Stamp Office at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time, do you know that the Stamp Office had a great deal of card-paper, with the duties on it, of the time before the alteration took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: I do not know that; nor that they sold it as waste<lb/>paper—the genuine paper would be in the custody of the warehouse<lb/>keeper of cards and dies—he has no perquisites, that I am aware of, respecting cards and paper—I have no access to the warehouse, and I do not know whether things are sold or not—there is only one warehouse—Lewis</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of forgeries should you call them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are imitation of the plate, no doubt—they resemble it in some measure—they vary considerably on being compared—any card-maker would perceive the variation.</p>

On Monday, the 21st of December, I went to Paul, and told him I was given to understand, that he had been selling the Weekly Visitor, which was published by us on Monday, on the previous Saturday, and I was very anxious on the subject, having the charge of that part of the stock myself—he said he had purchased 200 of the society on Saturday last, and that one of the hundred, contained a mixture of the number published on the 21st of December—I asked him how many he supposed there might be of that Monday's publishing; he said be should suppose about fifty; I said, "Do you suppose they exceeded that</p>

               <p>number?"—he said, "I should think not"—I then asked him if such as occurrence ever took place before; he said, "No"—Dyson came into the shop while I was there, and inquired if his book was ready; Paul said, "No"—Dyson had paper open in his hand, which appeared to be as order—I saw Paul again the same day, in the after part, when I was in company with Mr. Lloyd—we both conversed with him—I told him we could not make out respecting the sale of the <hi rend="italic">weekly Visitor</hi>, or how he could posses himself of so many—I said, I could not make out how he could sell twelve dozen to one person, sixteen to another, and two to another, out of fifty numbers—he said it was very strange, he thought it was impossible—I told him I could bring evidence to prove that he had done so—he said it was very singular—Mr. Lloyd asked him whether he knew Dyson, he said, "Yes"—he then asked if he had had any business transactions with him, he said, "No"—I remember Dyson being given into custody—on Monday, the 21st, Mr. Lloyd asked the prisoner what Dyson came for; he said he came for a novel, and know where Dyson lived—I was present when his house was searched—this paper was found there—I missed 2, 200 <hi rend="italic">Weekly Visitors</hi>—that was 1, 100 of No.179, published on the 21st, of December, and 1, 100 of the following week—they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 100.</p>

On saturday, the 19th of December, Mr. Brittain brought me twenty-seven <hi rend="italic">weekly Visitors</hi>, which he stated he had brought of Paul—these are the publications—they all bear the date of the 22nd of December—they would be in course of publication by the society, to the trade, on Monday morning—on Monday, the 21st, a mes<lb/>sage was sent to Paul's shop, and he came in the evening, between six and eight—Mr. Jones, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Dix, and myself, were there—I heard all the questions that were put—Mr.Paul was asked to account for selling the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Visitors</hi> on the saturday—he replied, that he had sent a lad to pur<lb/>chase two hundred of the preceding week, and that one of the bundles con<lb/>tained fifty of that week, and fifty of that succeeding week—he was asked whom he sent to buy them—he replied, "A lad who came into my shop"—being asked what lad, he said, he did not know, but would inquire—he was going away, after about half an hour's interview, and promising to produce the lad, if he could, and throw light on the investigation that he knew was then going on—he was asked where he bought these numbers, but not by me—I was asked if I had any observation to make—I said, "we ought not to request of Mr.Paul to make the inquiry, but to require it of him for no Jury would believe the fact, that he was in the habit of sending boys whom he did not know to purchase his goods"—I said, "We do not want more information than Mr.Paul can at this moment give us no object can therefore be attained by delay;" and, addressing Mr.Paul, I said, "Two things, sir, are certain: the one is, that we have been robbed; the other is, that you have received the goods"—I should say, that during the conversation, Mr. Paul had been reminded that sales of fourteen dosen, twelve dozen, and other sales, could be provided against him; and I asked him, how he could account for such large sales, since he had admitted that he only had fifty by mistake that week, and that such an error had not oc<lb/>curred before?—he said, it was impossible—he was asked, in the course of</p>

I was in the Earl of Chatham public-house on the 29th of Decem<lb/>ber, and saw the prisoner there—I had a pair of boots in the tap-room; and about half an hour after I had seen them safe, I missed them—I had been to my work in the mean time—I had left the prisoner and another woman there, and an artillery-man—I went, about four o'clock, to Mrs. Miller's in High-street—I asked Mrs. Miller if she had a pair of cossack boots which she thought would fit me—she said she thought she had, and brought me my own—I tried them on, and said I thought they would do—the prisoner was sitting by the fire—I fetched the constable, who apprehended her—I had purchased them the Saturday previous, and lost them on Tuesday—I had worn them in the mean time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Henry Cox, soap—maker, in Goswell-street. On the 23rd if December I went to a shop with half a ton of soap—I received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half-crowns—I put the copper into one of the soap-boxes—it was in five-shilling par<lb/>cels—I went on to Blackfriar's-bridge—I there looked back, and saw the pri<lb/>soner in my waggon, putting his hand into the box, and taking a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. parcel in his hand, he handed it out to another lad, who was by the side of the wag<lb/>gon</p>

               <p>I stopped my horses as quickly as I could, and came behind—I caught the prisoner at the time he was stepping out of the tail of the waggon—I asked what he wanted there—he said he was only going to have a ride—I said I would not let him go till I had got a policeman—I gave him to a gentleman—he got away six or seven yards, and was caught again—he got away again, and was again caught—I did not find any money at that time—I counted the money in the box at the station—house, and there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short out of the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper.</p>
