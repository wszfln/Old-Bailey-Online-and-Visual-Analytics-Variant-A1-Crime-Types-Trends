I never saw him again until a fortnight afterwards, when I had a warrant out against him for striking me - I then took him to Bow-street, and he was committed for want of bail; I missed these goods, and my wife, on my return home again in the evening of the 29th of October.</p>
               <p>(Upon a further investigation of this case, it appeared that the prosecutor's wife had assisted the prisoner in carrying off the property in question, and had cohabited with him from the time of his absconding until his apprehension.)</p>
               <p>Upon an objection taken by Mr. ARABIN, on the part of the prisoner,</p>
               <p>THE COURT ruled, That no person could be convicted of a felony, alleged in stealing goods, where such goods came into his possession by the delivery of the proprietor's wife.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. On the 5th of November, about one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner at the bar, with a coat under his arm, on the left-hand side of Lincoln's-inn-fields, coming from Great Queen-street into Holborn-knowing him before, I turned round and looked after him; observing that he saw I was looking after him, I turned about and followed him; he mended his pace, and seeing I was following him, he threw the coat over the iron railing into the front court of one of the houses in Lincoln's-inn-fields; I picked it up, followed, and secured him. I have reason to think that he knew I was an officer. When I took him into custody, he said, "What do you want with me? I have done nothing." I asked him what he ran away for, if he had done nothing? He said, "a gentleman gave me that coat to carry to the George and Blue Boar, in Holborn, and gave me two shillings." I asked him where the money was, but he said the gentleman had not paid him.</p>

As soon as I recovered myself I saw several people about me. I got to the railing opposite the Abbey, as soon as I could, and had much to do to stand; I supported myself by the railing, and then I observed the prisoner, Pickett, take hold of my arm, saying, he would see me home, if I would go, I refused; that is all I know. I had been drinking, but was perfectly sensible before I received the blow.</p>

            . As I was coming home I saw Mr. Perry holding by the rails that inclose the green, and the prisoner, Pickett, attempting to release his hands from them-which he did, and Mr. Perry crossed over to some wood rails, nearly opposite - He caught hold of them, and then the prisoner, Pickett, crossed over too, and appeared to endeavour to release his hands from the wooden rails, but Mr. Perry held the rails so tight that he could not do it; I also attempted to release his hands, but he would not let me. A short time after that I saw the prisoner, Pickett, pull the watch from Mr. Perry's pocket - He pulled it up in a very forcible way, and could hardly get it out. There was a great number of costermongers standing about; I saw him deliver it to the other prisoner, Wood, who was close to his elbow. Perry was at this time close to the rails - I believe he was in liquor; then Wood walked round to the other side of Perry, and gave Pickett the watch back again, he then put it into his great coat pocket, and they both crossed over towards Tothill-street; I followed them half-way up Tothill-street, and then Wood returned - I lost Picket - I do not know where he went to, and I also missed Wood. The next morning I saw Pickett passing by the shoemaker's, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WOOD. Was it light enough to see me - A. Yes; I was close by the side of you; there were gaslights on the other side - I knew both the prisoners before, by sight, and also the name of Wood.</p>

When I returned I met the prisoner nearly on the last step of the stairs, coming down; as I had lodgers up stairs, I asked her if she had been up to any of them, but before she could answer me one of the lodgers came down behind her; I asked him if he knew the prisoner, and he said he did not. As I saw she had a bundle in her apron, and observed the corner of the coat, which I knew, sticking out, I shoved her into the parlour, and sent for an officer - We found the coat and sheet in her apron. When I went out I left them in the bed-room. When the prisoner was taken into custody I went up stairs, and saw that both sheets had been dragged off the bed, but she had dropped one in the room. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

I do not know whether she carried what I saw her with out again; I saw her go out, but her back was towards me.</p>

I remember the prisoner, James Alder, coming to me on the Friday night; he asked me if I had seen old Mrs. Wilson, for he wanted to see Sarah Wilson, the prisoner; it was a week after the robbery, all but one day. I asked him how his sister got on; he said, if there was no more property found on her than the seal, she would he turned up. On the Monday following he came to me and said,"Bush, I have seen Sal. Wilson, and she says there is a watch and a broach buried in your cellar, and Mrs. Brothers will not let me in." I said, "I am going down presently for some water, you shall go with me, and have a light." He went down, I went with him, and took a small shovel with me, from my own fireside - He dug in three different places, but found nothing. I do not think he ever went there again.</p>

I then came from the place where I was concealed, and took hold of him, about twenty yards from Mr. Appleby's shop - I was in the alley, at the back of Slanghter's Coffee-house, where he could not see me. I took him with one hand, and laid hold of his apron with the other, and took him back to Mr. Appleby's shop-the pelisse was in his apron. Miss Wheeler was in the shop, but no other person.</p>

I had never left the shop, but had been at the other end, and did not miss it before Gooke brought the prisoner in. There was no other person in the shop besides me. The pelisse is worth 25s.</p>

I desired her to shut the door immediately, and went up to the prisoner, took her by the arm, and found a coat and a pair of sheets under her arm. I asked her what her business was there? she said she was a poor distressed woman, and came in to speak to the housekeeper. I asked her why she did not inquire for her, but she made me no answer. I then asked her what possessed her to do so; she said she was a poor deranged woman, and begged I would pardon her.</p>

I am toll-collector at the turnpike near Mr. Kater's house; I saw three men near the house, the prisoners, who were two of them, went into the front garden together; Nightingale then came out of the garden into the road, and Allen went into the house, he stopped there about ten minutes; both the gate and door were shut - He opened them, and went in; he had nothing with him when he went in, but when he came out he had the tail of his coat up-the other prisoner was loitering outside. They then both went in to the middle of the road and ran up Nottingham-place; I immediately gave information to the servant. I have seen both the prisoners often up that road, selling wood, with a donkey. They were pursued but not taken at that time. I gave a description of them to the gentleman, as well as to the constable; I went with him in the evening, and saw them both drinking in a public-house, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>

We occupied the shop, parlour, one room on the second-floor, and the garrett. On the 24th of December last, I shook up my bed and left it; I did not go up again until seven o'clock in the evening; I left the room, with my bed clothes, and every thing else, quite safe. I do not know as to the door; I generally lock it, but am not certain that I locked it at that time, I took the key out of it as though it was locked; it shuts and catches with a brass handle - I can say it was shut and latched, and the articles stated in the indictment were in the room. I left the room at twelve o'clock. On going up stairs and putting the key in the door, I found it was unlocked, and missed the box with the articles already enumerated. I told my husband of it, and gave them up as lost until I saw them advertized in the paper.</p>

On the 24th of December, about a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon, I received information, and went to Vine-street, Chandos-street, to a one pair of stairs back-room; I found the door fast, and knocked, the persons within refused to open it; I forced it open, and found the prisoners, and

               <p>SARAH PERRY. I live in Vine-street, Covent-garden, at the house which Edwards has spoken of. I asked the prisoner, Daniels, to drink tea with me about a quarter before three o'clock; I never saw the other prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the other prisoner before to-day - A. I saw him on the 24th of December; I went out, and when I returned I found him in the room; I do not know how he came there - I had been out for some butter, when I returned the box was in the chair, I had not seen it there before-it was open. I did not hear the prisoners say any thing about it. Just as I got up the stairs the officers came in at the door, and I went in and locked the door. I did not see what was in the box, but the things were on the ground; the officer said they were counterpanes and sheets. I never saw the prisoner, Smith, before that day, and asked him how he came in my room. I had invited Daniels to tea that morning.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DANIELS'S Defence. Perry asked me to tea; I was going there, and met the prisoner, Smith, with a box, which, he said, he was going to take to the Golden Cross; I told him after he had been there to come to tea at Perry's, as I was going there. He came and said he had let the box fall, and wanted to replace the things. The officer burst open the door before I could open it.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. A man asked me to carry the box; I carried it as far as Crown-street, where I met Daniels.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140008"/>I lost the man who gave it to me to carry. I pitched the box at the bottom of St. Martin's-lane, the lock broke open, and I took it to the house to replace the things.</p>

On the night of the 4th of December I put the horses up in the yard, and fastened the gate at eight o'clock, the bay gelding was safe then. I returned next morning, about a quarter before six o'clock, and the gelding was gone-it came home afterwards. I am certain it was my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Godstone is about twenty-two or twenty-three miles from Smithfield. There were four horses in the yard at night, and I only found three there the next morning. My master has had the gelding ten years; I have lived six years and a half with him, and have had the care of the gelding during that time, and knew it again.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COOPER. I am servant to Mr. Pennington. On the 5th of December, about five o'clock in the morning, I went to my master's premises, the yard gate stood open, there are two yard gates-the horses were in the corn-yard; the gelding was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have seen the horse since; it has a white foot, and a bald face; I should know it among a thousand.</p>

             MOORE. I manage Mr. Pennington's farm for him, he is the only occupier of it. Hook informed me that the gelding was gone, and I immediately came to London; I have known the horse about eighteen months; I saw it again in Giltspur-street, in the possession of John Ayres. After some conversation with him about it, the prisoner, Wood, came up, I asked him if he was the owner of the horse, he said, Yes. I asked the price, he said 24l. I told him it was too much, and asked him its age; he said it was six years old. I told him it was more; he said it was not more than seven. He then offered it to me for 23l. I said it was too much.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say any thing more about the horse-A. He said he knew it very well, and would put it into a cart to shew me how it would go. He said it was a Suffolk bred horse. I went for a constable, and on my return I met Ayres, leading the horse, in Smithfield, and Wood near him. I asked Wood if he would take 20l. for it - He said 22l. was the lowest-the constable came and took him, and I gave the landlord charge of the horse. After the examination before the magistrate I took the horse back into the country, the two witnesses saw it-it was the same horse. When I got into the country, I and Jones went and apprehended the prisoner, Vale, at Heaver, in Kent, on a Sunday, where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw the prisoner, Wood, until I saw him in Smithfield. I went up to him as if I meant to buy the horse-it stood alone, in the care of Ayres. Wood asked 24l. for it. I was gone about twenty-five minutes for the constable, I returned, and talked with him again about the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you give him any reason, at first, to suppose you suspected him - A. None at all.</p>

            . I assist the hostler at the Green Dragon, in Smithfield. On the 5th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the horse in the stable, I did not see the man bring it in, but I saw the prisoners in conversation about it. Wood asked me to go and have something to drink with him, and took me to the Denmark's Head, in the Old Bailey-Vale was there. Wood asked me what time the horse-market began; I told him about one or two o'clock, and not before. He said he had bought the horse of Vale, and wished to sell it again-Vale was present. Wood said he gave Vale 18l.10s. for it; he then put his hand into his pocket, and said, I have got to give you two shillings to make up the 18l. 10s., and he gave him two shillings-Vale took it. I asked Vale who he bought the horse of; he said he bought it coming along the road that morning. I asked him if he knew the man of whom he bought it, he said no, only that he told him his name was

            . I told him I thought it was a stolen horse, and if it was, I thought he had brought it to a very likely market to have it owned. Wood asked me to lead the horse into the market for him, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble - I said I would; he then told me to get him ready, and tie his tail up to take him into the market. We came out of the public-house, Vale asked the way to Pimlico, I told him, and they both went down the Old Bailey. I did not see Wood again until he came to have the horse in the market, at the time Mr. Moore was asking me the price of it - I heard him ask the price. He has spoken correctly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I am not much acquainted with horse selling. I was not in the way when the horse came. Wood took me out of the stable to the Old Bailey, he seemed anxious to sell the horse; he said he bought it of Vale, Vale set close to me and heard him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I do not know who brought the horse, I first saw Wood at a little after seven o'clock; we found Vale in the Old Bailey; I had a bad opinion of the business, and said, before them both, that I thought if it was prigged, he had brought it to a wrong place. After this Wood still went to Smithfield with me - He never attempted to go away; when Moore came I called him to me, and he was taken. Wood said he bought it of Vale before and after I had said I thought it was stolen, and still desired me to take it to Smithfield.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Green Dragon, in Giltspur-street. On the morning of the 5th of December, the prisoner, Vale, alone, brought the gelding; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140009"/>opening the gates to let a waggon in, about a quarter to six o'clock - He called for the hostler, and I answered; he said he wanted to put the horse in the stable to bait; I shewed him the way - He led it in, and tied it up himself. Wood came about seven o'clock, looked at the horse, and had him ran up and down the yard; he asked Vale if he,(Vale,) was not the man who bought the horse that morning, he said he was. I asked Vale if the horse was for sale, he said, Yes. I asked him if he knew who he bought it of? he said the man told him his name, but he did not know where he lived - He did not tell me his name; he said he bought it at Kennington turnpike, coming to town. After that he went into the yard, and returned in about half an hour, Wood had not been then; he ordered his horse a quartern of corn, which I gave him. Wood came down as if he was a stranger, and asked the questions which I related before; he said, "you are the man who bought the horse, if you had not bought it I should." I said, "if you will give him something for his bargain, he will let you have it." They appeared to be strangers to each other. They talked together; the horse was ran up and down the yard, and afterwards taken into the stable again. I did not hear them make any agreement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You told all this before the magistrate-A. Yes; I will not say I told it word for word. No person has been talking to me about it. Wood is not the man who brought the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You said Vale was the man-A. I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have sworn before the magistrate that the person who was dressed as Vale was before the magistrate, was the man, what do you believe now of Vale-A. To the best of my belief he is the man; I have not the least doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did the horse appear when it came into the stable - A.It appeared as if it had come off the road, being very thin and dirty. It had a broken halter on.</p>
               <p>JAMES JONES. I am constable of Edenbridge, Kent. I have known the prisoners from their childhood; they lived at Eaver, which is twenty-seven miles from town, and were very well acquainted. Edenbridge is twentysix miles from town. Godstone is between Eaver and London, but not the nearest way. I was applied to on Sunday, the 17th of December, by Moore, and took Vale into custody. I told him I was not certain what the charge was against him. As we were coming to town, he said he did not steal the horse; I had said something about a horse, but I do not remember what. He said he did not take the horse, nor yet sell it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a constable in the neighbourhood. I had not heard of the horse having been stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Wood lived at Edenbridge, and had a very good character; he is a collar maker.</p>

               <p>CHARLES THORNTON. About seven o'clock in the morning, on the 5th of January, I was cleaning the tap-room out, the prisoner came in and asked for a man named Turner. - I told him he had not been there. I went into the sitting-room, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and found the bar-door open, and saw the prisoner on his knees, in the bar, with one hand in the till. I asked him what he did there? he begged of me to say nothing about it. I called the landlord, and he secured him. He found 6s. worth of halfpence on him, and a key.</p>

I saw him on the 18th of October, he came to my master's shop, brought three books, saying, he brought them from his father, and that he lodged in Lisbon-street, Commercial-road, which is about five minutes walk from our house. I lent him twelve shillings upon them. I gave him the money before I heard the books had been lost by Mr. Mann. Five or six weeks after the prisoner pledged the books he came to offer a time-piece. He was disguised. I made an excuse, to detain him while I sent for the prosecutor. I pretended not to know him, and said time-pieces were cumbersome, and I did not like to take them in from strangers. He said, "I am no stranger, you may remember my bringing some books sometime ago;" mentioning these very books, the Bible, in two volumes, and the prayer-book. I asked him if he was the person who pledged them? he said, "Yes, in the name of

I said I would, and according went to the pawnbroker's and asked 1l. on them; they lent me twelve shillings, and I went to the young man, gave him the money, and he gave me a glass of liquor for my trouble.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the bar, and another man with him-they passed his shop repeatedly, and looked into the window several times; at the time the window was broken I stood in a passage nearly opposite, and saw them go up to the window, and heard the window break; the moment I heard it break I crossed the road, seized the prisoner, and took him into custody, the other man ran towards Gray's Ion-lane, but I had not sufficiently seen him to be able to swear to him. I have an opinion in my own mind who it was, but I cannot swear to him. When I took the prisoner into the shop his hand was bleeding a little, at the thumb point, and he had a white handkerchief about it. I took him to Hatton-garden office.</p>

About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 22d of December, I was alarmed by the watchman springing his rattle; I got up and opened the window; he desired me to come down immediately, saying, there were two men in the area. I went down stairs, the watchman still springing his rattle; the men were in the area when I went down, and remained so until the patrol came to the watchman's assistance. It is an area with steps-there is a door to it, and the gate was fast; it has wooden rails round it. The watchman was outside the rails, with a pistol in his hand, which he presented at the men, and swore that if they attempted to move, he would blow their brains out. After they were secured, and we had taken them to the watch-house, we examined the premises. In the road proceeding to the watch-house, the prisoner, Bailey, endeavoured to relieve himself of a centre-bit which was concealed under his coat, by droping it, but the watchman caught it before it fell to the ground. On our arrival at the watch-house both the prisoners were searched, and we found a phosphorous box on the prisoner Bailey, who wished to extricate himself from it, but his trowsers were too tight, and it would not pass at the knee. We returned to the premises and examined them. On searching the cellar, which was open into the area, we found a crow-bar, with a candle, and a short knife, sharpened at both edges. On examining the window we found the lower square of glass in the middle, above the division of the sash, was broken, and the latch which fastened the lower part of the sash down, had been pushed back, and the lower part of the sash thrown up as far as it would go, and a hole made in the shutter with the centre-bit. The piece of wood was not actually cut out, but it had been in the progress of being taken out. They could not have got at that part of the shutter without first breaking the pane of glass, and undoing the latch. The shutter is about two inches from the glass of the window; the pane that was broken was in the middle, but the second from the top, and the third from the bottom. The incision in the shutter was not opposite that pane which had been broken.</p>

            . I was last up in the house the night previous. It was about twelve o'clock when I went to bed. I fastened the kitchen window about five o'clock in the evening-my duty was in the kitchen-there is only one window in it; the shutter was fastened in the inside with a bar which latches, and the window fastens with a book which hitches. After I had fastened it I tried if it was fast, by pushing it up, and it would not go up. I did not remain in the kitchen all the evening, for I went to church; when I came home the window was in the same state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I did not examine the window when I came from church; the bar on the inside appeared just as it was when I went out.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. My way home from church was past that window, and if it had been thrown up I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOOTE. The shutter was nearly close to the window, and the fastening on the inside of the shutter was as it had been left, but a pane of glass broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where the mark of this machine was, was it opposite the pane of glass that was broken, or where the window was thrown up - A. Where the window was thrown up, at the lower part.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEEPER. I am a watchman. I was going my rounds about two o'clock on the night in question, and turning the corner of York-place I saw a man lottering about; I stepped back to the railing, the person then proceeded on about eleven houses, when he had got nearly halfway he made a motion as if to evacuate, and when I got very near him he gave me the meeting. I stopped about Mr. Boote's place for a short time, and heard a great noise in the area, I looked about and saw that Mr. Boote's garden gate was not as I had left it at one o'clock. I then went in at the gate, up to the area railing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140013"/>and looking over the railings I saw two men, one of whom was apparently very busy, doing something at the area window. I immediately drew out my pistol, cocked it, levelled it at them, and threatened to shoot the first person that attempted to move either up or down. In the mean time I sprang my rattle, and was at least twenty minutes springing it, with the pistol in my right hand. While I was springing my rattle the patrol came up, drew his cutlass, and held it over the prisoners, while I got over the area rails and secured them. When we had secured them, I and the patrol entered the kitchen - I cannot say who opened the door. From thence we proceeded to the watch-house, and when we got about half way, the patrol tapped me on the shoulder, and also tapped Bailey on the shoulder, finding something was there, and said,"That is a pistol, I suppose." When it was about his middle I caught it in falling-it was the centre-bit. I am quite sure it fell from him. When we came to the watchhouse, the watch-house-keeper searched him, and took a box of phosphorus out of his trowsers, it was half way down to the knee. I returned to the house, but did not try the centre-bit at the window. I found a crow bar. The premises were found as Mr. Boote has described them. The candle was picked up under the steps where the prisoners stood, and this knife, in a leather case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Spencer was standing at the back of Bailey, who was within four or five steps of the bottom - He appeared to be busy with his hands. I did not see him doing any thing with the centre-bit, but I believe he had it. He was four or five steps from the bottom of the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his hands would be some distance from the shutter - A. The window is about up to a man's middle from the area bottom.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. The place where he stood on the ladder would be most convenient for him to work with the bit on the shutter.</p>

             M'GEE. I am patrole of Kensington. I heard the rattle sprung, and went to the assistance of the watchman.

            . I am the watch-house keeper. I went the next day, and tried the centre-bit to the window it fitted exactly, and one more turn would have taken the bit out. I have kept these things ever since.</p>
               <p>(MR. ADOLPHUS objected, that though there was a breaking in this case, there was not a sufficient entering to constitute a felony. The objection was left for the decision of the Twelve Judges.)</p>
               <p>BAILEY'S Defence. I was coming along York-place, saw two men come out of the gate, and said to Spencer,"Here are two men coming out, it does not look well." We then went down into the area, found the centre-bit and phosphorus-box, and before we could well bring them out the watchman came.</p>

There were several persons drinking there. When I went out, three persons followed me-the prisoner, Scott, was one of them. As soon as I got a few yards from the house, he took hold of me by the side, and took my money out of my pocket, which I tried to prevent; he laid hold of me behind, and put his arm round me-Chapman was also about me. He felt me, to try if I had a watch, or any thing of that kind, and then struck me a blow between my eyes, which knocked me down. I immediately called out,"Watch! I am robbed!" The patrol came up: I thought they had got my hat also, but that was on the ground. When I came to the door, I found Scott in the custody of the patrol. We all went back again into the house, Chapman was sitting there. I am sure both the prisoners were the persons who robbed me - They had been forcing their conversation on me before in the house. They took from me half a sovereign, a 3s. piece, one shilling, a sixpence, and three halfpence; I was perfectly sober, and had drank only two pints of porter and some tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was not in any bad company that night. I do not know two girls of the town of the names of Fortica and Richards-there were women of the town in the room; one of them came to me, and asked me for sixpence to buy a quartern of gin; I asked her why she supposed I should give it her? - I at last gave her sixpence, they then brought the quartern of gin to me, and wanted me to drink, but I would not. The blow that was given me was after I lost my purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I always swore that Chapman was one; he was taken from the public-house. Scott was taken to the watch-house first.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Seven Star-court on the night of the robbery, crying the hour of one, and heard the captain cry out that he was robbed, at the same time, the prisoner, Scott, and another man, ran against me. I called out to the patrol, "I believe the thieves are gone up Seven Star-court." I had seen Scott about the neighbourhood, and am sure he is one of the men who ran by me. I had heard something like a blow, but could not make out what it was until I heard the captain cry out he was robbed. I saw the captain on the ground, and pursued the thieves - I saw him again in about ten minutes; Scott made a little round, and came back again into Seven Star-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I went to the watch-house with him when he was taken-Chapman did not go with him the first time, but we came back for him. The captain was sober.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 13th of December Tarson told me of the robbery; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140014"/>went through Seven Star-court and stopped Scott - He was running, and another man passed by me just as I stopped Scott - A stout man with a dark dress on; I cannot say I should know the man. We went to the Seven Stars, public-house. I took him there, and found the captain outside the door; he was making for the door, I believe. The prosecutor swore to Scott directly as the man who robbed him. The captain's nose was bleeding, he had received a blow between the eyes. He pointed to Chapman, who was in the house, as the other man - He was sitting down. He did that before Scott was taken to the watch-house - I did not take Chapman at that time. The landlord said he would be answerable for the appearance of Chapman for 50l. When Scott was in the watch-house, he seemed grieved because Chapman was not brought with him; we then went back and fetched Chapman. A man of the name of Burt gave in a canvas purse, containing the money in question. The captain did not appear to be in liquor, he was confused from the blow, A woman came, who used to cohabit with Scott; I have seen her with him.</p>

            . I was in company with Simmonds that night, when he laid hold of Scott. I found the purse in Seven Star-court, with the money in it. The captain said he believed Chapman was another one; that was before we took Scott to the watch-house. The captain's nose was cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Chapman was sitting down smoking his pipe - We went away, and left him there. There was a shortish man run by us when we were taking Scott - He run back to the public-house by the back-way-there is a back-way. I did not see any women running at the time Scott was laid hold of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SCOTT. Q. Was I not running towards the public-house when you stopped me - A. He was running towards the Seven Stars public-house; but there are many turnings, and he had been all round.</p>
               <p>SCOTT'S Defence. I was running up the court facing the house, and was stopped by the patrol, but know nothing of the robbery. It is not likely that if I had done the robbery. I should be going towards where it was done.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. Scott was brought in first, by the patrol and the watchman, and the prosecutor came in with them. The patrol said that there was another at the public-house, but that the publican was answerable for him - I told him that could not be, as it was a highway robbery. Accordingly, I went down, and brought him up. When Chapman was produced, the prosecutor said he could not take upon himself to swear to him, but, to the best of his belief, he was one of them.</p>

On Sunday, November the 9th, there was a pocket-book in the till, which contained three guineas, two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a half-guinea, a 7s. piece, 5l. 13s. in silver, eleven 1l. bank notes, and a banker's draft for 19l. 14s. I lost it out of the till - I saw it safe at half-past six o'clock in the evening, and missed it between nine and ten. I produce the pocket-book which contained the money-Mr. Hickman gave it to me. The next day Duproy was taken into custody.</p>

            . I have been examined here before. I lived next door to the prisoner - I knew him before the 9th of November; I have known Seymour ever since Bowfair. On Sunday, the 9th of November, I met the prisoner Bennet, about six o'clock in the evening, in Brick-lane-Seymour was with him, they both met me; Bennet asked me to go and take a walk with him up Whitechapel - I asked where to? and said, I was going to chapel - He said, "never mind," I said, I would go with him. I did not then know what I was going to do; they took me up by Aldgate, and kept walking about from the five lamps towards the watch-house - I did not know what I was going to do. Bennet said, "I will go in, and buy a halfpenny worth of horehound." We were then opposite Mr. Key's shop; he went in, and brought out some horehound; Seymour told Bennet that there were some notes, as he had watched them on Saturday night, and saw them put them in the till, and told him to go in-Bennet said,"Is there? I will go in;" he pulled off Munroe's hat directly, put it on, and went in, and brought out a pocketbook, and gave it to Seymour, who was at the door. I and Munroe were walking backwards and forwards-Munroe had joined us in Whitechapel-Bennet walked on the other side of the way. Seymour told me and Munroe to come on and follow him; he took us to his house in George-street, which is near Wentworth-street. When we got there, we found Bennet there; he and Seymour divided the money out of the pocket-book; there was some bank notes, guineas, and silver, there was a great deal of silver; they gave me some notes. After they had parted the money, Seymour and Munroe threw the pocketbook away by the sugar-baker's, near Seymour's house. Before I left Seymour's house, he took my share away from me; I slept at Seymour's house that night, and went out with him next morning about seven o'clock. - He took me to a hatter's, and bought a hat for each of us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140015"/>which came to 17s.; he had a 3s. piece in change for a 1l. note. I returned home to Seymour's, and went out again with him to a clothes shop, near Black Lion-yard, and to other places, and laid out part of the money. - (Looks at a pocket-book.)-This is the one, I know it by the reading on it-it is the pocket-book that was thrown away opposite George-street, in Wentworth-street - Bennet, Seymour, and Munroe threw it away.</p>

             FARR re-examined. It is the pocket-book which contained the notes and silver-there was more than 40l. in it. I was present when the prisoner was examined at the Mansion-house; the Lord Mayor asked him what he had to say - He was neither threatened or promised - He denied taking it, and said Duproy took it out - He said that he was one of the party, and received part of the stolen property, but denied taking it. This was after Duproy had charged him with being one of the party.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman. I was going along Cheapside, about half-past five o'clock on the 9th of December, and saw the prisoner rush from the pavement with such great violence, that he ran against a cart, and knocked himself down. I went towards him to help him up; before I got to him he was up, and looking for his hat, which had fallen off. I told him it was under the horses' feet - He got under their bellies; I saw a bundle in his hand, part of it dragged on the ground. I told him he was a thief, and run round the horses to take him; he run off, and left his hat behind, which I picked up, and pursued him, calling "Stop thief!" When I got to Milk-street, he threw the bundle down - I picked it up, it was a piece of print. He was taken in Milk-street.</p>

On Monday morning last, the 12th of January, a little after nine o'clock, I was in bed unwell, and heard the report of fire-arms so close together, that I apprehended some gentlemen were fighting a duel. I opened my window, and saw four gentlemen in the field opposite my house; two stood at stationary distances, and two together on the left of them; they were about twelve or thirteen yards apart. I dressed myself as fast as possible; they were fifty yards or more from my house; it was not a clear morning. Just as I got over the field-gate I heard the report of two other pistols, and saw one of the gentlemen make a kind of a turn, which induced me to suppose he had been hit; the other gentlemen immediately run to him, he took hold of two of their arms, and all four advanced towards me. My intention was to stop them if I had been in time. When I met them, the deceased had got his waistcoat and pantaloons unbuttoned; I have since learned his name is 
               <persName id="t18180114-39-person333">

            . I observed to them that it was an unfortunate affair; one of them said "Yes, it is; it was not our quarrel originally, we are all friends;" they all assented to what he said. They said they were to be seconds the preceding morning in another quarrel, which occasioned this; they anxiously enquired for a house where they could take the deceased - I offered mine, they took him there; they also anxiously enquired if a surgeon could be immediately obtained for the gentleman; I directly sent to Hampstead for Mr. Rodd. Mr. Bailey was taken into my parlour, and placed on a sofa. In about half an hour Mr. Rodd came; the deceased was still alive; Mr. Rodd extracted a ball from his left side. Before Mr. Rodd came, and soon after he was placed on the sofa, he called Mr. O'Callaghan to him; he appeared in great agony; he desired him to shake hands with him, stating that he freely forgave him, that every thing had been conducted most honourably, and asked him, if he had been in his place, would he have done so? Mr. O'Callaghan replied, "Yes, my dear fellow, I wish I had been wounded instead of you; I felt your first ball about my legs, I wish it had taken effect, for that would have put a stop to it - I wish I had been wounded." Mr.O'Callaghan exhibited his trowsers, which were both cut through at the legs, and one of his boots, apparently by a ball. After that Mr. O'Callaghan went to Hampstead, to procure a coach; he brought one, and afterwards went to Chalk Farm, with Mr. Newbold, to get Mr. Bailey a lodging. After Mr. Rodd had examined and found Mr. Bailey in a dangerous state, he advised him, if he had any thing to communicate, to see his friends; he named Mr. Phelan; we left him with him-about ten minutes after which, Mr. Phelan went to twon, to execute some commissions for him; after which I asked Mr. Phelan, and the other prisoners, if they meant to meet the thing? Mr. Bailey being under apprehension, and having declared in their presence, that he could not live, Mr. Rodd had also declared it in their presence-the prisoners were all fully aware of the dangerous situation of the deceased; I asked them if they meant to meet it? they all replied,"Most certainly," and wrote me their names and addresses themselves. I sent for an officer, two of them surrendered, and so did Mr. Phelan when he returned from town; they had said they meant to meet it before he went to town. About two hours after the first shaking hands between the deceased and Mr. O'Callaghan, he called Mr. O'C. to him again, desiring him to take his hand and rub it in a particular position, as he found ease from it; he did so for a considerable time, and then the other prisoners did the same; all of them shewed every possible attention to him, and appeared exceedingly affected; Mr. Newbold cried bitterly; the other two shed tears. Mr. Bailey lived three or four hours, and then died.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not something else said by the deceased in the course of the morning - A. Yes; he said, "God bless you all, and I thank you for your attention." I did not see the hands that fired the two first shots; the second time that I heard the report, as I was getting over the gate, I saw smoke about two or three hundred yards up in the air-it came from the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any person actually fire any pistol - A. Before I left my room, I saw a pistol fired over the hedge, quite away from every body - I was not near enough to see who fired it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw the pistol fired over the hedge, did you see any thing else - A. When I saw the four persons I observed nothing particular till I got into the field myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period was it that you saw two persons at stationary distances, and two together on the left flank - A. Just as I got over the gate, not before; I then saw two retire, and two go to particular distances; this was before I heard the report of the two last pistols. I afterwards found two pistols lying on my table, with a powder-flask and bullet-mould.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. NOWLAND. Q. Did not they say none of them were to blame - A. They did, and the deceased said so several times. Mr. Bailey mentioned the persons who were to blame; he said the quarrol originated with those persons whom he named.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hampstead. I was called upon to go to Mr. Adams's on the 12th of January; I got there soon after ten o'clock in the morning, and found Mr. Bailey on the sofa, with his right side bloody; he said he considered himself near death, and I told him so myself; shortly after I extracted a ball from his left side. After his death I opened him, and found the ball had penetrated the intestimes in three different places; in my judgment, the appearances were sufficient, and did undoubtedly cause his death. After I extracted the ball, I asked him if every thing had been fair between them? he said, "decidedly so." I then told him if he had any thing to communicate to any private friend, he had better do it; he selected Mr. Phelan - I left the room. Shortly after Mr. O'Callaghan was present, and cought hold of the deceased's hand, and held it up; the deceased requested him to hold it still higher, as it afforded him considerable ease. From the nature of the wound it would give him case-it relaxed the surface of the muscles. He said, "God bless you, I thank you all for your attention;" Mr. O'Callaghan then said, "I hope, my dear fellow, we shall be walking together again in three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140018"/>weeks;" the deceased said,"No, I shall be in Heaven before then." I received all the assistance possible from the three prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Was their attention uniformly kind - A.Perfectly so; the greatest anxiety was shewn by them all to render every assistance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. While you were in the room, was every possible attention shewn by the prisoners towards the deceased-A. There is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>O'CALLAGHAN'S Defence, (written.)

On the 21st of December I missed an ewe sheep between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I had seen it on the 20th at noon; I went to the prisoner, White's, house in the evening of the 21st, near Harrow-weald Common, with Howell, the constable, and found the whole of a sheep, except two breasts and one leg, hanging up in a room at the top of the stairs; it was cut up into joints - I found the head in a cupboard below. White was not at home-in about half an hour he came to the door with a beatle on his back; Howell and Clark came in and secured him, and told him we had found the meat at the house; he said we might find the sheep-skin on Harrow-weald Common, among some furze-he took us there, and shewed it us; I have got it here, and know it to be my master's, by the mark on the left hip, which I put on it myself.</p>

The prisoners came into my shop, and asked for some yellow and red ribbons to make bows for their horses - I shewed them a box of ribbons-Williams put his hand across the box, and asked the price of a piece - I told him it was 7d. a yard, and the others were 2d.; he put his hand across the box again, and took another piece; I told him that the seven-penny ribbon was not the sort he wanted. I did not like their appearance, and put the box on the stool behind me. They asked for patterns - I cut them some to get rid of them. Williams said he supposed I could take a halfpenny a yard off if they had a whold piece, which his master would have - I told him I could not. The instant they were gone I missed two pieces of ribbon, which cost 29s. - I am sure they were there when they came in. On Saturday they came again; Williams said they wanted six yards of two-penny ribbon, which they had taken the patterns of the Wednesday before; I told my husband that the two fellows were come again. When Williams saw my husband coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140019"/>out he said, "Come, we can go to another shop, they don't seem inclined to serve us." A friend, who was in the shop, followed and brought them back; we shut the door, and sent for an officer - We told them they had stolen the ribbons on the Wednesday; Perkins said, "Well, we will pay for them, rather than have a piece of work-leave 10s. for them." Williams immediately pulled out some silver and four gold rings, and offered to leave them to pay for the ribbons. When the shop was shut up at night, we found a piece of ribbon behind the shutter, which was not ours.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I am certain they are the men; my servant was in the parlour when they came in the shop the first time - You can see out of the parlour into the shop.</p>

I followed her down White Hart-yard, took hold of her arm, and said, "Caroline!" which was the name she went by at our house. She said, her name was not Caroline. I said she was the person who robbed Mrs. Bunting; she said I was mistaken, and wished me to go home with her. I took her into two shops, and begged of them to get an officer - They would not. I took her to Bow-street myself, and gave her in charge. There was a cap and a pair of stockings in her bag, which Mrs. Bunting claimed.</p>

            's house. On the 2d of December the prisoner came to lodge with me - She slept with me that night and the next. On the 4th of December I went out about twelve o'clock, and left her ironing my things-some were my own, and others I had taken in to wash; she said she would iron them for me - I left no person there but her. I returned at nine o'clock, and found my place covered with rags; my drawers, boxes, and every place were open, every thing off my bed, and all that I was possessed of taken away. I never saw her afterwards till she was at Bow-street. I found nothing of mine there except a silk handkerchief, which she had round her neck. I found eight gowns, twenty napkins, three handkerchiefs, two petticoats, a mustard-pot, a jug, ten caps, a tea-chest, a pair of sugar-tongs, a shawl, a cloak, a pair of ear-rings and a piece of lace, at the different pawnbrokers, who gave them up-the articles were worth 3l. 1ls. When I saw her at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140020"/>office, I told her it was a very hard case, as she knew my husband was dead. I claimed the handkerchief on her neck-she said it was mine, and gave it to me. I asked her where the other things were? she gave me the duplicates of some of them-she did not deny it.</p>

            . I am a wine-merchant, and live in the Haymarket. Lord Colerain requested that a horse might be put up at Tattersall's in my name; it was put there for sale on the 17th of November-the next day the prisoner called on me and asked the price of it. After some conversation, I agreed to take 28l. for it-the prisoner desired it might be sent to his stables, in Landsdown-mews, Guildford-street-he was to pay for it on delivery. I sent it by Lord Colerain's servant, and ordered him not to leave it without the money. About five o'clock in the evening the prisoner and servant came to me; the prisoner produced a cheque to settle for the horse. I told him it was not dated-he said the bankers were not open that day, and it would not be paid that day. He went away with the servant, saying he would get the money.</p>

            . I am servant to Lord Colerain. On the 17th of November, as I was bringing the horse from Tattersall's, the prisoner stopped me, and said he should like to purchase it - I referred him to Mr. Thomas. After that, Mr. Thomas told me to take it to Mr. Wilson's, in Landsdown-mews, and not to deliver it without the money. I took it on the Wednesday, which was the day the Princess Charlotte was buried, about eleven o'clock. The prisoner said he had not enough money, but had sent his servant to the Bank of England with a cheque - I was to stay till he returned - He returned in about a quarter of an hour after he went out; I saw him go out as I took the horse in. He told the prisoner that the Bank was shut up, and he could not get it. The prisoner said he had not got money enough, but would go to Mr. Thomas with me, which he did, and told him he had sent to the Bank of England with a cheque, and could not get it paid. Mr. Thomas looked at it, and said it was no wonder, as it was not dated. He said, he saw his error, why it was not paid, and would go and rectify it. I went as far as Coventry-street with him; when we got to the corner of Rupert-street, he said, "this is my way, for I have got to be at a place by eleven o'clock," and went away. I set off to Landsdown-mews as fast as possible, found the horse was gone, and have never seen it since. When the officer took the prisoner, he said his name was not Wilson. We went to the Mevy six or seven days before we could find him - We took him on a Sunday. I had not agreed with the prisoner to bring the horse at all - I did not hear him send his servant to the Bank.</p>

On the 5th of January, about half-past one o'clock at night, I was in Newgate-street; the prisoner, Double, accosted me, and asked me to go home with her - She was alone.

She asked me to go up there, I refused-at that instant she put her hand into my breeches pocket, and took out the notes and some silver - I had four 1l. notes in my pocket; I immediately put my hand to my pocket and missed them - I saw no person near her. I seized her, and called watch! at the end of St. Martin's le Grand - He did not come, he must have heard me. At that moment three girls came up, Welch was one of them - I secured her; they all pulled at me as hard as they could, and tried to rescue Double. I was very near letting her go, when another watchman came up. I have never found my notes. I am sure I went no where with her.</p>
               <p>JOHN HEBBERD. I am a watchman of Newgate-street. I heard the prosecutor call, came up, and took DoubleWelch was close by her - He told me to take them both.

The deceased jumped up in a passion, and by some means, the prisoner being in liquor, he fell upon him. They pushed each other about, the prisoner fell, and the deceased fell upon him; they then got up, and the deceased went away; he returned again in a short time, the prisoner was then in his former seat, and they had more words, the prisoner got up, they scuffled together, and the deceased fell against the table - I cannot say whether it was accidental, or whether the prisoner pushed him; the prisoner had not got hold of him - They were both in liquor. There were no blows struck on either side; the deceased's left side went against the table, he did not complain, but went out. I went out also, and saw no more.</p>

            . I was at the public-house; the prisoner was sitting by the fire, the deceased came in, and sat opposite him-the prisoner left his place, and the deceased took it. The prisoner came in again, when they had some words, and scuffled about-there were no blows struck - They both fell, and the prisoner was under the deceased; I got between them to prevent their quarreling. They sat down again and had more words, the deceased fell against the table by his left side, he was not pushed; he said he thought he had hurt his left side; he then went out, and the prisoner sat down. In about five minutes the deceased came to the window, and muttered something.</p>

            . I am the wife of the deceased. I met him at a quarter before three o'clock, returning from the public-house - He was very well before; he complained of being ill - He was leaning against the stile - He said, he had got his death-blow at the Wheatsheaf; he died on the 26th. He was always positive, after this blow, that he should die. He said he got into the man's seat by the fire, that the man came in and said it was his seat; he did not get up immediately; the man collared him, and threw him against the table. He complained of being hurt in his left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140022"/>side. He went to bed directly-he was not the worse for liquor. Next morning he went to the hospital, and died there.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Bartholomew-close. On the 24th I saw the deceased at the hospital - He complained of a pain in his left side, his rib was fractured - He died on the 26th. I did not think him in a dangerous state at first; he appeared to have a disease in his viscera. I examined his body after death. The complaint would not have caused his death so soon without the fracture of the rib. The liver and spleen were very much diseased, and the lungs much disordered. The fracture of the rib certainly hastened his death.</p>

On the 26th of November last, the prisoner, Kelly, came to my shop about five o'clock in the evening, and asked me to give him change for a 5l. note. I asked him who it was for? he said, for Mr. Crease, his master - I asked him where Mr. Crease lived? he said, in Long-acre, and that he was a plasterer. He had a white jacket, apron, and a paper cap on. I asked him what number? he said 26. Knowing Mr. Crease was a customer, I gave him five 1l. notes, and put Mr. Crease's name on the 5l. note (looking at one) this is it-(looking at five 1l. notes)-two of these have been in my possession; No. 27,334 and 21,372 - They have my hand-writing on them. I took one of them on the Monday or Tuesday, and the other on the Tuesday before the 26th of December, which was Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. My name is on the front of the two 1l. notes, they have no date written on them by me. One of them is dated March 1816, the other in October. I always mark notes when I take them. The 5l. note was in my possession from the time Kelly gave it to me till I gave it to the officer. I never saw Spicer except at the office. My shop is at the corner of Great Newport-street - it was lit up; it is surrounded by windows.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How soon after you received the 5l. note, was your attention called to the two 1l. notes - A. I saw them at Bow-street about half an hour after. I did not leave the shop till the officer came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From how many 1l, notes did you select those you gave to Kelly-A. I might have ten or twelve.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 26th of November I saw the prisoners in company together in St. Martin's-lane, Smith was with me. I watched and followed them about thirty yards in company together on the other side of the way. Kelly had a flannel jacket, a paper cap, and an apron on; I followed them until they came to Long-acre, opposite Mr. Braidey's shop. Kellythen left Spicer, crossed over, and went into Braidey's shop. I went away, disguised myself, and saw Spicer on the opposite side, looking over to the shop; it was about five o'clock in the afternoon. I crossed over to the shop, saw Kelly in it, and saw some notes pass from Mr. Braidey to Kelly; he came out, crossed St. Martin's-lane, and joined Spicer, who stood at the corner. I crossed over after them, they went up Long-acre on the right-hand side-Kelly took the paper cap off his head, and put it in his pocket - He was then without any thing on his head-some words passed between them. Kelly said to Spicer, as soon as they joined, "Come along, it is all right," or words to that effect - He had not then been out of the shop more than half a minute. When they joined, their hands were close together, and something passed between them.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140023"/>I distinctly saw their hands together. I was not near enough to see whether Kelly had any thing in his hand; I continued to follow them. They crossed Long-acre, and went down Mercer-street and Castle-street. When they came into King-street, Seven Dials, I told Smith we had better secure them. I laid hold of Kelly by both his hands, opened a shop-door, pushed him in, and searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you saw Kelly come out of the shop until that time, had he joined company with anybody but Spicer - A. No person at all; he had no opportunity of giving any thing to any person. I found 18s. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see any other person there; it was dark when I took Kelly. I did not look to see if he had thrown any notes away.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer, and was with Limbrick on the 26th of November. The first that I saw was Spicer at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, after that I saw Kelly going along King-street - he was before Spicer; I followed Limbrick. Limbrick came to me at the corner of St. Martin's-lane; I saw Spicer about three minutes after. In about four minutes I saw them both in King-street, Kelly was four or five yards before Spicer. Limbrick told me to go and apprehend Spicer, which I did, nearly at the top of King-street. In bringing him along the street, by the light of a shop, I saw him endeavouring to put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket-on observing it, I pushed him into a shop, searched him, and found in his left-hand breeches pocket five 1l. bank notes, and 5s. in silver - I took him to the office. I marked the five 1l. notes before I parted with them (looking at them) these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. King-street is two or three minutes' walk from the pork-shop. They went the nearest wayone was before the other.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am inspector of bank notes to the Bank of England (looking at the 5l. note)-it is not a genuine note, it is neither the Bank-paper nor plate; the signature is the name of a signing clerk, but not his hand-writing. It is forged in every respect.</p>

On the 4th of December, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of pumps, which came to 10s.6d.; he tendered me a 5l. note, I asked him his name? - he gave me the name of "George Meson." I asked him where he lived? he made a motion with his hand, and said, "through the turnpike, (pointing towards Cambridge-heath). I asked him if it was Newmarket-terrace? he said, "Yes." I indorsed the note"G. Mason, Newmarket-terrace, 4, 12, 17," (looking at it)-this it. I gave him four 1l. notes, and the rest in silver - He went away.

He asked to look at a pair of Wellington boots in the window - He tried them, and bought them, they came to 15s. He pulled out about 12s., and said he had not got enough, and I must give him change for a 5l. note. He gave me the note, I asked him his name? he said, "Perkins, Nelson-terrace, City-road"-(looks at a note) this is it - I indorsed it. I went to Goddard's to get it changed.</p>

I went out, got change, and gave it to him, he went away. About a fortnight or three weeks after I saw him coming out of Gregory's shop, in Shoreditch (the note had then been returned to me). I did not see his face. I followed him into Brown's-lane - He went all the back way; I followed him about half a mile. I got a glimpse of his face, and knew him again - He went into a public-house. I found out where he lived, and went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I am positive it was the 13th of November; he was dressed in a grey great coat, corded breeches, and top-boots; he had a black enamelled ring on his finger - He had not got pantaloons on. I was fetched there to see him by Gregory's shop-man, who followed him, with me, into the Laurel Tree public-house. I saw Locke, the beadle, and told him my business; he said if he was the man, he could find him any day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not offer to take him, if you was sure he was the man-A. I believe he did. He was taken a week or a fortnight after. I never said I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said to Miller, the officer, that he wrote the name and address himself-A. No.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 13th of November I saw the prisoner in my husband's shop; he bought a pair of shoes, and a pair of boots for his wife, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; we had a lamp and candles in the shop-(Looking at the notes.)-the hand-writing on the back is my husband's-the prisoner told him what to write. I saw the prisoner again in the parlour of the Fir Tree public-house, Whitechapel, soon after. I went into the room-there was about twenty gentlemen there. I had not been told that the prisoner was there - I picked him out immediately; I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. A person fetched me there. I went into the parlour alone - I went into the middle of the room and sat down - I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the company desired to stand up - A. I knew him immediately I went into the room. After I sat down the company were desired to stand up - I do not know why; I do not know why I sat down; I did not know why I was sent there; I was desired to walk in; when I came out Miller asked me if I knew any body there? I said the man in the grey great-coat was the man who gave my husband the note.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. On the 7th of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop; he bought a piece of Irish and two squares of muslin, which came to 4l.5s.; he tendered me a 5l. note; I asked him to write his name and address on it - He wrote "Collins, 17, Little Moorfields;" I put my initials to it-(looks at it)-this is it - I took it to the Bank next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the change-A. No; I told him I must enquire if he had given a right address; he said I could send my lad with him - I told him I should go myself; he walked gently to the door, while I was taking the change, and going to the door I found he was gone, and had left the goods - I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. About Christmas I heard there was a man in custody answering the description then given; he had a snuff-brown coat on, corded breeches, and top boots. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            , No. 19, Nelson-terrace, City-road;" he wrote it on the note himself-(looking at it)-this is it. I saw him again last Saturday in Newgate, with five or six more, and picked him out without the least hesitation; I asked him if his name was Seckerson? he said it was, and that he knew what I came about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He was then under a charge of forgery; I am certain he is the man; he had on top boots, dirty leather breeches, and a light coloured frock coat.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am an inspector of bank notes to the Bank of England. The note uttered to Scrase is a forgery-it is neither the bank plate or paper, nor is it the signature of the person it purports to be-(looking at the four other notes) - They are all forged in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner - A. Yes, at the Hope public-house, in Pollard's-row, on Saturday night, the 18th of December; there was about twenty persons in the room - He was one of them. A gentleman of the name of Jordan said he had heard that Seckerson had uttered a 5l. forged note to a Mr. Thorpe, of New Inn-yard, Shoreditch; that Thorpe had afterwards watched him to several places, and that it was supposed he went into different houses to avoid him; that they then watched him to a pawnbroker's, opposite Brown's-lane; the prisoner admitted that he had been to the pawnbroker's, but denied going to any other place. Jordan said it was necessary the prisoner should clear his character; it was hinted that I being in the room was not acting right, by not making enquiry. I asked the prisoner to go to Thorpe with me; he refused - I asked him to appoint some other time, which he also refused. I then said he must-several of the company came round, and abused me, and said I should not take him; I got assistance, but did not take him away that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I live within eleven doors of the house, and go there frequently. I do not remember seeing the prisoner there before. Messrs. Wood, Homewood, Wilson, and Jordan were there; neither Mr. Homewood or Mr. Jordan abused me; it was on the 20th. On the Monday the prisoner attended at the office-Homewood engaged to produce him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you would take him into custody, or that he had better put himself under your protection - A. I said he had better put himself under my protection, and I would see him righted.</p>

            's employ. On the 26th or 27th of November I was at Gregory's, where I always deal; I then went to Richards's, the pawnbroker, in Brick-lane;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140025"/>when I came out I observed a crowd - I asked what was the matter, and understood it was about a note; not being concerned in it, I took no notice; I saw Mr. Windsor at the door of the Laurel Tree public-house-we went in and drank together. The same day I went with Mr. Wood to Mr. Homewood's, the Hope public-house, in Pollard's-row; Mr. Welch, who was there, told me I had been followed by a man who had taken a bad note, and thought it was me, and if he could have sworn to me, I should have been apprehended, as the officers were with him; the company laughed at the mistake; I thought no more about it-it was mentioned one night when Mr. Christmas was there. On Saturday night, the 20th of December, three weeksafter, the conversation was brought up again; Mr. Christmas, who was one of the company, told me to put myself under his protection - He at length told me I must go with him - I felt indignant at it, and refused; my employer and Mr. Homewood, who was there, offered 1,000l. for my appearance. I remained in the room for an hour and a quarter-Miller and Freeman, the officers, came - They said information was given them of a person like me, but they were satisfied I was not the man; they said if I would come to the Fir Tree, public-house, on Monday at twelve o'clock, they would collect the persons who had followed me; to this I agreed, and was there punctual to the time. I there saw Thorpe, who said I gave him a 5l. note, and wrote the name on it myself, and that his wife would know the man in a moment; I was desired to write my name to compare with the note - I begged that Thorpe's wife might be sent for - She came, and staid in the room at least ten minutes; the company were told to stand up with their hats off; at length, from my having a coloured coat on, she went out, and asked if I was not the man. I do not mean to say that the witnesses swore wantonly against me, but, from my likeness to somebody else, they are mistaken. After Thorpe had seen the note, he said he wrote the name himself.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. The prisoner's master offered 500l. for his appearance, and Mr. Homewood gave his word for it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WOOD. I am a silk-weaver, and worked with the prisoner in December last, and for six months before that; he lived in George-street, Bethnal-green, I lived there with him for four months. When I went to work at eight o'clock in the morning, I generally found him at work; I used to leave off work at eight o'clock at night, and, from the quantity of work that the prisoner did, he must have worked till ten. When he went out he was either dressed in a blue or green, and not a striped waistcoat, chocolate coloured trowsers, a blue coat, and a grey great coat. I never saw him in a different dress, except in a different waistcoat; he had got a chest, which contained his clothes - He generally wore shoes, I have seen him wear Wellington boots. On the 6th of December he moved to Wellington-place - He worked for Mr. George Ransom. On the 4th of December I was finishing my work in George-street, in order that we might move on the Saturday; we wanted to knock the looms down, and take them away-they were taken down on the 5th; I had an opportunity of seeing him on the 4th; I was there in his house at work from half-past eight o'clock in the morning till a quarter to nine; I boarded with him - He worked with me the whole day. When I left him at a quarter to nine o'clock he was at work - We were both at home the whole day; I work in the same shop with him - He could not be absent without my knowledge - He was in his working dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the 12th of November-A. I do. On the Wednesday morning the house was broken open, and his work, which was a damask scarf, was taken away-it was between the 11th and 12th. On the 13th, in consequence of the robbery, the prisoner and myself went to Mr.

               <p>Q. Was he on the 4th of December so long absent as to go a mile and a half and return without your knowledge - A. It is impossible. I saw him about half an hour after I left him at the Hope, public-house, in Pollard's-row, which Homewood keeps; he had his cane-it is about a quarter of a mile from his master's-Mr. Bartlet and Mr. Homewood were with him - He had neither boots or breeches on, he had pantaloons on. I staid at Homewood's with him till about five o'clock - He went away to go home - He came to the Hope again about half-past six, with his master; he did not bring his cane with him-his dress was not changed; we staid there together till about nine o'clock. When he left I remained there with Ransom - He continued to work till he surrendered himself to the magistrate. Homewood's is about a mile from New Innyard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. I worked in the same room with him - I believe he did not go out of the room - I am sure he was not absent - He worked late to finish his scarf on the 4th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not absent an hour on the Friday evening - A. Yes - He was taking down the looms.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARK. I have worked for the prisoner ever since Whit Monday. I used to go to him at six o'clock in the morning, he began to work then. Wood and him worked together in the same room-the prisoner left off work at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day he moved from George-street to Wellington-place - A.He did move - He took the looms down on the Sunday morning; I think it was Tuesday morning that he moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he was at work in particular on the day before the looms were taken down-A. He had a fresh cane, he was ill with the govt-he used to wear a brown jacket, black waistcoat, trowsers, and buckled shoes to work in-when he went out he used to wear brown trowsers, a mixture coloured great coat, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140026"/>a blue under coat. I had an opportunity of seeing his clothes, I used to put them away - He had got a pair of boots without tops - He mostly were shoes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. He was very bad before he moved, and could not walk.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to live with him on Whit-Monday; where did he live then - A. In Castle-street; he moved from there to George-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what you have been telling us when he moved to George-street, or when he moved from George-street to Wellington-place-A. When he moved to George-street; I remember his moving from George-street to Wellington-place not long before Christmas; at that time the looms were taken down on the Friday, and he moved on Saturday. Wood worked for him in George-street - he used to come at eight o'clock in the morning, and dine with my master; my master was hard at work to get done, to take the looms down - We worked till ten o'clock on the Thursday night, and finished on Friday at one - I was in the house all day on Friday-my master was not out of the house all day. What I said of his having the gout was before he moved from Castle-street.</p>

            . I am a silk-manufacturer; the prisoner worked for me. On the 13th of November, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, he came to me - I know it was the 13th, because he was robbed on the 12th; I saw him with Wood at the corner of Pollard's-row - I stopped with him about a quarter of an hour - He then went to the warper's, in Quaker-street-Wood left him at the corner of Pollard's-row. I saw him at the Hope, public-house-the prisoner came there with his cane about half-past four o'clock, I left him, with Wood and Bartlett, about five. I returned to the Hope about seven o'clock, and found him there, and left him there after eight o'clock-he had brown pantaloons, a blue coat, grey great coat, and shoes on - He had not got leather breeches, or top-boots on, I never saw him dressed so; from the quantity of work that he did, he must have worked twelve hours a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Thorpe at the Fir Tree, public-house-A. Yes; there was a quarrel about a note-to the best of my recollection, Thorpe said the man wrote the name on the note himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. He must have gone to the warper's himself, they would not have given the cane to any body else. I saw him again between four and five o'clock at the Hope, public-house. New Inn-yard is full a mile from the Hope. On the 8th of December he brought to me sixteen scarfs.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOMEWOOD. I am the landlord of the Hope, public-house. The prisoner has frequented my house two or three times a week, for an hour or two in the evening; I have known him seventeen years. There used to be a party of neighbours meet at my house in the evening - I remember in November last, the day after he was robbed, he came to my house with his cane, Messrs. Bartlett, Ransom, and Wood were with him. I found him there at five o'clock, when I came down stairs; he was in my house about an hour after that time - He returned about a quarter or half-past six o'clock-Mr. Ransom came again. I remember the 20th of December-it had been rumoured that he had been followed on suspicion of having passed forged notes; I told him of it for three weeks or a month before the 20th. Mr. Christmas used to come to my house every night for many years-the prisoner had opportunities of seeing him there, and knowing what he was. On the night the accusation was made there was some words between Mr. Christmas and the gentlemen - I offered 500l. for the prisoner's appearance - He has an excellent character - I never saw him dressed in leather breeches and top-boots in my life, or with a ring on his finger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. I believe he returned about half-past six o'clock - He being robbed makes me remember it - I collected some money that evening to make up his loss.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DIBBEN. I am shopman to Mr. Fremont, a stationer. I was called upon to attend at Lambeth-street office to prove who uttered a forged note to me. The prisoner was accused of it, he is very much like the man-but, upon looking attentively at him, my opinion is that he is not the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I am quite sure he is not the man - I should know the man directly if I saw him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD RANSOM. I am a tobacconist, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. I knew the prisoner two years. About the latter end of November my wife called me down to give change for a 1l. note-the man was dressed very much like the prisoner. I did not change the note - He is about his height and age, and had a ring on his finger, and a mixture coat on.</p>

I neither threatened nor promised him with respect to this charge. I asked him if it was possible, notwithstanding our system of book-keeping, that we could be defrauded? He then told me that we had been defrauded to the extent of 600l. He alluded particularly to a Treasury bill of 500l.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS LONDON. I am superior clerk to Messrs. Robarts and Curtis. If we have any Treasury or private bills payable at the Bank, they are made up regularly every day, and a list, which we call the Bank Charge, and the bills, are delivered to a porter to carry to the Bank for payment. They generally give a ticket. If he receives payment, he is to bring the bank notes which he receives. If any objection is made to any bill on the ground of irregularity, or supposed irregularity, it is returned to the house. I look at the prisoner's book of the 10th of November; it was his duty to make out the Bank charge of that day-it is in his own hand-writing. There is a 100l. specified to be for a Treasury bill; he discharges himself of that 100l., by debiting the Newcastle Bank 100l., as if the 100l. to be received on that account had not been paid, but returned. The entry of the debit is,"100l. Newcastle"-(Looks at a Treasury bill for 100l.)-it appears to have been indorsed to our house by the Newcastle Bank, and to be due that day-it appears to have been received on that day by our porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that the entry of the 100l. applies to that bill-A. I have no doubt of it. When a bill is not paid at the Bank, it must be entered in that form to discharge himself of it, and to balance that account. In the column in which the 100l. is entered, he has not made any entry of the 100l. being paid by the Bank upon that Treasury bill, if he received it, there was 100l. deficient-the entry represents it as unpaid. It would be the prisoner's duty, if it was not paid, to make a debit ticket. I have one in my hand made out by him respecting this bill (reads)-"Debit Newcastle Bank on Treasury, 100l., 10th November."This represents that the Newcastle Bank were to be debited 100l. on account of this bill not being paid, which was done,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He charges himself with having sent out the bill-his debit ticket cannot apply to any other bill. The entry is in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILBERT. I am in the Public Drawing-Office in the Bank. All Treasury bills are paid there. On the 10th of November, a Treasury bill, (100l.) was presented to me by Davis, from the house of Messrs. Robarts and Co. for payment. I examined it, marked it, and drew a ticket on the pay-clerks for the porter to receive the money. He receipted the bill for Robarts and Curtis.</p>

             re-examined. I look at the prisoner's book. When he received the notes from Davis, it was his duty to enter the notes and dates to the credit of the Bank charge. The 100l. bank note, No. 10,789, 26th of October, 1817, is not entered to the Bank charge - He ought to have entered it to the credit of the Newcastle Bank. On the same day, I find the bank note, of that number and date, is entered as received from Johnston of the Coal Exchange, for a bill of 168l. 7s. 6d.; there is still a deficiency of 100l. in his account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. There must be a deficiency.</p>
               <p>Q. If Johnston had to pay him 68l. and he entered it 168l,, the bankers would not be defrauded at all - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of November I was with Gleed, opposite Field-lane, Holborn, and saw the prisoner and another man come from the Thatched-house. We followed them down Fleet-market, Ludgate-hill, and up the Old Bailey, into the Star, public-house, with another man in a butcher's dress. Suspecting them, I immediately went in, took the prisoner into custody, and told him I took him on suspicion of passing forged notes. He said he knew nothing about it, nor should he know a forged note from a good one. I took him in a coach to a public-house next door to Worship-street office - We held his hands until he got into the back parlour. I told him I would search him, he said, no person should search him. I found 27s. in silver in his left-handbreeches pocket, and three 1l. bank notes in his right-handbreeches pocket. He said he should like to mark them, which I let him do, keeping hold of them while he did it-(looking at them)-these are the notes; they were quite new, not the least rumpled, and did not appear to have been in circulation. He said he had them from Blackfriars Bridge, and gave 30s. for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did he not say he gave 30s. in silver, and the rest in larger coin - A. He might. I should have taken the notes myself, if I had not been told they were forged.</p>

               <p>HENRY GILLARD. I was at Dumpling Island, on the coast of Labradore, in North America, splitting fishBurnslow, Henley, and Pearse, the deceased, were there. The prisoner called Pearse a great eater. Pearse collared him, gave him a shove, and told him if he did not leave off calling him names, he would give him a hiding. We had knives to cure the fish with. Pearse left the prisoner, who still kept calling him a great eater. Pearse took up the stick (about the size of my finger), and gave the prisoner three or four blows across the shoulder, they did not appear to be very hard. The prisoner said, "If you do that again, I will run you through." Pearse again struck him across the shoulder with the same stick; the prisoner took the knife off the table, and stuck it into his left breast. Pearse said, "Cut away! cut away! I shall die - He has stabbed me!" He fell on his back. We carried him to the house - He died in twenty minutes. The knife was what we used in cutting fish; this is it-(producing it).</p>

            . I am a cheesemenger, and live in Broadway, Westminster. On the 16th of October, I met the prisoner, Turner, about a quarter after eight o'clock in the morning, by St. Clement's church, going towards Temple-bar, with a large bundle on her arm, with a towel over it. I said, "Cook, are you lost?" she said she was in a hurry, and passed me. The bundle appeared to contain linen; the towel did not quite cover it. I watched her till a waggon interrupted my view - I then went home. In about an hour and a half she came to my shop with a large bundle of greens, twice as large as the one she had before. I said, "Cook, are you returned?" she said, "I am. I said, "How you are splashed! where have you been?" she said, "to the King's Bench. I said that was not the road - She said, "No, to the King's Bench Chambers, which are her master's. She said, "The house has been robbed, and I have been to tell Mr. Pullen, the clerk, and he is coming down." I asked her where she was during the robbery? she said she slept at the top of the house. I asked her how she discovered it? she said, when she came down in the morning, she found a candle and a tobacco-pipe on the hall table. I asked her what they had taken? she said they had broken her master's drawers open, and had taken out the jewels and trinkets-that it was the painter's fault, as he desired her to leave the drawing-room windows open. She went away, saying she was going to the painter's. About eight o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Carter's house with Mr. Smith - She was then in the kitchen. I said, "Cook, do you deny having seen me this morning?" - I had been told she did. She said, "I do not deny meeting you, I deny having a bundle." I said, "You had a large bundle, and (pointing to the greens which laid there), tied up in the same towel." She said, "Yes, I had those greens." I said she had them when she came to my shop, but I could swear that when I met her at St. Clement's she had not those greens. She said I might swear any thing, and she would swing for it. I went away.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PULLEN. I am clerk to Mr. Carter. About half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 6th of October the prisoner came to me at the Chambers, and said the house had been robbed - I said I would come down immediately - She had no bundle.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of October, about one o'clock, I examined the house, there were no marks of violence whatever. I learned that Turner was acquainted with Davis - I went to him, and found him at Hungerford-market, and asked him where he slept last night? he said at his lodgings in Hungerford-market. I told him that something unpleasant had happened at Mr. Carter's - He said he had heard of it, and was sorry for it. I asked him how he heard of it? he said he had seen the cook that morning, and she told him. I asked him if he had any objection to my searching his lodgings? he said, none whatever, and told me where they were. He said he wished he had slept at Mr. Carter's that night, as he had slept there so long - He thought if he had been there the robbery would not have happened. I went to his lodgings, leaving him with Bly; they were in Hungerford-market. In a cupboard on the stair-case I found some saucepans, a candlestick, and a shovel, in a bag - I also found three chairs there. I asked him how he got them? he said he bought the kitchen things at a sale at Deptford, and the chairs at different brokers, one at a time, as he was going to be married to Turner in May. I found he had not slept at his lodgings that night. I found a bag at Mr. Carter's, corresponding with that in which the things were. Between his second and third examination, I was in conversation with him - He said the cook gave him the things towards going to housekeeping, that he wished he knew where the rest of the things were, and he would tell. I went with Bly to Mrs. Baxter's, in Shire-lane, and found a bundle of linen under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When you went for him you met Parry, told him you wanted the prisoner, and he fetched him - A. I did. He told me where the things were, and said he bought the things because he did not want to have the cook brought into trouble.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton, and know the prisoner. On Friday afternoon he asked me to take a walk with him, which I did; as we returned Farmer John met us; the prisoner and him asked me if I would go and help them to steal two sheep; at first I said I would-as we were in a bye-lane, I was afraid to refuse. When I got into the high-road the prisoner told me not to let my heart fail me; I said, no, but I believed it would; he said, "I shall not bid you good night, you must meet me here about six o'clock." I went home, and did not go out again. Next morning I went to his house - He said,"You was not so good as your word." His father came home, and said White had lost two sheep; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it; he told me that he caught both the sheep himself, tied their legs together, and he and John carried them; and as he was going over the bridge with one, he fell into the water-that he got him out, and carried them through a turnip-field to Bow's farm, and left them there, with their legs tied; that John went to call up Davey to kill them, but he did not get up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AUSTIN. I am constable of Edmonton. On Saturday morning I was about half a mile from where the sheep were taken, and saw a butcher there with a cart - He was quarrelling-it was getting light - He went away without taking any thing. I was present when the prisoner was before the magistrate; he was cautioned before he signed any thing, that it would be given in evidence against him. I saw the magistrate and prisoner sign this paper.</p>
               <p>(Reads) "Banton, John, and myself went together, on Friday last, to Bow's Farm; John went to see a man. We left Banton - I came across the field, and met John again. John and I agreed to go after the sheep. John and I went to Mr. White's mead, at Edmonton, and took two sheep; I carried them a little way, and John carried them the rest, and put them in a field."</p>

I had been ill, and the prisoner nursed me; I asked her if she had seen some spoons? she said, yes; I asked her where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140031"/>they were? she made no answer; at last she said she had made free with them; but if I said nothing she would get them again. I asked her if she had pledged them? she said yes - I then asked her about the shirts; she began crying, and said she would go and drown herself; she went out, and returned in an hour. I insisted on having the duplicates; she took a thread-case out of her pocket - I took it from her, and found thirty-five duplicates in it; she said five guineas would get them all again. I told her she was an ungrateful woman; she said she was guilty, and that I might hang or transport her, whichever I liked. After that she gave me six more duplicates.</p>

On the 10th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoners came into my shop to look at some seals; they staid a considerable time looking over the goods, and then went out. In about an hour or two afterwards I missed the seal, which was a very remarkable one, and told my man if he should see them again to secure them. Next morning Plummett came, and not seeing me, he was to call in about an hour; he came in about five hours- I told my man to go to the banker's, by which I meant to get an officer; the moment he went out Plummett left the shop, and ran away- he was secured. I am sure the prisoners are the men that came the first time. I never found the seal- nobody had been in the shop after them till I missed it. I saw Plummett handle it.</p>

On the 8th of January, about half-past four o'clock, the prisoner came into the dining-room, and called for a bason of soup, which I carried to him, with a silver spoon; he eat the soup, paid for it, got up, and walked out of the room. I went to the table to see if it was gone, and found it exchanged. I went down stairs, and charged him with having exchanged it, he denied it- I told him he had left a metal one in the room of a silver one. I called Shafe, and told him, and insisted on his being searched. He immediately pulled off his hat, and threw the spoon on the stairs- I gave him in charge. Rebecca Denton keeps the house.</p>

On the 17th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in, and called for a pint of beer, and asked for a pen and ink. Redford and Holt went out and came in again; they said something about some bread, I said I sold it, they asked for some. I went to the cupboard for it, and while I turned my back they went out; they had hardly drank any beer- they did not return. In about five minutes I missed the dial, which hung up in the box where they were. Between nine and ten o'clock Jackson came in, and told me to attend at the office. I am in care of the house for Green and Co. until it is let.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was on duty on the 17th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in Church-lane, St. George's. The prisoner, Redford, passed me with something under his arm, wrapped up; I asked what he had there? he made no answer, but walked on- I followed, and asked him again - He said it was a Dutch clock, which he brought from over the water, from West-square, Blackfriar's-road, and he was going to take it to his sister's, in Kingsland-road. I asked who it belonged to? he said to his mother, that he knew the maker very well, there were two brothers of them, and he went to school with them, and their names were Baggs. I took him into custody; there was a boy before him, without a coat, and a man behind him; the man followed us to the watch-house; I cannot say whether it was Wilks, I think Holt is the boy.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. George's. On the 17th of November the prisoner, Redford, was brought to the watch-house with the dial- I questioned him about it; at last he said it was of no use to tell a falsehood about it- that he had been innocently led into it, and that it came from a house in the Minories. He then said the two lads that were with him gave it to him to carry; that they went into a public-house with him. He went out for a sheet of paper to write a letter for them, on his return he met them outside with the dial, and told him to come along, he must not go in any more- in conequence of which I apprehended Holt and Wilks the next morning; the dial was wrapped up in Holt's great-coat.

I also found a small iron chisel, a knife, and a quantity of wire on Wilks. I told him he had come out of his way. He said he had to call at Wapping.</p>

               <p>JAMES ALDOUS. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. On the 15th of December the prisoner came to pledge four table spoons; he asked 3l. for them, I told him it was too much, he said they were new. On examining them I saw a crest had been erased, I told him so. He asked to look at them, and tried to get them foreibly from me. I detained them, telling him that was not the act of an honest man. I sent for Plank, who secured him. He said he bought them of a pawnbroker, in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer. I secured the prisoner. He refused to tell where he lived, he at last told me. I took him to Mrs. Blair's, and went to his lodgings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140033"/>in South-street, Manchester-square, and found a candlestick and a pair of snuffers.</p>

             and John Rawlinson, Jun. instructions to deliver the property on board that ship- they accounted to me for having delivered it. There was a trunk from Payne's among it. I gave them directions to make great haste, and forward the property to the ship. They left London about one o'clock on the day of the 5th of December. I furnished them with a sail. They ought to have arrived at Gravesend before day-light the next morning. I expected them to return about nine o'clock on Sunday morning - They did not return till Sunday night. When property is delivered to a vessel going abroad, a receipt is given by the master of the ship - They returned me the receipt. In consequence of what was then written I asked them how the goods happened to get wet? (having heard they were wet)- they said it was with rain and the sprey of the water.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I succeded their father in the basiness. I sent them to Galley Quay, which is in the city-from there they get into the middle of the shipping in the lower parts of the Pool, which is very public.</p>
               <p>Q. Very soon after that they get into the counties of Essex and Kent - A. Yes, at Limehouse-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had made haste, would they not have got to Gravesend at night - A. It was not probable that they would have reached there till night, or early in the morning. If they were delayed by rain, I should not think much of their being two or three hours later. I heard it was a windy and rainy night- I do not know it myself. They would have no occasion to leave the boat. They have a very good character. The other prisoner is their first-cousin. They have been a year and a half in my empty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is it from Galley Quay to the Pool - A.About a mile and a half. When they passed the Pool it must have been day-light.</p>

It appeared to have been unpacked and emptied-the paper that it appears to have been wrapped in laid by it. This was on Sunday, the 7th of December, about two o'clock. There was a vacancy in the trunk, beside where the box was, as if other goods had been taken out-the handkerchiefs lost might safely be packed in that place. The box was carefully repacked, and given to Mr. Pope.</p>

            , at Limehouse. I was standing on the wharf, they came ashore to me - I do not know what boat they came from. We went into the Horns and Chequers, public-house, kept by Mr. Backway, and drank together. They said they were going to Blackwall, and expected to have something for me when they came back - They went away immediately- they both drank with me. About nine o'clock the same night they came to my house, which is in Middlesex, and went up to my bed-room- my wife was at home. They said they had some silk handkerchiefs and some lace; they took them out, and laid them on the bed- they had them about their persons, under their great-coats. I asked them what they wanted for them? they said they were worth a great deal of money- there were about forty pieces of handkerchiefs, each containing three. There might be nine in a piece for what I know - I never counted them-some looked larger than others; they refused to settle about them till they saw something else. On Sunday, about one o'clock, the three male prisoners came while I was at dinner - They dined with me. My wife and son, who is about fifteen years old, were at home. I sent my son for a pot of beer, and then sent him to church. After dinner, we all four went up stairs, and agreed about them. They said they were worth 100l. - I said I would give no such money for them, as they were all very common. I at last offered 45l. for them, which they agreed to take. I said I would give them some money as soon as I could. They staid about an hour with me. They said they came from Gravesend. After they went away, I went to Backway's public-house to see the newspaper, and saw them there. I had half a pint of beer before I saw them - I put it into the pot out of which they were drinking. Mrs. Backway served us.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they left you was any appointment made - A. Yes, at the house I told them I would meet them in the Borough on Monday, about two o'clock. I did not meet them, because the eldest came to me on the Monday morning, and told me there was something the matter, and not to meet them, and that if I had any thing in the house, I had better put it away- I put the things that I had bought of them out of the house. I took a piece of silk handkerchiefs to the prisoner, Griffiths, she lives at Limehouse. I told her I had some, that I wished to turn them into money, and that she should have them at 2s. 6d. a piece. I gave the prisoner, Cox, two cards of lace. I told her on the Sunday night I had some lace and handkerchiefs, and she might have some, if she could do anything with them. On the Monday, at tea-time, she came, had two cards, and a few yards of another piece, for which she paid me 9s. - my wife cut it off. I do not think any price was settled for the two cards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I am now come from prison. I was examined three times before. I said nothing about these men. I never was in this Court before, nor was I apprehended for felony before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoners come to you on the Friday - A. Between two and three o'clock- I believe it was after two. They said they were going to Blackwall. When they came at nine o'clock it was dark, and they brought the property- I am no judge of it. This was on Friday night. My wife might have been in the bed-room part of the time with us- nothing was pulled out down stairs. On Sunday all three dined with me - I dine at one o'clock. I saw them at the public-house at three.</p>

             at Barclare's-buildings, near the East India Docks-it was a butcher's-shop, and her husband is a butcher. There was a parcel of silk handkerchiefs lying on the counter, in her bonnet, and in a work-bag which hung by the fire-place I found two lengths of lace. She said she would tell from whom she got them when she got to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took M'Gillivray on the 10th of December, at Mr. White's, in Lisle-street, Little Newport-street - I had been looking for him for two days. I found him out by information which the prisoner, Griffiths, gave me. Part of Bow Creek is in Middlesex, and part in Essex. It is above two miles from Limehouse.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH POWIS. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, Cox, at her house, on the 9th of December. When we went in she was placing a small paper parcel in the crown of her bonnet, containing three silk handkerchiefs. I asked her where she got them? she said she would tell the magistrate. She told the magistrate she had them from M'Gillivray. She said she knew they were British.</p>
               <p>JOHN GATTY. I am a Thames Police officer. I assisted in apprehending Griffiths. When she got to the office I told her I must search her - She said I should, after she had taken her money out. She was fumbling a long while. I heard paper rustle, and put my hand to her pocket, but found nothing. I desired her to get up off the chest on which she sat- I found three silk handkerchiefs in a paper. She at first said they were not her's, and afterwards that she had received them from M'Gillivray. I received some lace from James Hoggart. The whole of Limehouse is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>JAMES HOGGART. I keep a public-house at Limehouse. M'Gillivray gave me the lace, which I gave to Gatty.</p>

            , JUN. I was carrying home some work - I met my father at the Dolphin, public-house, between four and five o'clock, and had a pot of beer and a quartern of gin; it rained very hard, we went into another house, and had about six pots of beer; we left there about eleven o'clock. When we got to Crown-street my father called out, I was behind him - I ran up to him, he said he had lost his silk-Sims was standing over him; he said my father had charged him with robbing him, but that he had not; I took him to the watch-house, he went willingly-Cole and Colebrook came up, and struck me several times-when the watchman came up they left me. The next night I found them at the Flying Horse, public-house, and had them secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We had a quartern of gin at both houses - I was sober - I do not remember the watch-housekeeper refusing to take the charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES RICE. I am a watchman. At twelve o'clock at night I saw six men at the corner of Crown-street - I dispersed them, and went away. I came up again, and saw the prisoner, Sims, and the two witnesses - They gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was no attempt to rescue while I was there, or any noise; the prosecutor's son was not so drunk as himself.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARKE. I am constable of the night. I heard a noise, and came out, and heard a man say,"Clarke is coming, we will go;" May, Cole, and Colebrook went away, they were with Sims; Sims was brought to the watch-house, the bobbins were found on the ground. Gallaway, jun. had a black eye, which he said one of the men gave him; he was not in liquor. The prosecutor said he lost his watch, but found it in his pocket. I think the son was sober.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ATFIELD. I am an officer. I searched the prisoners Cole, Colebrook, and May, and found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>SIMS'S Defence. I went to help the prosecutor up; in a little time after he said he lost his silk, and I must know about it-his son collared me.</p>

I went to Van, and described him-the prisoner was taken seven weeks after.</p>

When we got into Beach-street, the two ladies were before us, at the corner of King's Head-court; the prisoner shoved the prosecutrix into the kennel, and snatched the bundle out of her hand; I did not know he was going to do it - He was about six yards from me; the ladies, and several other persons, ran after him - I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to pursue - A. No, I was as had as him. I went to the coffee-shop-the people were talking about his being there with a bundle under his coat - I did not see him - I came out-the prisoner called to me, I went into the yard to him - He had the bundle under his coat; the little girl belonging to the house opened the door; he said, "Here they come;" she went in; I went to a house with him, and sold it for 5s. 6d.; I do not know the woman's name, I showed the officers where it was; the prisoner treated me with a pot of beer - I slept with him that night. I had none of the money - I was taken up for it, and told this then.</p>
               <p>ELIZA NELSON. I live at the coffee-shop, in Chequeralley.

On that morning, when I came down stairs, I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen them at half-past eleven the night before in the bar cupboard; the prisoner had not then left the house; I did not know that he was then in the house, but thought he was gone to his place. I heard of him the Friday week following-(looking at a letter)-it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>ANN SMITH. I received the letter by the two-penny post, it is directed to me-(read)-"I write to inform you that I am in Horsemonger-lane; I hope you'll come and see me. I expect to come out on Monday. Come and see me, and I'll tell you all about it - You know what I mean-HENRY HALL." - I went to him, as I had some linen to wash for him, and asked him what brought him there? he said it was for making a riot in the street; I said, "No, it is for Mr. Stone's property;"he asked me how I knew any thing about it? I told him that Mr. Stone told me the officers had been there; I asked him where the property was? he said he sold the six tea-spoons to Mr. Bland, of Norton-Falgate - I asked him where the sugar-tongs were? he gave them to me out of his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HALL. I took the prisoner into custody at Mr. Hase's shop, in Blackman-street, Borough, offering the tea-spoons for sale. I took him to Mr. Stone's - I neither threatened or promised him; he said he came down stairs about half-past three o'clock in the morning, opened the bar sliding-window, and took the spoons and sugar-tongs out; that he sold the six tea-spoons for 15s., and that he had the sugar-tongs about him. When I searched him I found a snuff-box, which he said he paid 3s. for, and he had 11s. left, and a comb, which he had bought with the money.</p>
               <p>JAMES BLAND. On the 20th of November the prisoner sold me the tea-spoons; he said they were his mother's, who was ill, and could not come out - I gave him 15s. for them, which is the full value as old silver. The tablespoons and sugar-tongs weigh five ounces and three-quarters, and are worth 30s.</p>

I saw no more of him, and did not know where to find him. I missed the box out of the case. On the following Saturday I was informed he was at the prisoner Brooks's house, in Red Lion-court, George-street - I did not know her before; I went there on the Saturday evening, and found him hid under the bed, his aunt pulled him out-Brooks was not there. I knocked at the door, the candle was put out before it was opened; I had seen a light at the window before I got there, and through the key-hole - I insisted on having a light. His aunt asked him what he had done with the box of money; he said he had given it to his sister, who is twenty-two years of age; she was brought to him, and he then said he had not given it to her, but he had hid it in a cellar in a court where Brooks lived - He afterwards said he gave it to Mrs. Brooks. She left her house the very night he was taken. She was taken up on the 7th of January.</p>

I asked her what she had done with the money; she said she had bought a suit of clothes between Sullivan and her own child; a handkerchief, a pair of shoes and a pair of stockings, which she had on her feet; and that she bought her child some things out of the guinea, at Mr. Harford's, at Kingsland; that she changed a 5l. note at Mr. Cotton's, Shoreditch.

            . I am a beadle. On the 4th of November I was in Aldersgate-street, and saw the female prisoner, whom I knew before, standing at the corner of Falcon-street - she went towards St. Martin's-le-Grand, the other prisoner joined her; they walked together to the corner of Dean's-court - She left him, and turned up Angel-street into Mrs. Smart's shop, which is about twenty yards from where they separated - I was watching them - I saw her give Miss Smart a shilling; I went in and asked to see it - I found it was a bad one. I told the prisoner she had not left off her old tricks; she asked what old tricks? I told her I had her in custody before for offering a bad shilling - She then recollected me - I took her into custody, and went to look for the man, but could not find him; he could see me go into the shop. I took her to the Compter, returned and found the man standing at the corner of Angel-alley - I secured him. I told him he had sent a woman in to pass a bad shilling; he said, he knew no woman, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket - I tried to keep it out. We had a great scuffle, during which five counterfeit shillings fell on the ground, I heard them fall. He would not say where he lived. He said the money was not his. The woman said her name was Smith. I knew him before by the name of Hughes.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Harris. About three weeks or a month before the prisoner was taken, he came to the Verulam Club-house, and inquired for Mr. Sergeant Best, who is a member of the club. I told him he was not there - He went away; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. He came again in about a quarter of an hour, spoke to another servant, and went out. On the 24th of December he came again, and asked if Mr. Sergeant Best was dining there? we said he was (he was not there) in order to get him in - We apprehended him, and told him we detained him for stealing some spoons. He said he never saw the house before. We lost five spoons in all - They are generally in the passage.</p>
               <p>JOHN MACDONALD. I am also a waiter in the house. The prisoner had been described to me. On the 24th of December I saw him standing at Mr. Sergeant Best's door, which is next to our's - He did not knock; he then came in, and inquired for Mr. Sergeant Best - We detained him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress.</p>

               <p>JOHN KINGSTON. I am a boatboy, and so are the prisoners - They belong to Mr. Mags's boat, which was in the canal. I saw the prisoners go to the warehouse, and break a board down at the end, the coals then fell out. They put them into a bag, and carried them into the cabin of their boat. I am sure they are the men. Harris and Cox were with them. I was going to get my father's horse, and saw them do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was about ten yards off. Two took the coals, and two were watching. I had seen them before.</p>

Turner took the poker out of the cabin - I asked him what he was going to do with it? he made no answer. When I had dressed myself he brought in a small tub full of coals - I do not know where he got them from - I did not see them taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not near the warehouse - A. I did not see what they did with the poker. He brought a nose-bag full of coals in. I saw the board broken down at the corner of the warehouse.</p>

My son brought the prisoner in; I do not know whether the lodgers came in or out after I latched the door - I had been in my room half an hour.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday morning, the 9th of January, I met a young man in Charles-street, Drury-lane; he turned two or three times, and looked towards Drury-lane, from where he came; suspecting something, I stood a moment or two, and saw the prisoner on the opposite side, looking down Charles-street - he saw me cross towards him, and he crossed directly opposite Short's-gardens; I stopped him, and asked him what he had in this bundle? he said it was some things for his sister, and that he brought them from his mother. I found they were three wet petticoats. It was about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

I met two young men in the Newroad; they told me to come with them; the prosecutor's daughter called one of them in - He came out with the bundle, gave it to me, and old me to go on, and said he would follow. When we came to Oxford-street he said it was stolen.</p>

On the 13th of December I was at work; a little before nine o'clock my husband came home, and found the windows broken. I searched my drawers, and missed the gown. I suspected the prisoner, who lived in the neighbourhood; we went to look for him several nights, and gave information to the patrol to stop him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FULLBROOK. I am a patrol. On the 18th of December Walling told me to look for the prisoner - A little before twelve o'clock that night I saw him go up a turning - I crossed over, he turned back, and made away from me - I took hold of him, and asked him what he did about the streets at that time? he made no answer - I asked him if his name was not Simmons? he said, yes - I charged him with getting into Mrs. Walling's room, and taking her gown; he said he did do it, and that he had pledged it for 5s. at Shoreditch - He gave me the duplicate.</p>

I went home with her, but saw no preparation for breakfast; it was between eight and nine o'clock. I had been at the Ship and Shears sometime. She asked me to go up stairs with her daughter, who is the prisoner Briant; I went up, and, not liking the appearance of the place, I wanted to go down, when she struck me several times in the face with her fist. O'Hara came up, and struck me across the breast, and held me while Briant took some halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket. I went down stairs, they followed me-O'Hara demanded 2s. for the use of the room, which I gave her. Briant struck me several times again - I went towards the door, which I found fast. O'Hara, Briant, and Humphreys (whom I had not seen before), came to the street-door, and knocked me down-O'Hara put her knee on my breast, and held me down-Humphries held me also, while Briant took my silver out of my trowsers pocket. I called out murder several times, when she put her apron into my mouth to stop my breath; a great many people came about the door and windows - A young man came up, and called through the window to them; they rose from me-the young man said he would fetch an officer-an officer was brought, and they were taken to Shadwell-office. This was on the ground-floor-the window is close to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not call out when you was up stairs - A. I did, but nobody came to my assistance till I got down. I was not in liquor - I lost 15s;</p>

             STEVENS. I am a butcher. I was cleaning my horse in Elbow-lane, and heard a man crying out; being used to hear disturbances at Mrs. O'Hara's house, I did not notice it particularly. After some time, hearing him again, I went to the door, and found it fast; I went to the window, looked through a broken pane of glass, and saw the prosecutor in the act of getting up from the floor, with his mouth bleeding in a very violent manner-his pockets were turned inside out, and his money laying on the floor. I saw the prisoners, Briant and Humphreys, take it off the floor, and carry it to the fire-place, where O'Hara was sitting. O'Hara turned her head, and saw me overlooking her; she gave the other two to understand that somebody was overlooking them, and then they stood still as if nothing had happened. I told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves to treat a man in that way, as not to be satisfied with robbing him, but wanted to murder him. They denied what I accused them of, and used very bad language. I went to Shadwell-office, and got Brown - We went into the house; it is in Elbow-lane, opposite the Ship and Shears.</p>
               <p>Prisoner O'HARA. Q. Was I drunk or sober - A. Sober, and so was the prosecutor. All the prisoners lived in the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140046"/>took the prisoners in charge. Briant denied taking the money; when I was going to search her she gave me 7s. 6d., which she said she picked off the floor. O'Hara was not drunk, she had been drinking-the prosecutor was perfectly sober; his mouth was cut, and bled much - He was crying; the flap of his trowsers and pockets were torn off. I found 10d. in copper on O'Hara, but nothing on Humphreys. I afterwards learned that O'Hara was spending money for liquor, and went to the watch-house to her, and found 2s. 7d. on her. There were two 3s. pieces among the money which Briant gave me; the prosecutor said there were two 3s. pieces among his money.</p>
               <p>O'HARA'S Defence. The prosecutor came to my house between eleven and twelve o'clock. Humphreys was sitting in a chair - He behaved very rude to her, and made a great noise, which brought Briant down from bed. I told him to go home - He pulled out two 3s. pieces, a 1s., and a 6d., saying he had money, and he would stop. He struck Briant, she got up and struck him - He fell on the floor, and called out murder-the two women picked the money up, and gave it to him - He would not take it, saying there was more, and pulled his pockets out. He laid the money on the table till the officer came - I never touched it.</p>
               <p>HUMPHREYS'S Defence. It is as she has said.</p>
               <p>BRIANT'S Defence. The noise awoke me, I came down stairs - He laid hold of us, and asked us to go up stairs with him. I told him to go home, he struck us, and pushed us about - I pushed him, and he called out murder. He was not sober.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DELL. I am a waiter at Long's Hotel. On the 12th of January I was at the bar, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner coming from the staircase; he appeared very bulky, as if he had something about him. I followed him, and overtook him about eight or ten yards from the door, and asked what he had been doing up stairs? he said he had been to the water-closet, and that the housemaid had showed him up. I told him I thought he had something about him which did not belong to him, and asked him to come back. He then said he had lived in the house, which I knew to be false - I collared him, and brought him back, and put him into the coffee-room, and sent for an officer. While the officer was gone for, he pulled the things from under his clothes, and some from his pockets. The officer came and took him.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. On the 18th of December the prisoner, Spears, came to my shop, and asked the price of a handkerchief; he asked permission to leave two baskets which he had, at my house till the evening - He did not call for them; next morning he came, and said he wanted other things, and that he could serve me with a few candles - I said I had no objection; he left the baskets till next morning. He came again on Saturday night, with a box, containing 64 lbs. of candles; I told him I did not want that quantity; he said they were not all for me; I told him they would not suit me - He went away, I followed about one hundred yards from him. I met Fair and Morris, and informed them; they went with me, and stopped him in Red Lion-street. I had not seen the other prisoner. I went home, and in about half an hour the prisoner, Carruthers, came, and asked if a young man had been there with candles? I said, no; he said he was his partner, and he told him he was coming there, and he not returning, made him come for him. I told him he had better wait, and asked him up stairs. I sent for the officers; he said his name was Thompson, that he lived with Godfrey, a tallow-chandler, in the Commercial-road. The officers came and secured him.</p>

Just as it got dark the prisoner began to get quarrelsome, and wanted to fight; he fought with one man, after which he began upsetting the glasses; we wanted him to leave the room, he refused, and abused the landlady; I told him he should not stay in the room, and collared him to turn him out - We took him into the street, he slipped down-as soon as he got up, he advanced towards me - We closed, he threw me, and cut my head; he was pulled away. I went into the parlour, and in about twenty minutes I missed my watch-it could not have fallen out. I went out, collared him, and charged him with taking it; he said he knew nothing about it. I gave him in charge; my watch was found in the area of the next house, I heard it fall from him into the area.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN. I am an officer of Lambeth-street Office. On the 27th of November I heard of the robbery, I went and found the prisoners in Swan-yard, East Smithfield, and told them I came to search the room-it was Cole's room; I found a handkerchief and an apron there which the prosecutor claimed; Coles said they belonged to his wife, pointing to Stiff. I found she flounce of the prosecutrix's gown in her work-bag.</p>

               <p>JOHN FISHER. I live next door to the prosecutrix. On the 19th of December, at ten o'clock at night, a gentleman came, and asked me to take a trunk to Piccadilly. While I was talking to him at my door, two men were standing at a stable-door opposite. I stood at my door a few minutes-the watchman came by, calling ten - He went up, and sent them away; one went one way, and the other another-one abused him very much. I remained at my door till they got into Dorset-street. I heard the watchman tell him to go about his business. In about two minutes the other man passed me. I went out-there was a great mob collected; the man was abusing the watchman, and denied being at the house at all. I pointed the other man out who was with him - They followed me home. I went to bed, and in about two minutes I looked out of window, and saw them quarrelling again. I told the watchman I thought something wrong was going on - He went away. I still kept looking out. When the watchmen got to the other end of the mews the men came in again, stood opposite my door, and whistled. I heard the window open. The watchman came into the mews again, and the men went away. The watchman went out again, and the men returned to the same place again, and whistled again. One of the men looked up and said," All is right." I looked up, and saw the bundle thrown out. I called out Stop thief! he was alarmed and ran away; I called the watch. the prosecutrix opened her door - I told her the bundle had been thrown out, and she picked it up. I went up to the prisoner's room, he had just undressed himself - We brought him down.</p>

In three or four minutes I felt some person at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner, Thomason, with my pocket in his hand - He had cut it off. He gave it to the prisoner, Collins, who went immediately on the other side of the crowd. I collared Thomason, and called out Stop thief!-Collins ran away. I kept hold of Thomason. I had 2s. 3d. in copper money in my pocket. Collins ran about two hundred yards and was secured.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RODGERS. I am a waiter. As I was coming by the end of Somerset-street, the prosecutor turned round, collared Thomason, and called out, Stop thief! Collins ran by me. When I got close to him he put his hand in his coat-pocket, and threw the halfpence from him. I secured him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ANGAS. I was coming out of my house in Whitechapel, about half-past seven o'clock of the 13th of December, heard the alarm, and saw Collins running. When I got to Castle-street he was stopped. A great many halfpence were picked up just by him.</p>
               <p>THOMASON'S Defence. I deny it. He wanted me to give him 2s.</p>
               <p>COLLINS'S Defence. I was hearing the song. I did not move.</p>

               <p>ESTHER ELLIOT. I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 13th of December we lost the fowls-at night the prisoner borrowed a large saucepan of me - She said it was to boil a large piece of pork and greens-this made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140050"/>me suspect her. About her dinner-time (twelve o'clock), I went up, and told her I wanted my sancepan, and I would lend her another. Her husband said I should not stop her pot from boiling. She said I only wanted to see what was in the pot. I said,</p>
               <p>"if there is nothing there that you are ashamed of, why do you object?" Her husband asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him he knew I had. I sat there sometime, and said I would dine with them - They said I should have none of their dinner. I said I would see them eat. I stopped there two hours. At last she took the pot off, and emptied it into the slop-pail in the cupboard - They were two fowls; there was no pork. Her husband said he did not know how she got them. They began eating them, saying, if they were to go prison they would go with their bellies full. I gave them in charge. We found some feathers in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRIGHT. I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge. She said she bought the fowls at Charing-cross for 3s. 6d.</p>

On the 2d of January, between two and three in the morning, the watchman alarmed me-the house was secured before I went to bed. I found the sugar-house open, and a hogshead broken open-two moulds were empty; we traced the sugar, by its dropping, up to the step of a door in Finch-street, about 150 yards off; a man ran out of that house, and escaped. We traced the sugar, by its falling up the stairs, to the one pair room, where we found it in a drawer, which was drawn out-there was nearly 5 cwt. of it. The prisoners were in bed in that room.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HORNBLOW. I am a watchman. Between two and three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the sugar-house; before I got the door two men rushed out, knocked me down, and ran away. I gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DOWNS. I am a watchman. I pursued after the men that ran out, and traced the sugar to the house, up stairs to the room where the prisoners were found-the door was about a foot open; some of the sugar laid on the floor, in a heap, and some in a drawer-the prisoners said they knew nothing about it; there was a washhand stand in the room, and some person had been washing there. Rose said it was her room. There was no appearance of sugar any where else. It would take two or three persons to remove the sugar. I found a dark lanthorn in the sugar-house.</p>

I turned Watson out of the premises in September, a few days after I went there and found the front door forced open, and the inner door also - I missed above hundred books, which were safe the day before; I found a great quantity of them at Porter's, they had been sold for waste paper.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PORTER. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Blackmoor-street, Clare-market. I have bought waste paper of the prisoner Jackson, several times in December last-it was brought to me with the covers off. The prisoner Flynn, sold me a small quantity about the middle of December. I bought 210lbs. of them, at different times, at 3d. per pound, about 20lbs. or 30lbs. at a time. I neither asked their names or where they lived. Mr. Fox saw about 220lbs, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We often buy books for waste paper. The booksellers themselves sell them sometimes.</p>

He took them out of the ground, and was sorting them on the 22d and 23d. On Sunday, the 23d, Smith, the officer, came - I told him, and asked him to look at the remainder of the trees, that if he saw any like them he might know them-some had been taken away the night before. I lost five or six hundred in all. We went to Mr. Mills's, public-house, in the Hampstead-road - I told him not to tell me which he had bought, and I would point out my trees myself. The first I saw in his garden was mine. I pointed out twelve which I knew. He said he bought them of the prisoner. I found twelve more in the next garden, which I knew. I went into four gardens, and found twelve in each - I pointed them out myself. The other gardens belong to Barnes, Showler, and Baldwin.</p>

I told her I was in a hurry, and had got no money, in order to get rid of her. She asked me to give her something to drink, I gave her some halfpence; she still kept hold of me, and put her hands round me; I found her hand in my pocket, on looking round-it was turned out; there was a clean shirt in it, and the rest of the things stated in the indictment. I caught hold of her, and gave her in charge. My comb, seal, and 4s. was found on her. I saw her drop 4s.6d. as she went along - I picked it up. I went no where with her.</p>

Morris had something covered over in his apron. I followed them - They turned up Charterhouse-lane - I lost sight of them for half a minute. I knew Iffgrave before - I caught sight of them again, they were running together; Merris ran into a house, I went in and secured him, and took the cotton out of his apron-Iffgrave was brought back. I asked Morris where it came from? he said, from the linen-draper's, in St. John's-street.</p>

               <p>SECOND COUNT, the same, only stating that he did unlawfully put off the said pieces of counterfeitmoney at the rate of six of such pieces of counterfeit money for the sum of 3s., being a lower rate and value than the said did by their denomination import and were counterfeited for.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FRYER. I am a constable of Lincoln's-inn-fields, appointed by the trustees. I live in Princes-street, Gate-street. In consequence of information which I received on the 6th of December,I met a man of the name of Baker, who is a constable of Lincoln's-inn, and Spruhan; I did not know them before-we did nothing then. I met them again on the 10th; we went to Seven Dials, about six o'clock in the evening, having received instructions from Mr. Powel, an assistant to the Solicitors of the Mint; Mr. Baker gave me two shillings, an eighteen-penny piece, and a half-crown on the 6th of December - They were all marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You went on the 10th to Seven Dials, did you see any body - A.Spruhan left me and Baker together; we all three separated, and Baker stood close by, so that I could see him-Spruhan went down White Lion-court, and returned with the prisoner. Spruhan called me, I went to him, the prisoner was with him; we went to a public-house in Little Earl-street, kept by Owen; Spruhan called for three half-quarterns of gin; we stood at the bar, each drank a glass. Spruhan then said I ought to stand a pot of beer, I said I would; I called for a pot. While we were drinking it, a woman came in, and offered a shilling for a glass of gin; she put it on the bar, the landlord refused it; the prisoner took it up, looked at it, and said it was a very good one of the sort, but what he had was better.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did he say so - A. To Spruhan and me - We stood at the bar, he whispered to us; the shilling was put down, and the woman took it away. The prisoner then took us into the corner of a room, close by the bar, and pulled a counterfeit shilling out of his pocket, as a sample of what he had to dispose of; he said they were all like it. We drank the beer, and came out; we all stood by the side of a court next to the public-house; the prisoner asked me how many I wanted? (meaning how many counterfeit shillings) I told him two dozen; he said he had not got two dozen, he had only eleven, and would let me have them. I told him that I would only take six; he put his hand into his pocket which contained the counterfeit shillings, and gave me six; I then gave him two shillings and an eighteen-penny piece in payment; they were all marked. The rate of dealing was two bad shillings for one good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give him two shillings and an eighteen-penny piece - A. I had no change that was marked. I told him I had given him 3s.6d.; he said he did not know it-Spruhan was there the whole time. The prisoner took the money out of his pocket that I had given him, and said, "You are right, you have given me sixpence too much." He asked Spruhan if he did not want any? Spruhan said, he had no money; he said he would let him have two till the next night, and persuaded him very much to take them; Spruhan declined it. The prisoner went into the same public-house which we had come out of, and got change, and brought sixpence, and gave it to me. We then walked down to Seven Dials. The prisoner asked me if I knew how to make the money ring? I said, no; he told me to lay a knife on the counterfeit money, and put a hot iron on the knife, and then put the money into vinegar when hot, and that would make them ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then - A. Baker and I had agreed, that when I had made the purchase, I was to take my hat off, as a signal for him to come up, and take the prisoner - Baker came up, and took him into custody, and asked him what he had been doing? he said, nothing. Baker tried to push him into a shop, which he did; and in going in, the prisoner threw a parcel of counterfeit money about the ground-Baker picked it up. He searched him, and I believe he found four-pence or five-pence in halfpence on him. He threw good and bad money down. I was by his side - I saw the marked money in Baker's hand; Baker searched me, and took from me the six counterfeit shillings I had taken of the prisoner, and the good half-crown, which was marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you besides a constable of Lincoln's-inn-fields - A. No business. I have been a constable for ten months, before that I went to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever before this circumstance been engaged in buying counterfeit coin, or detecting people who uttered it - A. Not before the 17th of November. I have since that been engaged in it by Mr. Powell - I never knew the prisoner before. The public-house is the sign of the Rose and Three Tuns. Spruhan paid for the gin. The marked money had been in my possession ever since the 6th of December. Spruhan was with us, and could hear all that was said. He was not examined before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate of the woman's offering the bad shilling - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140057"/>Q. On your oath did you not tell the magistrate that you neither knew the sign of the house, nor the landlord's name - A. I did - I have since found them out. We did not go into any room; he took me into a corner-there was nobody else in the room when I told him I gave him sixpence too much; he did not say, take another shilling, but got change, and gave me a good sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the marked money found - A. No; one of the shillings I had given him was missing.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where do your friends live - A. At Battle-bridge. My father is gardener of Lincoln's-inn, and has been so for fifteen years. I went to sea at fifteen years of age. I do not remember where I lived last - I have never, in particular, been out of a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you learn what the rate of dealing was for bad money - A. From Spruhan-nothing passed between the prisoner and me about it. When I was before the magistrate I answered the questions that were put to me. Spruhan has got two thumbs on one hand.</p>

            . I am a special constable, sworn in to attend on the Lord Chancellor. On the 10th of December I went to the Seven Dials, with Fryer and Spruhan. After stopping about five minutes, I saw Spruhan, Fryer, and the prisoner together; I was at the corner of White Lion-street - they came up White Lion-street; Fryer joined Spruhan and the prisoner; they went into the Rose and Three Tuns, public-house, in Earl-street - I was nearly opposite the house; they staid there about twenty minutes-all three came out together, and stood at the corner of Monmouth-court, conversing some time, the prisoner and Fryer in particular. In a few minutes I saw something exchanged between the prisoner and Fryer. In two or three minutes after that Spruhan left them; I saw the prisoner go back again to the public-house - He came out in a moment, and Fryer gave me a signal; they went into Earl-street, and staid at the door of a chandler's shop, talking together. I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he was about? I told him I was a constable, and that I thought he was doing something wrong; I told him he must go into the shop, and after a great deal of resistance on his part, I saw him trying to get his hand into his right hand breeches pocket, I got him into the shop; as he went down the step he pulled something out of his right hand breeches pocket, and dropped it just as he went into the shop. I picked up five counterfeit shillings - I searched him, and found, in his waistcoat pocket, one eighteen-penny piece, and one shilling, which were marked, I had marked them; I knew them to be the same that I gave Fryer, and told him how he was to use them; I found four-pence in halfpence on him. I asked Fryer what he had been about? he said, nothing; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket I found a piece of paper, containing six counterfeit shillings, and the marked half-crown, which I had previously given him. I had also given him two shillings and an eighteen-penny piece. I asked Fryer whom he got the bad money of? he said, of the prisoner - They were close together-the prisoner heard it and did not deny it; he said he had reigned long enough, or something of that kind. I took him to Marlborough-street. I produce the money that the prisoner dropped, and what I found on Fryer. The shilling and the eighteen-penny piece are the same I gave to Fryer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORDEN. I never saw him before. I had received directions about a fortnight before to detect utterers of counterfeit coin, from Mr. Powell. I have assisted in convicting utterers two or three times. I first saw Spruhan about a fortnight before. I understood Spruhan knew the prisoner before. Mr. Powell and Spruhan told me that the prisoner was an utterer a few days before the 10th. I did not see Spruhan after I had taken the prisoner - I saw them all three together in the public-house. Fox went back alone to the house-Spruhan left before I went up to Fox; I saw something pass between Fox and Fryer. I saw Spruhan before the examination - I do not think he was examined. The prisoner dropped the six shillings inside the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you did not like to give evidence about this, and that you would give your evidence very short, because you did not like to be cross-examined - A. I never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. REVNOLDS. Q.Was your first acquaintance with Spruhan through Mr. Powell - A. Yes; every transaction with him was under Mr. Powell's direction.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SPRUHAN. I have known the prisoner since last December. A man of the name of Leonard introduced me to him. I gave information to Mr. Powell about the prisoner, and Mr. Powell introduced me to Baker and Fryer. We went together to the Seven Dials. Baker stepped on one side, and I and Fryer went on to White Lion-street - Fox lodges in a cellar there. Fryer stopped two or three doors off; he lived about twenty yards down the street. I went to Fox's lodging-he came out with me, and asked me what kept me till then? I had promised to meet him on the Sunday before, to purchase counterfeit money. I told him I had been to Teddington to see my child. We came up as far as the Seven Dials. I told him there was a particular friend of mine, who wanted a few things, if he could give him them - He said if he did I should come with the person myself. Fryer was quite handy at the time - I told him so, called Fryer to him, and told him that was the man I wished to recommend to him; he said,</p>
               <p>"very well." All three went together into a public-house in Earl-street - I asked for a quartern and a half of gin; we all drank of it. After that I told Fryer that he should stand a pot of beer, by way of footing for the recommendation - He did so. While we were drinking it, a woman came in, called for a glass of liquor, and tendered a connterfeit shilling for it, which was refused. I took it up and looked at it; Fryer did the same, and so did the prisoner, and laid it down again-the woman said she would get it changed. We pushed up close to the door. The prisoner took a counterfeit shilling from his pocket, and said the other was a good one of the sort, but the one he produced was better, and all he had were so too, The pot of beer being nearly drank, I said I could stop no longer, as I had left only my child at home-the prisoner said it was time enough. We paid for the beer, went outside the door, and stood at the end of Monmouth-court; the prisoner then asked Fryer how many he wanted? he said, two dozen; he said he could not let him have two dozen then, as he had only ten or eleven about him. Fryer said as he was not flush in them, half a dozen would do for him that night, as it was late. He took a paper from his pocket, out of which he counted six counterfeit shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140058"/>and gave them to Fryer, who gave him 2s. and a 1s.6d. piece, which the prisoner put into his pocket, and asked me if I was going to have any myself? I told him I had no money, nor time to pass them that night, but would meet him next evening at the Seven Dials. I wished him good night and went home, leaving him and Fryer together. Baker was on the other side of the street, and could see us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I never knew Fox till the 5th of December, and had known Fryer and Baker about a fortnight before. I have known Mr. Powell four years, and during that time have transacted business of this sort. I have known Leonard ever since August, 1816.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tempt Leonard to deal in the same way - A. I do not know a man of the name of Cubit, nor ever had any conversation with him about selling him bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. When Leonard introduced you to the prisoner, what was your conversation - A.He told Fox he introduced me as a friend.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, or did you not, undertake to supply the prisoner with counterfeit money, if he would put it off - A. Never. I never had the counterfeit shillings in my hand. I live in Bedfordbury. I have been to the prisoner's house since his confinement.</p>

            . I am principal assistant to the Solicitors of the Mint, and have been so for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the three witnesses who have been examined - A. I was. I gave them directions to detect persons who utter counterfeit coin. I introduced Baker and Fryer to Spruhan for the purpose, and gave them directions how to proceed. They reported to me that the prisoner was taken up - I conducted the prosecution, and brought forward such evidence as I thought proper before the magistrate. I had a particular reason for not bringing Spruhan forward. I look at the five shillings found on the prisoner, and those picked off the ground - They are all counterfeit, and of the same die - They are an imitation of the current coin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have known Spruhan many years - He introduced himself to me. I first saw him at a police office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the latter end of November Leonard and I were in a public-house, and the man with two thumbs on one hand came in, and talked with us - He went out, and Leonard told me his name was Spruhan. I never saw him again till he called on me on the 10th of December, he then gave me a parcel, and asked me to go and drink with him - He pointed out Fryer as we were going along; he said he was a friend of his, and that he would be thankful to me to give him (Fryer) what he asked me for out of this paper - I did not know what was in it. Fryer joined us - We went to the public-house, and came out. Fryer said he wanted two or three dozen out of what I had got for him. I opened the paper, and found it contained shillings. While I was counting them he said six would do - I gave him six; he gave me 3s.6d., and then said he had given me 6d. too much - I returned him 6d.; soon after, the constable came up and took me. A mob came round, and in the scufile they knocked the other five shillings out of my hand.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY CORBETT. I am a labourer, and work for Mr. Day, a builder, in Compton-street. I know Spruhan.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of December, did you see the prisoner, Fox, anywhere - A. Yes, I saw him going towards the Seven Dials, with Spruhan and a man in a blue coat - I did not know the prisoner before. Knowing Spruhan, made me follow them. I saw Spruhan give Fox a paper parcel out of his pocket. They went about a hundred yards up the street; Spruhan put his hand up, and the man in the blue coat went to them; they went into the public-house at the corner of Monmouth-court, I went in after them, and stood behind them all the while; they called for gin. I followed them out, and then went to market; when I returned I saw a mob at the chandler's shop, and saw the man in a blue coat. I told the people what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going when you first went out - A. To market. I had no other reason for following them than knowing Spruhan. I never saw Fox before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What market did you go to - A. It is what I call market-it is below Marlborough-street, I do not know the name of it. I have been in the habit of going to it for twenty years - I forget the name.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the public-house - A. It is about half way to Smithfield; I can go there in ten minutes-it was between five and six o'clock on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember its being on a Thursday - A. Because I go to market every day. They could see me in the public-house. I heard of Fox being taken up a week ago. I did not ask what was the matter at the chandler's shop. Three gentlemen told me to come here in the prisoner's behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now remember the name of the market - A. I think it is Clare-market. Lumber-court is in the way from it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now you say it is Clare-market; you said it was not further than from here to Smithfield - A. No.</p>

               <p>RICHARD VAUGHAN. I live in Windmill-street, and deal in waste ivory. The prisoner, Laing came to me, and said he had a lot of ivory to sell, and if I would meet him at the New Inn, in Tottenham-court-road, at ten o'clock the next morning, I should see it. I went, and the prisoner, Gibbs, came to me there, and asked me if I was looking for a tall young man, dressed in blue? I said, Yes. He told me he could shew me the articles, and took me to the corner of Norton-street - Grindley opened the door. They took me up stairs, and shewed me the ivory, which was in the wainscot between the first and second floors-it appeared like a cupboard - I should not have thought of finding any thing there; it was s secret place. They shewed me about a hundred weight of ivory-Grindley and Gibbs only were present. I bought 23lbs. at 2s. per pound - They brought it to my house. Next morning they brought 90lbs. more, which I said I would sell for them, if I could - I bought 50lbs. of it; the remainder was taken away. Grindley and Laing brought it, and I paid them for it by a little at a time. The prosecutor saw it about a week afterwards, and claimed what I had left of it.</p>

Grindley sent to me from Newgate, I went to him - He said he was starving, and asked me to pay him the remainder, I refused - He said I should get no good by it. I did not know them before.

I asked them what business they were? they said they were cabinet-makers. They brought about 40lbs. down that evening. I questioned them how they came by it? they at last said they were commissioned to sell it, and gave different accounts. I said, it did not appear that they came honestly by it, but if they would bring the proprietor, I would buy it. They never came again.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Adam and Eve-court, Oxford-street. On the 30th of November I met the prisoner, Laing, and another man, in Berwick-street - I knew him before. He said a friend of his had got some ivory to sell. I told him to call on me the next morning, which he did, and said it belonged to his friend's mother. I said I wanted a little. He asked if Mr. Langfield (who is my master), would buy any. He said he had sold some to Kinsman and Vaughan, but his friend's mother was very ill, and wanted ready money for it - I told him my master would give him ready money. He took me to Marylebone-street to see it. Just as I got to the door, I met Grindley; he said it was his mother's house, but she was in the country. Laing left me. Grindley shewed me four pieces of ivory, which weigbed about 60lbs. I bought about three-quarters of a pound of him for 2s.6d. I recommended him to Laban to sell some.</p>

On the 16th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a little girl about nine years old, and asked to look at some remnants. I was waiting on another customer, and saw her take the shawl off the counter, and give it to the little girl; the girl put it under her shawl. The prisoner sat on the stool, and the little girl was by her. In a few minutes she looked at the girl-the girl then went out. When she got to the door, I went round, brought her back, and took the shawl from under her arms, covered with her shawl. The prisoner said the child was her daughter. I sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pike. I was waiting on the prisoner - She had a little girl with her. I shewed the prisoner several remnants, all of which she said were too dear. I saw her take the shawl off the counter, put it under her cloak, and then set on a stool. I did not see her give it to the child. The child was brought back, and the shawl taken from her-the prisoner said it was her child. The shawl I was dropped just behind the child at the time.</p>

The waggon turned up the yard, and the prisoners followed it up the gateway before I could get inside the yard. They soon came running out-Wingate had the bag in his apron. I collared him, and told the other he had better stop, for I should soon have him again - I told another person to take him. The bag contained hemp-seed. I am sure they were in company.</p>
               <p>THOMAS OKELL. I am a lathrender, and live in St. John-street, opposite the Windmill Inn. I saw the prisoners coming out of the yard-Wingate had the bag in his apron - I took Lee.</p>

On the 23d of December, about five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoners, together, in Crawford-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140062"/>street. Lee had the meat on his back - I asked what they had got? both answered that it was beef, belonging to Toms, a butcher, at Paddington, and they were going to sell it for him at Newgate-market. I took them to the watch-house. The beef weighed nine stone six pounds.</p>

               <p>EDWARD HEALEY. I keep a public-house in Rosemary-lane, and am a customer to Rand and Abbott. The prisoner was in their service, and has sold me goods for them. In October last I owed the house between 4l. and 5l.; he called upon me to collect; he said his employers told him to keep the account short. He told me to pay a man who was with him 30s., and he would call again in a few days for 50s., and give me a receipt for the whole. I paid the man 30s.; he afterwards called, and I paid him 50s.; he gave me a receipt for the whole.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He delivered the goods in the name of Rand and Abbott. I paid the man the money in his presence. I paid him some shillings - I believe it was all in silver.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Rand and Abbott. The prisoner was their dray clerk-his business was to attend the dray, and collect money. He never accounted for 30s. received in October from Healey, which he ought to have done; he kept a book which I have - I turn to October, there is no entry of it. He used to account to me every night for what he received.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe he used to push the trade, and was to have an advantage.</p>

On the 5th of January, about half-past eight o'clock, I came home, and missed a quarter of mutton and ribs of beef - I saw it safe when I went out at half-past seven. I left the shop-door bolted-it was a latch door, the upper part was open. On the Wednesday evening following I saw them at Shadwell office - I am sure it was the same meat by the skewers I put in it. I found a stick by the door, with a hook in it.</p>

On the 5th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw a black man in Church-lane, with a bundle under his arm - I crossed over to him, he turned into a public-house - I followed him into the passage, and took the prisoner; the meat was on the stairs in a bag.
