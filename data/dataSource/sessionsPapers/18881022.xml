                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and member of the firm of Taylor, Mason, and Co., of 15, Furnival's Inn—we were acting as solicitors for the plaintiff and one of the defendants in the suit of Fry <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Fry, an administration action in the Chancery Division—part of the property, the subject of the action, is leasehold property at Newington—the greater part of the ground rents have to be paid to the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum—before 11th February last year Mr. Earle was receiver of the estate; he died in December, 1886—upon his death the defendant was appointed receiver on 11th February, 1887, under an order which is in Court; under that order the defendant was to account in the chambers of Mr. Justice Stirring on 22nd November in each year; he would have to produce his accounts and vouchers as receiver in order that the Chief Clerk's certificate might be obtained—the 22nd November, 1887, was the first date on which he had to account—a notification was sent to him by our firm to bring in his account—he did not account on that day—I interviewed him personally before that day—he made various excuses for not bringing in the account—he said that a fire had occurred at the office of Mr. Barry, a solicitor, next door to his chambers, and that the vouchers of the account had been drenched in water and most of them spoiled, and he would have to obtain duplicates of them in order to vouch his account, but that he would bring in the account very soon—that interview was somewhere between 20th December and the end of the year—I saw him more than once, and I think I wrote to him more than a dozen letters—I had answers to those letters, they are here—his account was not lodged until April—it is the practice to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188810220004"/>
               <p>verify the account by an affidavit—I prepared an affidavit for the defendant to swear, this is it, and this is the account referred to in it—this is a draft of the account that was prepared by the prisoner, it was sent to me a few days before the account was lodged—I am not prepared to swear positively to the prisoner's handwriting—in the account, under the head of payments and allowances, item 14 is, "27th March, 1887, Licensed Victuallers' Asylum, half-year's ground rent 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less tax 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., balance 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" item 34, on October 12th, 1887, is "Licensed Victuallers' Asylum, half-year's ground rent 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less tax 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., balance 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on 27th April an appointment was made to vouch—on that day I saw a man named Raven, and on that day or the day previous he gave me the vouchers—I knew at that time that Raven was the prisoner's clerk, I now know that he is his brother—the prisoner did not attend before the Chief Clerk on 27th April—Raven did not attend the vouching; it is not usual for the receiver to attend personally—I produced the vouchers before Mr. Boyle, clerk to the Chief Clerk—the whole of the accounts were vouched, except the two items in question; the matter was adjourned till 4th May to complete the vouching by the production of the vouchers of those two items—I do not remember whether I saw the prisoner between 27th April and 4th May, I saw Raven, the clerk—I wrote to the prisoner several times between those dates—I wrote to the prisoner before 4th May—I served a notice to produce on the prisoner on Saturday last—I have a press copy of the letter—immediately after the appointment on 27th April I went to the prisoner's office and saw Raven—on 4th May I wrote to the prisoner, I got no answer—I saw Raven that morning, and he gave me these duplicates of the missing vouchers of items 14 and 34—I attended the appointment in the afternoon for the vouching, and I produced those two vouchers before Mr. Boyle—the account was then completely vouched, and thereupon the Chief Clerk certified that 367<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due from the prisoner—the original certificate is in Court—it is usual to send the vouchers back to the receiver, that was done; I enclosed them in a letter on the afternoon of 4th May—I read the two vouchers, they were marked "duplicate," and purported to be signed for or on behalf of the Licensed Victualler' Asylum, and they were vouchers for the two payments 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., stamped with an impressed stamp, and in perfect order; they were partly in writing and partly printed—after the 4th of May I had some conversation with Mr. Weston, the accountant to the Licensed Victualler' Asylum, and on 28th May I applied to the Court for an order on the defendant to file his account on 8th June, and that order is in Court discharging the prisoner from the office of receiver—this signature to the original affidavit is in the prisoner's handwriting—I addressed all my letters to "T. S. Hunting don, Esq"—I was told somewhere between April and June that the prisoner's real name was Raven.</p>

I am a tailor at 20, Spring Street, Paddington—last December I knew Gigner, and I knew the female defendant under the name of Mrs. Gordon Baillie; she was then living at 32, Eastbourne Terrace—previous to 28th December, Gigner called and represented himself as an indoor servant; he said he thought he had got a situation with a Mrs. Gordon Baillie, and asked me to give him a card, as he wanted to get me to make him the livery—he said she was a rich lady from Australia, with large estates in Lancashire—he afterwards called and said he had got the situation, and I called on the female defendant and took patterns for her to select—she said she wanted a suit for her indoor servant, Gigner—she selected green cloth, and I measured him, made the suit and an extra waistcoat, and charged 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my account was sent in about a week afterwards—I have never been paid—I have not applied for the money; they had gone, and left no address.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, stated that, although it was a remarkable coincidence that he should get the note, it came into his possession from the bookmaker He stated that the letter was upstairs tied up in a bundle for a certain walk, and he was at work downstairs, and that it would have to pass through 10 or 12 different hands before it got to Hampstead, and there were plenty of chances of it being stolen before it got there.</p>

I am now living at Stevondale Street, Canning Town—for many years I was in the prisoner's employment as a milk carrier—lately he has kept a small general shop at 248, Manchester Road, Isle of Dogs, Poplar, where milk was sold—he was living there with his wife—on Friday, the day before Saturday, the 18th August, he and his wife were rowing—the prisoner was drunk the best part of that week—he was always quarrelling when drunk—I do not remember any particular expression that he used to her that week, only swore at her and hit her—on Saturday, 18th August, I went out on my round about a quarter to 7—the prisoner went out before me, about half-past 6—I returned about half-past 8—the prisoner was sober at a quarter to 7—I saw him about a quarter to 9; he was then about half drunk—he went out about that time—I saw Mrs. Bartlett at the time; she had been crying, and seemed distressed—I went out again, and came back a few minutes past 12—the prisoner was then in the yard—he told me he had had a fall a few weeks before, and it was bleeding afresh, and he asked me to put a piece of paper on it for him; he was then drunk—he went back to the house, and about 10 minutes to I he asked his wife for eighteen pence—she said <hi rend="italic">"</hi> No"; he had some in the morning, and she would not give him any—I did not hear him say anything, he went out—I was away from the house between 1 and 2, back again at 2, and I next saw the prisoner about half-past 2—he was then sitting in the arm-chair in the parlour, drunk—I went away and returned about half-past 5, the prisoner was in the same place, drunk—</p>

               <p>between 8 and 9 that night I had been down to the coal-cellar to break up some coal and coke for the Sunday morning—a hammer was kept there for that purpose, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the hammer—while I was there breaking up the coke, the prisoner came to the top of the stairs and asked what I was doing—I told him I was breaking the coal and coke up—he said "What hammer have you got?"—I said "The hammer I always use"—he was a little more sober then—after that I went up to the kitchen, leaving the hammer in the cellar; about 9 or a few minutes after I heard them quarrelling in the shop—I could not exactly hear what they said; I heard words between them, I heard the prisoner throwing the shutters about inside and outside the shop—he took them outside first and then took them up and threw them back into the passage; I did not see him, I heard him, he did not shut up the shop—I shut it up about 11, I found the best part of the shutters lying inside on the floor; he came down into the kitchen with a jug with ginger-beer and milk in it—he drank some and wanted me and the little boy to have some; the last I saw of him was about 11, after I had shut up the shop and was going up to bed—I did him good night, he was then sitting in the armchair in the parlour—his wife was there, he was then about half drunk—he was drinking the ginger-beer and milk at the time—I shared my bedroom with a man named French and the boy Still—Still was in bed, French had not come in—the prisoner and his wife slept in the next room, the front, and ours was the back—I could hear them speak, but not what was said; the prisoner came up to bed a few minutes before his wife, she came up about a-quarter past 11—I could hear them talking, but could not hear what they said—it was more friendly than rowing, it seemed friendly and quiet; I went off to sleep—between 4 and 5 in the morning I was awoke by the prisoner coming into my room—he asked French if he had got any drink—French said no, he had forgot to bring any; the prisoner shook hands with French and said "Good-bye, you won't see me no more alive"—he then went back to his own room, he seemed sober then—in about twenty minutes he came into our room again, and again bid French good-bye; he then came to me and said "Good-bye, Tom, I have done for my missis, and I am going to do for myself"—he shook hands with me and went out of the room—I had not heard any sounds in his room; I did not see any injury about him when he came in the second time, he, seemed much the same then as to drink, but paler—he came back a third time, in about ten minutes, and called out to French "Ben"—he then had a razor in his hand and his throat was gashed—he then turned and went back to his own room; at that time I awoke Still—he got up and went into the prisoner's room—I put on some clothes and went in after him—he was sitting on the side of the bed and his missis was lying in bed—Still went and shook her and called her—she did not answer—she was breathing, but was not sensible—she was in her nightdress—I noticed that the left side of her head was knocked in, and there was blood on her head on the pillow, up the wall, and on the ceiling—she never moved or spoke; I then went upstairs and called the lodgers, and then went for Dr Smythe—the prisoner made a gurgling noise in his throat in the room, but did not speak to understand him—I know this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was generally kept in a little box in a shed in the yard, and was used for cutting leather for boots—this razor is the</p>

I have not been in bed again until 2 o'clock this morning"—the prisoner was present—they were quarrelling about a quartern of gin—the prisoner wanted 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more for drink—she said "You won't have it out of me this day if I know it"—he said "You——cow, I will mark you for this to-night"—he flew to go to the cakes to take them out to sell, she went to stop him taking them, and he up with his foot and kicked her in a dangerous part—she ran round the parlour into the shop—he got the iron bar in his hand that was used for the blind, and raised it two or three times, and got very excited; she raised the flap of the counter, and got a knife—nothing was said, but in the meantime the boy Still came to the gate—the prisoner flow to the gate to make a hit at Still—I said "For God's sake, Walter, take care that he does not hit you," and his wife said "If he hits you with that bar go for a policeman"—he did not hit him; he threw the bar down, this was just about 11 o'clock; after that ho took the bell of the gate, snapped the piece of iron off, and threw the bell at her—it missed her—she ran after him, and he took the gate off the hinges and threw it at her, and said "You——cow, pick that up," and ran out into the street—he went out twice to get drink in the meantime—11 45 that morning was the last time I saw him till I was called up by Still about 5 30 on the Sunday morning—I then went to the house, and saw my sister lying on the bed—she was breathing, but she died shortly after—when the prisoner said he would cut her head off he was drunk, but he has said it when sober, and laughed at it; he has a brother named <hi rend="italic">Jim;</hi> I don't know anything of him.</p>

               <p>to the hospital; he was very violent—I took possession of the hammer the razor, and the knife—the hone was on the top of the cupboard; there were strokes on it as if something had recently been sharpened on it—the case of the razor was on the dressing-table—the blade of the razor was covered with blood—it was handed to me by Doe—it was taken out of his hand—the razor case was on the dressing-table—I noticed the stains on the hammer and knife—the prisoner was taken to the Poplar Hospital—I put him under the charge of a constable—he remained there until 27th September, when I went to the hospital, and took him into custody—I told him he would be charged with killing his wife—I also said that the Coroner's jury had returned a verdict of wilful murder against him—I also told him he would be charged with attempting to take his own life—he said "All right; how are they all in the Island?"—I said "Very well"—he said "Well, the firm is not cracked up yet"—the hammer weighs 81/2lb.</p>

I live at 40, Horseferry Road, Westminster—I am married; the prisoner is my brother, he is 65 or 66 years old—I have a sister named Emma Perkins; I had another sister named Ellen, she is dead—about four years ago Emma Perkins was brought before a Magistrate charged with trying to drown herself in the canal in the Kent Road, and she would have been drowned had it not been for assistance coming and fetching her out; I became surety for her and the Magistrate discharged her—my sister Ellen twice attempted to poison herself—the prisoner is my full brother, we had the same father and mother—he has been a soldier in the Crimea, in the name of Freeman—about 16 years ago he was in the London Hospital for seven weeks; a hook got under his knee in pulling him up, he would have been killed if he had not been caught by the hook; it was in the Docks, in unloading—ever since that I have noticed an alteration in his manner, he has not appeared the same man at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That happened in October, 1872—the actual injury was a lacerated knee; he was discharged cured, but he was doctored for a long time afterwards; he had a straight waistcoat on when I went to see him in the London Hospital—he has drank very freely for years—up to the time of this occurrence he lived with his wife and carried on business—he came to see me in his shirt-sleeves, like mad—there are nine of us in family, six girls and three boys—in July, 1884, one of my sisters tried to drown herself—she was 34 years old—she had had a few words with her husband; I was not there, I was sent for—she afterwards went back to her husband and is living now, but she is not always right—my other sister has been dead 14 years, she was about 25 when she died; she tried to take poison twice; the first time was about 19 years ago, I don't know the cause of it, it was trouble—we never knew what she died of.</p>

I live at 71, Manchester Road—I am churchwarden of Christ Church, Poplar—I have known the prisoner about 15 years—he went by the name of Dick Freeman, that was all I knew him by; he was always very strange in his character all the time I knew him—he has been a teetotaler for a long time, and he was more strange then than when he was drunk—it was connected with his work in Millwall Docks I saw his strangeness, but I could not illustrate it exactly just now, he was a ganger; I can only say he was very strange and eccentric, that was always the impression on my mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a few years before the murder that he abstained from drink; I should think six or seven years ago—I never knew that he was a heavy drinker—I don't believe that he has been a heavy drinker, not even recently—I have seen him nearly every day up to the time of this occurrence; he was not a free drinker during that time; I don't believe it was the quantity of drink that affected him, I don't know how much he did drink—I have not seen him the worse for drink during the last three months—half a pint sometimes will make a person drunk; I know his habit was to have a glass or two now and then.</p>

               <p>Edinburgh University—I have known the prisoner between 4 and 5 years—I have attended him—my opinion is that he is not quite sane, even when sober I could not honestly say he was quite sane, when drunk he is a dangerous lunatic—that is my experience of him—several times when driving I have seen him come up with an unmeaning grin on his face, put his arms round the horse's mouth and kiss it, and sometimes he would take the foam from the horse's mouth and put it into his own—he was quite sober then, but strange in his actions—for instance, he came up to me on one occasion and struck me a very hard blow—I looked straight at him to see if he was angry, and he appeared perfectly friendly, and there were no symptoms of liquor, he could stand, walk, and speak accurately—I attended him once for a dislocated arm—I found him sitting in a chair, I bandaged his arm up, and visited him again one or two days afterwards, he had then taken off all the bandages and wrappings, and either by accident or design taken the head of the bone out of the socket, which hung loosely by his side, and he was looking at it rather complacently; that occurred on two occasions with reference to the same injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I was 12 years old last birthday—the prisoner is my stepfather—up to 29th September I was living with him and my mother at 11, Regent's Gardens, Westminster—three or four months back he came from the Westminster Hospital, where he had been for some little time; he afterwards went to the Convalescent Home; he returned from there some weeks ago—after that he was very strange, he seemed to have something the matter with him; there was a great difference in him—he used to say to my mother that she let men into the house; she denied it, but he went on repeating it—he used to strike matches by day and night to look for the men; that was about 8th September—before he came from the hospital they lived happily, but after wards unhappily, by always making these accusations, that led to disagreements between them—on Saturday, 29th September, my brother fetched me about four in the afternoon—mother was there—the prisoner was going to hit me with a stick—he stopped in till he had tea, then he went upstairs to see if there were any men in the house; he came down in about ten minutes, and then seemed quite quiet; he then went out—he returned between 8 and 9, and told me to go to bed—mother was out then—he asked where she was; I said I did not know—I then went to bed, leaving him downstairs—I afterwards heard my door open and heard him moving about the house—I don't think mother had come home—the next thing I heard was a knocking at the front door I came down and saw Mrs. Redding—on my way down I looked into the sitting-room and saw mother lying on the floor; I called to her and she did not answer—I lot Mrs. Redding in and went back to the room; mother was still lying on the floor, and I saw a lot of blood round her head; she was dead—the prisoner came in and looked and then went and fetched a policeman.</p>

I live next door to the prisoner—I have known him living there twelve months—about 10 minutes to 11 on Saturday night, 29th September, I heard someone walk downstairs in the next house—immediately after I heard a scuffle in the front room and heard a woman call out "Oh, don't!"—I went with my wife to the front door, and heard a <hi rend="italic">thud,</hi> as from somebody falling on the floor; then all was quiet; as we got to the door I saw the prisoner leave the house by the front door; he slammed it after him and walked hurriedly away—after that I and my wife went and knocked at the front door; it was opened by the last witness; in consequence of what he said I went for a constable, returned and went into the front room ground floor, where I saw the dead body of the woman; I at once recognised her, and saw that her throat had been cut.</p>

S., 38, Vincent Square I was called to the house, and found the woman dead lying on her right side, her right arm extended, and her head resting on it—there was a large quantity of blood round about her head on the floor—her dress was also stained with blood—I turned her partially over, undid the upper part of her dress, and found two gashes in her neck, one merely a flesh wound; the other went nearly back to the spinal column; that was the fatal wound—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with this knife—I did not see the prisoner till at the police-court—his trousers were shown to me there; they had stains on them, which I think were blood stains.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the E district of St. George's Union—on 14th August I received a warrant from the Magistrate to examine the prisoner as to his condition of mind—I made that examination on 17th August, his wife being present—she complained that after he came from the Convalescent Hospital he had an uncontrollable desire to have constant intercourse with her when she was six months in the family way, and she believed he was not himself, and felt it necessary to apply to the relieving officer to have him examined—she said otherwise he was a kind and affectionate husband, always sober, and very regular at his work—he had just returned from his work when I examined him—I spoke to him, and remonstrated with him, and suggested his discontinuing living with his wife—after arguing the point some little time he consented to do so at once, and under those conditions I reported to the Magistrate that I thought this would answer the necessities of the case, especially at the earnest request of his wife that I would not have him locked up—I had him under examination three-quarters of an hour, but could not find any thing wrong about him, but there was a little wildness about his eyes, and his manner was rather morose—both of those are very often accompaniments of insanity—I put it to him that such was the case—he said "Well, that may or may not be; she will say anything; she can do as she pleases"—afterwards he said "Well, I will go away, and that will settle it," and I thought it would.</p>

I was house physician at Westminster Hospital in July last—the prisoner was there as a patient in the Burdett ward from 23rd June till July—he was suffering from pneumonia with pleurisy—he made a very fair recovery—during the time he was there I noticed there were peculiarities of his mind, consequently I directed particular attention to him—his wife visited him from time to time—she made a statement to the nurse, which was afterwards communicated to me—he was very melancholy, and judging from subsequent visits I diagnosed his condition as melancholia—that is a well-known form of insanity—I have no doubt now that he was suffering from melancholia.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to Her Majesty's Gaol at Holloway, and have been so about three years—I have seen a great many cases of insanity among the prisoners—when a prisoner comes in charged with murder I pay especial attention to the state of his mind—I first saw the prisoner on 2nd October; he was admitted on the 1st—I saw him with very few exceptions every day—I have spoken to him many times with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188810220052"/>
               <p>a view of ascertaining the state of his mind—in my judgment he is insane; he suffers from delusions—he is under the delusion that he heard many voices speaking to him, neighbours and friends to his wife, saying that she ought to be ashamed of herself, that she ought to be killed, that men had been running in and out of his house all day, and that they had given her a good doing while he was away at the hospital; that seven or eight different men used to have connection with her of a night—he was also under the delusion that she drugged his beer at supper, which caused him to sleep profoundly, and then that she used to have connection with men while he was actually lying by her side; that she used to make signs at the window, and let them in on the sly—he was also under the delusion of persecution, that while he was living away from her at four different lodgings she used to cause his landlady to annoy him by putting stuff in his boots, which he described as naphtha, which caused his feet to ache and burn, and that men used to watch and follow him about—he said he slept very badly, and he complained very much of aching gripping pains in his forehead, whioh he does still—I have no doubt whatever that these are genuine delusions—this excessive desire is very often an early sign of insanity; melancholia is undoubtedly a species of insanity—he is now perfectly able to appreciate what goes on in Court—at the time he committed this act I do not think he was capable of distinguishing right from wrong, or that he knew the nature and quality of the act he did—he has always behaved well in the gaol—from the history he gave of himself this has been gradually progressing for some years, but it has been worse since his illness.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This carriage was the third from the break—I was at the back—there were about five carriages in front of this—I am not far from my break as a rule when the train is about to start—I may be at my break or I may be at a carriage a long way from it—I am responsible for the train—at Kentish Town, when I saw the three men on the plat form, I said "What do you want to be out here for? get back again; there is no time"—I spoke rather sharply—the deceased did not tell me that he wanted to go to another carriage; that was at St. Pancras—I saw him apparently trying to open the door, and I said "What do you want?"—he said "I want to go to my friends"—that might be five minutes before the train started—I understood that they were all of the same party—he did not say why he wanted to go there, no more than he wanted to ride with his friends—I said "Stay where you are; you have more room there, and you will be better where you are"—I did not try the door then—I saw that he could not turn the handle—I only saw two men on the platform at Kentish Town—I did not see the third one on the platform; the two might be as far as the door of the next compartment—I saw that they did get into the same smoking compartment, and I saw the door shut, and gave the signal for the train to start—there was nothing to attract my attention at Bedford when I saw only one man in the compartment; the window was down—if a man in that compartment wanted to get towards the luggage locker he would have to open the door, close it, and then get round it—it opens towards the engine—he would have to close the door before he could get past it—the door does not go quite back against the side of the carriage; there is a strap and indiarubber to protect it—a door is sometimes left open—there would be a few inches space between the door and the side of the tunnel; I can't tell the distance; it is one of the widest tunnels we have—I did not speak to the man at Bedford; I thought he was asleep.</p>

I am a greengrocer, of 4, Duke Street, Kilmarnock—on Wednesday morning, 12th September, at four minutes past 7, I got into the train there to go to Glasgow—George Cowan was a fellow traveller—we got into a third class smoking carriage—the prisoner was there, on the left hand side, the side next the platform as you look towards the engine—we three were the only passengers in that compartment—after we started I commenced chatting with the prisoner—he commenced talking about the Colonies—he said he had come as a stowaway from Sydney, and he commenced to tell us about having a quarrel with a man in the train, and they had a fight, and ultimately they put him out of the window—his words were "I had a quarrel with a gentleman, and I received a blow in the right cheek"—he said after the struggle he opened his coat, and took off his shirts, as they were torn and stained with blood, and throw them out of the window—I asked him what the gentleman was like—he said he was a gruff sort of man, stouter than himself—he opened his coat and vest to show us that he had no shirt on—he said his father was a chemist in Hamilton, and he was going to Paisley Road, Glasgow, before he went home—he had a bottle of what I supposed was whisky, but I did not taste it, in his left hand coat pocket—he offered it me, but I did not take any—I noticed a mark on his right cheek, like a bruise; the skin was not broken—he was wearing a soft felt hat, something like this—the carriage was very wet—there was a little blood on the window next the platform, and a little on the floor opposite the prisoner—I put up the window shortly after we started from Kilmarnock—the mark on the window might be a spit, like a spit out of the mouth, and a hand drawn over it—the stain on the floor seemed to be mixed with water; the floor was very wet—there was not much blood; it was just visible; it covered about 2 or 3 inches—I left the train at Glasgow; the prisoner got out first—my friend and I went about our business at Glasgow—on the following Tuesday, the 18th, I saw Monday's paper, the <hi rend="italic">Scottish Reader,</hi> on my way to Glasgow in the train—in consequence of what I read there about an inquest on a Mr. King I communicated with the police at Glasgow—I made a statement to Inspector Bannister, which was read over to me, and I signed it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

I am a gardener at Dean Mount, Kilmarnock—on Wednesday morning, 12th September, about 7 o'clock, I was with Mr. Mickle at Kilmarnock station, we got into a third class compartment and travelled to Glasgow, the prisoner was in the carriage, no one else—he asked what place this was—I said Kilmarnock—after getting into conversation, he said he had travelled from England and he felt a little fatigued and he drew out his bottle and had a drink, he offered it to me, I tasted it and said it was rum—he told us he had come from Sydney as a stowaway—I told him that Mickle had been in America, so Mickle joined in the conversation for a short time—after that he told us that there had been a man in the compartment when he joined the train in England, and he was sitting at the far end of the compartment, that he seemed to be a strange looking man, and that he was looking very suspiciously at him—every time he moved his body his eyes were fixed upon him—so he took a drink out of his bottle, and then offered it to the stranger, but I can't say whether he took it or not, but he said the stranger was the worse for drink; that after having offered him the drink the stranger asked him if he could do anything with his fists, he replied that he did not know, but he could defend himself—with that the stranger struck him on the side of the right cheek—that he then took off his coat and fought him, and after that he threw him out of the door—I asked him if he did not look to see what had become of the man; he said yes, he looked out and saw him go past, the same as if he was looking for another compartment, and after that he opened up his coat breast, and showed us that he had no shirts on—he was wearing nothing under his coat—I could see that he had no shirt on—I asked him what had become of his shirts—he said he had got them so much torn, dirty and blood-stained that he had taken them off and thrown them out on the rails—that he had two shirts, a coarse one and a fine one or a heavy one and a light one—after that the conversation was about his coming home from Sydney as a stowaway, and that after he had been discovered on board he got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd for his work during the voyage—he said that he was going home to Hamilton to see his father, a druggist there, and that he had been five years out in Sydney—there was a blood stain on the window-glass inside—he said he had got a blow on his mouth from the strange man, and that the blood came from a spit out of his mouth—he said that he was going to call on some party at Glasgow, but I don't remember the name or address—so I told him it would be much better if he could get his face washed, for it looked very dirty, also to try and get a shirt to make himself look respectable with he was going home to see his mother, and I think he said he would try to get a shirt when he went to Glasgow—he was not to say either sober or drunk, like a man half in between—I saw him taking drink, he was not like a man the worse for liquor when we joined the train—that is all I can remember—we got out at St. Enoch's Station, Glasgow—we passed the</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner—on Wednesday morning, 12th September, I went to Haverstock Hill Railway station, and there saw the body of a man that had been found in the tunnel—about two-thirds of the head was removed from the remaining portion, the bones were broken, and the brains scattered about, and part of the left jaw—I afterwards made a more careful examination at the mortuary—the injuries to the head were the cause of death—the hands were dirty, but there was no indication of abrasion or scratches on them—on the right knee there were two small abrasions, the size of about one-tenth of an inch, and also on the left thigh there was a small mark, otherwise the whole body was free from marks—these injuries may have arisen from a fall or by coming in contact with the wall—there must have been great violence to produce the injury to the head—the clothes were intact except a small tear on the left sleeve of the coat, about two-thirds of the way up—it was hardly large enough to have occurred by coming in contact with the tunnel—it was a very small rent, not an inch in length.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The injuries I saw were not such as would have been caused in a fight—I saw no signs of any struggle—if the mark on the cheek was caused by a blow it must have been very slight indeed; it might possibly remain for a few hours; I don't think it would remain as long as 10 hours—it would be likely to remain 10 hours if there was an abrasion.</p>

I am a governess—I live at 6, Anson Road, Tufnell Road—about a quarter to 11 a.m. on 16th September I was walking in Torriano Avenue—the prisoner was walking in front of me on the same side of the street—there was no one else immediately in front of me—I passed him and directly felt something warm on my back—I put my left gloved hand to feel what it was, drew my hand forth, and saw red stuff on my glove; it was a sticky, jammy substance; I tried to Tub it off with my handkerchief, and as I did so the whole of the back of my glove went into a big hole—I then turned round and looked; the prisoner had crossed over and was on the other side going back—I turned back too, keeping on my side of the road—five minutes must have covered all the time—I turned up Leighton Road, he also turning up Leighton Road, only on the other side, still in front of me—I met a con stable in Leighton Road, spoke to him, and he crossed the road with me after the prisoner—I had never seen the prisoner before; he was a perfect stranger to me—I examined my clothing at the station—my dress was a present, so that I don't know its exact value, but I should have to look everywhere to get it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5 guineas, and my handkerchief, and a new pair of gloves were damaged—I estimate the entire damage at over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 179) On Sunday, 16th September, about 10 45 a m., I was on duty in Leighton Road—Miss Brown spoke to me and pointed out the prisoner about 150 yards off going at a fast walking pace—I ran after and stopped him—I told him I should take him in custody for throwing something on the lady's back—he said "It must, be a great mistake, I am a respectable man, how dare you put your hands on me? "I took him to the station, where he produced a small empty bottle, and said "Here is the bottle, I did it"—I searched and found in his right hand trousers pocket another bottle containing liquid; that has been shown to the doctor—I found no marks or stains of any kind on the prisoner's hands or clothing—he gave a false address at first, 592, Holloway Road—I did not go there—when I say it was false somebody else told me—at the station the prisoner was charged with throwing corrosive fluid on Winifred Brown with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm—he said "I admit throwing the stuff, but I must deny the intent to do grievous bodily harm "</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR HOPWOOD</hi>. I am a waiter at the Salisbury Hotel, Salisbury Street, Fleet Street—I was on duty on Saturday night, 29th September, till 12 o'clock—about 4 o'clock p.m. I saw the prisoner come through the coffee-room—the prisoner has stayed at the hotel at previous times during the last eight years, I think, but he has not stayed there for the last three years or thereabouts—it is three or four years since I have served him—I saw nothing more of him about 4—I next saw him about 20 minutes past 9 in the hat and coat lobby, which adjoins the front hall—I went round the front way into the hall, and while there I saw him lift this long overcoat (<hi rend="italic">A brown coat, produced</hi>) off a peg in the hat and coat lobby and walk out of the hotel—I followed and said to him "I think that you have made a mistake; that coat is not yours;" he said "Oh yes, it is"—I said "I happen to know to whom it belongs;" he said "Perhaps it is not mine; mine is either at Anderton's or at my office, 7, Water Lane; "I said "You had better come back, and I will send for the manager and you can explain it to him"—I went back with the prisoner and sent for the manager, Mr. Barton—in my presence the prisoner had been requested to leave the hotel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was on the Sunday previous to this when he asked for a room—that was the only time—during the last three years he has been there once a month, or not so often—he has not stayed there within twelve months I am certain—his things were detained once for his unpaid bill, and eventually he paid the bill and took them out—I do not know that of my own knowledge—I don't think he has friends staying in the hotel occasionally—I know Mr. Bright, of Sheffield; I know he knows the prisoner—I do not know Mr. Treherne, of Bath—he took the coat on to the doorstep outside the hotel—the porter spoke to him besides me, no one else; I spoke first—neither the barmaid nor the lady in the counting-house spoke to him first, I swear: the lady is not here—she spoke to one of the men—I did not hear him make the statement before the Magistrate, that a young lady came up and said "That is not your coat," that he said "Yes, I think it is," and that then he discovered it was not his, and said "No, it is a mistake; it is not mine"—he had the coat on his arm, he had not put it on—the lobby is 4 ft wide, the hall is on one side of it and the coffee-room on the other—it is not necessary to go from the coffee-room to the hall to go through the lobby—not one in a hundred go out that way, there is another way—they go</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188810220075"/>
               <p>to the far end of the coffee-room and come up the hall—there are swing doors between the coffee-room and lobby—if they come from the lavatory, as I saw the prisoner do, they would not come through the lobby into the hall—the prisoner had been in the smoking-room that day asleep in an easy chair—the hat lobby is lighted by one gas jet—I saw the coat hanging up, I cannot say if the outside or inside were showing—it was raining that night—I addressed the prisoner as Mr. Hamilton—I may have said "Whose coat have you got there?"—Anderton's Hotel is five minutes' walk off—to come through the lobby he would have to come by the little office where the barmaid or a lady cashier sits—a door in that office adjoining the lobby is kept open; the prisoner did not come that way, he came from the lavatory through the coffee-room and through the lobby.</p>

I have managed the Salisbury Hotel about four years—the last time the prisoner stayed there was about two years ago—during the last two years he had come once or twice, but we have refused to let him have a room or to have drink—we had good reasons for that—on 29th September I saw him about 4 30, it was light then—he was standing outside a public-house at the side of the hotel, holding up a green overcoat examining the lining—as I approached he went into the public-house—on that afternoon I had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Crampton, of Ilfracombe, for his coat which was stolen—in consequence of what I had seen I gave instructions to the servants at the hotel about a quarter to 6—afterwards Hopwood sent for me with reference to this overcoat—the prisoner said "There must be some mistake," and "Don't give me into custody, "or something of that sort—I subsequently gave him into custody—the coat and the waiter were there at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a Major in the Army—I live at 34, Old Burlington Street—in May this year I was at Madeira; my attention was called to the Methuen settlement, and I telegraphed to Graham, the agent, 2, Waterloo Place—I received a prospectus, and opened a correspondence with the London office, 2, Waterloo Place—I arrived in England on June 19, and went that day to the office, 2, Waterloo Place, with Mr. Wilson, a friend of mine, who contemplated emigrating with me—we saw Mr. Hand and Mr. Hooper there, and the defendant, who said that he had received a grant of land from the government, and pointed it out on a map which he said had been obtained by favour from the Foreign Office, London, during the occupation of Bechuana Land by our troops; Thomas Mitchell was the agent there, who had gone out to take a farm there, and he was so satisfied that he had sent to Cape Town for his stores and other things which he had left there, and that I could either take a farm then or when I went out, and he promised that I should have a river frontage to the farm—I went to Derbyshire on June 19th, and returned on the 30th, and saw the prisoner—he again referred to the map and showed certain ground where the settlement was situated between three rivers and said that I could take any farm that was not already occupied—on 2nd July I went there again and saw Captain Trehar, the agent of the settlement—I repeated to him what had taken place between me and Mr. Wilson, and told him that as my two friends would not be able to take these farms, I could only take one farm (<hi rend="italic">E.

This is my, telegram from Madeira "June 4th, 1888, take three farms for party coming England Fortnight Bolton"—I was not the "party"—one farm was for Mr. Swanham, one for Mr. Elliot Wilson, and one for myself; I was acting for them; if I had intended them to believe that I was going to take three farms, I should not have put "party"—my definition or "party" is, more than one person, and I disclosed the names in a letter subsequently—I had friends who were going out with me, who I relied on to take three farms—I do not know John Graham, he was not there at all; he is not a friend of mine—there was no person named Graham during the whole time I was communicating with them—I met Hill since I came home, he is an acquaintance, I cannot say if he is a friend—(<hi rend="italic">A letter from the witness was here read, in whích he said</hi> "We have'</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Hutton professed to come to me from the prisoner to make this offer—he was not acting with my instructions or authority in any sense—if I received the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I considered I had been defrauded, I was willing to allow the matter to drop if the Judge approved—before that I took the advice of my solicitor—I have since found that Graham was not there, and I never sent the telegram—a telegram from Madeira costs 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a word—I said in it "Take three farms for party," and in a letter of the same date, sent at the same time, I explained who</p>

               <p>the party were—two of the gentlemen eventually decided not to take farms, and I decided to take one for myself, and explained it fully to Trehar, after which there was no question of taking three farms for myself—I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings for the recovery of the money, after which I discovered the state of the account, and what became of the money, and on 23rd August I commenced criminal proceedings—I never saw Graham till after 23rd August, nor did I know Hill.</p>

I am independent and live at 28, St. George's Place, Knightsbridge—on 18th July about 7 p.m. I met a lady by appointment in Buckingham Palace Road—I then stopped and spoke to a letter carrier, and we all went towards Victoria Station, the postman then left me and returned with two men—the prisoner was one of them, and he said "Will you pay about 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which this lady lost over a bet"—I said "Certainly not," and moved towards the Victoria Hotel, the prisoner and the other man followed me, and the postman in the rear—I said to the prisoner "I shall make inquiries at the post-office as to this postman's conduct"—the postman said "If you do I shall probably lose my appointment"—I said "Perhaps your story may be as good as this young lady's, therefore, I shall do nothing until I make further enquiries"—the lady was there and three men, and I asked the whole six to come and have a friendly drink, and we all went to a public-house for half an hour; drank, and left together—I then said to the postman, "Good day, you had better go and deliver your letters, as you have already been with me half an hour"—he went away, and the prisoner and a man not in custody followed me—the lady followed behind—I said to the prisoner "What do you want, if you want another drink have it, for I must go"—he said "Yes, certainly I do, and he and I and the other man not in custody went into a public-house next door to the Victoria Hotel, and had a glass of beer—the lady waited outside—I went out and the prisoner and the other man followed me, I said good day to the lady, and walked rapidly away towards Lower Belgrave Street—I looked round and saw the prisoner and the other man following me; I hurried into a public-house to escape them and called for a glass of beer, but they came in and the prisoner said "Oh! here you are again"—he asked me to drink at his expense, I said "I have a glass of beer here, I will pay for your drink"—I was about to leave the house when he placed himself against the bar door, and attempted to trip me up, with the other man, but I got out and walked rapidly towards Eaton Square—I had got about 150 yards when they surrounded me; there may have been a third man—the prisoner seized me by my shoulder and dashed me back against the other man, who again threw me forward, and the prisoner seized me again by my shoulder, and whirled me round and threw me down some circular stone steps of an area; I went half way down them, and my fall was broken by some iron-work—the prisoner and the other man ran down after me and pinned me against the area wall—I said to the prisoner "Don't kill me," he seized my watch and tried to break my chain, he then took my watch off the swivel, I</p>

I live with my husband at 23, Astey's Road, Canon bury Road—the river runs in front—on a Wednesday afternoon in May, between 20 minutes and half-past 3, I was standing at my gate, and I saw a man running with a black bag on his shoulder from the direction of Canonbury Road towards River Street—I saw his side face as he ran past me, he was followed by a lot of boys crying "Stop thief"—I saw Madame Chefderville and a gentleman following—I followed to the corner of River Street—he ran down River Street, and dropped the bag between two of Pickford's vans—it was a bag like this—the man then ran across Essex Street, and down Norfolk Street—I saw a man pick up the bag; on September 20th I was called to the police-station, and there saw about 15 or 16 men, amongst them the prisoner—I picked him out as resembling the man with the bag; my belief is that he is the man—he had on a black cut-away coat, and a felt hat with a square crown.</p>

I am a scaffolder and live at Stratford—on Wednesday afternoon, May 16th, I was at work in River Street—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—and saw a man running in the roadway carrying this bag, I ran after him about 30 yards, he then threw the bag down between two furniture vans when he saw me running after him; he then ran on and escaped—a man picked up the bag and handed it to me, I gave it to the French lady—she said it was not hers, and I afterwards gave it to Sergeant Somers—on September 20th, I saw the prisoner among a number of others at the station, he is a good deal like the man—the man had on a cut-away coat, and hard felt black hat—he had a slight moustache, side whiskers, and all very dark, to my idea.</p>

               <p>Sergeant Mackenzie; I was living with the prisoner at old Mrs. Parsons' in the Caledonian Road when I saw Dominey—she came to see Mrs. Parsons—there was a quarrel there between me and Dominey—the prisoner took Dominey's part in it—this was about two days after he had told me this story—he said he took Dominey's part because she knew something about him—that was upstairs after the quarrel—I lived with the prisoner eight days altogether—two days before I left him he brought two parcels from his mother's, containing two coats, two pairs of trousers, and a black waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">two coats produced</hi>)—he said he would not wear the black coat any more, as he should be known doing the murder in it—this is the coat he referred to, the other is a brown coat—he said there was a stain on the black coat—I said "What stain, is it blood?"—he said "No, it is where I have tried some gold to it"—he told me to go and pawn both the coats outside King's Cross, which I did for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him the money—he said the waistcoat was the one he done the murder in, and I could give that to <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> Parsons, as they would not take it in pawn—the two pairs of trousers were also given to Parsons—I left the prisoner two days after that, and went back to Edwards, at 17, Percival Street—I used to see the prisoner after that at night, we were on very good terms—the last time I saw him before he was locked up was on a Saturday—he told me then that be believed there were detectives following him—before that on Monday, 27th August, Edwards hit me between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning in the street—I was living with him then—there was a quarrel between Edwards and the prisoner—I complained to the police, I went to the station and made a statement about what the prisoner had told me—the prisoner was not present when Edwards assaulted me, he had gone—Edwards assaulted me because he thought I had been with the prisoner—I told the police to take Edwards in charge for giving me a blow, but he could not be found, at the same time I told them about the prisoner—I don't know the name of the policeman I told (<hi rend="italic">Maroney called in</hi>)—that was one of the men I saw, he was not the one I told; he was not present at the time; he was up at the Court when I was telling them—that is the man I told (<hi rend="italic">Walsh</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Clerk in Holy Orders—I live at 49, Clarendon Square, St. Pancras—between 12 and 1 a m., on 27th Sep tember, my servant called me and I went into the church and struck a match—I thought I heard a noise—I went to the sanctuary, over which there is a tribune where the nuns can look into the sanctuary, the convent adjoins the church—something was said to me from the tribune—I found the door of the larger sacristy forced open, went in and heard men speaking in the smaller sacristy—I opened the door, and found four men with a candle, endeavouring to break open the safe which contained the plate belonging to the church—as I opened the door a man said to me "Hold on, governor," rushing before me into the larger sacristy—a scuffle ensued between the four men and me, the place is very narrow—they struck at me: what any particular individual did I am not prepared to swear; they also called to each other, "Why don't you use the stick on him?"—they had no stick as far as I could see, so I presume they meant the iron instrument with which they forced the door open—during the scuffle in the sanctuary the railings were torn down—I brought one of the men, I think Williams, on his knees, and two of the others I brought down flat; Jones I held in my right hand all the time, and did not let go—the other one being knocked down on his face had more power to get on his feet and hands, and got away leaving half</p>

               <p>his waistcoat in my left hand—three of them got away—I held Jones till a constable came—on the day following we discovered outside in the convent garden a great deal of blood, and I found on Williams's hands when I examined them at the police-court such wounds as I should have expected to find on the man who had escaped over the fence—he got over the fence into the convent ground, which has an iron railing, and I don't see how any man could escape without having his hands torn—these cruets are the property of the church, and in the absence of other priests I am responsible for them—I am one of the regular priests there—the policeman found them on Jones—a small spoon is missing—the four almsboxes of the church had been broken open—I cannot say how much had been taken—the outer door of the tabernacle on the altar, which, from a Catholic point of <hi rend="italic">view,</hi> I consider most serious of all, was broken off—the blessed sacrament is kept in the tabernacle—I was called to the station to identify Williams about a week afterwards—I picked him out from among 17 other men—there is in my mind a possibility that he might not be the man—I will not swear positively, but to the best of my belief I consider him to be one of the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Wittiapis.</hi> You were placed with a number of men in a line—I went down the line without picking you out, the light was not very good—I walked back slowly and looked at each man and then I picked you out—I got no hint or information from the police that you were the man—they gave me no description of you when they came to say they had got a man—some of the men may have been less than 20 years old—the sacristy is 10 or 12 feet square—I had no light—possibly I saw all the faces when I went in, for a very short time—the police have apprehended one other that—I can only swear to as I do in your case, he is doing eighteen months at present, or would accompany you here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Y.</hi>) On Monday, 27th September, I went to this church—an entry had been made by getting over a low wall in Clarendon Square, passing along the side of No 49, where Father Ryan lives, along the backs of 49 and 50, through a gateway in the wall and through a window in the side of the chaoel, which, I think, had been shut for a long time, but not fastened, as there was dust on the ledge and the sill; then up the aisle, round the altar to the sacristy, the door of which had been forced open by some instrument—another officer found this chisel—I found the lock of the safe, which is two feet by one foot six inches in the small sacristy, had been forced with this chisel—a little place in front of the altar was broken open—the rails were all broken down and four contribution boxes were broken open—I afterwards by daylight examined the back of the premises, and found some person had escaped through the same window over the walls at the rear of No 4, Charles Street, where there is a nine feet fencing with small spikes to keep people from getting up—I found a quantity of blood all down the fence where some person had clambered over, and at the bottom as though his hand had been torn—that was right at the back of the convent.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife, and was living with him at 5, Charles Terrace, Walthamstow—we have three children living, Ada Emily, Harry William, and William Frederick—on the morning of 10th October I got up and lit the fire, and I or my little girl laid the table for breakfast—my husband came down a little after I did, about 8—I made the tea for breakfast, and put the pot in front of the fire—the prisoner came down just after—the children were in the kitchen at the time—he went into the backyard for a minute or two, and then came in and washed himself—he came into the kitchen while I was in the front room for a minute or two—I think the teapot was still in the same place—I took it up, and poured myself out a cup of tea—my husband went out for a minute or two—he was not in the room when I poured out my tea; I poured it nearly all into the saucer, and just put it to my lips, and let it run out of my mouth, because it was so nasty—I did not swallow any of it; I spat it out; I did not feel ill or anything—I went and washed my mouth out at the sink: I was sick then—I brought up a little froth and phlegm, but I think it was the cold water—my husband came back just as I finished being sick in the sink—the children did not have any tea; they just put it to their lips, and wiped their mouths with their pinafores, each of the big ones, Ada and William, not the little one—they said "Mother, what is the matter with the tea?"—I told them it was nasty, and not to touch it—I told my husband to taste it—he did not say anything Ada said "Father, what have you been trying to do? have you been trying to poison poor mother and us by putting poison in the teapot?"—he made no answer—I told Ada I would smack her head if she said such a thing as that about her father—I said "Fred, have</p>

               <p>you put anything in the teapot?"—he did not answer me—I asked him to taste it, three or four times in case my mouth was out of taste—he said "You had better throw it away"—I emptied the teapot and threw it all down the sink, and I washed the teapot out quite a dozen times, and made fresh tea in the same teapot—I had a cup full of the fresh tea, that was all right—I got the water from the same place—my little girl washed the saucer out well, and used it again—my husband had taken it up and emptied it into the cup, and threw the cupful down the sink; that was before, I had washed out the teapot, directly he came back, directly after the girl had spoken to him—he was in the kitchen while I went into the front room for a minute or two to get some stuff to mend a stocking—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a packet</hi>) I cannot read—I had never seen this paper containing this powder in the house; I had no idea that my husband had such a thing in his possession—I had never heard of there being any oxalic acid in the house—my husband had been rather strange before this; he seemed strange for about six weeks, as if he was not well—his head was very bad—he complained of it twice—he said if his head was not so bad he would give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to go to the hospital, as he was so near it—the last time he said this was on the Monday morning in the week before—I can't say that we had lived over happily before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 10 years of age—on Wednesday morning, 10th October, mother came down and made the tea, and put it in front of the fire—I was there at the time; my big brother Harry was in the washhouse, washing himself; the other brother was in the kitchen—my father came down, mother went into the front room, father went out at the back—he came back into the kitchen, and then he went to wash himself, came back, and went to the front of the fire where the teapot was—mother was still out of the room—whilst he was standing in front of the fireplace he took up the lid of the teapot, and held it in his hand, that was all I saw him do—I then went into the washhouse—I left him in front of the fire with the teapot in his hand—he stood there about two or three minutes—mother then came back into the kitchen, and said to me "Pour me out a cup of tea, Ada"—I was too long in doing it, and she poured it out herself—father put on his hat and coat and went out—mother poured her tea into the saucer, and then she sipped it and spit it out—she let it run out of her mouth—I tasted it out of the same saucer—it was like bitter stuff, not like ordinary tea; Harry also tasted it—then father came in and found mother sick in the sink—the saucer had been put back on the table, and the teapot also—I said "Oh, father, have you been putting anything in this tea?"—he never spoke a word—I do not know whether he could hear what I said—he stood by the side of the table—mother asked him to taste it—he would not—mother said to him "You had better taste it if you say my mouth is out of taste"—he said "You had better throw it into the sink," and then he went and threw it out of the saucer himself—mother emptied the tealeaves out of the teapot, and washed it out five or six times, and made some fresh tea—I did not taste it.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police at Waltham stow—I was called by the last witness to the prisoner's house, and was shown this packet of oxalic acid—it had been an ounce, and half an ounce remained—it is poison—if given in any quantity it would cause very serious consequences—it is a violent irritant poison—from a grain to half an ounce is the smallest dose that has been known to kill—given in any quantity, however small, it would be likely to injure, to be very unpleasant, and cause sickness—it would taste very bitter—persons would not be likely to take it voluntarily; they would spit it out—if they swallowed half an ounce of it it might cause death—I saw the prisoner; he seemed very strange, as if he had been drinking—I suggested that he should be detained under supervision for a fortnight to ascertain the state of his mind—that was done at the suggestion of the Magistrate at Stratford—I have not seen him since—I only saw him on that occasion.</p>

I live at Leyton, and am captain of the fire brigade of Leyton and Leytonstone—about eight minutes to 1 o'clock on Saturday morning, 1st September, I was called to a fire at 5, Ferndale Villas—I got there just about 1 o'clock; the Leytonstone contingent of the brigade were there at work—the fire was burning fiercely, and the roof was burnt off—I broke the glass of the front door and got into the front parlour, ground floor—I found the furniture piled up in the centre of the room—it was about an hour and a half before we got the fire under—I then made a partial examination of the premises—I went into the parlour and the back room, which opens with folding-doors; they were open—I found a sticky substance all over the sideboard—I then walked through to where the staircase had been, and found two large oil cans (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) <hi rend="italic">;</hi> one with the bung out contained a portion of paraffin, the other had contained varnish or some such substance; that was empty—I then went over the furniture of the house—I saw Inspector Walsh, and drew his attention to the state of the premises—at that time the water was pouring through from the top, and it was very dark—I left two of my members, Lieutenant Hay and Ensign King-ton, in charge of the premises, and left the examination till the morning—a little after 9 next morning I made a further examination—the whole of the doors were smothered with pieces of resin—on the piano in the parlour the resin had run all over the piano and on the Keys of it—on the back of the sideboard there were traces of paraffin, also on the table.</p>

               <p>cloth—later on I found this tin on the sideboard, containing about 10 oz. of gunpowder; the lid was open, and the gunpowder was scattered in the sideboard, and nothing else with it—Sharp came up in a cab that morning, and I saw Butler later on—after I had come back from showing Butler the state of the premises, which I was requested to do, Sharp said "I am in custody on this case," and Butler turned round and said "I suppose you know what you are about?"—the detective said "Decidedly so"—Sharp asked for a few minutes' consideration, then he said to Butler "You have led me into this; you have drawn every sovereign out of me, and have been my ruin"—I don't remember that Butler made any answer; he was then taken into custody—I saw the key of the safe found before that when Sharp came up in the cab—a friend of Sharp's opened the safe, and this policy for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two receipts were found in it—this revolver was on the table; no cartridges were found—after the examination on Monday, this paraffin lamp was found at the foot of the stairs with some debris—it had evidently been taken out of the socket and thrown there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say when I got there the fire had been burn ing some time, possibly three-quarters of an hour—Sharp appeared some what excited, Butler was calm.</p>

"I said "What about this transaction?" he made no answer, and continued to run till he got to where his father and Brixlager and the younger son were standing, and then his father said, "Don't say anything"—I said "I want to know something about this transaction; how do you account for those two barrels which I have seen you push over your wharf, which I had previously seen you hoist on to it?—the elder Robinson said "We know nothing about it, we have just finished loading the ship; you have made a mistake"—I went with them to the front of the wharf and said "There are the two barrels," pointing to them on the shore, "you must consider yourselves in custody till we make further inquiries"—one barrel was smashed to pieces, and the other whole, but covered with grease on one side—the tide was not up when they fell, but by the time we got there it had flowed all round them—at the station Robinson said 11 It would be impossible for any barrels to be hoisted on to my wharf without my knowledge"—a ship was being broken up on the foreshore, and a vessel was being loaded, and between the two was about 30 feet</p>

I am a cashier at the Clapham Junction branch of the London and South Western Bank—on 22nd September, about 10 a.m. the prisoner came in and asked for a cheque-book for Smith and Co—I said "Have you an order"—and he said "They were in too much hurry to write it out" handing me one of their cards—I gave him a cheque book and he left—he returned in 2 hours and pre sented this cheque for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I consulted the manager and then cashed it and gave him eleven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—the cheque was the first in the book which I gave him that morning.</p>

I live at 14, vendel Street, South Bermondsey—on 1st September, and prior to that date, I assisted my brother in his business as a draper, in High Street, Merton—the prisoner's daughter, Grace Young, was an assistant in the shop—she had been there over three years—I had been there three years last June—on 1st September, 1888, I was in bed—I was called up by Miss Kitson saying Mr. Young wished to see me; I dressed and went down to him—he asked me if I was going to marry his daughter, I said "I could not"—he asked me again, and I said "No"—he asked me a third time and I told him "I could not"—he immediately pointed a revolver at my face—the bullet struck my tie, and passed over my shoulder—I dodged away, this is the tie (<hi rend="italic">produced in two pieces</hi>) I ran upstairs—half-way up I heard a second report, and felt a bullet strike my left thigh, and heard the remark "That has got him"—I was struck in the back—I went into my room till the doctor came—I was taken to Guy's Hospital, the police came.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM EDWARDS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman W</hi> 401) Shortly after 3 o'clock on the morning of 18th September I was on duty in Cowthorpe Road, Wandsworth; it is a new road—I heard footsteps, and got into an unfinished house; when I had been there five or six minutes I saw a man, not the prisoner, coming along on the opposite side of the road; when he got opposite me he looked round to the prisoner, who was about 12 or 14 yards behind, and said "Come along, be quick, it is all right"—I stood quietly until the prisoner got opposite me, then I rushed out of the building to the prisoner, who threw off this bag from his right shoulder—it came against me, causing me to slightly stumble—the prisoner ran away following the other man—I blew my whistle, and chased them down Cowthorpe Road and across the Brooklyn Road—a South-Western Railway constable heard the whistle, and took up the chase—the prisoner, seeing the railway constable, ran into the doorway of the Brooklyn public house, where the railway constable seized him—I was about six yards behind the prisoner, I had not lost sight of him, I am positive he is the man—when I came up, I said "What have you got in that bag?"—he said "You have made a mistake, old man, it isn't me"—I said "Never mind a mistake, you will have to come along with me"—I took him back to where I saw him throw the bag down—I held him, the other witness laid hold of the bag, which contained a roll of serge, a roll of flannel, 12 pair of men's woollen socks, four pairs of lady's stockings—this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> fell out of the bag—a counterpane was found close by—he was perfectly sober—he was searched at the station, and I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 01/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze loose in his right-hand trousers poeket, two pawn tickets, pencil, and knife—I subsequently searched the houses in the neighbourhood, and found the window of 6, Springfield Parade, open—that house is in the direction where the prisoner came from, and is on a bit of waste land not built on; it is a new estate opened for building purposes—I roused the owner of the house, and learnt a burglary had been committed—I have no doubt this is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Springfield Parade is 20 or 30 yards from the place where I first saw the prisoner—the waste land goes up to the back door of No 6—the prisoner came by way of the waste land—he was right opposite me on the other side of the road when I came out of the empty house—I said nothing to him then—I chased him 220 or 300 yards—I was about six yards off when the other constable apprehended him—I was within a yard of him when he started—I kept within three or four yards the whole distance—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a constable on the South Western Railway at Nine Elms—on 18th September, about 3 30 a m., I heard a whistle and on going out I saw two men running, chased by Edwards, who was a few yards behind the last man—I chased the men and apprehended the prisoner, who was the last one, he was about 5 yards behind the first, in the doorway of the Brooklyn Park public-house, Brooklyn Street—I saw him turn the corner—I said "You are one of them"—he said "I am not"—I said "You wait a minute and then we will see"—Edwards arrived at that moment—he said "You are the man that was carrying the bag"—the prisoner said "You have made a mistake, old man"—the other man escaped—I went down the Cowthorpe Road and found this bag—on lifting it up this jemmy fell out.</p>

               <p>except at the back part—we notice trains go past and come up as well, because we have to put the distance signal up as they come past—I was busy, but not exceedingly busy, on this evening—as soon as I have booked the trains I am on the look out again—I watch trains as they come down, and I note the time they go by at—the first train came by about half-past 8, I should say, when I saw the prisoners on the bridge; I cannot say the exact time—one train passed at 8 27—I am looking at the times the trains go by—I cannot tell you the exact time the train went by when the stones were dropped—it was between half-past 8 and 9; it might have been ten minutes to 9 or five minutes to 9; I cannot say—my memory is a little mixed—it was 1st August—I have had a little trouble between then and now; my wife has been confined—it was a beautiful night—I will swear it was not raining—there was a good deal of rain at that time of year, but this was a beautiful night—I was inside my signal-box when I saw the boys drop stones—there was no light inside my box at that time—the boys only dropped the stones over the bridge—I could only see indistinctly, because the smoke from the engine obstructed the view—the smoke did not obstruct the view till it got to the bridge—directly it got to the bridge the column of smoke came up—the boys dropped the stones just as the train got to them, as soon as the train got close to the bridge—it was travelling at So miles an hour, and going very quickly—when the train got to the bridge they dropped the stones—there would not be much smoke before the train got to the bridge, because of the smoke ascending—I have not had any complaint from any guard or engineman or stoker who passed under the bridge that day—I have not seen any driver or guard to speak to—I knew the prisoners by sight before this day; I did not know their names—these are the first I have seen drop stones, I swear that.</p>
