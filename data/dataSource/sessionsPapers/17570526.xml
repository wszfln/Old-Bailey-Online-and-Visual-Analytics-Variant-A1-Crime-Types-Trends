On the 18th of this instant May, out of thirteen shillings in half-pence I missed ten pence halfpenny, and upon my making inquiry I perceived the prisoner to change countenance. About an hour afterwards the ten pence halfpenny missing was laid upon a cannister between my shop door and the stairs, which (as I had lost money before) made it reasonable to think some of my servants must have taken it and laid it there; and my other servants much wanting to know who put it there, I thought it prudent to search their boxes, to see who was the dishonest person, to which they all readily agreed. In searching the prisoner's box I found a tin cannister with little more than half a pound of fine tea, and in a lead wrap'd up a little more than a quarter of a pound of tea of about ten shillings per pound, a quarter of a pound tin cannister near full of cloves, and about six or seven ounces of nutmegs. I told the prisoner that as for the fine tea and spices I could not swear to them, but that which was done up in lead was taken out of such a cannister in the shop, which was sold for ten shillings per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Morley. He had lived with me three or four months; he at first denied it, but at last said he had received seven shillings, which was sent him from Yorkshire to buy tea to send thither, that he kept the money, and took my tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking the whole you have mention'd?</p>
               <p>Morley. No. I only charged him with taking that which was done up in lead, because I could match that, and believed it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess the whole, or only that done up in lead?</p>
               <p>Morley. He confessed all the tea to be mine; at first he said he bought them and could tell where but did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you be sure the tea was your's, when one quantity of tea may be like another?</p>

               <p>Q. What was his answer to that charge?</p>
               <p>Morley. He at last said it was my tea.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Morley as a journeyman. Upon master's missing ten pence halfpenny, he suspected the apprentice, and talk'd to him about it. A little after that master said, it must be betwixt you four.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by it must be?</p>
               <p>Haverne. He meant, by laying the halfpence where they were found again. He insisted upon searching our boxes, so I desired him to search mine first. While he was searching the boxes the prisoner said something, but what I can't say; but master's answer was, he would search his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner unwilling to have his box search'd ?</p>
               <p>Haverne. He was unwilling. Master searched one of the prisoner's boxes and found nothing there; then he searched the other, and I saw a half pint cannister taken out, with tea in it, and after that a piece of lead with tea in it. Master open'd the lead and named the cannister in the shop where it was taken from. The prisoner did not deny it, and when we came down into the compting-house, there the prisoner own'd it was my master's tea. (The goods mention'd produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these parcels did he own was your master's?</p>
               <p>Haverne. This. ( Taking that parcel in his hand, which was wrap'd up in a piece of lead.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him confess the other tea to be your master's?</p>
               <p>Haverne. I was not there then. (He takes a cannister in his hand, in which were the cloves. ) I told him this was master's cannister; then he confessed the cloves were my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the weight of the cloves?</p>
               <p>Haverne. Here is upwards of three ounces of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own taking of the nutmegs?</p>
               <p>Haverne. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the alderman when the prisoner was there?</p>
               <p>Haverne. I was; there he bent down his knee, in order to ask my master's pardon, and own'd he took the teas. After we were sworn the alderman ask'd him again, and then he denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the alderman?</p>

            . On Saturday was se'n-night I lay from home. In the morning my maid came to me, and told me something extraordinary had happened. I went home and found a ladder standing up against a window. I went in and found a desk broke open, and a cupboard where my plate used to be kept.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come home?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I came home about six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any part of your house broke?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The window where the ladder stood was broke; there was a spout fix'd at the upper part of the window in such a manner that the casement would not open without breaking, the iron frame of the casement was bent, and the lock of the desk had the catch broke off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss out of the desk?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I missed from thence two razors, a penknife, and a pair of knippers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss out of the cupboard?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I missed a silver pint mug, two silver salts, six tea spoons, a castor, a pair of silver tea tongs (produced) these are my property. There were missing from other parts of the house a piece of bacon, about half a cheese, two flat irons, and some linen, but I don't pretend to know them. I leave them to my maid to speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I suspected him, and took him up on the Sunday, but not finding any thing material I sat him at liberty; he kept on working for me till the Thursday following, when I charg'd him again; upon talking to him a little, he took me into the fields to near Marybone workhouse, where he went upon a hay rick, and from thence roll'd me down all my plate and the other things in a sack. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260005"/> took him and them home, and from thence to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of forgiveness on condition he would tell you of your goods?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I told him if he would let me know where my things were, I would do my endeavour to be as favourable as possible, after he had said, Provided I would give him a note that he should come to no damage, he would help me to my things again. The silver mug was squeez ed quite flat then, but it has been put to rights since.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself before the justice of peace?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There he was quite sulky and angry, and said but little.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he work'd with you?</p>
               <p>Wilson. About seven or eight weeks, he was a weekly servant.</p>
               <p>Emey Barker. I am servant to Mr. Wilson. On Saturday was se'n-night at night I was the only person that lay in my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all made fast over night?</p>
               <p>E. Barker. Knowing my master was not to be at home, I took more care than usual. I bar'd the windows, lock'd the doors fast, and made all safe, and went to bed at about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise or disturbance in the night?</p>
               <p>E. Barker. No, I did not,</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up?</p>
               <p>E. Barker. I got up betwixt five and six, I observed it was very light. I look'd out and saw the window open, and a ladder against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ladder against the window of your bed chamber ?</p>
               <p>E. Barker. No, that was against a chamber window that we make a kitchen of. I ran immediately to the cupboard to see if the plate was there, and took the key out of my pocket to open it, but found it was open and the lock broke; then I ran immediately to my master's lodgings and call'd him up, and told him. (The linen produced.) These are all my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the linen taken from?</p>
               <p>E. Barker. From out of the cupboard where the plate was. The two flat irons are my property, and one of the silver tea spoons; the other six and the rest of the plate are my master's.</p>

            . Mr. Wilson came to my house and told me he had been rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Haistings. It was the last time he took the prisoner up. We went to the prisoner's lodgings, and there we found two sacks, and took them to Mr. Wilson's house; the prisoner was in the brewhouse. We asked him how he came by the sacks, he said, I saw him go out of my house with one of them, I said I never let him have any. Then we told him we had reason to suspect he had rob'd Mr. Wilson, and we should take him up. Then he said he'd go along with us and shew us where the things were, if we would not do any thing to him; we went with him into the field behind Marybone workhouse, he got upon a hay rick and roll'd the plate and things down, then we came to Mr. Wilson's house, and brought him and the things here produced with us.</p>

               <p>I was going to work last Thursday morning about five o'clock, and saw a man on a hay stack; after he was gone, I got up, and saw some things that I thought were my master's. When I came to my master's I told him I thought I knew where some of the things were.</p>

               <p>Q Do you sell such hats and pumps in your shop?</p>
               <p>Nowling. I do not; I had them for my own wear.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular goods that you deal in did you lose out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Nowling. I deal in every thing else but the hats; pumps and candles. I inquired if any body had laid my hats and pumps out of the way, and particularly I asked the prisoner at the bar, who said he knew nothing of them. Some time afterwards he asked me if I had found them, adding that the plaisterers and bricklayers were sad chaps, thereby giving me to understand that it was probable some of them had taken them. On the 29th of April,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260007"/> in the morning, the maid complain'd she had lost a handkerchief, which she had hung before the fire when she went to bed. Then I began to think it time to be as industrious as I could in finding out the thief, and decared I would find it out. I then went to Mr. Nixon, the master whom I employ'd to do the work, and told him the affair, and we agreed to take out a search warrant. The master, not knowing where the prisoner lived, dodged him home, and afterwards we went with the warrant and searched his lodgings, but found nothing. Then the constable advised me to take all the workmen up, to try who would confess; so I took out a warrant, but suspecting the prisoner only, I told the others my intention. I found he had left his work, but going to his lodging again I met with him, and gave the constable charge of him. In going down stairs he got the start of us and ran away, but we retook him, and carry'd him to justice St. Lawrance. There I said, Saunders, if you'll confess where the things are, so that I can get them again, I'll be favourable to you. He then beg'd I would talk to him by himself, so we went together, and he told me I should have all my things again. He said he knew of but one hat, and that was at a pawnbroker's in West-Street, Seven-Dials. His wife said she would go and fetch me the other hat and pumps. I asked her where they were. She said they were in the apartment of one

            . I saw the prisoner Griffiths take this handkerchief out of Mr. Davey's pocket with her left hand, and wrap it up, and put it under her cloak. I said to her now you have got what you wanted, she said what is that. I said you have got the gentleman's handkerchief. I desired the people that stood near not to let her go, for I would see if I could find the gentleman (he was gone on.) I went and overtook him opposite to Bow Church. He came back, and as we were taking the prisoners into the Horns alehouse, Griffiths drop'd the handkerchief, and a little girl said, here is the handkerchief, and took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. from Griffiths. Whether that witness did not ask me for money to buy more drink, or said if I would not, he'd do for me?</p>

            . On the 26th of last month I was coming from Shoe-lane, and went into St. Paul's Church yard, the rehearsal was then. I saw the two women at the bar very busy with several people's pockets, they had both cardinals on. I saw them take many things out of people's pockets, but I could not see what. They had a way of twisting them up, and put them under their cardinals. I said to the other witnesses, these are two pickpocket, let us watch them. When we got out of St. Paul's Church yard they were then standing at the end of Paternoster-row, when the prosecutor came along they followed him close, and were both very busy about his pocket. Hays said to them, now you have got what you wanted. What have I got said one of them, you have got the gentleman's handkerchief he said; then he call'd to me, I was watching over the way. I went to him, and he went and fetch'd the gentleman. We went in at the Horns alehouse, Gutter-lane; going in at the door they drop'd the handkerchief, a little girl took it up, and said here is the handkerchief. The gentleman sent for a constable, but there was not one to be got. Then he went to the bar, and said here is something for the people to drink, I'll go myself for an officer; then a constable came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both alike busy about the prosecutor's pocket?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. from Evans. What was the reason you did not attack us in St. Paul's Church yard?</p>

               <p>Wilson. I did attempt it, but they made their escape up to the end of Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hays. Were they searched in the alehouse?</p>
               <p>Hays. They were not, as the handkerchief was found.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Griffiths take the handkerchief, where was Evans?</p>
               <p>Hays. They were close together, one behind the other. Mr. Davey once turn'd about, or they had picked his pocket before that.</p>

            . I work in St. Paul's Church yard, I was there to see the people come from the rehearsal; the last evidence told me he saw two women attempting to pick pockets, and shew'd me them. I look'd and saw them both attempt it several times. We followed them to the top of Pater-noster-row, there Mr. Davey cross'd the way; they both made after him, and beyond Gutter-lane they took the handkerchief out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. I did not see it taken, but I saw it in Griffiths's hand, then the other cross'd the way, and Mr. Wilson went and fetch'd her back again. Mr. Hays went and fetch'd Mr. Davey, and going into the alehouse Griffiths drop'd the handkerchief from under her red cloak or cardinal.</p>
               <p>Q. from Evans. Did not we insist upon being search'd?</p>
               <p>Beaumont. The handkerchief was found before that; when they found there was no constable came, then they desired to be search'd.</p>

               <p>I never saw this woman [meaning her fellow prisoner] before that time in my life. I saw her in St. Paul's Church yard; she asked me what was to be done, I said something of a rehearsal. I was going as far as Mile-End, and this good woman asked me how far it was to Whitechappel. I told her I was going as far as the Mansion-house, and would shew her the way so far. These people ask'd the constable if there was no reward.</p>
               <p>Beaumont. We had no intention of getting any reward, we thought of getting them severely used by the populace.</p>

             went out with her after that, with what we call night goods, who told me when they came home that she saw something stick out of the prisoner's pocket apron, which appear'd like my handkerchief. Then I looked, and missed two handkerchiefs, a cap, two yards and a half of silk ribbon, a pair of pattens, and a pewter plate. I charged her with taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things taken from?</p>
               <p>M. Martin. The cap and ribbon, and one handkerchief, were taken out of a trunk in the same room she went into to shift herself. I found the trunk lock'd as I had left it. The soosey handkerchief was lying on the table or the bed in the same room, but the pewter plate and pattens were taken from below stairs. I took her before the alderman, and she own'd she had taken them, but that it was with a design to put them in their places again, and that she had pawn'd the handkerchief in Shoe-lane, (the goods produced, and deposed to.) She said before the alderman, that she took the things out of the trunk with a knife, and did not open the lock, but that was impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the other things ?</p>
               <p>M. Martin. She did not say any thing at all about them. The soosey handkerchief was found by her direction at the pawnbroker's, and the cap was found out by a person that said he knew where she used to pawn things of her own.</p>

               <p>Adshead.

            . On the 23d of April I was drinking in company pretty late, and when we broke up it was between twelve and one o'clock; I found myself a little in liquor, and did not much care to go home, as the woman of the house where I live was ill, and I did not chuse to disturb her; so I went away from the alehouse, and walked over London Bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the alehouse you went from?</p>
               <p>Canvin. It is in White's Ground, Barnaby street, in Southwark. I went through best part of the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Canvin. I live in Southwark.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go over the bridge?</p>
               <p>Canvin. I walked about to get sober. I walked till I came almost to Whitehall. I had my watch and some money about me. Then I thought I'd turn back again and go through the city, rather than go home over the New Bridge and St. George's Fields at that time of the night. Then I went up into Covent-Garden, and got into Drury-Lane, where I saw this woman at the bar and a companion of her's standing together; they both called to me, and said they wanted to speak with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that companion of her's a man or a woman?</p>
               <p>Canvin. It was a woman. I went over the way to them. The prisoner ask'd me if I'd give her any thing. I said, what shall I give you? She said a dram; there was no publick house open as I saw, so I gave her a penny to buy a dram; she brush'd up to me, and ask'd me if I had a mind to do with her, and what I would give her; I said nothing. I had not much occasion that way. Then she ask'd me if I would give her partner a dram; she said if I would I should have a touch with her. Then she put her hand between the waistband of my breeches and my body. Then I thought she had a mind to pick my watch out, so I put my hand to my watch, and my other hand to where my money was. Then she took hold of my hand and went to put it under her petticoats; while my hand was there I felt my watch go out of my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your watch before?</p>
               <p>Canvin. That very instant I had felt it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the other woman to you?</p>
               <p>Canvin. She was about a yard, or a yard and a half from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for her to take your watch ?</p>
               <p>Canvin. No; she could not reach me to take it: Being conscious the prisoner took it, I challenged her with it, and desired her to give it to me again;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260012"/> she denied it, and said she knew nothing of it; I said I would not lose my watch upon any account. She wish'd several bitter wishes about it. Then I said I would give any thing rather than lose it; she said, what will you give me, will you give me half a crown? I said, yes I would, and took out 2 s. and 6 d. Give it me she said. I said I would, if she would deliver me the watch. She said, she would have the money first, which I would not give her. I said, if she would let me see it, I would give her half the money. She would do nothing, except I would let her have the money first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce it?</p>
               <p>Canvin. No, she did not; I held the money in my left-hand. She stood on the right-hand side of the passage where we were, and I open'd my hand, thinking the sight of the money would induce her to let me have the watch; she catch'd at it, and got a shilling out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch again?</p>
               <p>Canvin. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you got sober then?</p>
               <p>Canvin. I was a sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Canvin. I am a leather-dresser. There came a soldier up to the entry while I was contending with her, and with his help I got her to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she out of your sight in this time?</p>
               <p>Canvin. No, never till I got her to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other woman?</p>
               <p>Canvin. They both pushed me and intreated me to go into the house up the alley, but I would not. I found I could not keep them both, so I seiz'd the prisoner, and the other jump'd away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing before the justice?</p>
               <p>Canvin. No, she did not; all she said was, I gave her the shilling to have to do with her.</p>

I saw him hold the money in his hand, and saw her snatch it out; I help'd to secure her. She carried the shilling in her hand to the constable's house, and in the Round-house she sent for a full pot of purl, to drink the prosecutor's health.</p>

            . I am servant to the keeper of St. Giles's-Round-house. I remember the prisoner's being brought in there for stealing a watch. I strip'd her from top to bottom, and there was nothing about her; I really know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with her?</p>
               <p>E. Basset. No, I had not; I strip'd her quite to her skin, skin and all.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutor, on St. Martin's side in Drury-Lane, with three or four women.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of them?</p>
               <p>M. Caly. No, she was not there at that time; but however, as I came out of the court I saw the prisoner and her husband having some words; he was in liquor. She came out. I asked her where I could get a little beer, and she directed me to a night house in Covent-Garden. I went and got a pint, and came back again; when I heard a noise made by this man about his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutor before?</p>
               <p>M. Caly. No, I never saw him since that time.</p>

            . I am a working silversmith; this prisoner at the bar brought me two irregular small pieces of gold, at two separate times; I knowing him bought the first and second, which was much the same shape, but the last more in quantity; after that I had some suspicion they were not honestly come by.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Harman. He is a milkman. I gave orders to my people, if he should come and offer any more they should not buy it. On the second or third of February last he brought me another piece of gold, which appeared as though it had been turned out of a melting pot, or crucible; then I had a full suspicion that it was dishonestly come by. I ask'd him how he came by it. He told me he sold it for another person. I clap'd it in the scale, talk'd to him a little to amuse him, and then told him I was satisfied it was dishonestly come by, being in such a shape; he said he came honestly by it. I said, I have no reason to distrust you, but you must discover the person you had it of; he told me he had it of a Jew that sold old cloaths; I told him if it was good it might be worth 3 l. 5 s. but desired him to leave it, that I might have a trial made of it; he left it with me, in order to have a trial made of it, which we call an assay. I applied to justice Welch, and told him my sentiments, and how I came by it; he bid me apply to the assay master in the Tower, which I did, and according to that assay it was reported to be a quarter of a grain worse than standard, but they always make some small allowance. I had a warrant from Mr. Welch, in order to apprehend the prisoner. I had given the prisoner a memorandum of my receiving such a bit of gold of him, in order for my delivering it back upon demand. When he came to my house I told him he must produce the person that he had it of, and I privately sent one of my boys for the constable. The prisoner made this excuse, he could not tell who, or where the man was he had it of, and desired to have some time to find him. I gave him opportunity to go and see for him, but did not deliver him the gold. He did not return, and has absconded ever since, till last Monday he was taken. He has prevaricated much in his discourse. He said he had it of a German Jew first, and that he had not paid for it; afterwards that he had paid for it. When I told him it might be worth 3 l. 5 s. he said he gave three guineas for it; but before the justice he said, he did not pay for it till after I had told him what I thought it might be worth, Mr. Welch committed him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner first produce this piece of gold to you ?</p>
               <p>Harman. About the second or third of February.</p>
               <p>Q Did you mention any suspicion you had then?</p>
               <p>Harman. At that time I told him I suspected it to have been stoln.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he call again after that?</p>
               <p>Harman. He call'd about two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he abscond ?</p>
               <p>Harman. He absconded after the second time of coming.</p>
               <p>Q Was the warrant taken out before he absconded ?</p>
               <p>Harman. It was, but it was in the constable's hands, and I call'd my boy in order to fetch him to serve it. I told the justice I was apprehensive it was the diminishing of coin.</p>
               <p>Q. What was their opinion who made the assay?</p>
               <p>Harman. They seem'd to be of the same opinion with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is the piece of gold?</p>
               <p>Harman. It is here [produced; the jury look at it.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought this piece of gold of a German Jew, but I don't know his name, nor where he is. I gave him three guineas for it. He wanting to borrow some money of me to buy old cloaths with, I told him I had none, and he took me into a publick house, where he pull'd this piece of gold out of his pocket, and said he would give me that instead of three guineas. I carried it to the gentleman's house, and ask'd him the value of it; he said it was worth 3 l. 5 s. He gave me a note, and I left the piece of gold with him. I went back to the Jew, and paid him the three guineas.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on that day for fourteen sheep, which he was to take away; my servant not being in the way, I desired him to take them away right, and that he would stop as he came by the door with them, that I might count them; but when he came with them, he hurried them by so fast, that I could not count them. I went down into the field about half an hour afterwards, and found that one sheep belonging to the prosecutor was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. I live at Paddington, and take in butchers sheep to grase.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this sheep?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. It was in my ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the other fourteen sheep belong to?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. They belong'd to other persons, not the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he to drive the other fourteen to?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. To Bloomsbury market.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheep all together in your ground?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. They were all in one pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take them out of the pen?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him as he went by with the sheep?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. I call'd to him, and said I could not tell them; he said they were all right. The next morning the prisoner came to me, and ask'd me if I had lost a sheep, saying he had found one in the Brick-fields. I ask'd him why he did not bring it home; he said it was in the constable's hands, who would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was that?</p>
               <p>A. Gee. That was about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Mrs. Gee's house for fourteen sheep, and driving them along I went to case myself, and the sheep went down the road; when I came to count them I found one more than I should have, so I took and ty'd it's legs, and drove the others where they were to go. Then I went up to Peter-street, to a young man that drives a cart, and said I had found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260016"/> a sheep in my parcel that was none of my own, and bid him come down and look at the marks. He said he would. When we came there the sheep was taken into the constable's house, and they would not let us see it till the constable came home. I ask'd where he was, they said just by. When I saw him he said it was one Mr. Giblett's sheep, it was mark'd with the letter I. They ask'd me how she came amongst mine, I said I did not know. I went to Mr. Giblett's drover, to see if he had lost such a sheep, but the constable bid him keep away, and not trouble himself about it, so he is not here to be a witness for me.

               <p>Ford. That was the man that came to demand the sheep. I told him I fancy'd he had better keep at home and mind his business, and not get into trouble. I said, I questioned, whether he was not guilty as well as the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been your journeyman ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. The discovery was made by a person that went to work with the prisoner, who saw the tools there, and knowing them, he came and told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he saw them?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. At the prisoner's lodgings. So we took the prisoner up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He said my husband lent him them before he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but that is true ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. I am certain he never lent him them.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you be certain?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. Because it would be against his interest so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he work for you after your husband went away?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He work'd for me several weeks after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this a prosecution by way of resentment, on account of his leaving you ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. No, it is not, it is far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these goods?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. They are of small value, they are not valued at one third of their worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he quite quitted your service?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he quit your service with or without your consent?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He gave me no warming, and left my work unfinished.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he behaved in your service?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He behaved much in the same manner about two years ago. I had not a very great opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether during the time he work'd for your husband, there was not a deal of greatness between your husband and the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. Yes, so far as drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they not used to walk out together on parties of pleasure ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. Yes, I believe they might two or three times; he earn'd a great deal of money, by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260017"/> which means he could ride when others must walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband shew him more respect than he did other journeymen?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He used them all well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not discover a greater kindness-towards the prisoner than the other journeymen?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. The other workmen went on parties of pleasure with my husband, as well as the prisoner; but the prisoner might have more money than they.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the goods found?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. They were found at the prisoner's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say they were found in the prisoner's lodgings?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. His shop and lodgings are both on one floor; he work'd in the room joining to his bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they concealed or open?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. They were not concealed; he was at work with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man that work'd with him, that had work'd with your husband, named Lambert ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. Yes, there was; at the time the tools were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know the tools ?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He did very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lambert come and discover it directly, or did he leave the prisoner's service first?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He left him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Lambert serve his time?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He served his time with my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Lambert been gone from you to the prisoner, before he made this discovery?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. He work'd there but about a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any dispute they had?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Lambert tell you of it?</p>
               <p>M. Pewterers. It was not Lambert that told me; he told one of our journeymen, and he told me.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at these tools, do you know them ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lambert. Did you work with the prisoner at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Lambert. I did work with him a week and 3 days.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to work along with him?</p>
               <p>Lambert. I was out of my time, and I had a mind to go to work with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with him about the tools?</p>
               <p>Lambert. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you did not tell him they were your mistress's tools ?</p>
               <p>Lambert. There was a man that work'd with him, who said to him, here is a tool that is crack'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Which tool was that?</p>
               <p>Lambert. That tool is not here; he said he bought it, and would have it alter'd. The man answer'd so he might, and it would do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that tool belong to?</p>
               <p>Lambert. That belongs to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Where is that tool?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That the prisoner sent home the day after he had the warrant served upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lambert. Why did you not tell him whose tool it was?</p>
               <p>Lambert. I thought my mistress had lent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you think so?</p>
               <p>Lambert. Because he used to have more liberty in the shop than any of the other servants.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your mistress's time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260018"/>Lambert. In my master's time and mistress's too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to follow any separate business in your mistress's time?</p>
               <p>Lambert. He set up about two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself after he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Lambert. He said before justice Fielding his master lent him the tools which he used then.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether your mistress lent him these tools in question now?</p>
               <p>Lambert. No, I can not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any difference with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lambert. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him so soon?</p>
               <p>Lambert. He and another man agreed to be partners; they were to give me so much a week, and when I ask'd the prisoner for money, he flew in a passion and bid me go along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that go and tell Mrs. Pewterers of these things being in his custody?</p>
               <p>Lambert. I did not tell her at all; I told it to Mr. Pearson, and he told her.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did not you lend the prisoner the tools yourself, in your husband's time ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>These tools were lent to me several times, both by Mr. and Mrs. Pewterers.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Conrode Hidcloaff. I remember that when the prisoner work'd with Mr. Pewterers his master used to lend him tools.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you known him to lend him tools?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. Once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you related to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. I am his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you can recollect he lent him tools?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. It was about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Pewterers ever lend him any in the absence of her husband?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. She did; I went to her and asked for a tool for my brother, and she lent it me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. It was about Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. What tool was it Mr. Pewterers lent him?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. It was a coffee pot tool.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. I am a brasier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever work for Mr. Pewterers?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. I did for about 6 years. I remember my master told him when he lent it him, that he was welcome to what he could spare till business came on again ( business then being very slack) he lent him another tool about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. That was a beck iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the tools produced, whether they are like them ?</p>
               <p>Hidcloaff. These are the same tools; he took them, and brought the beck iron back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are you sure you never lent the prisoner any tool?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never lent him any tool in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never bid him take a tool?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard his brother's evidence?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have, and all he says is not true. My husband call'd at his house about three years ago, and saw some of his own tools at his house; he reprimanded him, and desired him to bring them home, which he did; at that time he forgave him, but desired him never to make so free again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an intimacy between your husband and he since that?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, the same as before at times.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you a married or a single woman then ?</p>
               <p>C. Blacquire. I was a married woman, but I acted on my own foundation; my husband was never in England. I went from England to Ireland to him, and left the prisoner in charge of all my effects, and he took the things mention'd in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband living at the time you charge the prisoner with taking these goods?</p>
               <p>C. Blacquire. My husband died about eight days after I went from London; I believe he was dead then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you administer ?</p>
               <p>C. Blacquire. No, there was no administration.</p>

               <p>C. Blacquire. I believe he died on the 28th of April.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment out of the wash, as the cloaths were hanging to dry. I at first accused the girl that lives with me, but she denied it. The next day I sent for the prisoner, and charg'd her with taking them; she own'd it, and said they were in pawn, and that she would get them and send them home again.</p>

               <p>E. Wilkins. My servant deliver'd them to her to wash in my own house. I took her before the justice, where she own'd the same. She had before that fetch'd them out and brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her you would not prosecute her, if she would confess, and bring them again?</p>
               <p>E. Wilkins. No, I did not, I only put the things in the indictment which she brought home; I have lost more things than I have mentioned.</p>

               murder of her female bastard child, by cutting its throat

               <p>Mr. Phipps. Although I am prosecutor in this trial, I can give but little light into it. I can only inform the court I did suspect the prisoner to be with child, and very strictly charged her with it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was she?</p>
               <p>Phipps. She was my <rs id="t17570526-22-deflabel113" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

               <p>Q. Can you tell the time you charged her with being with child?</p>
               <p>Phipps. I can't exactly tell the time. I believe it might be about two months before she was brought to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her answer?</p>
               <p>Phipps. She very boldly denied it, and assur'd me with great truth and veracity it was a very unjust censure; she shew'd no signs of guilt at all. She answer'd in such a manner that I was really a good deal inclined to think she was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear big?</p>
               <p>Phipps. She did, which was the cause of suspicion. She told me it was a distemper, and was inclinable to think it was the dropsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it very visible?</p>
               <p>Phipps. It was. She never in the least strove to conceal that, which rather confirm'd me in the belief of her innocence. I told her if that was the case, she was an object of pity and compassion, and I would get her to be an out patient in the hospital. I thought that to discharge her my service would be of hurt to her, rather than alleviate her case (as there are undeniable cases where women may have the appearance of being with child, when really they are not so) so I continued her in my service till it came to this unhappy issue. I did not see the child nor her after she was delivered. Here are witnesses that can inform the court as to the particulars of it. So I shall beg leave to refer your lordship to their examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that she had taken any thing by way of medicine?</p>
               <p>Phipps. She told me she was under the care of some person (whom I forget) and had taken a very strong dose of medicine.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she tell you this?</p>
               <p>Phipps. The preceding night of her being brought to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she liv'd with you?</p>
               <p>Phipps. I believe she liv'd with me about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. How was her behaviour that time?</p>
               <p>Phipps. Her behaviour was nothing amiss, and to the last went about the house very chearful and merry, and I really thought it had been a distemper.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>A. No, I did not; when I went to see her in the morning she told me she had been very ill of the cholic.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in the house?</p>
               <p>A. About eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been there?</p>
               <p>A. I have been there longer.</p>
               <p>Q. What morning was this you speak of?</p>
               <p>A. This was on the 29th of April. I ask'd her how she was then, she said she was very ill, but said she was a great deal easier than she had been.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>A. This was about ten o'clock. I ask'd her if she would please to have any thing, she said no. I went down and brought her up some broth; she eat them, and said she was a good deal easier and better, and beg'd she might lie down and go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she up at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260024"/>A. No, she was in bed then. I went down, and after that went to her again, and said I thought she seemed very ill, and if she would have body of her acquaintance to come I would send for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>A. This was about half an hour after ten o'clock; her answer was she was better, and she chose to lie still, and did not want any body. I went away from her, and went again in less than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she and you lie together?</p>
               <p>A. No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say then ?</p>
               <p>A. She said she was a great deal better, and desir'd she might not be disturb'd, for she was going to sleep. I left her, and after that she had some water gruel, and still desir'd to be alone by herself, and said she thought she should go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever suspect she was with child ?</p>
               <p>A. I did, and have often charged her with being with child, but she never would own it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you charged her?</p>
               <p>A. A great many times. She said she was no more with child than I was, and if she was, the D - l got it, for she never knew a man. From her answers she made me, I did believe it was a distemper, as she so stedsastly denied it; that afternoon she had some wine.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>A. It was between three and four o'clock. I never left her alone all day long, but was backwards and forwards; when I gave her the wine I perceived she was in a great deal of pain, I ask'd her if she would have any more, she said no, she had rather be left alone than to be troubled so. I was with her till the midwife came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know she was sent for?</p>
               <p>A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when she came?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was between 7 and 8 in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. After she came what did you observe?</p>
               <p>A. I was sent for something that was wanting, and was not in the room when the midwife found the child.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see when you return'd ?</p>
               <p>A. When I came again I saw a child lying on the table with its throat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the cut.</p>
               <p>A. It seem'd to be two inches long, crossway, directly in the middle of the throat.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep did it seem to be?</p>
               <p>A. I can't particularly tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing?</p>
               <p>A. I heard her say she did not know how that happen'd, for she did not go to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else?</p>
               <p>A. I observed a great quantity of blood wrap'd up in a colour'd apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body warm or cold?</p>
               <p>A. I was so frighted I could not observe any thing as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing besides blood in the colour'd apron?</p>
               <p>A. I observed the stool of a new-born infant there; it was wrap'd up with the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any more blood than what you speak of?</p>
               <p>A. I observed blood in the bed, and I saw likewise more about the bed-side, on the bed, not on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity?</p>
               <p>A. I really can't tell what quantity, there was a great deal.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she behave during the time she lived fellow servant with you?</p>
               <p>A. She always behaved well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not believe she was with child?</p>
               <p>A. I did not believe she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear like a person that had been in great torture ?</p>
               <p>A. Not then; she told me she was much easier than she had been.</p>
               <p>Q. How then did she appear?</p>
               <p>A. Not as a person in great torture.</p>
               <p>Q. When you carried her up some wine, and found her in pain, about three or four o'clock, how long did you stay with her?</p>
               <p>A. I staid with her till the midwife came.</p>

               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>A. Because she had so stiffly denied it to me. I was backwards and forwards all day long.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the times you were with her ?</p>
               <p>A. I was with her at ten, at eleven, between twelve and one, and when I came from dinner, which was about half an hour after three; it was at that time I went up and gave her some wine and a bit of bread.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it at the most you was absent from her at any one time that day?</p>
               <p>A. There was about half an hour's space between the times of my going to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you commonly in the room with her, or what you call backwards and forwards?</p>
               <p>A. I was backwards and forwards with her, she was not left alone any length of time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the child born?</p>

            . I was sent for to Mr. Phipps's, and when I came there was told they had a suspicion that the prisoner was with child.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that you went?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was about eight at night; I was desired by Mrs. Phipps to go up-stairs, but not to let her know who I was, or what I came about. I went up and told her I came from her friends ow how she did; she told me she was be than what she had been, but she had had the cholick a great many hours, and on asking of her several questions I had reason to believe that a child was born, upon which I acquainted Mrs. Phipps with my suspicion who desired I would insist upon knowing where the child was laid.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you upon that ?</p>
               <p>A. I told her I found she was suspected in the house for being with child, and I apprehended she would make no scruple in letting the family know whether she was or not; she said she was not. I told her she had been delivered of a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did she make to that?</p>
               <p>A. I told her I was very well assured there had been a child born. She said, how could I prove that? I said from many circumstances, and your master and his lady are in the other room with an officer, who will come in and take you into custody if you will not confess it, and where it is laid; then, after a great many hesitations; she told me it was under the bolster, where I look'd and found it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find it?</p>
               <p>A. The throat was cut, and it was wrap'd up in a colour'd apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large or small wound?</p>
               <p>A. There was a large wound cross the throat, as to the length I can't be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, according to your judgment, whether the child had been dead long or not?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe not?</p>
               <p>A. The stomach was warm, and I observ'd two or three drops of blood issue from the throat, after it was laid upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the limbs, was there any warmth there?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any quantity of blood?</p>
               <p>A. I can't be a judge as to the quantity, the apron was full; there was a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else upon the apron?</p>
               <p>A. I observed a stool there.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you observ'd, can you form any judgment whether the child was born alive or not.</p>
               <p>A. I rather think it was than it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you recollect something from that stool being upon the apron?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did ever a child that was born dead make a stool to your knowledge?</p>
               <p>A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether it was a perfect child?</p>
               <p>A. It was at its full time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blood upon the bed?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; there was a large quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260026"/>Q. Could you form any judgment how long the child had been dead?</p>
               <p>A. The limbs seem'd as if they had been cram'd together.</p>
               <p>Q. How, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. One leg seem'd to be drawn up backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment with what instrument this incision was made?</p>
               <p>A. I asked her where the knife was. She said it was in the chair by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it there?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, I did, as she directed. (Produced in court; the court and jury look at it, and find blood dried on it.)</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been a midwife a great while?</p>
               <p>A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sufficient knowledge to know this; supposing a child is strangled, or otherwise killed just at the time it is born, so that it does not come alive from the woman, can you distinguish whether it can have a stool, supposing life just departed from it?</p>
               <p>A. I think it impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. When life is going by violence from any person, do you know or not, whether those persons have evacuations at the mouth, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>A. We have often instances in that at the mouth, but I can't say I ever met with it in this kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that blood that was in the bed was in that part of the bed where the prisoner lay?</p>
               <p>A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that issued from the child?</p>
               <p>A. No, I do not; but it was the consequence of another cause.</p>
               <p>Council. You say one of the child's legs was a little drawn up.</p>
               <p>A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary of a child, if there should be a hard birth, to be distorted in its birth?</p>
               <p>A. They are generally contracted, but where there is life we put them strait; a child is generally drawn a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen women in great torture of a hard birth; is it not such as would make her glad of every opportunity to relieve herself from that torture?</p>
               <p>A. To be sure it would.</p>
               <p>Council. You say you ask'd her where the knife was, with which she made the wound, and she said it lay in the chair by the bedside; what was her answer to the next question ?</p>
               <p>A. I asked her how she could be so cruel. She said, she did not intend to murder it.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had had no directions at all of the prisoner, might not you have found the knife by the bedside?</p>
               <p>A. I imagine I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing upon the chair besides the knife?</p>
               <p>A. I can't take upon me to say there was, but I was very much surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. In the delivery of this child, might it not be necessary to make use of some sort of an instrument?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner?</p>
               <p>A. To part the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Must that instrument be applied to the child's throat?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is something to be cut, is there not?</p>
               <p>A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the child in the delivery was to be very difficult in coming from the mother, and the mother should attempt to cut the navel-string, might not she cut the throat through mistake?</p>
               <p>A. I can't say any thing to that; I never met with any instance of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not children sometimes their navel-strings wrap'd round their necks in their birth?</p>
               <p>A. Very often; the umbilical vein was cut within an inch and a half, or two inches of the body.</p>
               <p>

            . I was desired to examine the child, to determine whether it was born alive or dead if I could; I found it lying at it's full length upon a table.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175705260027"/>Q. Did it appear to you to have been born perfect?</p>
               <p>A. It did, in all its parts, and at it's full time. I f ound a large wound extended cross the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that wound be?</p>
               <p>A. From skin to skin it might be about three inches in length; it had divided the wind-pipe entirely, and all the blood vessels on each side the wind-pipe, both veins and arteries. I thought I observed that blood had been forced from the wound backwards, there was the trace of fresh blood in the nose, and the child had been washed very clean.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you collect from seeing fresh blood there?</p>
               <p>A. From that I collected that the child was born alive, for I imagine the blood by the breath had been forced up into the nose thro' the wind-pipe; this was an argument with me to induce me to believe it, for no dead body breathes. I then open'd the body, and examin'd the state of the lungs, and found they had been inflated, there had wind passed into the lungs; the nature of the lungs is, when the animal has been alive and air has passed into them, that they will float in water; any animal that has never been alive, and breath has never passed into the lungs, they will sink in water. This is a positive proof to know that the child had been alive. From this circumstance I did conclude that the child had been alive, and gave it in as my judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment how long the child had been alive?</p>
               <p>A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take it that the lungs were as much inflated as if the child had breathed for for a considerable time?</p>
               <p>A. I don't determine that, the lungs may inlarge by the continual admission of air; they may extend themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the child strangled in its birth, with its head foremost, as soon as the mouth is exposed to the air, might it not be said the lungs are in some degree inflated?</p>
               <p>A. I can't take upon me to determine that. In such cases it is the strongest proof we can arrive at, by trying the lungs in water, to know whether the child has or has not breathed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the apron afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the stool?</p>
               <p>A. I did, but can't pretend to say any thing in relation to that; that is not what I was call'd to determine.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Council. Then the moment the air gets into the lungs they become inflated; can you see any reason why a child that has got it's head in the air, and afterwards dies in the birth, why that child's lungs should not be inflated, because inflation must go in at the mouth?</p>
               <p>A. I can't determine how far that may or may not be the case, because I have not examin'd it so critically.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of what is laid to my charge. I did not know what I did at that time.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shaw. I have been in the midwisry and surgery way many years. I have known more instances than one, that children have had stools and urine where they have died in the birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a woman in great agony in labour should attempt to cut the navel string, might not she cut the child's throat?</p>
               <p>A. I can't say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known navel strings wrap'd round the child's neck?</p>
               <p>A. I have known that very often. I was once call'd upon such an occasion, and I found a piece of the navel string left in the kitchen, cut in two different places.</p>

               <p>Huntley. It is about a year and half ago. He delivered a petition to me, and desired me to speak favourably to my brother jurymen for him.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. On the eighth of April last. I went and found the prisoner at the sign of the Cock in Duke-street, the house of one Macurr; there were two other men along with the prisoner, one is here, the other look'd to be a sailor. We took them before justice Wright, when the other sailor was discharg'd, and this was committed to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other man was a ship-mate of mine, and he shew'd his ticket to the justice.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in this court last December was twelve-month.</p>
               <p>Hudson. No, I was not. I don't know every person that comes into Newgate and goes out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know one named Furgerson that was tried in this court?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There was a Furgerson that came into Newgate about 13 or 14 months ago, I am not sure to the time. He was a great deal lesser than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what he came in for?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I think it was about some stockings.</p>

               <p>A. I am a plaisterer. I was with the other men in this building when the Jew came in with some pencils, and ask'd if we wanted to buy any, opening his handkerchief. There were four carpenters at work. Henry Hill bought a dozen pencils, and gave the Jew a shilling for them. After that the Jew miss'd three dozen, and made a sad racket about them. They advised him to go up stairs after Benjamin Hill. He went up, and then I saw Broad take some pencils from under the bench, and carry them into the next room on the same floor.</p>

I never thought any more of it afterwards, till one day this week, as I was coming through Westminster, I met Benjamin Hill, who desired me to come to Hicks's-hall to find the bill, and said I was to speak what I knew in behalf of the Jew.</p>

               <p>Marshall. It was in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you before a magistrate with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I was before justice Welch; he ask'd her if she was guilty of taking the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any things mention'd?</p>
               <p>Marshall. They were particularly; my wife charged her. There the prisoner own'd she had taken and pawn'd them.</p>
               <p>A. Marshall. I am wife to the prosecutor. I trusted the prisoner the same as if she had been my own sister. We let her be at our house till she got a place. I missed several things.</p>
               <p>Q. Name them.</p>
               <p>A. Marshall. There were five handkerchiefs, a piece of new lace, about a yard and a half of it, two lawn aprons, a linen gown, and two dimity waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>A. Marshall. From out of four separate drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>A. Marshall. I was going to church on the fifteenth of May, I said to her, go to such a drawer, and bring me an apron and handkerchief; she went and said here is no apron here. I said, then look in another drawer, she did, and said she could not find any, then I went and look'd in all the drawers; I missed the things mentioned, my husband came in at the time. Then I said I'd go to enquire at the pawnbrokers on the morrow, to see if I could find them. I went out to tell a neighbour my loss, and left her with my husband, and when I returned, my husband told me the prisoner had confessed to him that she had taken them; after that she own'd the same to me, and told me where she had paw'd them at different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what you missed?</p>
               <p>A. Marshall. I did, we took her before Mr. Welch, where she voluntarily own'd of herself the taking them all.</p>

               <p>I had been there some time, and was hired to several places, but Mrs. Marshall would not let me go, being very ill, and said she would make it up to me. I had no money, and she said she had none, so I pledg'd these things, thinking to get them again when I got a little money.</p>
