I am a bill discounter, at 8, St. Benet's-place, City—I first knew the prisoner some six months before this transaction—about 24th March he called at my office; we were on pretty friendly terms at that time, and he said, "Brown, here is a bill that I think you may take; it is an order which Mr. Preece, the acceptor of the bill, has received from some steam-boat company for bottled beer; I can't carry it out, not having the money, unless I get the bill discounted; there is about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit on it to me; if you will take 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, write me out the cheque"—in answer to that I said, not knowing the acceptor, and having one or two little things, running with him at that time, I would not take it without some further knowledge—he then said, "Well, Mr. Preece, the acceptor, is a young man, and not long established in business, but he has a brother, Mr. W. Preece, at Southampton, a civil engineer, a highly respectable man; he keeps an account at the Hampshire Banking Company, and if I get his endorsement on the bill, will you then take it?"—I then said, "Believing what you say, to be true, I will take it"—at that time he showed me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had the acceptor's name, G. Preece, on it as it is now; it was endorsed by the prisoner at that time—the name, W. D. Preece, was not on it then—about two days afterwards the prisoner came to me, and said he had sent the bill to Southampton, and had received it back that morning—he produced it to me, with the endorsement, W. D. Preece, on it—I then drew this cheque for 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to the prisoner—the bill became due, it was pre<lb/>sented in the ordinary way, and it has never been paid—I have not been able to find the endorser—I afterwards received these two letters from the pri<lb/>soner—there are no dates to any of his letters—there is one letter here which would be written about a fortnight after the date of the bill—I saw the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186509180004"/>
               <p>prisoner several times after the bill became due; he wrote to me, and I afterwards saw him personally, and he told me that Mr. W. D. Preece was dead, and I need not trouble myself about it, but he would go down to South-ampton, and see the executors, and I should be recouped the money—I can't say in whose handwriting the W. D. Preece is—(<hi rend="italic">Two letters from the prisoner to Mr. Brown were put in and read, the first stating that Mr. W. D. Preece had died on the day the bill became due, and the second, asking him to send a copy of the bill of Preece's to him at the Railway Hotel, Southamton, and that Mr. Preece, the acceptor, had had</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">out of the bill</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">Bill read</hi>:) "March 24th, 1865. Bill for 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Henry Wilshin, Accepted by G. Preece, endorsed by Henry Wilshin. W. D. Preece" the cheque I gave to the prisoner was returned paid through my bankers—the prisoner endorsed it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter I wrote in answer to the second letter he wrote to me—it was returned to me through the dead-letter office.</p>

Q.</hi> You have known the prisoner about six months, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About that—I met him at the house of some friends—I had a bill transaction with him somewhere about a month afterwards—I live at Moulsey, and he lives at Thames Ditton—he mentioned a bill one morning in the train, and I negociated a bill for him—I have had about five transac<lb/>tions with him in all—the total amount of business done for him was 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the total amount of interest 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—50 per cent, was not the general rate of interest—I did not charge him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for changing a cheque; he would per<lb/>sist in paying me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the cheque; no charge was made—50 per cent is not my ordinary rate of interest—I went to Paris for a week with the pri<lb/>soner and my father-in-law—I think it was in Easter week—I also went for a day's shooting with him—I think that was after the first bill had been dis<lb/>counted, but before anything was irregular—we each paid our own expenses, but I think I paid his because he had a cheque from me for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the same day we went, and I have not been paid yet—at the last moment he said, "I can't go with you; I have been disappointed in two or three cheques," and the end of it was that I let him have 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bills were not drawn to cover expenses as well as other things—the business transactions had no<lb/>thing to do with the Paris trip—I really do not know what the prisoner is; he was supposed to have something like 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and he afterwards took a place at 8, St. Helen's-place, on the second-floor, and settled himself as a commission agent—my offices were on the first-floor there—he asked me if I knew a place for an office—he told me he was not doing anything then—he said he should like an office, and he took this place at a rent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his wife has 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and at that time I believed he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

I live at 26, Seething-lane—I have known the defendant nearly thirteen years, he lived at 12, Barking-churchyard—prior to June,.1862, I had been in the habit of lending him small sums of money—in that month he came to me and said, "Bob, I want to borrow 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Yes; but it is a large amount, what do you want it for?"—he said, "I am going to pay my partner, we are going to dissolve partnership, and I want the money"—I said, "What are you going to give me as security?"—he said, "I will give you the lease of my house, when can I have it?—I said, "I will go up stairs and see if I can let you have it now, and if so I will let you know"—I went and got the money ready, had it counted out, and said, "Harry, that is the money," and he said, "And that is the lease of my house, "giving me this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped up in a piece of thin paper, and an I O U for the amount—I should not have parted with that amount of money, if I had not believed that was the lease of his house—he was to pay me 5 per cent, interest; he paid the interest for two years—I found out what this document was about four months wince—I then discovered that it was an old lease, dated in 1833—I went to him and told him of it, and he said, "Oh, my God, you have found me out"—I said, "Yes. you had better see about settling it, what are you going to do?"—he said, "All right, Bob, you shan't lose, I will make it right, come on old boy, come and have a glass of ale."</p>

I live with my father, at 6, Blue Anchor-yard, York-street, Westminster—on 11th August, about half-past 10 in the morning, I was at the door of a public-house and the prisoner spoke to me—he said, "Go and get me a quarter of a pound of cheese, and I will wait till you come back"—he showed me the shop and gave me a half-crown—I went to the shop—Mr. Morrell gave me the cheese—I gave him the half crown—he tried it and it broke—I gave him a description of the prisoner—I was in the shop about an hour talking to Mr. Morrell—after then I went out with the cheese, and went to the Blue Anchor to see if I could see him, but he was not there—I saw a man who is not here, but did not give him the cheese—he spoke to me about it—I went that day with a policeman to a house—I saw the prisoner and his wife—the constable said, "Is that the man," and I said "Yes"—I had seen him before, and his wife and also the other man, but I never saw him with the prisoner.</p>

I keep a cheesemonger's shop—on 11th August this little girl came for a quarter of a pound of cheese, and gave me a half<lb/>crown—I tested it and broke a piece off it—it was bad—she gave me a description of a youngish looking man, with a long dark coat and dark cap, and without any beard or moustache; and I think she said he had a broad chin—I detained her, sent for a policeman, and went outside the door and looked for the man—about a quarter of an hour after the girl came I saw the prisoner pass the shop and look in very hard—he was dressed in a long dark coat and a cap—he went to the cow-yard—I saw him again half an hour afterwards with another man—I went out, met a constable, and then sent the girl out with the cheese—I saw the man who I had seen with the prisoner go and speak to her—I am quite certain of him—the constable</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Vauxhall—I am in the employ of Mr. E. T. Smith, the proprietor of Cremorne-gardens, and have been so for four or five years; it is part of my duty to attend to the glass lustres—I employed the prisoner to assist me for one fortnight—his duties were to clean the lustres and to put them in a proper state to put up—they were cleaned in a room on the premises—I can positively speak to these lustres (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) they are Mr. Smith's property—I never authorised the prisoner to take, them away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Cremorne-gardens, and have been so for several years—I can speak positively to the identity of these lustres—the prisoner was one of the band at Cremorne, and was also employed by Mr. Eaton—he absented himself from the gardens for some days—he returned on the evening of 19th August—I told him I had received information that there was property stolen from Cremorne in his apartment—he replied, "If there is, Fisher must have stolen it"—I said, "If the property is there, have you any objection to letting me see it?"—he hesitated a moment and then said, "No, if you like to go you may go and see it?"—I said, "Well, let us go," and we walked towards his apartments—when we came to the end of the street, he refused to go any further—Manley, a police-officer in plain clothes, was by us, and I said, "If you refuse to go I shall be obliged to compel you;" and after some objection he at last consented, and we went to his lodging, it consisted of two rooms in Blantyre-street, Chelsea—he applied to the land-lady for the key—he said, "Bring me my key"—the rooms were un<lb/>furnished—on the sideboard, by the side of the fire-place, I found two parcels rolled up in newspaper—the policeman opened them, and they contained these lustres, which I examined and at once knew were Mr. Smith's property—I said, "Barnes, you must know that these are stolen from Cremorne"—he said, "Well, you cannot charge me with stealing them"—I said, "But I can charge you with the unlawful possession, and I shall give you in charge for that"—which I did—I believe Fisher lived somewhere in the neighbour<lb/>hood of the King's-road.</p>

I am a porter at 18, Garlic-hill—on Saturday, 19th August, I was at the Boar's-head, in Cannon-street—I left there at about twenty minutes to eleven—I had been there about twenty minutes—I was at the bar—while there I saw the three prisoners and another man, an ac<lb/>complice, they were together—the one who is not in custody forced his con<lb/>versation upon me, he was dressed as a sailor—he said he had been over in America, and was talking about what he had done there—the others took part in it—I can't recollect what they said—they asked me to drink—I rather refused at first—they wanted me to stand a quartern of gin, which I refused three or four times; afterwards thinking a row was about to com<lb/>mence, I paid for one quartern for quietness—they then wanted me to pay for another—I then went out for convenience—the three prisoners followed me out—I had scarcely got a few yards from the house, when the male prisoner came and threw his arms round my neck, and the two females came and rifled my pockets of three half-crowns and a bunch of keys—Flannagan put her hands in my pocket, Carney was on my right hand side assisting the other two in robbing me—the two females then made their escape—the man also got from me—I went up Nicholas-lane and met him there, he was alone—a constable came up, and I charged him with being an accomplice in rob<lb/>bing me of three half-crowns—he said he had nothing at all to do with it—at the station he said, "Did I nail your three half-crowns?"—I said, "No, your accomplices did"—he then said, "All the blame comes upon my shoulders."</p>

I am a Baker, of 108, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green—on Monday night, 8tb August, I shut up my house and remained up after all had gone to bed—the windows were shut and the house safe—before I went to bed I called up my men to work—I went to bed about 12 o'clock—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was called by my men—I went directly into the bake-house—from what I heard, I went into the parlour, and saw my till on the floor, quite empty—the previous night it had been on the table, and had in it from 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and amongst it was sixpennyworth of farthings, separate in the till—the prisoner had been in my service for about five months, and left about five months ago.</p>

On 19th August, about a quarter past one in the morning, I was on duty in Broad-street, Ratcliff—I saw the prisoner lying against a door, apparently asleep—I saw a common clasp knife lying by his side, shut—I took hold of his arm and asked him to get up—he said b——if he would—I then said, "What does this knife mean lying by your side?"—he said, "b——what is that to you"—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Get</hi> up and <hi rend="italic">go away home</hi>, you might get robbed"—he then got up and crossed over the road, and then swore again—I found it was no use talking to him any longer, and I said, "If you don't go away now, I shall take you into custody"—he said b——if he would—I then took him into custody—he commenced kicking and struggling—I seized him by the collar—he said several times, "You b——will you let go?"—I said, "No, you are in my custody; I shan't leave you now till I get you to the station"—we then proceeded on for some considerable distance, when all of a sudden he said, "Now you b——will you let me go," and struck me with his right fist on the left side of my head, and knocked me down—I pulled him down on me, and held him till Sharp and Sergeant Procter came to my assistance—I felt as if I was stunned by the blow and the blood flew all down my neck—Procter said to me, "Go to the station, you are stabbed"—I saw Sharp endeavour to take the knife out of the prisoner's hand (it was the same knife that I had seen lying on the pavement)—it was shut, he could not open the prisoner's hand to get it, and was obliged to hit him across the hand with his staff—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) there is blood on it now—I went to the station and had my wound dressed—I have been under the doctor's hands ever since, and have not done a day's duty—the prisoner was drunk.</p>

On the morning of 19th August, I was on duty in Broad-street, Ratcliff, and saw the prisoner in Stretch's custody—I went to his assistance, turned my light on, and asked what was the matter—Stretch said he had found him asleep, and asked him to get up and he would not, and he said he would take him to the station—whilst I had my light on, he said to me, "You are the b——as robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd"——Sergeant Procter came up a few minutes afterwards and said I had better go to the station with him, and I walked a few yards behind him—we had got above one hundred, or one hundred and twenty yards, when I observed him and Stretch having a struggle on the ground—I ran up and saw the prisoner swing his arm round and make a blow with his right hand—Procter came up and said, "He has got a knife in his hand"—I tried to get it from him, but could not, and I drew my staff and hit him three times across the knuckles—the knife dropped on the ground and I picked it up—I saw blood follow the blow he made, it smothered my coat all over.</p>

I know she would come and see me often, but you keep her away, and she is very submissive, and you do not care how hard she slaves, like some poor drudge of a servant. If you loved her you would not allow it, in her declining state of health. Since you have had her you have broke her spirit. If the dinner is not ready to a minute, look at the agitated state she is in, frightened almost to death. As I told you last Sunday, I am the woman for spirit, and you held my arms till they were black and blue the other day. Sir, I am still inclined to come to terms, to save any more bother or further trouble, as you know what I mean—the affair between you and me that has taken place at Bow. The best thing you can do is to supply me with a few pounds, and I will go to New Zealand, and then you will be rid of those you have acted so wrong to. I must have an answer to this. Tell Caroline to bring or send me a few shillings. I will pay her again. This is not her fault, but yours, sir. Remember. P. S.—Sir, I want the answer" (<hi rend="italic">no signature</hi>)—In consequence of this I instructed my solicitor to write a letter to her—this letter, written by the prisoner to my foreman, was given to me on Saturday 24th June—<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> "June 23rd, 1865. Respected sir,—I hope you will furnish me with the information I require, that is to tell me the exact road or place where Mr. Giles takes his evening walk, and the time that he can be seen or met on such place, as I want to know particular; hoping, sir, you are quite" well and all at home. Please to write an answer by return of post, and I shall feel obliged. Direct Miss S. Geals, 38, Grafton-street, Mile End"—On 17th July, about a quarter or twenty minutes to eight in the evening, the prisoner came to the first loop hole, when I was seeing my work-people—it is where we give work out—she asked my foreman for me in my hearing—I went from the door leading from the first shop into the passage, and found the prisoner at the second door—I was partly inside and partly out—I said, "Well Sarah, what is your pleasure with me?"—she made no reply, but presented a pistol in my face, and said, "That"—I heard the explosion of the cap, and felt a slight concussion on my left cheek bone—she threw the pistol through the first loop hole, where she had applied for me, and ran out—my foreman</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know how long the prisoner has been passing to the world as a man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of my own knowledge, but from what I have heard 17 or 18 years; five or six years before I knew her—I always found her strictly honest—Caroline is the woman who she represented as her wife; she is now my wife—she was living with the prisoner at the time, but I very seldom saw her—they lived in a small house, not in lodgings—I never went there and saw them together, but I have met them in the street—it was generally believed that they were man and wife—I knew nothing of their private affairs, or whether they lived comfortably together—I never heard anything to the contrary—I always found the prisoner honest, but she was of an excitable temper—she had been with me a few weeks when my wife was taken ill—my wife died in the beginning of January—Caroline was not in the habit of coming to the house till my wife wanted further assistance—I then asked the prisoner to allow Caroline to come to my wife—I very seldom saw Caroline before that, but I proposed for her to wait on my wife, because it was handy and she could come at once—she waited on my wife two or three days—it was three months after my wife's death that Caroline communicated to me the prisoner's sex—Caroline remained with me in the day time after my wife's death, but went home at night—I do not know how she came to communicate the prisoner's sex—I married her four months afterwards, this time twelve months—I communicated with the prisoner before I married Caroline—Caroline had told the prisoner that she had revealed the secret—I have heard two or three reasons for the prisoner's extraordinary conduct—she placed a paper in my hands stating that she really was a female.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it stated to you by others that the cause of this extraordinary conduct was a disappointment in marriage in early life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is just what I was going <hi rend="italic">to</hi> explain—I have no reason to suspect that her mind is affected, but she is of an excitable disposition—she changed her attire about six weeks before our marriage—she and her brother were the only two persons present at our marriage—I took a place for her in September, 1863—I had been married a very short time then—I have been married thirteen months now—my wife and I visited her on Sundays, and I have been there on Sun<lb/>day mornings to make the books up—we continued to visit her—the busi<lb/>ness did not prosper—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in different sums—she very seldom drank after separating from Caroline—the least drink she bad made her eccentric in her conduct—I supplied her with this pistol (<hi rend="italic">producing another</hi>) for her protection when she lived in that house alone, and when the shop was let I took it away—I brought it here in my waistcoat pocket, as I did not know whether it might be required—she kept it loaded at times—I do not know whether she used it constantly; she has been in the habit of using fire-arms, I understand, from a child—my wife was standing by my side</p>

               <p>when the pistol was discharged—the prisoner had never left off visiting us; she was there on Sunday, and used to dine with us, and remain all day—I think June 10th was the last time she visited at our place, when she stayed three or four hours, and went away early in the afternoon—she did not dine with us that day; there was a little disturbance between her and my wife that morn<lb/>ing, but I was out—the affair of the pistol happened as quickly as I describe it—there is no doubt the cap exploded; and it is in this paper now—I think the lock was out of order—she was living at 38, Grafton-street, Mile-end—I paid her the whole of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and lent her money afterwards—I do not know whether she had been drinking more frequently than site had been in the habit of doing—I once reprimanded her for drinking, knowing that it excited her—I do not know whether my wife has written to her since she has been in prison—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my wife's, but the prisoner's brother's writing.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of 1, Chiltern-view-terrace, near Uxbridge—I have seen this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a mill; the Leet, a stream of water, runs along here, and there is a footpath by the Bide of it—here is the high-road from West Drayton going towards Uxbridge—the little girl, Elizabeth Lydia Bacheller, was my niece; she had been staying with me six weeks; she came down for a change, and was shortly expected to be taken back again—she was four years old and a few days—on 21st August I had been working at Langlcy-park, and was coming home at quarter or half-past 7—she has several times come out to meet me—I know the prisoner; he lives in Uxbridge, and is a dealer in old clothes—he keeps a pony and cart—as I crossed the high-road, I heard a horse and cart coming from West Drayton towards Uxbridge—I looked round, and saw the prisoner driving it as fast as the pony could gallop—it was a large pony, and the prisoner was flogging it—he was very near to me—from the place where I saw him it is an open straight road, and is twenty-four or twenty-five feet broad at the nearest part, at the end of the terraee—he passed about two strides from me—Messer was walking with me, and I said, 'Out of the way; here they come flogging away,' and put my arm out as a guard, by which means we both avoided it, and the cart went behind us—I imme<lb/>diately looked round, and saw the horse's legs just striking the child, which threw her on her back, and the off-wheel passed over the lower part of her neck or chest—from the near-side of the cart was about fourteen or fifteen feet—he was near the middle of the road, but, if anything, deviating to the off-side—I saw nothing else on the road; he had the whole command of the road—it was quite light; I do not know whether the sun had set—Messer picked the child up—it never moved afterwards—I did not know at the time that it was the child that was stopping at my house—I saw the pri<lb/>soner, two or three minutes afterwards, coming with his cart—a man was sitting with him, and there were two children behind—the prisoner was drunk—the child had been in very good health; never better.</p>

I am gaoler at the Mansion House justice-room—on Saturday afternoon, 2d September, about half-past 1, I was on duty adjoining the prison cells; a Mrs. Burrows came into the passage to make some inquiry of me—I asked her to go to the bottom, and I would speak to her—when I opened the door to answer her, I saw the prisoner there, pressing against Mrs. Burrows very rudely—I said, "What are you about?"—he made no reply, but walked out of the passage into the street—I then spoke to Mrs. Burrows, and from something she told me, I followed the prisoner—I lost sight of him for a minute or so, but when I got outside the door, I saw him about twenty yards off, just stepping up to another man—he moved his hand towards him, but did not pass anything—I caught hold of him, and said, "I charge you with stealing a watch from a lady in the passage"—he said, "I do not know anything about it; I have not done it"—I took him back into the passage—there was another female sitting down there on a form, and he placed his hand in her lap; the moment his band left the lap, I saw this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is wrenched off from the swivel—I gave him into the custody of the officer Curtis.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Limehouse, and am foreman to Messrs. Abbott, Gun-lane, Limehouse—on the evening of the 11th September I sent Baker with a cart load of grains to North Woolwich—I told him to take them oh to the marshes for Messrs. Abbott's, cows—he had no authority to sell any—I have seen Bryant before—he has nothing to do with my master's cows—the grains were worth 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per bushel—a boy named Prudence went with him.</p>

On the evening of the 11th of this month, about half-past 7, I was on duty in North Woolwich-road—I saw two carts standing there; one was laden with grains and the other with sawdust—I saw Baker and another boy on the cart laden with grains—Baker had a shovel in his hand, and was putting grains into a sack—the cart containing the sawdust had got Bryant's name on it—the sack of grains was taken to the back of Bryant's cart by himself—another man helped to lift them on his back—I heard Bryant say, "That will do," and he left—I spoke to Baker, and gave him into the custody of another policeman—I followed Bryant, and overtook him—i told him I should take him into custody for receiving grains, well knowing them to have been stolen—he became very violent, and I had a great difficulty in getting him to the station—I returned to the place where the carts had stood, and there found a quantity of grains shot down by a brick wall.</p>

Q.</hi> What sort of a room was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A large, airy room with two windows—there was not much furniture; it presented an appearance of poverty, not very great poverty; not more than is usual in the neighbourhood; it is a poor neighbourhood—when I first went into the room there was a thin coverlid over the child's face—that would not affect life in any way—I did not take the child up in my arms, I merely examined it—I touched its hand and it moved—I was there two or three minutes examining it, sufficient to satisfy me—I took no steps to prolong its life, because it was impossible in my opinion to have done so—I left it there—there were several other persons in the room besides the prisoners when I left, several came in—I thought it impossible it could recover—I took no steps to save its life, because it was just dead; as nearly dead as possible; no power whatever could have restored it—the movement of its hand was the only sign of life—I give it as my opinion that no food had been given to the child for two or three days—if it had a small quantity of food and thrown it up again, that would account for none being found in the stomach; from my examination I should say none had passed into the stomach; I do not say none had been given—there was not the slightest evidence of any having been there—a child in a weakly state would be likely to throw up food, if it disagreed with him—it is a fact that some weakly children refuse the breast—other food would then have to be supplied—farinaceous food would have to be supplied—there are a variety of preparations, corn flour and other things—they require to be carefully prepared.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But to make arrowroot even, requires some care and skill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It requires a little care, it does not require skill—it does not always follow that a child, born of parents who are given to drink, would be weakly, nor generally; it does occasionally—in all probability, if the parent was an habitual drinker of gin, it would make the child more weakly than it otherwise would be—the average weight of a child of that age, would be about nine or ten pounds—this child was eighteen days old—some healthy days old—some healthy</p>

               <p>children weigh less and some a great deal more—I have never, myself, weighed a child of that age and found it less—I did not attend the mother when the child was bora, nor see it before at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the kidneys were imperfectly developed, was that from disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the kidneys are very often imperfectly developed in a child of that age—Rawley came for me—I can't say how the room door was fastened—I did not break it open, I merely put my hand and pushed it open—if a child is examined very shortly after it has taken food, and thrown it up again, you would find some traces of it; it is never all entirely thrown up—I think I should find traces of it four or five hours afterwards—the child is said to have died at 10 o'clock, that same evening—the covering over its face was just carelessly thrown on, as it is generally put over little children that are dead—it was laid in bed, with its head on the pillow, and the clothes just put over it, as you will generally find when babies are put to bed; not in a careless, negligent way, as if they did not care what became of the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 182, Brick-lane, Spitalfields—on Wednesday, 30th August, I assisted Mr. Allenson in making the post mortem examination—I should say it was a full period child—it was very emaciated—there were no external marks of violence—there were marks of fleas all over it—internally all the organs were healthy; there was some little malformation about the kidneys—I should say the child died from ex<lb/>haustion from want of food—there was no trace of any about the stomach or intestines—the intestines were also very much contracted, showing the absence and want of food—I think it had been without food some days—I saw nothing in the appearance of any of the organs to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you think it possible, that to an inexperienced eye, the child might, through weakness, present the appearance of being dead, some hours before it really was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should think so—I have seen some children in so very low a state, as to be to all appearance dead for some hours before death—there was no trace of food at all—if it rejected food there would be very little trace of it—the intestines being contracted in the way they were, led me to believe that the child had been without food some days—I mean that no food had passed into the intestines—I can't say it had not received food on the day it died—I can only say none</p>

               <p>had passed into the intestines—a weakly child will constantly throw up its food—if unable to take the breast, and other food be administered, it will very often throw it up, but with experienced attendance that can generally be alleviated and relieved—I think, as a medical man, I could relieve it—the malformation of the kidneys had nothing whatever to do with the state of the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the ordinary course of things, the mother's milk and nothing else, would be food enough for a child of that age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite sufficient; the best food it could have—it might be so vitiated by habitual drunkenness, that the child would derive no nourishment from it, and regularly throw a great quantity of it up—in all probability the child was born weakly, the mother being given to drink, and it would be supplied with the worst possible milk for its growth and strength—if milk is thrown up you can generally trace it within two or three hours—you might, or might not, trace it within six hours; I think it is doubtful; it would depend a good deal on the quality of the milk—as a rule it would leave some slight trace—I can't form an opinion, as to how many days it had been without food.</p>

I am a midwife, and live at 6, Wood-street, Spitalfields—I attended the female prisoner during her confinement—the child was born on 10th August—I did not deliver her, it was born before I arrived—I was sent for, to attend to her, immediately afterwards—I did what was necessary—I did not send for a doctor, it was not requisite—I was paid by the parish—when I attend any person in a confinement, I have to report to the doctor, and he visits the second day—I reported the birth of his child to Mr. Keen, the parish doctor, and he went to see her the next day—I continued my attendance to the fourth or fifth day—it was an average weight child, I suppose about seven or eight pounds—it was perfectly healthy when I left—I don't know whether it had been suckled in that time—the mother made no complaint to me respecting the breast—I saw no food given to it—Mr. Stack said they were badly off, and bad no clothes for the infant, and I told him they had better go down to the house and get some—they did go, and they got some—I think they also got some arrow-root—Mrs. Stack said the child had come earlier than she expected, and that was her reason for having no clothing for it—I thought the child had arrived at the full period of gestation—it had every appearance of it—I have had considerable experience, for nearly 25 years—it would have been my duty, if the child was not going on properly, to send the doctor to attend—I saw not the slightest necessity for doing so—I had no reason to suppose it would not live.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 27 1/2, Great Pearl-street—I know the prisoners—I think they are Irish—I remember the child being born—the male prisoner asked me to come to his house and see his wife, as the child had come unexpectedly, he did not think she would be confined until coming on Christmas—I went and found Mrs. Stack in bed, with the baby in her arms—I stayed with her very nearly an hour—Mr. Stack was there at the time—the female said, "The little baby has nothing to put on it, only the other child's things," and Mr. Stack and I went down to the workhouse and got a petticoat, a shirt, and a frock for the baby, also some arrowroot and sugar, and gruel and meal—I saw Mrs. Stack again once or twice, and I saw her once suckling the baby—I think that was about four or five days before I heard it was dying—I saw her on the Monday on which the baby died, from 12 to 1 o'clock in the morning, I think it was—I went there to see how the baby was—she was not sober then nor yet drank—the baby was alive at that time; she had it in her arms—she gave it the breast, and the baby shut its month against it—I think it was convulsed—there was a little foaming at the mouth—Mrs. Stack's little boy was crying at the time—it was a sickly child, and she put the baby into the bed to take the other child—that is a child of about four years old—I took the baby up in my arms, and sat with it next the fire, and I said, "I think Mrs. Stack the little baby is dying"—I saw a rattle come up in its throat—Mr. Stack said. "The child has been convulsed since 6 o'clock in the morning"—I then went home with my husband—we went to have a pint of beer first—the prisoners were then at home—I said to my husband, "There</p>

               <p>is Mr. Stack at the window, go over and call him, and give him a drop of beer"—at that time I do not think he had any beer—he came over, and had part of a pint of beer—his wife came over and said, "Come on home"—he said, "No, I will come in a few minutes; you know I have got no money; go home and mind the two dying babies"—she did not go homo, and be went out and struck her.</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose your husband paid for the beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was about 5 o'clock in the evening when we went to the workhouse; we got the things at once; we were not delayed—we got back again near 6 o'clock with the things—I did not stay any longer that night—on the Monday there was me and my husband, and the prisoners, a man who was working for the male prisoner, and a woman, the godmother of the child—I did not see the child have convulsions, but I saw it foaming at the mouth—it looked very delicate and ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The statements of the prisoners before the magistrate were read as follow: Edward Stack says</hi>, "It is the first time I have ever been in a court or prison in my life. I left the mother indoors in charge of the child, when I went to have a glass of ale with a party. I did not think I was in duty bound to take care of the child at all, being so young." <hi rend="italic">Honora Stack says</hi>, "When the child first was born, he never cared about drink<lb/>ing from the breast I put it in his mouth, and he would give one such, and leave it out of his mouth again; the nurse or the doctor never ordered me any castor-oil for the child. I gave it castor-oil; a tea-spoon full at a time, as far as it wanted. Likewise I used to give it a little drop of my own gruel at night, and then I got a little biscuit in boiling water, milk, and sugar, beat them up very fine, and give it to him, and then the nurse told me it was a seven-month child, and she never came to see the child. She said she would send the doctor. The doctor came on the Friday, found me in the bed, and he said, 'That little child will not live; it is over a seven-month child; between seven and eight months;' then the nurse never came till the Sunday to look after the child, and I told the doctor I had to wash it myself as the nurse did not come. The doctor said,' It is too soon for you to put your hands in water.' I told the doctor I did not open the child at all, but washed its legs down, to keep its legs clean till the nurse came. I tried as well as I could, and every day I went out I washed the child and cleaned him, and did not open him at all. I went out for my husband for fear of his taking a drop to drink too much. The child she some victuals on the Sunday morning, and then the Sunday evening he did not take anything, only drink. On the Monday he closed his lips entirely against drinking or taking anything from me."</p>

I have always kept it from myself, and given to my children"—I mentioned to the man that the child they had in their arms looked so very bad, and he said, "Well, it has got the worms; that accounts for it"—that was a child three years old—I took it to the workhouse with the other children—when I directed the constable to take the child out of the female's arms, she rather objected, and the man said, "Let them take it if they like, what matters? let it die"—the child is alive now, but very bad.</p>

Victoria-road, and am a boot-maker—all these boots are mine—I saw them safe at my house on Wednesday night, the 30th—I fastened the fanlight between 10 and 11—these boots were in a line with the fanlight, hanging on nails, within reach—a constable called me between 1 and 2—I found the fanlight open, and the glass broken—five pairs of boots were gone—one pair I found on the door-mat, and one pair I have not seen again.</p>

I think, until the first day of November—I arrived at Berwick-street on 16th or 17th October, and she remained at the hotel—she was in the habit of coming to my house at Berwick-street—she was in the habit of talking to me at the hotel, in the presence of my wife and my three daughters about her private affairs, and at Berwick-street likewise, but I bad two daughters less there, my wife and my eldest daughter only were there—she has often said that she intended to leave England and go to Scotland and thence to America, and to travel a great deal—I cannot exactly tell you how often she made that statement, but at table and in her room she has told me so often—she assigned no reason for doing so—I have known Coulan since 1st October—he was present somewhat often at those conversations, as well as my daughters—he was examined against me at the trial last session—the defendant did not finally fix the time when she intended to leave—she said to me one day, "We must employ ourselves by selling those conpons"—she had shown them to me in Paris, but she never showed me any here—I went to Whitecross-street prison about May, 1860, and saw her there—she was alone when I arrived—she first reproached me by saying that I had sold myself to M. Bouillon, and she proposed to me to make a new affidavit in her favour so as to destroy the one which I had made with Mr. Hall—I said that I would not, and refused to give my signature for any purpose—Mdlle. rey then came in, the former conversation was then finished, but Madame Valentin was going on speaking, and was raying that Coulan had told her that I had sold myself to M. Bouillon—after the entrance of Mdlle. Rey we did not talk of anything more, and I do not suppose she heard anything that was said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police at Scotland-yard—on the 8th of August last I met the prisoner in the Gray's-inn-road, about ten o'clock at night—I asked him if his name was Ancenay, be said it was—I told him I was an inspector of police, and that I had been to Southley-lodge, Datchet, near Windsor, that I had there opened two cases and seen certain plates which I believed were used for the purpose of Russian notes—he said, "I do not exactly understand you, please tell me in French if you can"—I did so; he then said, "I will tell you all about it; I am one of the oldest lithographers in Fiance; some years ago two men came to me and engaged me to make notes for the Government of Hungary—I came to London and worked for a Mr. Day, and we made notes to the extent of 290,000,000, we were then stopped by the Government and I returned to Paris; about two and-a-half years ago the same gentlemen again came to me and said they wanted me to go to London and make more notes for them, I consented, and from that time to the present I have been engaged with them; on the 1st of June I went to Southley-lodge, at Datchet, and there saw a gentle-man who gave the name of Mascaras, be told me to engrave plates and I did so, he said they were not good enough, and he would try photography, and he photographed some fifty Russian rouble notes; about a month ago he went away, and as he had not paid me I returned to London, having pre<lb/>viously packed up the plates; it was my intention to have gone to the Russian Ambassador, and have given myself up because I knew we were doing wrong"—I then asked the prisoner if he had any plates in London—he replied, "I am living with a woman, and she has some in her room"—I then went with the prisoner to No. 127, Gray's-inn-road, to a back room on the second floor, the prisoner went into the room first, looked under the bed and produced this box (marked B)—I asked him if he had any more plates—he replied, "There are two cases in the hands of one of our com<lb/>rades "—I asked him where he lived, and he said, "No. 4, Berwick-street, Soho"—he said, "It is no use your going there as he will not give them up to any one but me"—I then went to Berwick street with him, and in a front room I saw a man named Nichola with his wife and children—the prisoner said, "Adrian, I have come for those boxes; it is important I should send them to Paris to-night"—Nichola said, "Are you going to give these things</p>

               <p>up?"—Nichola and the prisoner looked under the bed and they took from it a large wooden box—the box is not here but the contents are—I asked if there was anything else, and Nichola then took the small box (marked C from a shelf—I then told Nichola that I was an officer, and should take him into custody as these boxes contained plates for the fabrication of Russian notes—Nichola said that the boxes had been entrusted to him by the pri<lb/>soner, and that he was not aware of the contents—I found this engraved metal plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied to one of the boxes—the prisoners were removed to the station, where I opened the box (marked" C) and found it to contain ten photographs of fifty-rouble Russian notes—I then returned to the pri<lb/>soner's lodgings, and there found a photographic copying frame, a printer's roller, and a quantity of paper, the same that I had found at Datchet, and also another sheet of paper, bearing an impression from one of the plates that I found at Datchet—I cautioned the prisoner at the commencement of his statement—on the morning of the same day I had been to Datchet and searched Southley-lodge, in a back room up stairs I found two portions of a printing press; the room smelt strongly of acids, and there were stains upon the floor—in a room down stairs I found two boxes, and opened them—one contained six large stones, upon one of which there was a preparation for engraving—the smaller box contained eight stones, one of which was prepared the same as the large one—I then opened a hamper, and found it contained several bottles of different kinds of acids—these bottles were wrapped up in paper, upon which there was a kind of watermark, as if taken from the plates referred to—I opened another box, and found it con<lb/>tained pumice stone, a sponge, and printing inks of various colours; in the garden I found a large case—I opened it and found it to contain a complete printing press, with the exception of the two parts I found up stairs—the conversation I have given took place in the presence of one of my sergeants.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 145, Tottenham-court-road, and am manager to Mr. Maple, an upholsterer there—we have a person Darned Jackson in our employment, a polisher—the prisoner Harris has worked for us, but Jackson was his master—he employed the prisoner for us—he was in the habit of coming there—on Thursday, 24th August, I saw him go up stairs—he went to a part of our place where there was nothing kept but chair frames, in a roof—I saw him come down and go out of the shop, and I followed him out down the Hampstead-road, and saw him go into Turrill's—that was the day before he was taken—I gave instructions to an officer named Chapple—the next day Harris came again, and went up into the same roof—I watched till he came down, followed him out, and saw the officers follow him to Turrill's—he had no business up in the roof—he had occasionally to go up to fetch chair frames down from the floor below, but not from the next floor—after he was taken I found some table covers, table cloths, pieces of cloth, and several other things in that roof—it is not a place where we deposit property in the course of business—I saw these table cloths (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the station-house when Harris was taken—they arc Messrs. Maple's property—the things I discovered in the roof were of a similar description, and I saw these very cloths in the roof the night before Harris was taken—I went up to see what there was, and saw these table cloths, and nine or ten more huge ones—when the officers went to Turr<lb/>ill's I waited outside—Turrill has no connexion with our establishment in any shape or form—I did not know the man—he is a tailor, I believe.</p>

Drew and Campbell's works, at Silvertown—on the night of 8th June, from information I received, I went to a field between the Graving Dock and the fitting-shop of the Graving Dock—there is a road between—about a quarter or twenty minutes past 11, I heard a noise like breaking a fence open—I was about forty or fifty yards from the fence at that time—I stayed where I was, and saw something like iron, something very heavy, put into a cart, and after it was put in, some men drove away with it—the iron Was brought through the fence—Speck was in the cart—I had known him before—he lives at Cannon-town—I could not tell how many other men were there—there were five or six in the cart—the swing bridge is about half a mile, I should think, from where the fence was broken—there is a foot-path along the bank, going from the Graving Dock into the road—I do not know that anybody had a right to go that way, but many do.</p>

M.—Major de Vere was there also, about three or four yards from me; Captain Hinds, a brother officer, was standing between me and Major de Vere—it was the ordinary every day parade for work—I should say about three hundred men were present, not under arms—both Major de Vere and I were on duty—the report of a gun attracted my at<lb/>tention, and I saw Major de Vere in Captain Hind's arms—I went to his assistance—I heard him say twice, "Oh, my God"—I saw blood running from under his coat—I carried him partly off the parade—I then gave orders that men should be posted at the back doors of K and L houses; those were the only two houses on that side in which the single men are quartered; there are two other houses, occupied by married men—I went with other men to post at the front doors—on arriving at the front door I met a man named Mason—in consequence of something that Mason said to me, I went up to room No. 4, that is a room on the first floor, which faces the parade ground—when I got into that room I found the prisoner there; he was alone, he had on the same dress he has now, with a cap—there was a smell of burnt powder in the room—I said to him, "Did you do this?"—his answer was, "Yes, sir"—his manner was very respectful and calm—I asked him for his rifle and his pouch—he pointed out his rifle to me, it was in the arm band at the head of a bed in the same room; the pouch was hanging on the accoutrement pegs, at the head of the same bed—I took the rifle and examined it; it had evidently just been discharged—there was an exploded cap on the nipple—I examined the pouch—I found one round of ball cartridge and two caps deficient—the prisoner was then removed to the guard room.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday the 16th May last year I went into the premises of the General Steam Navigation Company—I examined the garden and found several footmarks and saw that something had passed over the fence and on the ground at the other side of the fence there was the impression of a large flange—I traced the marks across the adjoining field over another fence into a lane—a cart could pass down that lane—it is 200 or 300 yards from Copperas-lane—there were prints of two small wheels as if a barrow had been drawn up to the fence—I followed the track of those wheels into the neighbourhood of Pope's-buildings—on Monday morning about 3 o'olock I and two other constables secreted ourselves in a garden at the bottom of Copperas—lane—about half-past 3, I saw the prisoner come out of No. 13 and he marched about two or three times close to where I was—two other men joined him and they went to and from there until about half-past 5 or quarter to 6—I then lost sight of the prisoner—he then came down Copperas-lane with a van—Woolford was with him—the van was bucked up to the end of a narrow street against some posts—the tail board was taken down and the prisoner went away with one man and the other stood and watched—shortly afterwards they returned with one of the pipes and put it into the van they went again and brought out the three and the van started off—I ran after the three men—the prisoner ran into a house in Griffin-street about 150 yards off and I tost him—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody, about a fortight or three weeks ago—I have been looking for him since the robbery several times—I saw what was in the van—the pipes were after<lb/>wards shown to Mr. Beard more.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Maxwell the prosecutor, who is a farmer at Kidbrook—he had some ducks—on 18th of last month we minted seven about 8 o'clock in the morning—I had seen them age the night before—I saw them dead on the 18th at the Greenwich Court—I am quite certain the two drakes were our's and the others are very much like what we lost—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

At 6 o'clock on the morning of 18th August I saw the prisoner in Trafalgar-road East Greenwich carrying a bag and a basket—I stopped him and asked him what his bag contained—he said, "Ducks"—I asked him how he came by them—he said he was a breeder—I asked him where he came from—he said "Blackbeath village"—I asked him where he lived there—he said he did not exactly know but he lived with a Mrs. Green—I took him into custody—there were two drakes and five ducks in the basket and bag dead—I showed them after<lb/>wards to the last witness and he identified them by the marks—it was about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house that I met the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner—on the evening of 26th August, about 10 o'clock, I arrived at London-bridge—I had come from Gloucester from my ship—a man in a light coat was close to an omnibus, and asked me whether he should carry my chest—I went with him to a coffee-house, and had some beer with him there—I then went to a public-house with him, and saw Farrow standing at the bar drinking—Finn came in afterwards—I gave them just what they liked to drink, liquor and beer—Farrow had a pipe, and I asked him to give me a smoke—he gave me the pipe, and said, "You can keep it"—when I had done smoking I put it in my coat-pocket—I am sure I did not return it to him—I saw it next at the police-station; it was taken from him there—the man in the light coat addressed the prisoners by name—he called Finn "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—there was a woman there, but I did not notice her much—I left the public-house nearer 1 than 12, I cannot exactly tell—my purse was all right then—I looked in it a few minutes before we came out of the public-house—I was not intoxicated, and knew everything—we all left together, all who were in the bar, and the woman—they were all together, except one man who stopped outside—four men and a woman were by me, and when I had got a few yards from the house they tackled me by the throat, and a hand was put over my mouth—I struggled, and knocked two of them away—two of them again tackled me by the throat, and one got on my legs, put his hands in my pockets, said, "All right; I have got it," and took out <hi rend="italic">my</hi> purse, containing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; also my scarf, and shawl, and the pipe—they all ran away—I also lost my cap, but found it next morning hanging up at the station—I know it by the scratches inside the peak—I slept in the police-station—after the men ran away, I hallooed out, "Police"—I walked down to a policeman, and they had got the two prisoners; the others had gone—I told the policeman to take them in charge, as they were the men who had done it—I was very nearly black in the face.</p>

On Saturday morning, 26th or 27th August, I was 60 or 70 yards from Castle-street, and heard a cry of "Police," which appeared to come from Counter-street—before I got there, I was met by a woman named Larson, who was afterwards taken in custody—I spoke to her—she said something and pointed towards London Bridge, which was an opposite direction—I then, heard groans, and saw a man in a light coat and the two prisoners run out of Counter-street—a man in a dark coat ran into the Borough-market, fourteen yards before the other three—the man in the light coat had a dark coat hanging from his hand, he ran towards the Blackfriars-road—he ran past the hoarding, where the cap was afterwards found—I immediately took Finn by the left hand and Farrow by the right—they were running; not very fast, but coming quickly—the woman said, pointing to Farrow, "Let my husband go, he has done nothing"—I said, "Stop a bit, we will see what he has done"—I took them to Counter-street—this was fifteen or sixteen yards from where the prosecutor was lying—he got up, and staggered towards me—he complained of his throat, and was hardly able to speak—he said, "I have been robbed"—I said, "What of?"—he said, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a "purse"—I asked him if he knew the prisoners, he said, "Those are two of them;" he expressed no doubt about them—the cap was given to me—I took it to the station and hung it up—Hall saw it, and recognised it—I found the pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on Farrow—he said, "That is my pipe, I lent it to you in the public-house for a smoke, in the Black Horse"—Hall said, "You did not lend it to me, you gave it to me, and I bad. it on me at the time the robbery was committed"—I found the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) open, in Farrow's breast pocket.</p>

She made some kind of mumbling noise. I could not tell what she said. I said, "Anyway you will suffer for this; it is not the first or second time you have served me so." While she was trying to light the fire I got out of temper, and struck her. When she fell I kicked her with my foot, and I think that the heel of my boot must have made the gash in her head, and caused her death—I then went into the yard, and when I came again into the house I found she had not moved. I lifted her up, and found she was immoveable. I found her life was gone from her. I laid her head on a small block of wood, and sent for a doctor by a next-door neighbour.

On the night in question I was at the police-station on duty—from information I received I went with another constable to 3, White's-grounds—I found a Mrs. Gregory there—she let me in—I found the deceased lying on the floor, with her head resting on a small block of wood—she was dead—the prisoner was sitting at the back of her with her right hand in his—I said, "Who did this?"—the prisoner said, "I did"—I cautioned him to be careful of what he said, as anything he might say I should use against him before the magistrate—he said, "I want to tell you all; about a quarter to six I came home from work, I saw the de ceased sitting in front of the fire, beastly drunk, I asked her if she intended to get any tea to-night, she muttered something that I could not under<lb/>stand, she then commenced cutting a piece of wood to light the fire, but she was so long about it I got out of temper, and struck her on the side of the head with my fist; she fell on the floor, and whilst lying on the ground I gave her a kick with my boot, and I think the heel of my boot must have made the gash in her head—I then went out in the yard; when I came back I found she had not moved, I lifted her up and found she was senseless, I placed her head on a small block of wood and went to Mrs. Gregory's, next door, and asked her to go for the doctor"—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see some pieces of cut wood on the floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he seemed to be very much excited by what had happened—he was crying, and in the midst of his crying he made this statement—he did not say that he had found her in the same condition at dinner time—he said at the station that he had given her the wages he had received on the Friday night—he did not say how much—he did not say it was all gone—he said of course he expected his tea when he came home on the Saturday.</p>

About seven o'clock on Satur<lb/>day evening I went to 3, White's-grounds, after the prisoner had been re moved to the station—I saw the deceased lying on the floor with her head resting on a block of wood; she was dead—on searching the room, near her feet I found this knife and some wood on the floor, apparently recently cut up—seeing some spots of blood on the knife I took it to the station—I showed it to the inspector on duty in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner said, "It was not done with that, but it was done with a kick."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Gregory, and live at 4, White's-grounds, next door to the prisoner—I have known him between seven and eight months by living there—a little after six on this Saturday evening he came to my door and said, "Will you come in, Mrs. Gregory"—I said, "Yes"—he did not say what for—he left my door and went into his own house again—I went in and saw the deceased on the floor, the prisoner was resting his arm underneath her—I said, "What have you done?"—he said, "Go for the doctor," which I did—I only knew the deceased by living there—I know she was given to bad habits in drinking—I had no acquaint<lb/>ance with her, only speaking part of the time.</p>

I live at 92, Russell-street, Bermondsey—I know the deceased by sight—I saw her on the afternoon when this matter happened, about twenty minutes to five, in Gun-alley, that is the next corner to her house—she was very much intoxicated then—I have seen her intoxicated several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was sent for to the police-station on this evening, and went from there to No. 3, White's-grounds and saw the deceased—I found a severe contusion on the forehead above the left eye, and a wound at the upper and back part of the head—it was an incised wound, rather jagged, an inch and a half in length, and penetrating to the bone—the scalp was separated from the bone, to about the extent of an inch there was not a great deal of blood—I afterwards made a post mortem examination by direction of the coroner—I found effusion of blood on the inner part of the scalp, under both the external injuries—on exposing the bone I found the membranes very much congested, and on removing the membranes there was a large quantity of effused blood—the cause of death was rupture of a blood vessel on the brain—the other organs of the body werehealthy—if a person was intoxicated at the time a blow was given, the rupture of a blood vessel would be more likely to occur—the wound at the back of the head would be very likely to be caused by one of these boots—I examined</p>

               <p>them at the station, and found a small spot of blood on the iron heel of the right boot—the contusion over the eye might have been caused by a blow of the hand or fist—the skin was not broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it equally be caused by a drunken person falling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—it was a large vessel that was ruptured, in the substance of the brain itself—the blood vessels of the brain were much con<lb/>gested—such a condition would result from intoxication—that would render a rupture more probable, a slighter blow would then cause a rupture—I looked at the liver—the whole of the tissues were somewhat soft—I should say the liver indicated a tendency to drink.</p>
