Instant; It was particularly made appear, That the Master of the boy was wont to beat him in a most inhumane manner with the Whip and sometimes with a Stick; pretending that he did not follow his Work, so close as he expected: And he had another way whereby he was wont to punish the boy, which hath scarce ever been heard of before; he had a Stone that he used about his Work, which weighed Seven Stone and two pound, and that he would frequently tye it about his Neck, and make him carry it about, Lashing him forwards, with the Coach Whip aforesaid, telling the boy, that if he was able to carry that Stone, he was able enough to work, &amp;c. And when the Prisoner saw it (instead of endeavouring to allay his Passion) she added Fuel to the Fire by crying out, give him more: Another way he had to Exercise his unparalell'd Cruelty, was by burning him with a hot Iron; upon the Back and Thighs: Also several times he would prick the boy with an Iron Spindle, &amp;c. in several places of his Body.

It was also sworn, That the Master was wont to hang a Curtain before the boys Face, that he might not see him when he came to correct him; and lest the aforesaid Stone should not be ponderous enough; He would add another little one to it; &amp;c. The Prisoner made great Protestations, that she never did any harm to the boy, and called some Witnesses, who declared in the General, that the boy never wanted any necessary Provisions, and that the boy was a sickly distempered boy, troubled with Ulcers, and Runing Sores in his Legs, and elsewhere, about his Body; so the Gent. of the Jury being directed seriously to weigh the Matter; they gave in their Verdict, that she was <rs id="t16920115-7-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Then the Court was pleased to give them a most seasonable Exhortation, pertinent to the occasion, to this effect; telling them, That they were now in a good posture of submission, being bowed upon their Knees; hoping that they were also relenting in their Hearts, for that they had all been great Offenders, not only against the Laws of Man, but of an All-seeing God, who would call every one of them to a strict and particular Account for all their Actions, and therefore it behoved them to beg Pardon of both; and as they had obtained Mercy from the Goodness and Clemency of so Gracious a King and Queen, so they would endeavour to demonstrate their thankfulness for so great a Deliverance, by living in holy, humble, and honest life for the time to come, that being the least part of their Duty for such extraordinary Pity; putting them in mind how many notorious Offenders (in nature like to themselves) were gone before to the fatal tree yet They were spared: therefore it was now hoped, that such particular Indulgence to them would work such a thorow change upon their Hearts and Lives, that their whole Life should be dedicated to the Service of God, and that no temptation whatsoever should be able to draw them aside; remembring withal, That the shedding of a few Tears here, will not satisfie offended Justice, except they universally repent, and turn to God with all their Hearts and Souls, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After this the Court was pleased to particularize some of their Offences to them, not any ways to upbraid their former dissolute Lives, but calmly to caution them, to take heed how they steer'd their Course for the future; that they might not split upon the same Rock, some of them being but young in Years, yet old Offenders; therefore it was hoped they would take heed of falling into the like Danger; for if they did, they must not expect to receive such Pardon, as now happly they had met withal: And furthermore, if they who were to be Transported should return into England, before Seven Years were expired, it would certainly prove a great detriment to them, even to the Loss of their Lives, if overtaken in such a desperate Adventure, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16920115006"/>Another amongst them was more particularly remarked, viz. John Ray, alias Red, who was condemned formerly for Clipping and Coyning the current Money of England: He receiving such Mercy as to be freely Pardoned, and not Transported (as he deserved) was told, That it was required of him (being more sensible than some others) to lay out his whole Interest for the Service of King William and Queen Mary: but if he thought to undermine the true Interest and Government of the Crown and Church of England (as it was to be feared his Religion might teach him) then he would certainly find himself to be mistaken; for upon this Rock have I built my Church, faith a much better than the best, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Conclusion was in the general to all of them, That notwithstanding their Crimes could not be particulary recounted, yet the Court hoped they would be all forwarned by this particular Grace, and distinguishing Favour, as never to offend any more in the like nature, but that they may have Grace to serve God for the time to come.</p>

                  <p>Then the Court was pleased to give them a most seasonable Exhortation, pertinent to the occasion, to this effect; telling them, That they were now in a good posture of submission, being bowed upon their Knees; hoping that they were also relenting in their Hearts, for that they had all been great Offenders, not only against the Laws of Man, but of an All-seeing God, who would call every one of them to a strict and particular Account for all their Actions, and therefore it behoved them to beg Pardon of both; and as they had obtained Mercy from the Goodness and Clemency of so Gracious a King and Queen, so they would endeavour to demonstrate their thankfulness for so great a Deliverance, by living in holy, humble, and honest life for the time to come, that being the least part of their Duty for such extraordinary Pity; putting them in mind how many notorious Offenders (in nature like to themselves) were gone before to the fatal tree yet They were spared: therefore it was now hoped, that such particular Indulgence to them would work such a thorow change upon their Hearts and Lives, that their whole Life should be dedicated to the Service of God, and that no temptation whatsoever should be able to draw them aside; remembring withal, That the shedding of a few Tears here, will not satisfie offended Justice, except they universally repent, and turn to God with all their Hearts and Souls, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>After this the Court was pleased to particularize some of their Offences to them, not any ways to upbraid their former dissolute Lives, but calmly to caution them, to take heed how they steer'd their Course for the future; that they might not split upon the same Rock, some of them being but young in Years, yet old Offenders; therefore it was hoped they would take heed of falling into the like Danger; for if they did, they must not expect to receive such Pardon, as now happly they had met withal: And furthermore, if they who were to be Transported should return into England, before Seven Years were expired, it would certainly prove a great detriment to them, even to the Loss of their Lives, if overtaken in such a desperate Adventure, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16920115006"/>Another amongst them was more particularly remarked, viz. John Ray, alias Red, who was condemned formerly for Clipping and Coyning the current Money of England: He receiving such Mercy as to be freely Pardoned, and not Transported (as he deserved) was told, That it was required of him (being more sensible than some others) to lay out his whole Interest for the Service of King William and Queen Mary: but if he thought to undermine the true Interest and Government of the Crown and Church of England (as it was to be feared his Religion might teach him) then he would certainly find himself to be mistaken; for upon this Rock have I built my Church, faith a much better than the best, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Conclusion was in the general to all of them, That notwithstanding their Crimes could not be particulary recounted, yet the Court hoped they would be all forwarned by this particular Grace, and distinguishing Favour, as never to offend any more in the like nature, but that they may have Grace to serve God for the time to come.</p>
