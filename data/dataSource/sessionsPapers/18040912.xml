               <p>Q. Were you at home on the night of the 17th of July? - A. Yes; we generally go to bed together as near as possible; I was the last of the family that was up; it might be between ten and eleven o'clock when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your house fast that night before you went to bed? - A. I have every reason to believe that I did make every pin and bar fast; I am in the habit of doing it every night; about two o'clock in the morning I was alarmed by the ringing of my bell by the constable of the night and the watchman; they told me my house was broke open; when I came down stairs, I saw two or three squares of glass in the window was broke, and the shutter was down, the glass of the window was whole when I went to bed, and the shutters were all up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing? - A. Yes, a brass warming-pan, which I was shewn the same day; it has my own hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it before you was shewn it? - A. I cannot say I did, but I know it to be mine by the writing that is on the inside of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About half past twelve o'clock, we had an alarm like a window being broke open; I went all round my beat, and could not find any thing the matter any where; I saw two men walk the opposite side of the way, but I did not take them, as I could not find any thing amiss then; about two o'clock we heard another alarm down the street, like the noise of a copper or pan; whatever it was, we could not tell; we saw the prisoner walking up to a cart that was tilted up; it belongs to a chimney-sweeper; and before we got up to him, he got from the cart, and was on the pavement, and we took him to the watch-house; we searched him; he had nothing upon him but a knife; I went to the cart after he was taken to the watch-house, and there I found a crow bar, which I believe was the handle of a saucepan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the house was broke open? - A. I went over the way, and found a shutter was down, and three squares of glass broke, and a bottle basket standing outside of the window.</p>

             sworn. - About a quarter past two o'clock, I was standing outside of the watch-house door, I am constable of the night; I heard a noise of something fallen, like the noise of a pan of some kind; looking steadfast, I saw the prisoner on the outside of the window of Mr. West.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might the watch-house be from the house? - A. About the distance of fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light? - A. Just break of day; I saw the prisoner fall from a basket that he stood upon, under the window; I immediately pursued after the prisoner, and saw him cross over the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether he had any thing with him? - A. Not apparently to my sight; the prisoner was making up to a cart that was tilted up; I saw the prisoner stoop; I did not see him lay the property down; when he returned from the cart, I got up to him, and laid hold of him; the watchman was behind me at the same time; I delivered him up to the watchman, who took him to the watch-house; I rung up Mr. West, and told him his house had been broke open; I asked him if he had lost any property; he said, yes, he had, a brass warming-pan; he told me it was marked the price and the width, it was an eleven inch pan; I searched the prisoner, and found nothing upon him but this little knife; his apron was all over blood, and the glass that was broken from the window was the same.</p>

            ; in consequence of his information, I suspected the two prisoners at the bar; I went and enquired at their father's first, if they were there, and there I was told by John's wife that they were at a house in Buckingham-street; I went there, and found both the prisoners. Coming along, I asked John if he had been changing a five-pound note that morning; he told me he had not; I took them to Mr. Prince's house, and asked Mr. Prince if either of these two men had changed a five-pound note with him; he told me that the prisoner John had changed one; I took him to Bow-street with Isaac; I searched him, and found in this purse four one-pound notes, a half-guinea, half-a-crown, and six-pence, and in his waistcoat pocket I found a quantity of halfpence; I asked him how he came by it; he said, it was the change of the five-pound note he had changed with Mr. Prince; I asked him how he came by the five-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he would confess? - A. No; he said he had it of his brother Isaac on Saturday evening.</p>

In another pocket I found a half-guinea and four seven-shilling pieces; I asked him how he came by that, and he said he received it from his brother Isaac. Not finding any duplicates upon either of the prisoners, I then went to John's lodgings; I searched the apartments, and found nothing; I then went in search of a woman of the name of Stephens, who lived with the prisoner Isaac; I met her in Covent-garden; I desired her to go along with me to Isaac's lodgings; she went with me to the lodgings, and I searched some time; she told me it was of no use my searching; she said, there is nothing here; she said, if I would go with her to Russell-court, to Mrs. Cole's, there I should find the four spoons; I went with her, and she knocked at the door, and asked for the spoons that she had left: Mrs. Cole gave them to Stephens, and Stephens gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give them to you immediately? - A. Yes, before I went down stairs; she is not here, I could not find her; these are the spoons that I received from her; I have had them in my custody under lock ever since, and this is the five-pound note I received from Mr. Prince at Bow-street; I have had it in my custody ever since, (produces the spoons and the note); I have John's confession before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - A. I do not think it was; here is another officer here that he mentioned it to first, and then he went and mentioned it to the Magistrate afterwards.</p>

(like the one he had on) I answered him sixteen shillings; he said, will you make it as good? I answered, yes; the moment he said that, he darted to the counter, and knocked off the banker's book, and catched up all the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you counted the notes before you put them down? - A. Yes; there were eighty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any ten-pound notes? - A. Yes, there were four; the fifteen-pound note that he took, he got changed at Mr. Savage's, in Houndsditch, and bought the clothes he now stands up in.</p>
               <p>Q. When he darted at the banker's-book, what did he do? - A. He took the notes, and ran out immediately; I was not able to cry out I was so alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he was the person you saw standing about the shop? - A. Yes, I have no doubt at all; he had the pipe in his mouth, and his large apron on, when he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes which you have seen since, and which are here now, do you believe them to be your's? - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner had some conversation with you about some articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing unkind said on his part? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes were lying at one end of the counter, you had had them in your hand the minute before, and then you went to the other end of the counter; you were alarmed at seeing the man run away with the notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no attempt of any sort at all of his striking you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your shop? - A. Not above a minute and a half; Dr. Hamilton saw him coming out of the shop with his pipe in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Could the person who was walking about your shop-window, or perambulating, as you have said, could he observe what you were doing of? - A. Yes, through the cavity of the things that were hanging in the window; there were stockings and caps hanging up, and they could see between them; my shop is a very large shop, they could see all over it.</p>
               <p>- LEATHWICK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I keep the Robin-Hood and Little-John.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar at your house on the 17th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to your house for? - A. He came and called for a pint of rum and a quart of milk.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he pay for it? - A. He gave me a ten-pound note in my hand, he said he had no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120012"/>other money to pay; I had some suspicion it was a bad one, I took it to the Bank, and there I wrote my name upon it, and then I tendered it them at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the morning after the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the note again? - A.(Looking at it.) I find my own hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner at the bar that gave you that note? - A. That is the very man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you always write your name upon the back of the notes you receive? - A. I did upon this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you any suspicion of this note? - A. I had suspicion that it might be bad, or not got cleverly by.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one ten-pound note, you have now in your hand, the ten-pound note you received from the prisoner, and the one you paid at the Bank? - A. It is the one.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Look at that note, and tell us whether that is one of the notes that the prisoner took from the counter? - A. My son can.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have lodged with the prosecutor from the year 1802 till 1804; he had given me particular charge to take care of his house in his absence; I have saved him much beer; and as I have for that time took care of his house, therefore, on the 27th, when he was out of the way, I did as usual; I shut up the shutters and left the street door open; she desired me to carry a small cask of gin down into the cellar; she followed me with a light; the draft of the wind blowed the candle out; he came down stairs; he had neither coat or breeches on; nothing but his shirt; he said, who is there? she said, there is nobody here but George; he made use of very bad expressions, and said he had caught her and somebody rude with her on the cellar stairs; she went and brought him a light; I was coming out of the cellar; he said, Oh, George, George, I should never have expected such things of you; he then said, you rascal, you have been rude with my wife; he immediately went to his kitchen and got a knife; I said to him, recollect, this is my home; if it is your house, I have paid you for my lodging these two years; he was in his shirt; I laid hold of him and shoved him against the wainscot; I said to him, if I have done you any injury, and committed upon you any violence, there is law for it; he said, you rogue, you robber, you have robbed me of all that is dear to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him several times? - A.

               <p>Q. You gave him the very same? - A. Yes; the next morning I went down to Lambeth-street, and laid an information that I had lost so and so; they said they would apprehend the man, and send for me at Frogwell-court, where I lived, and that week they did not find the man; then I went to Shadwell office, and saw Mr. Brown; he told me he knew the man very well, and it was very likely he should find him in a few days; I never saw the prisoner from that time till Mr. Brown came and told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am very positive; I have known him five years back; I I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. At what time of night was it? - A. It was between nine and ten o'clock; I cannot say to a minute; after I got into my own place, and had lost these notes, I heard the clock strike ten; a little after I came out of the Bank, I stopped about an hour with an acquaintance I happened to meet.</p>

On the 20th of July, in Ratcliff-highway; I and Oliver; I said to Oliver, there is a man that I want for a foot-pad robbery; we immediately went after him till such time as I lost sight of him; he ran down an alley; the other officer perceived that he got into a public-house; he went after him another way, and just as he got into the public-house he nodded his head to me; when I got to the public-house, the prisoner ran away; I crossed to the other side of the way, and there I saw him go into a pawnbroker's shop; I followed him and then he went into another pawnbroker's shop; I immediately followed, and looked through the window, and knew it was the man; I have known him several years; I called to him; he answered to the name of Slater; I said, Slater, you must go with me; then I told him what I wanted him for; I secured him between eight and nine o'clock at night; I told him it was for robbing Mr. Briant, about nine or ten months ago; I took down a sketch of what Mr. Briant said when he came to me; it was for a 5 l. note and six 1 l. notes, by a person of the name of Slater; I told the prosecutor to make himself easy; when he came to inform me, I said, I shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120016"/>get him, he works at coal-heaving or ballast-heaving; after I apprehended him, Briant came down and swore he was the man.</p>

I have nobody to speak for me, I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutor.) Q. Was it dark or light? - A. It was a star-light night.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was employed to watch the prisoner: On Sunday morning, I waited with Mr. Lambert's nephew from eight o'clock till nine, at No. 47, East-Smithfield, and within a few minutes of nine o'clock, Mr. Lambert's nephew shewed me the prisoner; he had a bag across his shoulder with this soap wrapped up in an apron in it; there were twenty-four pounds weight of soap in the bag; I jumped out of the coach, and waited for the prisoner coming up to the door, he went in at No. 47, at Robarts's, a potato warehouse; I followed him, I never had him out of my sight; he sat down, I went up to him, and told him he was my prisoner; I took the bag and him into custody, and conveyed him into the coach; I then asked him where he lived, and he gave me one or two false directions; by great persuasions we got from him where he lived, and there we found a great deal of Mr. Lambert's property, oil, and a great many other things.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with Robarts, did you take him? - A. No; they mostly lock the officer out of their house; I secured the prisoner, and took the property.</p>
               <p>Court. You did very right, but the house may be watched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was in open day-light? - A. It was about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prosecutor.) Q. Look at the soap? (the soap produced) - A. Here is the stamp that I put at the ends of the bars, and in this one there is the wire; I have some of the same wire left in my pocket, which exactly corresponds with this.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Lambert shewed to the Court the piece of wire he had left, and the wire he had then taken out of the soap.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To the prosecutor.) Q. I suppose you did not take this man without a good character? - A. No, I had a good character with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your master say any thing to him when he confessed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your master you saw the prisoner shutting the drawer? - A. Yes, I asked him what he was about at the time; when I first saw him, he made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what quantity of dollars there were in the drawer? - A. No; they were not in a till, they were in a drawer for that purpose.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge; he observed to me it was very unfortunate that he should be discovered, as he was going away from Mr. Gray, it was the first time he had done it; I am not come here to commit the man; as much as I have said is the truth; I produce the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Gray.) Whether the dollars you gave to the constable at the Mansion-house, were the same dollars that you took from the prisoner's hand? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going from you at night? - A. He was, I had discharged him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I must leave it to the mercy of the Jury in your hands.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutor.) Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. About four months; I had a very excellent character with this man; I was very much hurt when I detected him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             and Emma Lane, Lloyd, the prisoner, was then coming out at the parlour-door, and Haines and Emma Lane stopped him, and said, you are the man that has robbed Mrs. Uther; he said he was not the man, and that he was a man of consequence, and he was astonished that I should stop him in the street; he said he was a serjeant-major in the Sepulchre's corps; he said he could bring people forward to prove that; he begged that I would let him go; I said no, I will not let you go till you go back with me to my house, and I see what I have lost; accordingly I conducted him back, and when he came to my house I went up stairs to see what I had lost; I saw the second drawer at the top open; I looked in the drawer, and as I had laid my cloak there the day before the first thing, I missed it; I came down stairs, and desired they would detain him. In the mean time, the witness, Mr. Harris, brought my cloak in; Mr. Harris said, what have you lost; I said a black silk cloak lined with purple; he said, I have got it, it was thrown into my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Harris live? - A. In Wilson-street, Finsbury-square; his premises lay back into Christopher's-alley, where the prisoner ran down.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner throw it away while you were following? - A. No; he had turned the corner too quick for me to see; Mr. Harris refused to give me the cloak till I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. This was between twelve and one o'clock in the day time, when you and your children were at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was your outward door in? - A. The outward door was open, and the chamber-door was locked, and on the prisoner was found a key that would open it, and eleven other keys in his breeches, by Harper the officer; when I came down in the morning, I left two children in bed, and when they came down the eldest brought me the key, and said she had locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is your little girl? - A. Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. The chamber-door, when you last saw it, was unlocked? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever it was in your passage, he said, good morning, and passed on very quick; you looked up your stair-case to see whether your door was fast or shut? - A. I did, and he passed on very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you saw the person again? - A. Not more than a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him for a minute; where was it you first saw him again? - A. I saw him turn the corner of the alley where he dropped the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is your street-door from that alley? - A. My street-door is two doors from Wilson-street, and in Wilson-street I saw him turn down the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner down the alley, you observed him with his hat in his hand, talking about the election? - A. Yes; he ran very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever he was in your house, it was only a momentary sight you had of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, madam, I am sure you give your evidence in a very decent and becoming manner, you would not undertake to swear to whom you had seen so momentarily? Will you undertake to swear that he is the man that was in your house? - A. What struck my curiosity was, his saying good morning to me, and then he made a little bit of a halt.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That made you take more notice? - A. Yes; when I met him on the stairs, he had on a blue coat, a striped waistcoat, and a pair of kerseymere breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. The alley that laid back from Wilson-street is Christopher's-alley, how low down from Wilson-street is that alley? - A. About five or six doors.</p>

             sworn. - I bought the horse of the prisoner at the bar: on the 21st of April I delivered it up to Mr. Ray, and I believe he delivered it up to Mr. Chandler; I have seen the horse again at the livery-stables in Worship-street; it is a brown horse, with a white blaze down the face and a bushy tail; I bought the horse for a friend; he is a Captain; the prisoner rode him in the yard; the Captain was with me, and he said, buy that horse for me; the prisoner asked 16 l. for it; I bid the prisoner 15 guineas for it; he said, he would not take less than 16 l. for the horse, he did not get any thing by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to you on account of that horse? - A. He came by, he said; and it was a good horse, and would go in harness very well, but rather aukward; I have seen him in Smithfield for this year and a half, selling of horses.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Atkins.) Was 16 l. paid to the prisoner for the horse? - A. My acquaintance said, do not part from the horse; I called to him in the Minories, and said, come home, and I will pay you for the horse; and there is a man in our yard, to whom the prisoner gave a shilling for taking the bridle and saddle home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The horse was found in your possession, and therefore you were liable to be charged with stealing it, unless you had brought the man forward you had bought it of? - A. I have a witness that I bought it, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen that you know where the prisoner resided? - A. He always informed me that he kept a hop-ground at Sittingbourn, and that he kept waggons.</p>
               <p>Q. You took a receipt for the payment? - A. No; I have bought an hundred horses and never took a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this captain? - A. Capt. Brasson; he is a master of a powder-vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Peck; he is not forth-coming? - A. No; he is in the Compter; he recommended me to this man in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. So that neither of the persons who were present at the purchase are forth-coming? - A. I have a witness that saw me buy the horse; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a carman, and deal in horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a cart horse? - A. No; between a cart-horse and a nag.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with this captain? - A. Twenty years; I knew him from a child; he lives within a quarter of a mile of my house; he is not in town now.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to the clover-field? - A. About five o'clock on Saturday morning I went to my clover-field, and saw the gate open and half unhooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other cattle in the same field? - A. Yes; there were three others that remained in the field; I took one of the horses and went down to Bury, and had some hand-bills printed, and distributed them as fast as I could; on the 23d of July, Mr. Mason and I went down to Dagenham; we heard that Mr. Denginfield had purchased this chesnut mare; Mr. Denginfield bought the mare for Mr. Tyser, of Barton; he told us, if we went down to Mr. Tyser's, we should find the mare; Mr. Mason and I accordingly went down, and there we found the mare; she was branded on the fore hoofs with RE; we took the mare up to the Office in Worship-street; that is all I know about that mare; I am sure it is my mare. The black mare Mr. Atkins came and told me he sold to Mr. Roper, in town; Mr. Ray, the Officer, went with me to Mr. Roper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Roper live? - A. I cannot tell exactly the place; when we went down to Mr. Roper, the mare was gone down the country on a journey.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the mare last? - A. On the 15th of August; she was branded in the same manner as the other was on the hoofs; Mr. Roper told me he would send the mare when she came off the journey, which he did: I was certain it was my property, being branded on the hoofs; Mr. Ray sent her down to me by one Frost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These mares were traced back into the witness Atkins's hands? - A. They were.</p>

             sworn. - I bought two mares and a horse of the prisoner on the 20th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them? - A. Forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy them? - A. At my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner before? - A. I knew him in Smithfield selling horses for a year and a half; I am positive he sold horses there, and at Mr. Langhorn's. Here is a letter that came from Sittingbourn, which was the reason of my taking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 20th of May when you bought them? - A. Yes; I sold two of them to Mr. Poulter and one to Mr. Roper; the black mare to Mr. Roper, and the chesnut mare to Mr. Poulter; he informed me that he lived at Sittingbourn and kept a hop-ground; that he had waggons, and that he would buy two or three horses frequently, merely to get the load up, and after he got his load up he sold them, though he got nothing by them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you kept them before you sold them to Mr. Roper and Mr. Poulter? - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell them for? - A. I sold the three for forty-two pounds: I gave him forty pounds for the three; I sold the black mare to Mr. Roper for seventeen pounds, and the other mare, with the horse, I sold for twenty-five pounds to Mr. Poulter.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the mares' hoofs marked? - A. They were branded on the hoofs; I cannot rightly say what with; it was an E and something else.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You can read and write? - A. I can read, but not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any receipt on this occasion? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought them in a lumping way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You contrived to get rid of these horses as soon as you could? - A. I have got horses that I bought to-day, that I will sell to you within an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep them, I suppose, till you can make a fair profit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought these horses for forty pounds, kept them a fortnight, and then sold them for forty-two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120025"/>pounds? - A. They earned their keep; I sold a horse the other day at sixteen pounds loss.</p>

               <p>Q. How many horses have you charged the prisoner with stealing, that were found in your possession? - A. There are three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Eleven stolen horses were traced to you? - A. Certainly I did buy them, I did not know they were stolen when I bought them; I took the prisoner, and after I took him, he made his escape.</p>
               <p>- POULTER sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A. In Black Horse-yard, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy a mare of the last witness? - A. Yes, I bought a chesnut mare and a horse together of Mr. Atkins; the mare belonged to one man, and another man claimed the horse afterwards; I have known Atkins some time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy the mare? - A. About the latter end of May, I cannot say particularly the day; I gave twenty-five pounds for the two; they were very dear when I bought them; the mare had had a kick, she was very lame.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mare marked on the hoof? - A. Yes, and this gentleman found her as I bought her, and I had sold her to Mr. Denginfield; I knew she was marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have known the witness Atkins a long while? - A. Yes, I have known him twenty years; I know nothing of the black mare.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Atkins.) On the 19th of May, where were you? - A. I was nigh home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in London? - A. Yes, I was in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any people to assist you in your business? - A. Yes, my son, a man, and a boy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did either of them see you when you bought these horses? - A. Yes, my man; he is gone from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here who knows you were in London on the 18th or the 19th of May? - A. I have not been further than Rumford for these six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. That is somewhere about the time these horses were missing? - A. For these six or seven months I have been no further than Rumford.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any body here that saw you buy the horses? - A. No, I have sent for the man; I am not in the habit of going out of town.</p>
               <p>- DENGINFIELD sworn. - I bought the chesnut mare of Mr. Poulter, about the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Poulter.) Did you sell the mare to Mr. Denginfield? - A. I did, about the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Denginfield.) Where do you live? - A. At Dagenham.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy the mare? - A. I bought the mare of Mr. Poulter, in town; the mare was at grass when I bought her; I believe it was about the 3d of July; she was branded on the fore hoofs with R. E. the mare was lame when I bought her of Mr. Poulter; I turned her to grass; I gave information to Mr. Edgar where she was, and he took her to town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Atkins.) Q. You told us that you had not been out of town for these five or six months any further than Rumford? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your memory is not impaired, is it; you know Chatham? - A. Yes, it is near Rochester.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not at Chatham three or four months ago? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said a while ago you had not been out of town for these six or seven months past, not for three months before you saw the horses, any further than Rumford; upon your oath have you not been at Chatham about three or four months ago? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When were you at Chatham; was it before you bought the mares? - A. Upon my word I cannot rightly tell you.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You went down to Dagenham with Mr. Edgar? - A. Yes, and I was at the Office when the prisoner was brought in with another man, on the 9th of July; Mr. Atkins charged him with stealing some horses that he had sold him; Mr. Atkins said he had given him a direction that his name was John Brown; the prisoner persisted that he did live at Sittingbourn; I asked him whereabouts, he said, at Chapel-farm; I said, if he kept a farm there, perhaps he could tell who he bought the horses of; he said he could not tell the people, he had bought them of some travellers at a village called Bye-France, in Kent; we searched, and found some letters that told us where his lodgings were at St. Giles's, and that his friends lived at Norwich; I went with Mr. Edgar to Dagenham, where we found the mare, and brought her up to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour do you call it? - A. I do not know exactly the colour; the gentleman called it a chesnut colour; she was branded in the fore hoofs with R. E.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Recollect you are upon your oath, and answer me solemnly the truth; you have said that you asked the prisoner where he lived; that he told you at a place called Sittingbourn, in Kent; that he could not tell the people he bought the horses of; that they were travellers, and that he bought them at a village, called Bye France, in Kent; is that the truth? - A. Yes, I wrote it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present at the time of this conversation you had with the prisoner? - A. Mr. Ray, Mr. Atkins, and another person who is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say to the Magistrate that the prisoner told you he purchased the horses of some persons in the manner you have described? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When Mr. Mason was examined on the night of the 10th, were you present? - A. I cannot say I was; we were engaged in going to different parts of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner at the bar give any account how he got these mares on the night he was brought to the Office? - A. On Monday, the 9th of July, in the evening, he was brought to our Office; Mr. Mason, in my presence, asked the prisoner how he got possession of these horses, and where he lived; those were the horses that Mr. Atkins charged him with stealing; Mr. Atkins gave us to understand that he had bought several horses of him; the prisoner told Mr. Mason that he lived at Sittingbourn, in Kent, and that he bought them of a traveller in a village called Bye-France, near Sittingbourn, in Kent; those are the words, I think, that were made use of; I found out afterwards that he did not live at Sittingbourn; I found out where he lived in town, at a tobacconist's shop, in St. Giles's, near to Oxford-road, where he had lodged some time, in a two pair of stairs back room; I told him I had been to his lodgings, and that he did not live at Sittingbourn: that we found out his lodgings at St. Giles's, and he made no reply to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I think you told my Lord this conversation was on the 9th? - A. I think it was on the 9th, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mason heard it; on the 10th he was examined, therefore after this conversation had taken place, Mason attended before the Magistrate, and was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were not there? - A. I cannot say I was; there was so much confusion, I was not present all the time; there were a great number of examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were you examined? - A. A vast number of times, I was six weeks going round the country.</p>
               <p>Q.Things are done very regular at your Office, the depositions of the several witnesses are taken down in writing? - A. In general they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not your clerks attend for the purpose of taking down the depositions in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what was said at that time was taken down in writing? - A. I dare say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined on the 28th, the final examination? - A. I think I was ill at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any person lay hold of the prisoner? - A. When he first came up to our Office, the flap of his coat was off, which I found at the public-house the next day; it was tore off right up to the button; I went to the public-house and got it, and the prisoner had it sewed on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Atkins.) Did any body accompany you when you went to the Office? - A. Yes, an officer, whom I have sent home in a coach, to get the person that saw me buy the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the question put to the prisoner where he bought the horses on the 9th, the night he was taken to the Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body lay hold of the prisoner? - A. I detained him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body lay hold of his coat? - A. I laid hold of his coat in the City-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he make his escape from you? - A. We were in the City-road; we went over to a public-house; we were asking where he bought the horses; he said, of some travellers, in a village called Bye-France, in Kent; he said, I will not stay inside; I stood between him and the door; I said, now tell the man every thing true; he said, I will not tell you any thing at all; he ran, and I ran after him, and catched hold of his coat; the flap of his coat came off; we stopped him, and put him into a coach, and took him to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have made no confessions; if I had even had the horses, I should have been much to blame to make that confession; I know nothing at all about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Sunday, the 8th of April last? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - A. Between nine and ten o'clock in the forenoon; he and another person came to my shop to purchase a waistcoat; I shewed him some waistcoats, and he fixed on one which had been made for myself.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a waistcoat was that? - A. A buff-coloured marcella, something like a diamond cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did you ask him for it? - A. I asked him thirteen shillings and sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he approve of the waistcoat? - A. Yes, he approved of the waistcoat, and the price likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he pay for it? - A. He asked me if I could give him change for a note; I told him I could, and he presented me a Dover Banknote.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that note in your hand, and tell me whether that is the note he presented to you? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed on his producing that note? - A. I asked him how he came by this note; he told me he received it at Deal barracks; I asked him if he worked at the barracks; he told me, yes; I asked him if he knew Messrs. Minet and Fector, or whether he ever was at Dover; he told me that he had been at Dover; I told him I knew Mr. Fector very well myself, and I asked him whether that was his hand-writing, or whether it was the hand-writing of young Mr. Fector; I told him I knew old Mr. Fector very well; he told me it was young Mr. Fector's hand-writing, for old Mr. Fector was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time happen to know whether Mr. Fector, senior, was alive? - A. I did not; I asked him why he did not present this note for payment there; he told me he came very late into town last night, it was too late to present it.</p>
               <p>Q.After making all these enquiries, did you then take it of him? - A. I then, by his mentioning that old Mr. Fector was dead, took it; I did not know but it was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Your suspicions were then immediately lulled, and you took it? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have said thirteen shillings and sixpence was the price of the waistcoat? - A Yes; and when I came to look for change, I saw I had not change sufficient; I then told him to call the next day, and I would give him the change; he had a person along with him that said it would be the best way to take the note, and go somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the person that came in with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did the prisoner give? - A. The answer that he made was, that he had change enough in his pocket for that day, and he would leave the note, and call the next day for the change; I then desired him to tell me what his name was; he said his name was

            , No. 14, Pitfield-street, Tottenham Court-road; I inquired what time he would come for his change, and he said, about nine o'clock to-morrow morning; I told him I should not be at home at that time, nor all the day till six o'clock in the evening; he agreed to come at that time. On Monday morning, I went to Mr. Minet to tender this note for payment; the clerks looked at it, they were in the accompting-house; they asked me how I came by it, and said that it was a forged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come at that time for the change? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You told them exactly the account you have given to day, how you came by it? - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same note? - A.(looking at the note) Yes, there is my hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name you put at the back of it? - 
               <persName id="t18040912-21-person313">A. William Jones</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. How came he not to put his name to it? - - A. Because I always put it down from their mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the note after you had been to Mr. Minet's? - A. It was left there; when I came home, I found some gentlemen in my house making some inquiries, and those two gentlemen and I went up all the streets in Tottenham Court-road, in order to find Pitfield-street, and William Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you find any such street as Pitfield-street there? - A. No, no such street.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not find such a person as

            ? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had made this fruitless inquiry, what then? - A. Then there came the Solicitor of the Bank to me, to know if I should know the person again, and when I found he did not come for his change, I took his features so much in my mind, that I should know him for fifty years to come.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go to Bow-street? - A. I went to Bow-street several times, and never saw him till about a month or five weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever any doubt about the prisoner being the person? - A. Never any doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the waistcoat that he bought of you since? - A. I saw it this morning; I have got a piece of the pattern, it exactly corresponds; I have no doubt but that it is the waistcoat, though I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that made the waistcoat? - A. He is in Court, his name is Turner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you sworn on the Old Testament? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you should know all the streets round about there? - A. No, I do not in my own neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it happen at this time your children were at play? - A. They were not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife? - A. She was not down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife very bad? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you indulge her to lie in bed till that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gets the breakfast for your children? - A. The servant.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she must have been in and out of the shop and the parlour; is there a kitchen? - A. Yes; it lies from the shop, behind the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have me to understand, that your wife was not down stairs, and that your children were not there, nor your servant? - A. No; the servant was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was the other man? - A. I took no notice of him, my conversation with him was when he spoke, and desired the prisoner to take the note back again, as I had not change enough; that is all the conversation I had from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house of Minet and Fector? - A. I have been there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been at Dover? - A. About twenty years; I have a sister that lived there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any correspondent at all at Dover now? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any notes before? - A. No; never in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have not seen any for twenty years? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence thereof, no sort of suspicion could have arisen upon that note? - A. So far, in consequence, it is signed at the bottom J. M. Fect, and not Fector.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity to judge, in your mind, that it was not one of the notes that they generally issue? - A. I could not; I had no suspicion at all at the time, else I should not have taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a good many neighbours about you? - A. I have many neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. And you, having lived there so long, might have got change? - A. It being Sunday I did not send for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you, that it would be better to get change, rather than lose the custom? - A. He immediately answered he had change enough in his pocket, and he would rather take the waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. It did not strike you at all then, when he said he had change enough, that he did not pay you with it? - A. Not enough to pay for the waistcoat; he said he had enough to serve him that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you wrote the name upon it yourself? - A. I did; I always put it down, that I should know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the firm, and discovered that you had got into an aukward situation? - A. I did; I knew him again, at the office, when I looked at the people's faces; I was not examined the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120029"/>Q. Was the office open? - A. The door was, and I went in myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any of these posts placed in a field near this building? - A. They were within about twenty yards; there were a great many; I went to the heap where they laid, and I could see there had been some removed that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you look at the heap? - A. I suppose about an hour after he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether all that whole heap were the property of Mr. Whitaker? - A. They were all Mr. Whitaker's and mine, together.</p>

               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. What did he ask for? - A. He asked to look at some pearl broches; I took out a tray, and shewed him a great number of articles; when I had shewn him some, he asked to look at more; there was another young lady in the shop, and she took out the tray in which this diamond locket was; he looked out articles to the amount of twenty-three pounds; when he had looked them out, he gave me a direction to send them to Mrs. Rumley, No. 25, in the Change, pointing out to the Old-Change; when I had selected these things together, I missed this diamond locket; he asked me first of all, whether I could talk French, and I said, no; he said then, he would be in the way to interpret; he said they were for a lady that was going to the East-Indies; he gave me this direction, and went out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you observed this diamond locket before? - A. Yes, the moment the tray was taken out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it? - A. The moment he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the shop? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. During the half hour he had been in the shop, had any body else been in? - A. No, there was not any person whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody came during the time he was there? - A. No, not a soul.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain that nobody came in from the time he came in, to the time he went out? - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed it the moment he went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to pursue him? - A. No, I supposed he would make off as soon or before I got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which way he went? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no steps to apprehend him that night? - A. I took this direction, and found it was false; I am perfectly satisfied he is the man, though I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was gone, what did you do? - A. I put the things together; I went to the place where the direction was, and found it was false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body at this No. 25? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived there? - A. I do not know; there was no such person as Mrs. Rumley; I saw a woman and a child there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give his directions in writing? - A. He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. In what tray was the diamond locket, mentioned in the indictment, deposited? - A. In the second tray.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that, before Miss Gibbs came into the shop, that you had not opened the second tray at all? - A. I did not, because she gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you right, Miss Gibbs drew out the second tray; at the time she drew out the second tray, are you able to state whether the diamond locket was there? - A. I am sure it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any such thing amongst the things which he had selected, as a diamond locket? - A. No, there was not; those were pearl broches he had selected to purchase.</p>

None in the least; the moment I saw him, I said it was him; I pointed to him, and said it was the person.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live with Mr. Gaimes, I serve in his shop; he keeps a jeweller's shop in St. Paul's Church-yard; I was there on the 15th of August last; I remember the prisoner coming into the shop when Miss Coles was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner at the bar was in the shop when you came in, when Miss Coles was there? - A. Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you came into the shop, what was passing? - A. He was looking at some bracelets, out of the first tray.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after you came into the shop? - A. I took the second tray out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to swear whether or not there was a diamond locket in that second tray? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are certain? - A. Yes, quite certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Do you happen to know what the bought price of that was? - A. It cost twenty-eight guineas; the prisoner looked out some goods, and ordered a quantity more to be sent, to the amount of twenty-three pounds; he had the bill made out; he had not money enough in his pocket, and ordered them to be sent to the Old-change, No. 25, where, he said, there was Rumley on the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you the bill of parcels here that was made out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was destroyed, I have no doubt; we have a number of false directions of this kind, we take no account of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Miss Gibbs.) Q. Are you quite sure that there was no such article purchased as a diamond locket any way? - A. No, he never even mentioned it, he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the shop, and what then? - A. He left the shop, and then we missed the diamond locket immediately; we did not miss it before he left the shop in any way whatever; after he was gone, we looked out the goods; he was to have some more handsome things brought, he said, besides what he purchased.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you accompanied the last witness, Miss Cole; did she pack up the goods pursuant to order? - A. Yes, she went away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner? - A. Last Tuesday, at Marlborough-street; I am confident it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the slightest doubt in the world? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had never seen him from the 15th of August till the 11th of September? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you are sure he is the same person? - A. Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - On Tuesday last, the prisoner was brought to the Office in Marlborough-street; a neighbouring boy says, here is a shoe that belongs to the prisoner; I went down to the lock-up place, and shewed the prisoner the shoe; he said it was his, he paid fourteen shillings for the pair a fortnight back, on a Sunday; he said he bought them of the Prince of Wales's shoe-maker; he asked for the shoe, but seeing the shoe was cut in such a nasty way, I would not give it him, it being cut in such an artful way; he attempted to make his escape after he was apprehended, and in doing that he lost his shoe.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he got to serve? - A. About a year and a half: On the 22d of July, when I arose, the prisoner was calling our niece to open the door to let him out; I came down myself; the prisoner asked me to let him out; I said he must go and fetch me a peck of flour; while he was gone for the flour, perceiving his bundle to be very large, I examined the outside of it, and found, through the hole of the wrapper, some patten ties; I immediately went to the Half Moon public-house, to ask the landlord to step in, but the landlord was not up. On my return, I found a neighbour standing before the house; I desired him not to go away, if I required him I should call him in; I went into my own house, and in a very short time the prisoner returned and rung at the bell; I opened the door, and took the flour; I said I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120034"/>not detain him any longer, I would take the flour up; the prisoner said he must go up stairs, he had left his bundle in the kitchen; when he went up stairs, I beckoned the evidence to come in, and told him to stop till the prisoner came down; the evidence came in, and went into the shop, and I shut the door directly; I said to the prisoner the bundle was very large, he must dirty an uncommon quantity of linen in the course of a week, and before he took it any further, I must see what it contained; when I opened the bundle, there were five dozen of patten ties; I asked him where he got them from; he said, on the Thursday evening prior (I was out on Thursday), he had them from the ware-room; I had left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to induce him to say that? - A. No; the next parcel that was packed up, I had to cut the strings, and upon opening it, there were twelve pair of patten rings; I asked him where he got them from, and he said, from below, in the work-shop, where he worked in; I asked him what he was going to do with them, and he said he was going to try if he could sell them; I then said to him, as the bundle was so very productive, I would search his pockets; I searched his pockets, and found in his pockets the different articles mentioned in the indictment; I then sent for an officer, and after the officer came, he found another article, or two; he said he was going to give them away to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been with you? - A. About five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave? - A. I liked the lad very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Till this happened, you had a good opinion of him? - A. Not till this time, I had suspected him some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partners? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you induce him to say this you have been telling us; did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send to his father? - A. I sent a friend to him, in order to find out who his accomplices were; I made no promise to him at any time.</p>

               <p>Q. It is your property? - A. It is the soap that he was working on that day; it was warm when he cut it, and it was warm when he brought them into the accompting-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect his person? - A. I am sure he is the man that drove me; I put into the coach a mahogany box, with the articles in question, they were all in the box; there was a gold medal, a gold ring, two studs, two lockets, two glass inkstands with silver tops, a silver case, two silver bladed knives, two razors, a looking-glass, and a purse, containing thirteen guineas, six half guineas, and two seven-shilling pieces; I fancy there was a guinea more; the coach set a gentleman down at Covent-garden, and from thence drove to my lodgings in <placeName id="t18040912-32-crimeloc191">Duke-street, St. James's</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you alighted you went up stairs? - A. Yes; about an hour afterwards I had occasion to go into the country, I had got up to the top of Duke-street, in the chaise, when I found I had not got my box; I sent back immediately, and was told that no such thing was taken out of the coach; I directed my landlord to advertise the box, and he did so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along Fenchurch-street, facing Lombard-street, I took two gentlemen up, with their luggage, I did not see what luggage it was; one gentleman went to the Hummums, in Covent-garden, and the other to Duke-street, St. James's; I did not get into the coach to get these things out, I reached and took them out, and delivered them at the house; the lady asked me if the things were all out; I told her they were; the gentleman gave me four shillings and sixpence, I wanted something extra for carrying the luggage; I stood for about ten minutes and counted my money, what I had earned, and walked off gently; coming to Charing-cross, a woman and a man wanted a coach, they got in, and they ordered me to drive to the George and Blue-boar, in Holborn; after that, I watered my horses, and then I saw that box under the seat of the coach, I could not tell whether it belonged to that gentleman, or to the man and woman I took up after; I took it home, and they asked me if it had been left in the coach; I said, yes, I do not wish to have it opened; oh, said he, my landlord, they cannot hurt you for opening it; my landlady got two or three small keys, they would not fit; after that, she sent her daughter and borrowed a bunch of keys, and none of them would fit; here is, said she, a man in our court that makes these boxes, when he came, he said he did not make these kind of boxes, but, he said, I can get him a key in the course of the afternoon; my landlord came home to dinner, and they wished to see what was in it, they said I had a right; he gave me a chissel, I would not open it, he took the chissel and he opened it, and over-hauled what was in the box; I could not read or write, they know more than me about it; I took the money out for fear it should be lost, I did not wish to make away with it, nor any thing of the kind; I was never here before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - A. No; his name is Hodges, I drove No. 114; I do not suppose he would lose a day's work to come.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Is that your box? - A. Yes; my name is on it on a brass plate, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no reason to know that they all went at once? - A. No other than the duplicates mention, when they were pawned; one was within eighteen days before I took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- DURATT sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A. At the Castle, in Shepherd's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. No more than his being sent for beer; he took a lodging of me on the 4th of September, he brought a leather trunk on the 5th; I took down a key when he came, from where they generally hang for the lodgers' convenience; I opened the door, and he took the trunk in, he locked the door, and hung up the key; Mr. Hollings, and the officer, came in the same day the prisoner brought the trunk, betwixt eleven and twelve o'clock; Mr. Hollings and the officer came betwixt seven and eight o'clock, to the best of my recollection; I went along with Mr. Hollings and the officer to where he had left the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same trunk which the prisoner had brought with him? - A. Yes; I was present when Mr. Hollings opened it, he had the key; the officer took the things and the trunk away. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court, I have no one here to speak for me; when I lived with Mr. Hollings, there was one Sarah M'Crow lived there a short time as cook, she told me she had been a married woman, and had some shirts and some other articles to sell: she brought forwards four shirts; I went to Mr. Hollings, and borrowed a one pound note; in a short time I bought a pair of silver buckles of her, and a topaz broach, at the same time she gave me the duplicates, as they were in pledge; I was distressed for money, and as I had borrowed a pound note of Mr. 
               <persName id="t18040912-33-person409">Hollings</persName>
             I did not like to ask for more; I took two shirts and a waistcoat, and pledged them in Brewer-street, in my own name; in a short time afterwards, I took the broach and buckles, into Swallow-street, and pledged them; the leather trunk was given to me by a gentleman that lived with Mr. Hollings, as he said he would give it me I took it; when I went into the country I took it with me, and when I came back I brought it back with me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Hollings.) Are you sure that is your trunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase it yourself? - A. No; it was given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that the things were given, or sold to him, by Sarah M'Crow? - A. Mrs. Hollings gave Sarah M'Crow a good character; when she went away she shewed her box, and there was none of my property in it; she lives at Bow, I did not proceed against her; many of the things are pawned since she left me, some so lately as the 18th of August.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Are you a silversmith? - A. Yes; I live in Coventry-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever bring any jewels to you to sell? - A. On the 15th of June he came to my shop, and said he had found a diamond, and asked if we purchased them.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was he a stranger to you? - A. Entirely; I asked him the particulars concerning it; he said he found it on Ludgate-hill, near the Bell Savage Inn, on Holy Thursday; he had been to see the children come from St. Paul's; this was on the 15th, when he came to my shop; I told him it was a thing of some consequence, and some value, and recommended him to have it advertised; he told me he had looked over the different papers since the time of finding the diamond, for the purpose of seeing if it had been advertised, but he said he had no objection to leaving it with me, if I thought proper, or if I chose to make enquiries, or advertise it myself, he had no objection; he went away, I advertised it, and I saw him again on the Tuesday or Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you any thing but the diamond? - A. The diamond was set, but it was not a complete piece of work; it was not a ring, or a broach, nor any thing else; it was only a diamond in this enamelled border.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the enamel perfect when he brought it to you? - A. I believe it was, I am not quite certain; he asked me what success I had had, on the Tuesday or Wednesday, when he called again; I told him not any yet; his father called afterwards whom I have seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be his father? - A. He said to me, I understand my son has left a diamond with you; the prisoner called on Monday on me, and said the Saturday following he should come and take it away or dispose of it; on the Saturday following he came, and his father with him; it was the same person that called before; I told them as before, I had heard nothing of it; I had made several enquiries; I had been to those in the trade; I had been to Green and Ward's, and to a variety of other jewellers; they told me they had come to take the diamond away; I gave it to them; they asked me what it was worth; I told them I supposed it was worth about twenty guineas; they asked me if I would give twenty guineas for it; I told them I would; they said they would sell it me, and they would take it no farther; I gave them twenty guineas; I gave them 20 l. in notes, a gold ring, which was 14 s. and the charge for the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was the value of it? - A. I conceived that to be the trade price of it; it weighed 12 grains 3 penny weights and an 8th of a grain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had found any thing else at that time? - A. He did not. Mrs. Esten called some time afterwards and she saw the diamond; I had taken it out of the setting; I shewed her the diamond, and she said it resembled her's very much; it was out of the setting then; as soon as I found it I waited upon her, which was in about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long did this diamond remain in your possession from the time the prisoner brought it, and the time Mrs. Esten called upon you? - A.Somewhat about a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You recommended him to advertise it; he had no objection to your advertising it, and you did advertise it; and he left it with you eight or nine days, till you purchased it of him? - A. I purchased it of him about eight days after he left it.</p>
               <p>Q.He left his direction with you; it was a true address? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You advertised it, and had the means of resorting to him, if you had found an owner; and the prisoner paid for the advertisement, not you? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He said his father was a tailor and lived in Portpool-lane, No. 44? - A. The young man in the shop took down his address.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 8, Little Wild-street: I had been to the Pantheon-chapel; I was walking home by the side of my own daughter, who is one of the charity children belonging to the Free-school; they had been singing an Anthem over the grave of the servant girl of the mistress of the school, that was deceased; we had crossed Gray's Inn-lane, and was coming into Little James-street; I saw the prisoner at the bar at the head of the mourners; I saw him square with his arms up against the mourners, and when he came to the children, he behaved in a very indecent manner, especially to the girls, making use of infamous language, and shoving them off the pavement; upon which I addressed him in the following words:</p>
               <p>"My friend, do not insult the children, let them pass on;" he then made ready to strike me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any offer to strike him? - A. No; I kept off the first blow with an old umbrella I had in my hand; as soon as I dropped my hand by my side, I received a blow from him on the right side of the face, which knocked me from the pavement into the middle of the coach road, but I did not fall to the ground; when I recovered myself, I went to the opposite side of the street, and turning round, I saw Mr. Webb and Mr. Thorn with the prisoner; they seemed as if they were preventing him from following me; I went over, and said it was a pity that I could not pass the street without being insulted by him, or any other person; Mr. Webb and Mr. Thorn said there was a constable just by, and it was a pity but such a man was taken up; upon which, Mr. Hooker asked if there was any man to give charge of him, and I gave charge of him; Mr. Hooker took his staff out of his pocket, and took hold of him; then we proceeded to take him on to St. Andrew's watch-house; Mr. Hooker finding him very strong, and more than he could manage, called on Mr. Dubbledey to assist, and he took hold of him; the prisoner used every effort he could to get away; we had to drag and carry him all the way; in the course of going along, some person sung out, which I judged to be Mr. Hooker, he has got a knife, take care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after Dubbledey had hold of him? - A. After.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dubbledey do any more than lay hold of him? - A. I did not see that he did; in a little while after Mr. Hooker had called out, he threw the knife from him, and Mr. Webb picked it up; when we got to the top of Bedford-row, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120042"/>Dubbledey's hand running down with blood, and from there we took him to the watch-house in Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it? - A. It was about half past four, it was good light; I could see him perfectly well, or any one else.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dubbledey.) You mentioned being in Theobald's-road; what happened when you were there? - A. I saw the prisoner strike

             with his fist, and knocked him off the pavement; I saw him a long time before cutting capers with Mr. Hooker, and likewise with all the children.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the children? - A. He used very impudent language, he put himself in different postures.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he meddle with their persons at all? - A. Only pushing them about.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he struck Harris, had Harris done any thing at all to him? - A. No further than saying, my friend, let the children alone; Mr. Hooker was the undertaker of the funeral; he left his company, and came to the children; seeing one was one way, and the others another,

             asked whether there was any constable nigh; Mr. Webb and Mr. Thorn said it was a pity such a rascal should go on so; Hooker said he was a constable; he laid hold of the prisoner, and called me to assist; I laid hold of him, and we dragged him along; he was very resolute, and strove to get away from us, and at Theobald's-road he

             a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him draw the knife? - A. No; the constable sung out he had got a knife, going across John-street; I looked round, and saw my hand running with blood; I looked at Mr. Hooker's coat, and saw it cut about a foot; Mr. Webb looked out for the knife, and found it; we dragged him to the watch-house, and there I washed my hand with some water; it was cut deep through the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been done by a scratch? - A. No, it was done by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. How many wounds had you on your two fore-fingers? - A. One on each, on the outside of my fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. What length might the wound be? - A. About three quarters of an inch long, each of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What depth? - A. Near the bone, as near as could be; they were both cut at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for any assistance to have your wound cured? - A. I dressed it myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the examination before the Magistrate, he said he never felt nor saw me cut him; it is not possible that a man having a cut near the bone, should not feel it.</p>
               <p>Dubbledey. In the heat of blood I was in, I did not feel it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot say whether I did it or not, I was not sensible at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dubbledey.) Was he sober or drunk? - He was sober enough to fling away the knife, after the person sung out, he has got a knife.</p>

No, we had hold of him by his arms; we had then got, I think, into John-street; I felt something pulling my coat, but I did not perceive whether it was the mob, or any thing else; I cast my eyes to Dubbledey, and saw his hand running with blood; I immediately said, gentlemen, he has got a knife; I saw the knife distinctly in his hand; he took his arm in this manner (describing how), and threw the knife away; he could not lift his arms far, as we had hold of him, I stopped him; I said, gentlemen, he has thrown the knife away, I with you would find it; I heard the knife drop, Mr. Webb picked it up; I took him on to the watch-house, and there I searched him; this coat, which I have on now, was cut right across; it was examined by the Magistrate; as the coat was loose, it did not penetrate to the waistcoat; if it had been tight, I suppose my bowels would have been cut out.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. I am a sea-faring boy; I saw him come off the barges with the pail, and take it off; he came over the barge that I was in, and carried it up Mr. Griffiths's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Yes; I have seen him a great many times; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a lad that lived with you, of the name of Lunn? - A. He lived with me about a year and a half; he was just breeched when I first took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any of your property? - A. I had missed some noyeaux, that were in cases, and one bottle of Madeira.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any information that you received from the boy, find any brandy on the premises of the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the 29th of August we went to her house near Widegate-street, Petticoat-lane; she furnished us with her address; when we came there, we opened her drawer, and there we found a bottle nearly full of brandy; I gave it to Read, the officer, after tasting and shaking it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go to your stock, and did you observe that you had missed any quantity? - A. About two-tenths of an inch, which is a little more than a bottle; I tasted it from the bottle which was found at her house; it was import strength; the strength it would be allowed to come into the port of London.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was import strength; is that the state in which it would be sold by publicans? - A. No; I believe you may go into ninety-nine gin-shops out of an hundred, and not get it of that strength, because it is the profit they are allowed; it would be reduced 3 s. in a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you taste the gin; what state was that in? - A. Similar; I went by the bead on the vial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing more in the stone bottle which was found? - A. The bottle was covered up in a sieve of fruit, as I conceived it to be, under her barrow; I found it to be brandy and water; brandy grog.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that to be your property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the bottle of brandy that was found in her house? - A. Yes; I can swear to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You import a deal of brandy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the strength of spirits is seen by shaking the vial, to see what sort of a bead it makes; do not you know that the thermometer is to ascertain the heat, and the hydrometer the strength? do you know the woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all? - A. No; I have seen her in passing; that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak to the brandy because of your shaking it; it had the strength of that which you had at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you may go to ninety-nine gin-shops out of an hundred, and not get such brandy? - A. That I am sure is true.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. As to the bead, that may be put upon it to make it look stronger than what it is? - A. I believe it is possible to be done, but the bead put upon it by a chemical process will shew different, we do not do it; the process may be done by others to lower it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if a customer comes, he sees there is a fine bead on it? - A. We never do it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not do it, but the retailers do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What account did she give of the bottle of brandy? - A. She said she bought it at the Hole in the Wall, Aldgate; it was found in her drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That might be owing to the lady's delicacy; she did not like her husband to know she had a bottle of brandy at all.</p>
               <p>- LUNN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How old are you? - A. I am 12 years and 6 months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master? - A. About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner; where did she use to be? - A. Close to my master's house with a barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. What daily? - A. Yes; I have known her about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you acquainted with her? - A. One day, I went to buy a halfpenny-worth of apples; she asked me to bring her some liquor; I denied her; she said I must do it; I took her five bottles of Hollands, four bottles of noyeaux, one bottle of Madeira, and one bottle of brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take this from? - A. From my master's house; I took them to Harp-lane, and delivered them to her there.</p>
               <p>Q. You took them at different times? - A. I took the five bottles of Hollands at once, and the four of noyeaux at once; and the bottle of Madeira<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120046"/>and bottle of brandy at another time; she said she would give me 18 d. a bottle for the spirits, and and a shilling a bottle for the wine; she gave me a shilling a bottle for the noyeaux; I took nothing else to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you have told us the truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I am told you were a naked boy when you came to your master, and was breeched at your master's; how was it? - A. I was breeched some time.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have learned your catechism? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me the eighth or ninth commandment? - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. The eighth is, thou shalt not steal; the ninth is, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour; did you ever hear them before? - A. I learned them, but I quite forgot them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your mother live? - A. At Bermondsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you ride across the river with a scull to your mother's house? - A. No; I generally walk over.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sister used to be where your master lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a sister? - A. Yes; my things used to come sometimes on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this you stole these things from your master? - A. About three months ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a good judge of liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you tell whether it was gin, rum, or brandy? - A. I can tell whether it was brandy or gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tasted gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether it was gin, brandy, or rum; you took the first thing that came to your hand, like any other rogue? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you stole, you cannot either read or write? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever drink brandy, rum, or gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was red or white? - A. There were some red and some white.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to swear whether you gave rum or brandy? have you ever seen brandy mixed with sugar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you will never tell another lie? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not tell me another lie? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was brandy or rum you cannot tell? - A. It was a bottle of brandy that I gave to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it in a bottle when you took it? - A. No, I took it out of a puncheon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were not wicked enough to taste it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You might mistake a rum puncheon for a brandy puncheon; might you not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you it was brandy? - A. Some of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body see you take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You always took it privately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know what a bellencher is? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is what they draw samples with; have you ever helped to draw with the bellencher? - A. I have sometimes with my master, upon the quays.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the smell of brandy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the bellencher in, did you suck the bellencher, or taste the brandy at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were taken up for this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in custody now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell your master this before you were taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she selling at the door? - A. Sometimes she sold apples and sometimes pears.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first time she asked you to give her some liquor, did not you tell your master or some of the men, that a wicked woman asked you to bring her some liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you give them to her? - A. The five bottles of Hollands I took to the pastry-cook's, and left them there, and when she came I gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them to her in the presence of the pastry-cook? - A. No, I left them, and said I would call bye and bye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the noyeaux at the pastry-cook's? - A. No; I took eleven in the middle of the day to her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What did you do with the money? - A. I spent it at the pastry-cook's, some of it, and some she paid me in apples.</p>
               <p>- BUTLER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You live at the Hole in the Wall? - A. Yes, in Aldgate; I am nephew to the master of the house; I do not know the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along with the dray, and there was a cart unloading on the opposite side; I held my whip to the hind horse to keep clear of the cart, and the horse came in rather before I could stop him; I did not see the girl, nor the child.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You were on the wrong side of your horses? - A. No, I was on my right side.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation were you to your horses? - A. I was standing against the middle horse.</p>

He was at the side of the middle horse, and I was at the fore horse; the dray was coming along very gently; he hauled in the horse to prevent him running against the cart; the wheel might take the curb, it laid very low, and it was in a very narrow place.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he come to you first? - A. On the 6th of July, near eleven o'clock in the morning; he called for half a pint of porter, and gave me a shilling, which at that time I supposed to be a good one; afterwards it turned out to be a bad one; I gave him a sixpence and fourpence three-farthings change, and he went away; I laid the shilling upon the mantle-piece under an image; I found it to be a very bad one, by rubbing it, the moment he was gone. On the Friday following, to the best of my recollection, it was the 13th of July, he then called for half a pint of porter; there was a person in the bar with me then, and I said that was the person that offered me the bad shilling; then he offered me a bad shilling, but I gave him no change for that, supposing it was a bad one; I took the shilling, and compared it with the other on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a bad one? - A. Certainly; I turned to the prisoner, and told him that he made a trade of it, that he might be content with giving me one in a week, without giving me the second; he said he did not know it was a bad one, and that he had never been in my house before; I told him I would send for a constable, and have him searched, for I thought he had more about him; he made no answer, and I sent for a constable, who is now in Court; I gave the two shillings to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You keep the Mitre; pray do you know a person of the name of Dyer? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not like to pry into secrets; have not you the good fortune to be married - no private marriage? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What is this girl? - A. She is a neighbour; she lives about three doors from me; her father is dead; her mother keeps a mangle.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is she? - A. I cannot tell; I missed money before at different times; she has been taken ever since the 21st of July, and been in prison. On the 10th, I had the shop robbed of a bowl full of money, and I put some money there on the 14th, to see whether they would come again; twelve shillings and sixpence there. On the 15th, the money was there, which was Sunday, and in the afternoon the money was gone; I was determined to find out some method to detect them, the shop laying intirely back from my house; I went to Hatton-garden, and engaged with the officer to detect them; I put some money there on the 16th, and told the officer to set up to watch. On Friday he came, and told me he could not come that night, he was upon particular business; I set up myself, and this girl came between three and four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get in, at the window? - A. The pane was broke; there was a board put up there, she pulled it down, and came in; Mr. Hancock was called, and he came into the shop, and saw her; we let her come out of the shop with the property on her, because we thought there might be somebody else there; Mr. Hancock saw her come out, and he took her about three or four yards from the window; when he took her, he brought her into the house; she had nothing but a sort of a smock-gown on, and a pair of slippers; he ordered me to go to her mother's, and fetch her clothes, which I did; I saw nobody with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the money on her? - A. The money was in her hand in a bag; I called her mother up.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prisoner.) Q. What age are you? - A. Not ten years.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith.) What kind of a woman is the mother? - A. She is a hard working woman, and has got a large family.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find out whether she was set on by any body? - A. I cannot tell; I produce the money; it was all marked by Mr. Smith, I desired him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they pay for it? - A. No, they had it put by in the same way, and was to call for it on Saturday; they likewise came in again on Friday, the next day, with a third person, and made choice of another gown for the third person; during the time I was serving the third person, I observed one of the prisoners stoop down, under pretence of tying up her stockings; I perceived her making a great bustle in tying up her stockings, which excited my notice; when she arose up, she took both her hands, pretending to draw up her petticoat.</p>

I saw the boy pull a piece of print from under her arm; I took them both to the door, I saw a constable in the street, and gave charge of them immediately; the third person had a gown cut off, pretending a marriage was to take place, and they wished to appear like sisters.</p>

Yes; I bought them of one Mr. White, and put them at my door for sale in that basket, on the 1st of August; I was at work backwards, and was called by my youngest daughter; she told me a man had robbed her mother of some fowls; I then run after him towards Bow, I was informed he was taken in Stepney fields; he was taken to our house; the man who took him is here with the fowls and basket; when I got home, they had let him go; I desired him to be fetched back again, and he was brought back again directly; I have lost a great many things from the door.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure they are my fowls, I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You have a great many fowls for sale? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great many fowls that you keep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back, did you not give them a little airing with the other fowls in your yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you swear to them? - A. This is the basket, and these are the fowls that were lost from my house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any silver? - A. I lost three pieces of silver, I have lost property at several times: On the 18th of July, one piece was taken from the prisoner, seventeen penny-weights, all in one piece; I lost it out of my shop between the hours of six and seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it there last? - A. It was left there on the Monday at dinner-time, till the Wednesday; it was cut off this bit of slip by the prisoner; I ordered my apprentice to conceal himself in the loft of the shop. (Produces the slip of silver from which it was cut off.)</p>
               <p>Q. You had suspicions a long time before? - A. Yes, and particularly of the prisoner; my apprentice saw the whole of the circumstance.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Bridgeman.) Is that your piece of silver? - A. Yes; it was cut off this slip, it fits it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say more, than I have been a hard working man through my life-time; I have got a wife, and six helpless children, and an aged mother, who looks to me for support; I hope, Mr. Bridgeman, you will recommend me to mercy, on account of my family.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When you did that, you did not think of my family, but I recommend you to mercy.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) How long had he worked for you? - A. Better than a twelvemonth.</p>

I missed them on Friday, at half past twelve o'clock, when the prisoner was out of the house; I have got a key myself that belongs to the same room, for being robbed before, it made us careful, and when she came in, I asked her for the sheets, to change them for her; I said, will you give me the sheets, and I will give you others; she said, most assuredly I will; she then went away, and run; I cried out stop thief, and followed her; a man in the street took her; I followed her to Marlborough-street; she said, Mrs. Rodbourn let me go, I will bring them to you on Monday, or directly; my husband not being present, I did not know what to do; I took her before the Magistrate, and she denied ever having them on the bed; I then told her, if she would own to them, that I would not put myself to any expence.</p>

             sworn. - I was going up Sackville-street on the 31st of August, and saw the prosecutrix running after the prisoner, she was crying out stop thief; I asked her what was the matter, and she said the prisoner had robbed her room; I ran after her, and stopped her; I desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120053"/>her to come back; she said, let me go, I will return her her property; I said, I know nothing of you, you must go back with me; I brought her back, and the woman desired me to take her to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I can assure you I am wrongfully accused by my prosecutrix, of whom I took the lodgings; at the time I took the room, she said she was sorry she could not make the place so comfortable as she wished; she had taken the key of the door with her, and then charged me with stripping the apartment of that which was never in the room; I declare myself innocent; leaving my case in your hands, I trust in God I shall be acquitted.</p>

             sworn. - I had an information against the prisoner for carrying away a great quantity of linen; I went to Birmingham and took her at her father's house; I did not know whose property this gown was; the prisoner owned the gown to be part of the property; she gave it up with a great quantity of linen, which belonged to Mr. Reynolds; I took her up at Birmingham on the 3d of August last; she acknowledged to part of a basket of linen which she had made away with; she had the gown on when I apprehended her, and at the watch-house I made her take it off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. (The prisoner handed a paper to the Court, which was read as follows:)</p>
               <p>"My Lord and gentlemen, I am exceeding sorry for having acted wrong; my character was always good till this transaction; I unfortunately over-staid my time with a woman of the name of Mary Griffiths; I was persuaded to pledge the articles; after having done so, I was abandoned by my companion, whom I have never seen since, nor heard of; I have nothing to say more, only throwing myself upon the lenity of this honourable Court, hoping this, my first offence, will excite you to be merciful to me; so shall my future conduct be ever grateful, and that, by keeping in mind your lenity, I may tread in the paths of virtue, and leading a life of honesty, endeavour to repay the humanity shewn to the unfortunate prisoner,</p>

I then took him into custody. (The money and notes produced.)</p>

             sworn. - On Sunday, the 25th of June last, I met this Rutherford in Oxford-road, near St. Giles's; it was past one o'clock in the night; this man came home to my room with me in <placeName id="t18040912-51-crimeloc302">St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there then? - A. Yes; they both spoke together; I do not know what they said then; he said I had got a man's watch in my pocket, and if I did not deliver it to him he would take me to the watch-house; I told him he might take me, and then I would not give it him; the prisoner desired me to call the young woman down to him; I went into the passage to call this young woman down, and the young man struck me; at the time I was struck, I had the man's watch in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had it in your pocket then; you had it in your pocket when you went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not particularly observe that you had it in your pocket at that time? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the young man struck at you; you did not perceive that any person took the watch at that time? - A. No, I was very much in liquor at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you to the Justice? - A. The constable; that was on the Tuesday or Wednesday following; the man that owned the watch sent for the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after you received this blow? - A. I went up stairs to my own room, after I recovered myself; the young man I received the watch from was asleep, and when he awaked he missed his watch; he asked for his watch, and I told him, as well as I could, how I had lost it; he said he would take me to a Justice; I said I was very willing to go; on Tuesday, I think it was, he took me to the Justice; I have seen the watch since at Marlborough-street, but I did not know the watch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You live in St. Giles's; you never had the good luck to be married in this country? - A. I have been married in Ireland.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You were in company with the last witness on the morning of the 26th of June? - A. I was; I went home with her to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much in liquor? - A. I was not so much in liquor, but I knew very well what I was doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give charge of your watch to any body? - A. I gave it to the girl and desired her to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the girl for any liquor? - A. I said if she wanted any thing here was a shilling, that was all; I wanted to go to sleep; she said, let us have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your intention to go to sleep when you parted with your watch? - A. Yes, I had been out in the country, and had spent the evening with some friends, who had kept me late.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you awake when she returned? - A. No, I awoke in the morning, and desired her to give me the watch; I was in a hurry to go to work; she told me she had not got it; she told me two men took it: they knocked her down in the passage, and took it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since? - A. Yes, I saw it again on the 25th of July, I believe, in the possession of Mr. Dobree; I found it out by a hand-bill I got printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the watch? - A. Yes, 111; and there were the two initials(TR)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120056"/>of my name on the swivel; the wife of the prisoner offered me money to make it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not been acquainted with that girl before that night? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were sober enough to know what you were about? - A. I know that I delivered the watch to her.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was very drunk, she told me so herself, and you gave her, who was then drunk, and was going out, a watch to take care of? - A. I cannot say I was sober, but I knew what I was about; and she did not seem to me to be quite drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was quite a stranger to you; and there was another girl in the room? - A. Yes; she told me she was an acquaintance of her's.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw a man in the room when you lost your watch; the girl was out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her a shilling to bring home liquor, for her and you to drink together? - A. I did not want any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she to bring it home? - A. I expected it so.</p>
               <p>Q. She staid some time; you knew nothing of her till the morning when you awoke? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She said you charged her with stealing it? - A. I took her to the office, that I might have a good understanding.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with her that she should have two guineas? - A. I offered a guinea to any one that would bring the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a highway-robber; do you know any thing of a forty pounds reward? - A. I have heard of such a thing, but I do not know the truth of it; I know no more than by hear-say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You told me the girl asked for liquor, and that you gave her the shilling to get what she liked with it; you told me that you did not want the liquor yourself, you wanted only to sleep; and now you say you expected the liquor? - A. I expected the liquor, but I did not want any of it.</p>

               <p>Q. From whom did you receive it? - A. I cannot tell, it was a man; it was pledge in the name of Shaw. On the 13th following, the prisoner, Shaw, brought me the ticket, and asked me five shillings more on the watch, to the best of my knowledge it was him; after he had asked for five shillings more on the watch, he hesitated for a time, and took a pound note out, and took the watch out.</p>

There was a printed hand-bill delivered to me on the 26th of July, and finding the T R mentioned in the hand-bill, I remembered taking in a watch with T R on the swivel; and, in my own opinion, I conceived I should be able to tell the person that pledged it when I was asked; I went to Marlborough-street, and was taken to a place where several people were locked up, I desired the officer not to point out any person to me, and I pointed to the prisoner at the bar; I firmly believe him to be the man that pledged the watch.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Todhunter.) She came into the shop, but she never spoke; did she see you? - A. I do not think she did when she came in; she immediately went out with part of the print sticking out, it was wrapped over with the tail of her gown, it was a small part that I saw; I did not observe the print gone before I went after her, and I saw nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came in, did she look about as if she wanted to speak to any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what she said about the conversation when you went out? - A. I ran directly after her to the corner of Steward-street; I caught her by the arm, and took the piece of print from her first; she said, I was coming to your shop, ma'am; she said nothing more, only when I sent for an officer, she begged me not to punish her.</p>

               <p>Q. Could she take it without coming into the shop? - A. No; the ham was in the back part of the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120059"/>Q. How long had you seen the ham before she took it? - A. Not a minute before; when I missed it, I ran out immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner as soon as you got out? - A. No, I did not see her till I came into Bow-street, that is a great distance from our house; there are several turnings, I went the straight road after her; she was running in Bow-street as fast as she could; I laid hold of her, she had the ham on her arm, wrapped up in a kind of a sack-bag; I took it from her, I never saw her before; the officer took her to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your ham? - A. There's nobody cuts it but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner passed by, as you suppose, I suppose you did not get a particular view of her, so as to know her person? - A. She was in her shift-sleeves when I took her, and when she passed the window with the ham under her arm, she was in her shift-sleeves; I have not the least doubt but she is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along to my work, I met with a man, and he asked me if I would hold a piece of ham while he returned; I said, yes; he told me to wait in the street, and I waited in the street; a gentlewoman came up to me, and said that piece of ham was her's; ma'am, says I, if it is your's, there it is, but a gentleman left it with me while he returned; I have no witnesses; I gave it her directly, I have two fatherless children that belong to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of them? - A. Yes, but I know they are the same men; I should know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120060"/>Freak amongst five thousand men; I was close to them, they were stopped in about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>- sworn. - I am a Police-Officer belonging to Hatton-Garden; I was in company with White; at half past eight we saw the prisoner at the bar; he said he brought them from the Marlow waggon, and he said he was going to take them to Thames-street; he had a note in his mouth with the name of Briley on it; on bringing him out of the Office, he said he was very sorry he did not tell the truth; he was very sorry he had taken them; he was sorry he was to suffer for Webb; that they had sold nails to one

Every nail that I deal in passes through my hands, from Birmingham; I was told that there were a quantity of nails in the watchman's box; when he was gone, we had it broke open; he had taken the key with him, we found a quantity of loose nails there.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. At that time I was assistant to Mr. Purse, a pawnbroker; on the 6th of July, the prisoner came with an Officer to pledge this cloak, to pay the expences of the Compter; she was in the Compter the over-night; it was a silk cloak, upon which I advanced her one pound; that is all that I know of it, except when I went up to Lambeth-street, where the prisoner was; I am sure she is the person that pawned the cloak. (The cloak produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been out all night; I came home between four and five o'clock in the morning; as I was going up our street I met an Irish woman coming out of the house with a bundle; she gave me the cloak; as I came through Aldgate the Officers took me to the Compter, and I was taken before my Lord Mayor; the Officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120063"/>told me I must go and pledge the cloak to pay the expences, which was half a guinea; I did not take any of the things, and what was in the bundle I do not know; the Officers stopped me, and asked me where I lived; I had been into Darkhouse-lane, with a person that was going to Gravesend; I never was in the place that night; my mother is a very hard-working woman; the two Officers were in our street, where I met the woman.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Did you ever find your stockings again? - A. No, nor my linen.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not parted with any? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had not observed the pieces of money so as to know them again? - A. No; I rang for her, and told her there were two missing; she said I must be mistaken, it could not be lost; I told her very likely, but I had not got it; she said that could not be; she observed that there was nobody in the kitchen but herself and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true? - A. Yes; no one came in, and I never stirred out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody, in point of fact, did come into the kitchen, after she delivered to you the change? - A. No, she persisted in it that I must be mistaken, and I persisted that I was not; I looked again, and there were no more than one shilling and four sixpences, and when she put them down there were three shillings and four sixpences; I had not laid them from my hand at all, when I took them up and went into my chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the money again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself go down into the kitchen and make search? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct her to go down and make search? - A. I do not remember that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be possible that in the action of ironing you might have misplaced those two shillings from the ironing-board to the floor? - A. No, I put the money on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she was doing the work of the kitchen? - A. I observed her removing some basons, there was no occasion for it; I saw her at the dresser, but I did not see her take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. So I presume you never desired her to go down and look for it? - A. I was convinced that she knew where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you thought; is that all you know respecting the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn her away that day? - A. No, she staid several weeks after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there missing four bottles of wine the same day as the silver was missed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it will be necessary for me to ask which you have the strongest proof of, the money or the wine? - A. Sir, I am certain of the two shillings.</p>

             sworn. - Q. There are in the indictment two distinct charges, because they were taken at different times; you must select which is the strongest case against her? - A. I think the wine.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Jury.) Then, gentlemen, you must discharge all this about the money.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Reeves.) Do you know whether you have missed any wine? - A. Yes, I have missed wine for several months.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, during the time this woman lived with you, you missed to the amount of four bottles? - A. Yes, a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing particular yourself about the wine? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge her at any time of taking your wine? - A. I told her somebody must go to my cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this wine secured? - A. In a cellar, under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key? - A. The key was in a closet; no person could go to it without they went to the closet, where the key was hung up.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept the cellar constantly locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you kept the key that closet was locked with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to send this girl to that closet? - A. Sometimes she used to go and take out the tea and sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever miss the key yourself? - A. I cannot say that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever send her for wine? - A. Never, I made a practice of getting it myself, or Mrs. Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her box at the time you discharged her? did you find any bottles? - A. No, I searched her box, and found no bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause her to be taken up in your service? - A. Yes; when I searched her box I found a great many clothes that she bought with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. That only strengthened your suspicions, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120064"/>induced you to have her taken up; when did you have her taken up? - A. About a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good character with her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she lived with you? - A. Two years and five months.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is she? - A. About twenty; my suspicions have been alive a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. You still kept her? - A. I could not prove any thing against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in her box, that would open your cellar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MARY TODDEL sworn. - I saw her take two bottles one morning, and two in the evening at another time; Mr. Reeves lodged in the house with the family that I lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. What family did you live with? - A. Mr. Coombe, in King-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Reeves's cellar is separate from Mr. Coombe's? - A. Mr. Coombe had no cellar for wine, it was Mr. Reeves's cellar she took the wine from.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you see her do this before she was taken up? - A. About two or three months before she was taken up, I observed her with two bottles; I did not observe what was in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Two bottles at one time coming from the wine-cellar; did you see how near she was from the wine-cellar - A. When she had the two bottles she was coming out of the wine-cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of that wine-cellar door - A. Mrs. Reeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make any observation to Mrs. Reeves about it? - A. No, not till I was going to leave my place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you told Mrs. Reeves of her coming out of the wine-cellar? was the time you saw it done at the time you left your place? - A. No, about a month or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you tell Mrs. Reeves of it then? - A. Mrs. Reeves had lost her comb, and that made me speak, because it was laid upon me; I was going to leave my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who laid it upon you? - A. She came down stairs, and said it must be one of you that has taken my comb, and I was going away the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told Mrs. Reeves what you had observed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before that? - A. Not before that.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had not been for this dispute about the comb you would not have told? - A. She begged me not to mention it; I thought she had some money that was not her own.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that she begged you not to mention it? - A. When I was going away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that wine; how was it used? - A. There was wine drank in the house; I partook of some wine while I was in the house; she gave me a glass of wine now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not an extraordinary thing for servants to have wine in the kitchen? - A. She informed me that her mistress gave her some.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that her mistress did not give her these two bottles; did you ever ask her mistress about that; you never would have told, if it had not been for this quarrel? - A. She confessed herself.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before the Justice? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Reeves.) How is that? - A. When she was taken up, this young woman told me she had seen her take wine twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the young woman at the bar it would be better for her to confess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other young woman would never have told you, only for the dispute about this comb; do you keep any thing but wine in this cellar? - A. Yes, spirits; brandy, wine, and shrub.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what was in these two bottles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all the evidence you have? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when you took him? - A. He was fast asleep in bed, laying on his back; I stood right across him, and stood upon him; I received information that he had a brace of pistols, I broke open the door and went in, he was fast asleep with a young woman; in the room I found an iron crow, a phosphorus bottle, a bunch of matches, and a piece of wax-candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the room besides this young woman? - A. No; he got the poker, and struck me over the arm, the blow was aimed at my head, he tried to kill me, he cut my arm; while I was packing up these things, I saw him whisper to the girl, and I suspected him, I saw him get the poker; his hands being small, he got the handcuffs off.</p>

               <p>Q. This was done at half past eleven o'clock at night - will you take upon you to say it was the prisoner that knocked you down? - A. It was at half past ten o'clock; I will take upon me to say it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before, it was half past eleven o'clock. - You have heard of the forty pounds reward? - A. I never heard of it to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where have you lived all your life? - A. In Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. And you will take upon you to swear that you never heard of a forty pounds reward? - A. I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is as true as every word you have spoke? - A. Yes; I only come here to speak the truth, I did not come here for the forty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that he lifted the window up? - A. The window was lifted up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - A. I did not; I saw a man's arms put through the window; he took the hat and key; I immediately made away to the door that leads into Neptune-street; I turned to the right that leads into Wellclose-square; I saw him run from the window towards Wellclose-square; I halloaed out stop thief, and he was stopped; when I came up to him, I found the hat and key upon him; I brought him back to where he took the hat from, and my master insisted upon sending for a constable for him; I gave him in the charge of Dunbar.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this window, how long had you seen it before? - A. Before it was lifted up, it might be about a quarter of an hour, because I laid some halfpence in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was down? - A. I am certain that the window was down; it communicates to the street; we never open it, on account of having a safe close by it, and it has communication to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you leave it in such a manner that any body may open it, as it leads to a safe, and put money there, that any idle boy may put his hand in and take it? - A. There is a little kind of a ledge at the bottom of the window, they cannot see the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you keep in that safe; I should think this window should be open, in order to keep it cool in hot weather; on the 27th of August it was warm weather? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you wanted to keep the provisions safe, you ought to keep it as cool as possible; are you certain sure the window was not open? - A. I am sure the cook had not opened it, we have no other servant there but the master's neice; I am sure the window was down, we cannot go past from the kitchen to the cellar without passing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this man? - A. I never saw him before; he has an ancient father that he takes care of, I hope you will be as favourable as you can; I took him before a Magistrate in hopes he would send him on board a man of war; it was very tempting to be sure, there was a blind to the window, this blind was gone to be mended, and outside you can see every transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the window open? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. The hat was found upon you? - A. This is not the man that stopped me, that gave evidence against me now; this man came up afterwards with the hat, and challenged me with it; I know no more of the hat than Adam.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Who was it that stopped him? - A. A man that belongs to the West-India dock; he went to Shadwell Office; instead of that he was taken to Lambeth-street-office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not the hat at the time when the man came up to me, nor do I know the man that stopped me, no more than a child that is not born of his mother; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>

             sworn. - Q. On Wednesday, the 12th of September, I had been out with a parcel, and when I came in, the last witness desired me to wait upon the prisoner; after I had shewed them several different patterns, they were going out of the shop unserved; I called the young man to wait upon them, and when he had shewed several different patterns, the prisoner at the bar ran out of the shop; on seeing her hand under her apron, it gave me suspicion that she had stole something; I immediately ran out of the shop after her, and overtook her in St. Martin's-court; I took the piece of printed cotton from under her apron, and told her to come along with me; she resisted at first, but the neighbours interfered, and she came home with me; I went and fetched a constable; I did not suspect her till I saw her running out of the shop.</p>

I went into this woman's shop to buy a hat for my son; going into the shop, I saw one at the door marked ten shillings and sixpence; the lady came out to me, and asked me if I would buy that hat; I told her, yes, if she would sell it reasonable; I had the hat in my hand; I told her I would not give that for it, I would give nine shillings for it; she then said I should buy that hat, and pay for it, or else I should go to jail; I said, since you are so fierce about it, I will not buy it at all; that is the truth; and then she sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is she commanded by? - A. By the Hon. Capt. Leadbetter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner go on board the Repulse? - A. The latter end of November, or the beginning of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he from that time to the 15th of March? - A. At the Nore; and from there we went to Yarmouth, and from there we went to the North Seas; we came off the Texel on the 5th of December, and never left the Texel for seven weeks; and the man was never out of the ship from the day he came into the ship till the 16th of March; I informed Mr. Pearson of this circumstance; he desired me to come down immediately; I know he was in the ship on the 16th; I was discharged then, as disabled; on the 18th, the purser called on me, and paid me the extra-money that was due to me; I asked him about Johnson, as Johnson took the place; I can swear he was on board the ship the time I said; he was on board the Zealand, and from thence he was turned over to the Repulse, at the Nore; I was at the Nore at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is admiral of that fleet? - A. Admiral Thornborough.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You seem to have been the principal engine in apprehending the prisoner; how long has he been in the factory? - A. He has been a twelvemonth upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he have not been friends for these six months past, I am told; are there a great many weavers about the house? - A. There are about twenty, I believe.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you and the prisoner, before you made any discovery, any quarrel with each other? - A. Not one; I was upon as good terms with him as I was with the others.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I think his arm could support it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing in the kennel? - A. He put his hand in the kennel, and rubbed his righthand in the kennel; it is a strong dirty kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. No; I understood, by the jailer, that he had been in custody before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not in his shop at all, I was coming along the street; they cried out stop thief; I am innocent of the charge, they knocked me down, I asked them what was the matter, they said I had robbed him; they would not hearken to me, they said I was the thief; I said I was not, I was going to Deptford; I am a seafaring man, and have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>Q. That is where you and your husband live? - A. Yes, my husband is agent to their manufactory: On the 23d of June, some time in the forenoon, the prisoner came with two or three yards of carpet under his arm, and asked me whether that was our pattern; I told him no, it was not; he said he came from Mr. Hall, in Moorfields, he produced the order out of his pocket; I have got the order in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hall a customer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The order read.) -</p>
               <p>"Please to let the bearer have two pieces of body to match, or as near as possible, for Hall and Co. Moorfields." - I gave him the order; I knew Mr. Godwin was in the neighbourhood, and I sent him to him; he went out, but never went to him; he came back, and told me he was not there; I went up into the upper warehouse and picked out the two pieces of carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did they contain? - A. One was twenty-eight yards and a half, and the other was twenty-four; he asked me to be particular to find two pieces of this colour, for the ladies were waiting to choose them.</p>
               <p>Q. And you, upon the delivery of this order, delivered to him the two pieces of carpet? - A. I did.</p>
