                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Alexander Lowe, who lives in the parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe—I have lived with him ten years. On the night of the 21st of December I shut up the house before ten o'clock—I am sure I bolted the door and secured the windows—I and an old lad named Beckham, a relation of Mr. Lowe's, were the last persons up—we both went to bed together—she is not here—between one and two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise like a crushing of wood and hammering—it seemed to come from the lower part of the house—I slept on the first floor, and the old lady slept with me—I got up, and after hearing the noise about a quarter of an hour, I called to my master, who slept in the next room, to know if he was up—he did not answer me—at last I heard some-body talking in the alley—I then got up, but I did not go down stairs till seven o'clock in the morning—I then found a chisel on the kitchen stairs, which is below the parlour floor—I gave it to Mr. Lowe—I found a piece of candle in the back yard, and the back-kitchen window was broken open—I am sure I had shut the shutters of that window the night before—they are inside shutters—the passage door was unfastened—I am sure I had shut that—I found marks, of a chisel on he panels between the shop and the passage of the house—my master is a slop-seller—I had left some towels in a basket, and I found them, about the floor, and cupboards doors were open in the kitchen—nothing but plates and dishes were kept in those cup<lb/>boards—they were not moved—I had left the cupboards shut at night—when I went into the yard I found a piece of candle under the kitchen window, and a piece of sand—paper out of a lucifer box, and the panel of the window shutter which it here—I do not Know the prisoner—nobody lives in the house but myself, my master, and the old lady.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020006"/>
               <p>he dropped it and the shoes—I told him to put the shoes on, as he had none on—I did not have them afterwards—the other man made his escape—I secured the prisoner, and searched him at the station-house—I found in his coat-pocket some tallow—it appeared to be part of a candle from the shape of it—there was some tallow on the chisel—he did not say any thing.</p>

On the 22nd of December I went to Mr. Lowe's house—I have brought the pieces of panel her which I found outside the kitchen window—here are two pieces, they are pieces of a shutter—they have marks on them, corresponding with the chisel which Taylor has produced—there was enough of the shutter taken out to make way for a man to come in—they were inside shutters they must have got through the glass part to get to the shutter—I observed footmarks in the back yard—marks of feet without a shoe—the yard has a close-boarded fence seven or eight feet high round it.</p>

I had been to a singing place at a public-house, and was returning home, and as I came along, I turned up the court to ease myself, the policeman laid hold of me, and said I had dropped the chisel—I never had my shoes off, nor ever had any chisel in my possession.</p>

On Saturday the 31st of December, the prisoner Langton came to the office of his own accord, and stated that he was afraid he had got him<lb/>self into trouble, or was likely to get into trouble on account of some sil<lb/>ver spoons he had purchased of a man dressed in a brown coat, about thirty-two or thirty-three years of age—he stated hat he asked him at the time he offered him the spoons, the particulars whether they were his won and the party seemed very much offended at the question, and stated that he had a bill to make up, and was ashamed to go to a pawnbroker's with the articles to pawn them—that the man asked him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, which he refused to give, but gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and a half-crown for a set of fire-irons—I asked him where the spoons were—he said, "At Mr. Wil<lb/>liam's, the pawnbroker's"—1 said he bad better go with me to Williams's and I would make inquiry into it—on the way to Williams's, the prison's house being on the road, I called there and saw his wife, and in cones<lb/>quence of what she said, I understood a policeman had gone to tell wil<lb/>liams to come to the police-office—I told the prisoner then we night as well go to the police-office at once—he said he was quite willing to go be<lb/>fore a Magistrate to clear the point up—I went with him as far as the police-office, and gave the statement I have now done here—I stated there that he had come to me for advice—he was not aware that the officer had gone to the pawnbroker's till I went with him to his wife—I learnt in the mean time that Andrews was gone to the pawnbroker's—Langton brought some fire-irons, and I told him he had better take them down with him, and they were taken down—I produce a cap, a shoe, and a knife—I received</p>

               <p>the cap and shoe from Mr. Sewell—either of the prisoners could wear the cap, being torn at the back—it would fit either of their heads—at the Thames Police-office we were directed to take Goddard and Knowlan out<lb/>side, and fit the shoes to their feet, and we fitted them to both their feet—either of them could get them on and wear them, but they fit Knowlan pro<lb/>perly, they are too long for Goddard—I received a pair from Mr. Sewell at first, but detained one, and sent the other to be tried, respecting another burglary.</p>

On the evening of the 16th of December last I was bringing the prisoner from the compter to the mansion-house—I said nothing to induce him to say any thing—he owned to the fact that the handkerchiefs were in his trunk or box, but he said if he was free his life time again, if he was to go back again to his situation, he would never be guilty of such a thing again, as long as his breath was in his body.</p>

               <p>of cloth which gentlemen wear very much—I delivered the cloth to the prisoner, and he took it away with him—I have been in the habit of exe<lb/>cutting genuine orders like this, without their being addressed to cur house—it is not addressed to any person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where were you when I gave you the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the shop, at the desk—I fetched the cloth from the top of the shop—the clerk never had the order in his possession till after I had executed it; I cannot say how many times I have served you before for Mr. Foster, but to the best of my knowledge I have seen you several times in our shop—I do not recollect serving you with 2 1/2 yds. of Harrington before—I do not know that you gave any name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I worked for Mr. Foster six or nine months, but never went to this shop but once—I took an order for the cloth—I was remanded two or three times, but they could not produce the order fur the Harrington which Mr. Foster had received—I fetched that, and took it to Mr. Foster, and they cannot find that order—it is very probable the one they have produ<lb/>ced here may be the one I took then—I was at work at Mr. Foster's at the time they say I brought this order, and Mr. Foster's books will prove it—I was not in their shop at the time. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to sign your name as if you had executed it your<lb/>self; look at your deposition, you have put your name to that as if you handed him the bill of parcels, and gave him the cloth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not give him the property—I do not know how I came to sign my name to this—it was read over to me—I did not hear that particular word used—I could not say I gave it to him, because I did not—(<hi rend="italic">deposition read</hi>)—"Robert Ward says I know the prisoner to be the person who brought the order on Saturday, the 3rd of December, for a cut of Harrington—the order was brought to me, and I gave the property to the prisoner, with a bill of parcels, in the name of Foster."</p>

There is no other order for two yards and a half—I have several orders in my pocket for two yards—they are all genuine orders—I cannot say who brought them—some of them are with<lb/>out dates—I am certain I saw the prisoner come into the shop on the 3rd of December, and this order was given up to me at the desk—it was on Saturday, and I think inquiry was made on Monday or Tuesday—I do not recollect having soon the prisoner there before, but I am sure he is the man who came that day.</p>

On the 7th of December I met the prisoner, about half-past eleven o'clock, near the five-mile stone, on the Edgware-road—that is the road from Stanmore—he had four pigs—I asked if they were his own, he said they were—I asked him where he brought them from—he said from his brother, whose name was Cole, and lived at the Hyde—I was not satisfied, and turned my horse's head, to apprehend him but he made his escape, and left the pigs—it was near the Welesh Harp, and the pigs turned into that yard—I pursued and took him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) On the 9th of December, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening I was at Kingsland, and fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor's stable I saw the prisoner and another—the prisoner was carrying a truss of hay—I suspected, and watched them—I saw the other person go out into the main road, and look about—they were in an avenue—he turned back and said something to the prisoner, who then came out and in the road going towards the Elephant and Castle I took hold of the prisoner, and said I should take him into custody—he put the hay down, and said he was going to take it to the Elephant and Castle for a truss which he had borrowed—the other man went away as quick as he could—I think he was one of the prosecutor's men, but I am not certain—I went to the Elephant and Castle, and could not find the ostler—I have not seen him since, he has gone away entirely—I showed the hay to the prosecutor, and he claimed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furnishing ironmonger, and life in Davis-street, Berkeley-square. The prisoner James Bateman was in my employ as occasional porter and assistant is the manufactory—he had been so about eighteen months—in consequence of suspicion, I went to the house of his mother, June Bateman, on Wednesday night, the 14th or 15th of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020046"/>
               <p>December—it is next door to the Hanover public-house, Bays water-road—I found the two female prisoners there—I inquired for James, and his mother told me he had been gone out about ten minutes—I said I wanted him to come to work at half-past five o'clock next morning, which was half an hour earlier than usual, to oil a smoke-jack in Portman-square—she said she would tell him when he came home—she brought a tin candle<lb/>stick, with a pair of steel snuffers in them, to the end of the counter (it was about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening)—the snuffers were part of a packet 1 had lost a few days previous—I said, "Mrs. Bateman, these look very much like a pair of patent snuffers which I have the pattern of—they were very superior ones, and are a peculiar pattern—I never saw any other ironmonger have them—there is not a patent for them, but they are called patent—she said, "Sir, they are not yours"—I said, "I did not say they were, but if you will allow me to take them home with me, I will return them by <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> in the morning?"—as they were all over grease, I gave them into her hand to wrap in a piece of paper for me, and brought them away with me—as soon as I returned I sent my son for a parish-officer, and he went with the officer to their place—I was not present—next morning about ten o'clock, I went with the officer to their residence—Priscilla said her mother was not at home—between that time and one o'clock, I went to Smith's, a pawnbroker in Edgeware-road, to inquire if he had any cutlery, or brass candlesticks, or ironmonger's goods pawned with him—he produced two or three pairs of knives and forks, two pairs of large bran candlesticks, and one flat candlestick—I found my private mark on the largest pair—the whole of the knives had my name and address stamp on the blades—I claimed them as property lost from my warehouse—I then procured a search-warrant from Marlborough-street, and took two officers to Bateman's house, and found a japanned canister, and a tin candlestick in the shop, and the duplicate of a carving-knife and fork in her bed-room—it was the only bed-room in the house—the prisoner James slept in the house every night—it was his lodging, as I understood—I never saw him lodging there—after searching the place, the officers and I accompanied the female prisoners to Smith, the pawn broker's, and his man recognised Priscilla as one of those who pawnel the articles—we went from there to Marlborough-street office—about half-past twelve o'clock the same night, James Bateman knocked at my door—I opened it, and asked, "Who are you, Sir?"—he replied, "It is <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> come to render himself up, having heard that his mother and sister were in prison, for he had robbed me"—I asked him how he came to do such a thing—he said because his mother was in distress when he did it—I said, "I can do nothing more than deliver you into the hands of justice, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">James Bateman</hi>. I believe he gave me the tin candlestick at the time his house was under repair. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never gave him any thing of the kind—it is a new one—I once gave him an old one.</p>

               <p>search her house, on suspicion of having property of Mr. Baker's—she said she had not—I searched, and on the ground-floor found a candlestick and sugar-canister, which Mr. Baker identified—I went up stain, and found two duplicates in a chest of drawers in the bed-room—the mother said those two tickets belonged to her—she afterwards said only one of them belonged to her—she very much wanted to get them from me, by putting her hand out, saying, "That one is mine"—on looking at them I found one was for a carving-knife and fork—I said, "This must belong to Mr. Baker"—she made no reply—the duplicate she claimed was for six dram-glasses, which the prosecutor does not claim—I took both the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, John Warner, and another—we are brass-founders, in Jewin-crescent, Cripplegate. The prisoner had been in the service of our firm twelve or fifteen months—her was to lacquer brass articles after they were finished by the mikes—she came at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and left at five in the evening—on the 14th of December I went to a pawnbroker in St. John-street, and saw some articles I knew were mine—I went to the prison<lb/>er's house the same evening, with an officer—I found there a bottle-jack, two brass figures, three pairs of candlesticks, and some duplicates, and gave her into custody—she said she was very much distressed—I said I thought it exceedingly strange that she should do such a thing, but I made her no promise—she said it never would have been had it not been for the good-for-nothing old woman, Mrs. Eagles, who had given her all the articles.</p>

About October, 1835, the prisoner came into my service as shopman, and continued till this time—I missed articles from time to time, and communicated it to the prisoner—he denied it—I said, "It is an extraordinary thing, I cannot find out who is the thief"—he put me on my guard against the workmen, and I have discharged two of them—On the 30th of November a communication was made to me by my apprentice; in consequence of that I had search made at the pawnbrokers' on the 1st of December, and found a pair of Blucher boots and a pair of Wellingtons—I came back, and said to the prisoner, "I have been looking over the stock this morning, and miss a couple of pairs of boots out of the shop; they were here yesterday" (I had seen them the day before)—I said "Where did you go to?"—he said, "I went to such a place"—I said, "Did you take any boots any where else?"—he said, "No"—I then said, "I have got a thief about my concern, I hardly know who to suspect"—he said, "I can assure you, Sir, I never robbed you, whatever fault I may be guilty of"—I said, "Your own conscience is the best mentor; you and the pawnbroker must settle this"—I then said, "Who is this 'Jackson?'"—he said a friend of his—I said, "You and the pawnbroker must settle that," and I called one of my men to go and fetch a porter—I said, at "all events I will fix the offence on you"—he said, "For God's sake, for the sake of my poor mother, don't commit me, it is my first offence"—I had not given him any authority to take these.</p>

On Saturday evening I was out with a party in Leicester-square—I was going to Covent-garden, and met this girl who said she would take me to a house where I could stop—I went with her, and asked what they wanted for the room—they charged me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that woman left the room—I said I could lock the door, and should be safe—I went to bed, and in ten minutes (before the young women came to bed) Mr. Josephs broke the door open, and said 1 most take my things and go out as quick as I could—I said, "Give me time to dress myself," and said, "I won't leave the room till I have my money back "but he took my things and threw them out of the window—I took the poker and knocked at the window to call the police—he took the poker from me and we struggled for it—his wife came up, and a girl brought some boiling water—I called the policeman, and murder, and whatever I could—the po<lb/>liceman came up at last, and I dressed myself, and went with him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Charles Cooper, a draper of Tottenham. On Tuesday the 20th of December, about two o'clock, I went with sixty yards of merino to the Rev. Mr. Wallis, at Edmonton, for the house-maid to examine—I left it as she was engaged—I went for it again between four and five o'clock, it was then getting darkish—it was rather a large parcel—I carried it on my shoulder, and got as far as wag-on house-lane, about halfway home, when I saw three or four boys stand<lb/>ing at the corner—I did not know them before—one of them pushed against me—I turned round, and he ran away—my bundle was still on my shoul<lb/>der I stood still—I walked on again, and was pushed against again, but not by more than one at a time—I looked round, and recognised the pri<lb/>soner Buckley—I am quite sure of him—I kept going on, and in a minute or so after I heard steps behind me, and before I could turn round, my</p>

A load, and said he bought it for Mr. Hunter, the iron-founder, and that he was his groom—1 put the trusses off the cart to him, and he pitched them into the corn-chandler's passage—all the trusses were in his hands—I in tended to sell it to Mr. Hunter—I allowed him to take possession of it, under the belief that Mr. Hunter's clerk lived there—I believed he was telling me the truth all the time—I made do bargain to be paid for a part, but for the whole—I expected the money when I delivered the rest of it at Mr. Hun<lb/>ter's should not have left it there without being paid for it—I expected Mr. Hunter to pay for it.</p>

On the 30th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the bar and asked for change for a sovereign—I said, I would see—he said unless I could give it, he could not have a pint of beer—I sent the change by my niece, and he sent a supposed sovereign—he was in the tap-room, and I was in the bar—she laid it on the table—it turned out to be a medal—I went and found the prisoner in the Grave Maurice, Bromley—I asked him if he had been to the George the Fourth, and changed a sovereign—he said, "I have not been out of this house"—I said, "I am certain you are the man, who had change and gave me a bad sovereign"—he said he could give the change back again, and make it all right, but the policeman would not allow it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge in Prince's-court, Poplar. On Sun-day afternoon the 20th of November, I was in a beer-shop in Harrif-court-the prisoners came into the shop with two or three more females—I got half a gallon of beer, and they got the same—we drank together, and we went out together—I felt tick, and I said I wanted to go home to my ship—the two prisoners said they would find lodgings for me—I came out to go home, they followed me, and the woman pressed me to go into the White Hart—I went in and got half a pint of liquor for them—I could not drink any—they wanted me to get a glass of brandy, which I did, but I did not feel better—I said my head against the bar, and Knowlan said, "Do not he there"—the woman was out at the time; she then; came in and I laid my head there again; and he said I must not lay my head there—I said I might get better—Rooke said, "Take him home"—he said he would—I said if they put me in a house that was safe, I would pay for it—I then went down with the man, and went into a house—the woman came in directly, and gave him a candle, and told him to take me up, and go to bed with me—I went up, pulled off ray two jackets, and laid them under my head and then my trowsers and laid them there—Rooke was down stairs then—Knowlan told me to get into bed—he pulled off his jacket and dropped it on the floor, and got his trowsers half down, and then I got into bed, and then he put his trowsers up again—I had five shillings in my trowsers pocket—I put my hand in and felt the five separate shillings, when I came out of the public-house—it was then about half-past eleven o'clock—soon after I felt a violent blow on my head, and I said, "Have mercy, do not kill me, for God's sake"—I looked up and saw this man—he said, "you</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Captain in the 79th Highland regiment—I was formerly in the 89th Foot—I am one of the sons of Lord Panmure. In the early part of 1835 I had occasion to borrow 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 11th of February I had an introduction to the prisoner for that purpose—I had a conversation with him upon the subject, and saw him again in consequence of that, on the 14th of February, at No. 107, Jermyn-street, which is an hotel, and on that occasion I accepted a bill of exchange—be-fore I accepted it, it was drawn and indorsed by Mr. Atkinson—I believe this to be my acceptance, which I gave him on the 14th of February, 1835—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I never gave him any other for that amount—it was drawn at three months date, and would be due in May—after I accepted it the prisoner was to get it discounted for my use—I waited some days to enable him to procure the money—on the 23rd of February 1 called on him on the subject, and he told me the bill for £1000 was too large, and that he could not get it discounted, and he said he thought he could get two for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. discounted better—he proposed to draw two: I said I would give him one in the mean time—he said, as the £1000 bill bore both our signatures, it might as well be destroyed; upon which he pulled from, (I believe,) his right-hand waistcoat-pocket, a piece of paper, which he said was my bill for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had it in his hands a little while—he unfolded it, tore it in two, and threw it on the fire—I believed it to be my acceptance for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not put it into my hands—I saw it in his hand, but did not read it—it had every appearance of my bill—I then accepted the bill for £500—in consequence of information which I received, I called on him on the 1st of March—I had not then received any money at all from him—I never received any thing from him—when I called on him on the 1st of March, I requested him to return me my bill for £500—I do not exactly recollect whether I assigned any reason for doing so—to the best of my recollection he took it from a small pocket-book, and handed it to me—it was my bill—I examined it, tore it, and threw it into the fire—on the 1st of November I went abroad with my regiment, and while at Quebec I received a letter from Mr. Lane—I returned from Quebec about the middle of October, 1836, and was sent from Portsmouth to Glasgow without landing—I got leave of absence on the 17th of December, and on the 19th arrived in London, and, in consequence of information from Mr. Lane, in three days I went before a Magistrate.</p>

About half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 17th of December, I was coming to town in my phaeton, and saw the prisoner at Acton Bottom, between the fourth and fifth mile stone—something induced me to pay particular attention to him—when I got up to him he was on the off-side of the road—he crossed to the near-side, and attempted to take hold of my horse's head, but was prevented doing so by my galloping—he then came to the near side of the chaise, and eventually to the back of the chaise, but I galloped, as I thought away from him—I then pulled up, and looked behind me and he</p>

               <p>was close behind—I tried to gallop away from him again—he then jumped up on the back seat of the phaeton—it was a turn-over head—he took hold of me by the coat—I said, "What do you want there? get down"—he then swore at me with a bad expression, and said, "I will cut your b——throat"—I then presented a pistol at him, and said, "You ragabond, get down, or I will fire at you"—I struck him in the face with the birrel of the pistol, which marked him down the face—I believe I struck him again, and he fell from the back of the chaise on his head in the mud, and there I left him, apparently insensible—when I proceeded further, I met a party of policemen—I told them, and described his parson, that he was an Irishman, that he had fallen on his head in the mud, and they would find his head covered with mud—a policeman returned with me in my phaeton, and in a very short distance we came up to the prisoner—he was covered with mud, and there was the mark of the blow from the pistol down his face—the policeman laid hold of him, and said, "You are my prisoner"—he then said, "I did not mean to hurt the gen<lb/>tlemen—he shammed intoxication, and, perhaps, he might be a little so—he was decidedly not intoxicated—he had been drinking, but I should say he was decidedly not drunk—I have not a doubt of his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Angel on the evening of the 26th of December, between four and five o'clock, with my son-in-law, and there was one or two more in the company—the prisoner was there, but not drinking in our company—my wife came about seven o'clock, and I asked her for a shilling, which she gave me—she did not stay above two minutes after giving me the shilling—I stopped to spend the shilling with my son in-law, and she went away by herself—the prisoner was not there when she went away—he was there when she gave me the shilling, but I missed him and my wife both at the same time—I did not miss any body else out of the room—after some time my wife came back—she had been Knocked about and bruised, and had been very ill used indeed—she had a black eye, her nose was cut, and she had three or four marks about her forehead—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and have chambers at No. 8, New-square, Lincolns Inn, in the parish of St. Clement Danes. On Monday afternoon, the 26th of December, I left about four o'clock, I returned at eleven o'clock, and found Mrs. Matthews there—in consequence of what she stated, I looked at the drawers in my bed-room, and missed six waistcoats, and one handkerchief—and from the servants' room, three tea-spoons, the sugar-tongs, one salt-spoon, a table-spoon, and a great coat—I think the whole were worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the lowest—I hate since seen two of the waistcoats, and the great coat—the prisoner lived with me several years formerly as clerk and servant, but not just at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I made a purchase of some Meck Lenburgh Keil butter, at Brewers Quay—it takes its name from the place it is shipped from, Keil—on the 11th of November I sent my lad Peacock with a cart and horse, for fifteen casks—I have since seen some of the butter at the premises of a man named Coxson—I know it by the peculiarity of the favour—it was then packed in a different cask to what it generally is.</p>

I was sent by him to get some butter from Brewers' Quay, with a horse and cart—it was delivered to me—there were twelve casks in the body of the cart, and three on the copse, in quarter casks—in all fifteen firkins—as I was driving away, a man came running up to me at Billings<lb/>pte, and said something, in consequence of which I returned to Brewers' Quay—when I came back, I found the horse, cart, and butter gone—the person who spoke to me had on a pair of corduroy trowsers and a fustian jacket, very much torn—he was a very dirty-looking man, and was pitted with the small-pox—I had seen him at work on Brewers' Quay, which made me think it was right—the horse and cart were afterwards found at Day's livery-stables, in King David-lane, Shadwell.</p>

               <p>said. "My partner's van is in the stable, if that will do, I will lead it to you," and he went out with them—in about a quarter of an hour Stebbings returned alone—that was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon I went to the door when Collins and <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> went away, and saw the prisoner Bowles and another young man, whose clothes were all torn off him, his elbows were all out, and he was freckled with the small-pox, he had a fustian jacket and corduroy trowsers, and was very dirty, he had a low-crowned white hat with a broad brim, and was bigger them either of the prisoners—they went the same way as Stebbings, Collins, and <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi>—I saw them walk close up to one another, but did not see them speak—I saw them join directly after Stebbings, Collins, and <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> went away—Stebbings walked on first, and the other four were all together—they were in company—I went to the door, and saw them turn round Shorter-street, which leads into Well-close-square, which is when Stebbings's partner kept his van—I saw the four men together for about five minutes—they were all four together in a line—about half an hour after, as near as I can guess, when Stebbings was at tea, and I was in the shop I saw Potter's van and Stebbings's horse—Potter is Stebbings's partner—the van was full of tubs—<hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> was by the horse, and Collins was by the cart—I did not see any one else—I was going out at the time, and saw the van go up Rosemary-lane, and stop at Coxson's—I saw <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi> take one cask out first, and take it into Coxson's—Collins at that time was standing by the horse's head—I then saw <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> come out and take another cask out, and take it in—I then went on to where I was going—<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> said to Coxson, in Collins's hearing, "Are not you going to have the other two?"—Coxson said, "No, I will not have them, as you have brought the van up to the door, I will not have more than two, or else I would have had the four"—Collins was about a yard from Coxson at the time the conversation took place, and must have heard what was said—about two hours or more after I was at Stebbings's house, and Bowles and the ragged man came to the door—Bowles said, "Mistress, is the van come back yet?"—I did not make any answer then, as I was serving-they went and stood a little distance from the door—Bowles came again, and said, "Mistress, is the van come back?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I am not going to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> out of it in no such a way," and the ragged ran said, "I am not going to be done out of it"—they stood quarrelling with each other—the ragged one said, "I am not going to be done out of it after driving it away," and Bowles answered, he was not going to be dm out of his regulars—when I said the van was not come back, Bowles said, "I want the young man who borrowed the van, <hi rend="italic">Upright Charley</hi>."</p>

               <p>men—I have never thought of it—I was only housekeeper to Stebbings—I have not been promised that endeavours should be made to get him off if I gave evidence against these men—no one has told me 1 might get some of Stebbings's punishment off if I did so—of course I should be glad to get Ms punishment remitted, but not by convicting these men—I did not tell Mr. Webb all I knew about it, only part of it—I did not tell him say thing—I only went to show him a letter—Cook the police—sergeant was the first person I told of it—I saw him going past the door, and called him in—I told him some part of it, and told the rest at the Thames police about three weeks ago—the letter I showed Mr. Webb was from Stebbings—it was a letter to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Piko at Union-wharf, on the right-hand side of the City-basin. On the morning of the 17th of December, I had two empty barges and one full one, lying there—I was on the bridge looking over towards the basin about half-past one o'clock, and observed a fly-boat come through the bridge—I observed the name of the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> on it, in black letters on a white ground—it steered its course alongside my barge—I was not in a situation to see the people on board the boat, but I saw two men jump from the boat on board of my full barge, the <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi>—I observed one man steering, and another on board the fly-boat—I cannot speak to either of the prisoners, as being the per-sons—the man who was steering was a considerably larger man than the others—I saw the two men who were on board my barge stoop and take up something and throw it into their boat-they took something from the stern of my barge and put it in the bow of the boat, which was along-side</p>

               <p>the stern of the barge—the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> was passing as slow as a child could walk, and as they came to the head of the barge, they took something from the bow of it—I then heard a voice from Mr. Pickford's side, call out, "It won't do, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—I think it was repeated twice—the man on board the fly-boat put the tiller off, and the two men on board the barge jumped into the boat, which went towards Pickford's—I went and got a policeman, and he obtained others—three attempted to go to the boat, but one could not get over the gates of my wharf, and he remained behind—I and two policemen went on my wharf, got into the barge, put it off, and they went on board the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi>—I did not go on board—I acted as waterman for them-the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> was moored outside some boats of Mr. Pickford's—I described to the policemen what I had seen, and the place where I had seen something put—I heard the question asked by some one in the boat, "What do you want here?"—"We come to search for coals," was the reply—I was not on board then, but I think I did go on board—three of the prisoners were then at the stern of the boat, and one at the head—they were in hearing when I pointed out the head of their boat to the policemen, which was quite filled with Bellmoor Wallsend-coals—the same as I had twenty-eight tons of in my barge—I found from two to four or five hundred weight on board the boat—the prisoners were taken in about an hour, or an hour and a half, afterwards—some of the policemen staid, while others went for assistance—I heard Mills, who was the captain, say he would not go, he could be found in the morning—the policemen said, "You must go now"—I examined my own barge, and saw holes where it appeared the larger coals had been taken out.</p>

I saw my sheep safe in the gravel-pit field, at four o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 31st of December—next morning, about nine o'clock, I was in the field, and missed two sheep—one of them was a ewe—I found the head and feet of a sheep in the field—I traced it by blood to the corner of my stack-yard—in consequence of information, I obtained a search-warrant, by means of which the mutton was discovered at Price's—traced blood round in the direction of Price's house—I compared the skit found by Kent in the New River, with the head found at Price's house, and I could ascertain they formed part of the same animal, and there were parts of the carcass on which the wool was left—part of the skin was left on the mutton at Price's, which exactly corresponded with the skin—4t was the skin of one of my sheep; and the other found at Julph's was also the skin of a sheep I lost—I found the head and feet in the field corresponded with the skin found at Julph's—the mutton at both places had part of the skin left, which agreed with it—one skin has my initial on it near the hip, and the other has a star branded on the same spot.</p>

I should have five more, and if I would go over to the Elephant and Castle I should be taken to a house where I should be made a gentleman of—I believe I stated the whole of that—I put my signature to what was read over to me—I did not say that was not all I said—the prisoner wanted me to say that I believed Lee to be the man, but could not speak positively to him—he wanted me not to go against him at all, at first—the woman appeared much affected—she pretended to cry—I believe it was pretence—I looked at her, but I saw no tears—I am a cabman—what I had said was, that I saw Lee take a carpet bag from a coach as I was driving—I stated to you, On Lee's trial, that I only saw him for a short time.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Elliott, and live in Catherine-street, Vauxhall. On the 6th of December the prisoner came to my house about a quarter past one o'clock, (at dinner time,) and said he had been a very unfortunate young man, he had been transported, and now had returned from Hobart Town—(I have a son there)—he told me he had brought a letter for me, which was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it was left at the dead letter office, Somerset-house, if I would go with him, he would get it—I said I could not go then, I was going to get my children's dinner—I said I would go on Wednesday—he said he could not go on Wednesday, as he was going to Mr. Capper's office to receive his penny a day, as a convict—but would I go that evening? I said, I did not know how to go, but I would go in the evening—he came at ten minutes before five o'clock, and I gave him tea, I left my children, took my baby, and went with him—as we were going along, he said my son was quite well, and that he was drinking with him on the 20th of June at a public-house at the top of Waterloo-street; we went on to Somerset-house right under where the man saved his life by hanging by the brickwork—there are a great quantity of steps—I had the baby in my arm—I said it was rather awkward to go down with the baby—he said, "I will hold the baby"—I said "No" he said, "Give me your money, I will go down and get the letter"—I gave him one shilling, two sixpences, two penny<lb/>pieces, and four halfpence—I waited round the yard till a quarter before eight o'clock, and then the sentry asked me what I was waiting for—I said I was waiting for a young man who was gone to get a letter—he said there was no such place there—I never saw the prisoner again till I was fetched by the officer, to Union Hall, and the turnkey asked if I could swear to him—I said I could from a great many—he had sat half an hour in the kitchen with me, and then walked with me—I have not the slightest doubt, he is the person</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020156"/>
               <p>—he had a short jacket on, a pair of low shoes, a small white handkerchief, striped, and his face and voice is the same—I could swear to him from thousands—I was with him an hour.</p>
