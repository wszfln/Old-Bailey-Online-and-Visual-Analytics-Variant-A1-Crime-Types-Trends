             sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Shotter: On Friday evening last I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, and found those things that are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the ticking? - A.Between the sacking and the bed, made up in a kind of mattrass, stuffed with new hair, and some small bits of ticking besides; this ticking that is stuffed, I can swear to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a mattrass when your master lost it? - A. No, we had used it as a wrapper to keep the goods from the wet.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your master's property? - A.Because I knew the pattern of the tick; I have opened the ticking, and in the inside of it there are some marks of dirt, which I remember very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that ticking in the state in which you used it? - A. About three shillings; I have another piece of carpeting here which matches exactly with that which was found at the prisoner's lodgings, that is worth about two shillings; I remember the pattern of this chintz border very well, it is worth about one shilling, we bought it at a linen-draper's in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That piece of border was publickly sold in the linen-draper's shop? - A. Not by anction.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not publicly sold in the shop? - A. I do not know how public it was.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had a bit of carpet of the same size and pattern, you would have suspected me? - A. If it had been that identical piece, I should have suspected you.</p>
               <p>Q. And the mattrass was concealed under that bed, where mattrasses ought to be? - A. No, not where it ought to be, it ought to be upon my master's premises.</p>

             sworn. - I work at Mr. Shotter's: Last Wednesday morning, I went to work about ten minutes before nine, and Mrs. Moore was there before me; she came from the further end of the shop where the ticking was found afterwards; I asked her if she had been at work, and she said, no, she was poorly; she then went towards the fire, and then into a corner where the horse-hair was kept, and I followed her there, and saw her stoop towards the place where I afterwards saw the roll of ticking lay; she seemed as if she had something more than common under her petticoats, for she kept pulling it up all the morning; before twelve o'clock she went away without her cloak.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The roll of ticking that you saw in the shop, is still there, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.It is not charged in the indictment? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shotter. I can speak to the ticking, I mean the mattrass, and to the carpeting; it is a Russia<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090004"/>ticking, and a very uncommon thing, we have used it as a wrapper; and the carpeting I know by the pattern, and by the quantity that was missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That mattrass belongs to my mother, who lives with me; there is that piece of carpet, and another small piece, I bought; and there was another small piece that was given me, with a work-bag, by this woman, Mrs Green.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t17990109-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Why did not you bring your wife here? - A. She is in a very forward state of pregnancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the shop at the time with you? - A. Yes, all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these stockings to be your's? - A. Yes, by moving them in and out of the window for a long time; they are an article we fell very little of; I am confident they were in the window within an hour and a half of their coming.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HINDE sworn. - I live with Mr. Wassell, a pawnbroker, in Parliament-street: On Saturday the 15th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came to our shop together, but for what purpose I do not know, for there was a dispute between them, and they were turning out of the shop again; Mr. Appleby then came up, and accused them of robbing him; he pulled the prisoner Sullivan's cloak, and then I saw a pair of stockings in his hand, I did not see them drop from her; I then saw him pick up two more pair; Murphy then ran away, and Sullivan went upon her knees, and begged for mercy; I afterwards saw the other prisoner return to the shop-window; I went out and secured her, but found nothing upon her; she had a bundle the first time, but she had none the second.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH KEMP sworn. - I live at Lamport, in Northamptonshire: Upon hearing that my box was broke open I came to town, and, in the prisoner's room, I found a bundle containing about a yard and a half of silk ferret that had my private mark upon it; the prisoner had then quitted the lodging, and gone to another; I also found in the bundle a piece of sponge that I had left in the box, and a hank of buttons. The box contained, among other things, the goods mentioned in the indictment: there were two cotton gowns and coats, worth one pound each; four petticoats, worth three guineas, they cost me more; a white calico gown, worth one pound; a muslin apron, that cost me half-a-guinea, and all my muslin handkerchiefs and caps; a pair of stays, worth a guinea and a half; a tea-pot, worth five shillings; a tablecloth, worth eighteen shillings; half-a-dozen napkins, worth ten shillings; and a great many more things mentioned in the indictment; I have never found any of them again.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that that bundle was his? - A. Because I had seen him wear the jacket and leather breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person lodged in the room after the prisoner had gone away, and before Mrs. Kemp came? - A. Yes, a barber lodged there, he lodges at my house now, he is not here; he works upon Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. I do not know, only Thomas. (An officer was sent by the Court to fetch him).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Jones). How came the prisoner to quit your house? - A. I do not know; when he came first, he agreed upon a week's warning, but he went away without giving me any warning; there was another person lodged with me at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090006"/>time, and does still, of the name of White, a porter; the prisoner said, first, I did not see him with a bundle, and then afterwards, he said, I did see him with a bundle, he was going to carry to be washed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you say that from having counted them since? - A. Yes; but I knew there were either twelve or thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all of a size? - A. No, not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this silk ferret ever been used? - A. Yes, as a binding for my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. This mark you made, is a mark for the pocket? - A. Yes.(Jones produces a bundle, but the buttons on the gaiter did not correspond at all with them).</p>
               <p>The prisoner produced three buttons from his waistcoat and jacket, but they did not correspond.</p>

               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. The prisoner at the bar stands indicted for the wilful murder of a person of the name of Gabriel Franks. Gentlemen, this unfortunate man lost his life in consequence of a very outrageous riot which took place on the 16th of October last, late in the evening. Probably, Gentlemen, you most of you know, that there has been established at Wapping an office, called the Marine Police-office, in order to prevent those depre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090007"/>dations which have taken place on the River Thames, and for the purpose of bringing to justice persons who commit offences, particularly against the Act called the Bumboat Act. That office was, upon the 16th of October last, while the Magistrates were engaged there in business, I believe between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, attacked in a most violent manner by a very outrageons mob, throwing stones of a very large size, breaking windows and doors, and committing a considerable degree of outrage there, which made it absolutely necessary that they should be resisted. After some time, the mob being extremely great, a pistol was fired from the office, which occasioned their temporary dispersion, and then the Magistrates got out of the office, for the purpose of reading the Riot Act, to induce them finally to disperse. Gentlemen, the Riot Act was read, and while that was going on, one of the officers was slightly wounded. The discharge of pistols had occasioned the mob to retreat, and, I believe, for your perfect understanding of the subject, it will be necessary for me a little to describe to you the situation of the office, which is in a street probably known to you, Gentlemen, called Wapping High-street, that I understand is parallel to the River Thames; the office is on the side next the river; a little below the office, about twenty yards from the middle window, is a place on the same side of the street, which is called the <placeName id="t17990109-5-crimeloc26">Dung-wharf</placeName>

            , and also one of the rioters were killed. Gentlemen, I believe, according to the evidence which will be given to you, it will be found that Franks going towards the Dung-wharf, for the purpose of making observations upon the rioters, was, from the Dung-wharf, shot by some person; and, with respect to the prisoner, the charge against him consits of this not that any evidence can be offered to you that he discharged the pistol by which Franks was killed, but that he was an active man in the riot, encouraging and inciting it; and you will be told by the Court, that the law of this country is clearly this, that if you are engaged in one common purpose and design of a riotous and tumultuous nature, which must in all probability lead to consequences which may produce bodily harm to numbers of people, and perhaps to the death of some, all the persons who are engaged in such an undertaking, if death ensues, are guilty of the murder, because it is impossible, in cases of that description, to discover from whom very often the actual stroke of death comes; but if they are engaged in one common purpose, and that purpose of a nature which I think the witnesses will clearly shew you the object of the mob in this case was, and if one of the persons engaged in that purpose does kill a man, that that is murder, not only in the person who actually inflicted the wound of death, but upon all who are abetting, aiding, and assisting in the riot which produced the unfortunate circumstance, Gentlemen, I shall not trouble you with a detail of the particular circumstances; I shall only beg to call your attention to the situation of the spot, because it will be material for your rightly understanding the evidence that will be given to you. You will recollect, that the Marine Police-office is on the river side of the street, that the Dung-wharf is on the same side of the street, that it is about twenty yards below the office, that is, that it is about twenty yards from the centre window of the office; that that is an open spot leading down to the river, and consequently affording that sort of retreat to the mob which I have described, and that the evidence as it is stated to me, will prove to you decesively, that the shot by which Franks was killed came from the Dung-wharf. Gentlemen, unfortunately two persons have lost their lives in this outrageous riot; one of them was one of the rioters, who was killed shortly before the shot which killed Franks, the other was this unfortunate man Franks, who was shot in the manner that I have described. The witnesses will detail to you the circumstances; they will state to you what concern the prisoner Eyres had in the riot, where he was at the time this accident happened, what his situation was, how far he was a person aiding, encouraging, and abetting that riotous disturbance, which unfortunately produced the death of the man, for whose murder he now stands indicted.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the names of those people? - A. Charles Eyres, the brother of the prisoner, and another man; they were soon after convicted by the Magistrates of the misdemeanor; they were all adjudged to pay a penalty of forty shillings. After the conviction, other business was gone upon, part of the money was brought to me, and there was some objection to the payment of the money: about five minutes after that, I heard a great noise in the street, which kept increasing till it grew quite outrageous; Mr. Colquhoun then ordered the constable in waiting, Richard Perry, to go out with the other constables, to see what was the matter, and if it could not be otherwise quelled, to bring the rioters in. About five minutes after, they began to batter the outside shutters of the office windows, which were fastened; that continued with very great shouting, and vast uproar, till at last the violence became so excessive, that they destroyed the outside shutters, broke in the windows, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090008"/>the stones came into the office, large paving-stones; it was wholly impossible, during this violence, for the Magistrates to attempt to go out, it was unsafe; and after this had continued for a considerable time, I imagine from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, I heard a pistol fired from the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know who fired that pistol? - A. I did not see it fired. About five or ten minutes afterwards, the Magistrates were enabled to go out, though I thought attended with some danger, and they did go out, accompanied with their officers, and I heard the preamble of the Riot Act read by Mr. Colquhoun; just at that instant, he had hardly finished reading the Act, when Thomas Mitchell, and another of the Police-officers, came running up to me, and it appeared that his hand was wounded, his hand was then bleeding, and of my own knowledge I can say no more of it; then a requisition was sent to the Volunteer Association, to assist the Police.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what situation was Franks at that time? - A. A <rs id="t17990109-5-viclabel28" type="occupation">labourer, working on board ships</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Where Franks was at the beginning of the riot, you cannot possibly tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were the Magistrates out reading the Riot Act? - A. I suppose about two or three minutes; it was read in a very audible voice.</p>
               <p>Q.Franks was a lumper, was not he? - A. Yes, a foreman lumper.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a sworn constable? - A. No, but occasionally assisting at the office.</p>

I saw there was a riot going to be, and I shoved the door of the office to immediately: then there was another voice said, here goes for the forty; with that the fan-light of the door was instantly knocked all over me, I suppose with a stick, they could not have reached it without; I went into the Magistrate's room, and immediately the next light was beat, shutters and all, into the office, by large stones, I suppose twenty pounds weight, such stones as the streets were paved with; they then proceeded to the next light, that was beat in also with great stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the street quiet at this time? - A. No, there was crying and shouting, and a great noise, and saying they would have the b-y Police-office down; they then proceeded to the third window, and beat that in also, and a large stone came in, which took me over the shoulder, and passed Mr. Colquhoun, the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel yourself in danger at that time? - A. No doubt of it; I expected every man there would be murdered; I directly went and fired a pistol off out of the place where that large stone came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Thinking it right to take that means to disperse the mob? - A. Yes, or else I judge we should have been murdered; I then said to the Magistrates, for God's sake, Gentlemen, let us go out of doors; Mr. Colquhoun then went out, and read the Riot Act; the stones were flying about at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular happen to any person while he was reading the Riot Act? - A. The moment it was done, I heard Mitchell, one of the officers, cry out, Oh Lord! Oh Lord! I saw him put his hand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased, Franks? - A. Yes; he desired me to give him a cutlass; I did not give him one, but I believe he had one by some means; we proceeded then towards the rioters.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabout was it that you perceived the people who were engaged in the riot? - A. By the Dung-wharf, about twenty yards, or there away.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Dung-wharf on the same side of the way as the office, or the opposite side? - A. The same side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Lower down the river, or higher up towards the Tower? - A. Lower down the river; Franks and I walked ten yards, I suppose, looking at the mob, and then Frank's said, for God's sake, Perry, take care; he turned round, and, at that distance, I saw the flash of a pistol; I saw no more of Franks till I saw him at the Rose and Crown public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the pistol appear to be fired from the office, or any other quarter? - A. That pistol could not have been fired from the office, it was fired fronting to me, but it could not possibly come from the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any expressions made use of? - A. Yes, several horrid expressions, that they would kill all the people belonging to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear these sort of expressions more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090009"/>than once? - A. Yes, several times, shouting and huzzaing, and making a very loud noise indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Franks known to be employed by the office? - A. Yes, he had been employed by the office some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are an officer-what had you been before? - A. I have kept a public-house, I keep a shop now.</p>
               <p>Q.Probably the reason of that was, that your licence was taken away? - A. Yes, it was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon what ground? - A. It was stopped at the time when a great number of public-houses were stopped for having liquor-shops, and selling spirits, they were called gin-shops.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the only ground upon which it was stopped? - A. Yes; there were some other little circumstances, that a disorderly man was turned out, and he got away out of the office.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps there might be some other little thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not at all been said to you, I do not know with what propriety, that one of the shots from the office killed Franks? - A. I have not heard that said.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been charged with that at all? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols were fired from the office? - A. I cannot say, I believe there were more than one, two, or three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Franks was perfectly well after you had fired your pistol? - A. Yes, and was along with me.</p>

            , the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see him on the 16th of October? - A. At the Rose and Crown; while I was there, I heard there was a riot at the Police-office; Franks and I, and Mr. Webb, the landlord, went towards the office; when we got there, we found a great number of persons aslembled, breaking the windows with large stones; we went to a side door, and knocked; Perry came to the door, and said, he had orders not to let any body in; Franks said to me, let us go amongst the mob, and see if we cannot pick out some of them; we then went towards the mob; as soon as we had passed the windows, a pistol was fired from the office window, and shot one of the rioters; we then went a little farther together; the rioters took the dead man upon their shoulders, and carried him towards the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Franks and you do then? - A. There was one man particularly active, and Franks said, take notice of that man, while I go and get a cutlass; he then went towards the office, I remained opposite the Dung-wharf, on the other side of the street; about a minute after Franks had left me, I heard a pistol fired, and Franks cried out, that he was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. In what direction was that pistol fired? - A. It appeared to me to be towards the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Franks fall? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any particular expressions made use of? - A. I heard one man call out for arms; I think the words were, bring the arms, and let us shoot all the b-s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that expression before you heard the sound of the pistol? - A. Yes, Franks was with me at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the person, as far as you could judge of the man that Franks desired you to take notice of? - A. They were dressed a good deal alike, and it is impossible for me to recognize him; he was a tall man in a flannel jacket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not know all the officers of that office, and the persons belonging to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps a good many more of them for aught you can tell, were among the mob? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You know some of the officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Probably they had pistols? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no fire-arms among the mob? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The weapons they made use of were stones? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You could not distinctly hear the sound of the pistol, but it appeared to you to come from towards the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The Dung-wharf was between you and the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. What is the width of the street? - A. There is room for two coaches to pass.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see any of the officers interspersed among the mob? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Solicitor General. I keep the Rose and Crown public-house, Wapping, about thirty yards from the Police-office, or rather better: On the evening of the 16th of October, I was informed of the riot, I went out of doors, and saw a great mob in the street; they gave three huzzas, and began throwing great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090010"/>against the window shutters of the Police-office; and in the space of about two minutes, I heard a report of a pistol near the end of the alley that leads up to the Marine Police-office door.</p>
               <p>Q. The door is not in the street, but up an alley? - A. Yes. I then went just opposite the Marine Police-office, under a gateway, to one Mr. James's, and there I stood for a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that gateway lead to the Cooperage? - A. Yes. Then I saw a great many stones thrown against the windows, which were broke all to pieces; and I saw the flash of a pistol come through the hole that was broke in the Police-office window; I then heard there was a man shot dead; the mob still persisted in throwing stones against the window shutters; I went a little way below, and I saw a man close to me dead, apparently, on the ground; a tall man went into a shop and fetched a candle, and looked at the man, and he said to another of them, is that one of us; he said, yes; then says the other, get him on your back, which he did; I then went to a narrow passage just below the Dung-wharf, and while I stood there, I heard the report of another pistol apparently fired below the office, from where I was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the flash of that pistol? - A. I saw just the light of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgment from that, from whence it came? - A.No. As they were taking the dead man along upon their backs, I heard some of them say, d-n their eyes, we will go home and fetch some arms, and blow the office up; upon that I returned through the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them carrying this man before or after you saw the last pistol fired? - A. Before, about the space of a minute; I returned through the mob, and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said? - A. No more than that there was another man shot. I went home and found

             was taken up for a misdemeanor; I went with Newman and Mason, they were going to pay the fine; I had not been there long before Newman and Mason, and then Charles Eyres came out; the prisoner said to his brother, Charles, d-n your long eyes, have you paid the money? to which Charles said, yes, I have; he took his brother by the collar, and dragged him towards the door, and said, come along, and we will have the money back, or else we will have the house down; shortly after that, in a very short space of time, there was a man in a blue coat began breaking the windows over the Police-office door with a stick; then the people began huzzaing and making a great noise, and took up stones, and began hammering the window shutters with the stones in their hands till the windows broke by the jar of the window shutters; shortly after, I saw one of the window shutters broke open; I saw the prisoner at the bar throwing stones like pavement stones into the Police-office; by this time there were two or three of the windows broke open in the front of the street by the violence of the rioters; I had not been there above a minute before I heard the report of fire-arms, and saw the flash from the Police-office; shortly after the first fire, there was another fire out of the one pair of stairs window; then I heard an expression from one of the rioters, d-n my eyes, there is a man killed; I grew alarmed, and went immediately across the street under the wall, thinking perhaps I might be shot; I looked to my left hand, and saw a man lying dead in the street; I saw the prisoner at the bar holding him up, and another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar was one of the men who was holding up that man who had been killed? - A.

               <p>Q. You were known to the prisoner, and him to you, before? - A. Yes, we were intimate acquaintances; I said, yes, I was going home, it was the fittest place for him and me too, we had no business there; he said, if I went away he would knock my brains out with a stone, he had three or four stones under his arm; and he said, who will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090011"/>lay hold of my ammunition, meaning the stones, I believe, I did not see any other ammunition, says he, and I will help the man up, but who it was that carried the deceased away I cannot tell; I went away from the office then, as far as Execution-dock, which is but a short space.</p>

             then said to Anty, d-n your eyes you are the strongest, you take him up, and then they carried the body towards Execution-dock; then one of them said, here is Branham, d-n his eyes, we have got him dead at last; Branham was a waterman, and belongs to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it turn out to be Branham? - A No, Mr. Branham is alive; the mob cleared then a little, and I went to see Franks, the doctor had got hold of him, with his finger in his back.</p>
               <p>Q.Probing the wound? - A. Yes; I lent my husband a penknife to cut his clothes off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Which was killed first, the rioter or Franks? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any exclamation that a man was killed before you heard that Franks was killed? - A. No; there was no man killed before Franks was shot.</p>

               <p>Q. That you are certain of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of seeing, and therefore you must know whether any man was killed before Franks was shot? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090012"/>Q.Have you never said, that in your opinion, the same shot killed both Franks and the rioter? - A. I may have said so, I dare say I did; I saw them both dead at one time, and I heard but one pistol fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state to the Justice, that it appeared to you, that they were both killed by one shot? - A. I dare say I did, and I think so now; I saw but one pistol; I am sure Franks was shot by that pistol, and I heard but one pistol fired, when I saw them both lie dead, and that was fired from the office.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a dark night, was it not? - A. It was not a light night, but the lamps were lit; and when they broke the Police-office in, there was light enough came from there.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard somebody say, here is Branham dead? - A. I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you are more likely to remember things now than a week after the transaction happened? - A. No, I dare say I remembered better, I might not tell the Justice that, I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many informations have you laid before the Magistrates? - A. None, nor I never was before a Magistrate before.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. I am surgeon to the London Hospital; the deceased was brought to that hospital, and committed to my care on the night of the riot; I examined him, and found a wound on the right side of the breast; he was sinking very fast from internal bleeding, he was suffocating the blood leading to the lungs; he seemed in a dangerous situation to move him, and therefore I made no enquiry into the wound in his back; it appeared that his existence was likely to be very short; Mr. Headington, my brother surgeon, examined the body after his death, and he can speak particularly as to his situation.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live? - A. I sent to Mr. Williams, the Magistrate, to receive an account from this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Franks, the deceased, appear to be sensible of his own danger? - A. He did, and he particularly became much worse after I sent for Mr. Williams; however, he was collected, and capable of speaking, and I thought it my duty to take his declaration, having the honour to be a Magistrate for the Hamlets of the Tower.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed certain that his death was approaching? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was he at that time in a state of certainty that he was about to die? - A. I had no doubt of the event.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in a state of certainty of death? - A. I inferred it from him; when I mentioned to him taking his declaration, he said, oh, then I have but a little time to live; to which I made no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live afterwards? - A. Several days, much longer than I thought he would; Mr. Williams came just after I had taken the declaration of the deceased; I delivered the declaration to Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>R. WILLIAMS, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. I received the paper of Mr. Blizard, which I sent the next morning to Mr. Colquhoun, enclosed in a letter; I never saw it after.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Blizard.) Did you ever see it afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- HERIOT, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. I received the deposition of Franks, and when the Coroner sent for that deposition, I took a copy of it, and sent it to the Coroner, Mr. Walter; I kept a copy of it myself.</p>

               <p>MAJOR WALTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. I am clerk to my father; I was with him when he sat as Coroner upon the Inquest in this case; I received from him the original paper, purporting to be the declaration of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the original paper? - A. No, this is a copy that I myself made: I saw the original at my father's, with the other depositions, all of which I afterwards brought here, and left at Mr. Shelton's office; I am certain that was among the other papers; the copy was left at the same time with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. I am looking over this bundle; the informations and depositions that are returned every Sessions, are put up in a bundle like this.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And can you say, that you have no others in your office? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. Here is the calendar of the papers that were returned, and the number in the calendar corresponds exactly with the number that are here now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you inspected your papers and books, to see whether the original deposition or declaration of the deceased is there? - A. I have, and it is not amongst them.</p>
               <p>Mr. HEADINGTON sworn. - I examined the body after death.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wound did you find? - A. A small wound near the back bone, which passed through the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. By what was that wound given? - A. It is impossible for me to say, it was a ball to all appearance; I should imagine there were two balls, one came out between the third, and the other the fourth rib.</p>
               <p>Q. And were those wounds the cause of his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090013"/>death? - A.They were; the ball entered between the shoulders, near the back bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Rather lower in the belly than behind? - A. No, rather higher.(

            , Prisoner at the bar. You have been charged with the horrid and heinous crime of murder; by your plea you have denied the charge; the Jury, after a very patient and attentive hearing of your case, and of every circumstance which the humanity of a very learned Judge, and the ingenuity of an experienced and an able Advocate* could bring forward in your behalf, have found themselves bound by a duty which they owe to themselves, and which they likewise owe, in a case like the present, to the safety of the country, to pronounce you guilty.</p>
               <p>*Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>My task is a very painful one indeed, when it compels me to deliver to a fellow creature the most dreadful intelligence that can, perhaps, reach the ears of an individual, that his doom is fixed, and that an almost immediate separation of soul and body, is the necessary and inevitable consequence of a very profligate act of wickedness. - The very learned Judges, who preside over this tribunal, are satisfied with the verdict of the Jury; you must, therefore, immediately prepare to die for the great crime that you have committed. You have, prisoner, in breach of the peace, and in open violation of the laws of the land, in the pursuit of a very wicked purpose, namely, the demolition of the house in which the Magistrates administered the justice of the country, and the destruction of the Magistrates themselves, and that too after a very formal and legal notice to the party; you have been, I say, the wicked occasion of the loss to society of an innocent individual - I say the wicked occasion of the loss, because all persons who take an active part in a riot are answerable, by the sound policy of our law, for all the dreadful consequences which are most likely, and most unfortunately for you, in the late tumult and outrage, have ensued. Prisoner, - In a state of society, nothing promotes the real and solid happiness of the people so much as wholesome laws, and an uninterrupted administration of them; - the Magistrates, therefore, who are called into that often painful, but always very honourable service, must, of necessity, find protection against the outrages of the wicked and the profligate; they must find, I say, that protection in the strong arm, and the just vengeance of the law; a law which, I may truly say, is executed in this country in great mercy to individual delinquents, when mercy to individuals does not become cruelty to the public. My duty calls upon me, therefore, however painful the task may be, to declare, that in a case like the present, mercy to spare your life, would be to want mercy for the people at large, and to neglect the dearest interests of society. Prisoner, - As to your happiness, therefore, in the world to come, your crime seems to be so very malignant, that the limited understanding of man can scarce feel it to be within the reach of mercy; the religion, however, which we prosess, teaches us, that there are no bounds to the mercies of the Father of all mercies! - It may be, therefore, some consolation for you to learn, that your sufferings of body, and of mind, at the time of your execution; and the infamy and disgrace attached to a public exposition of your body after death, may, in the end, be found the means of expiating your crime, provided you apply at the Throne of Mercy for forgiveness with a contrite heart, full confession, and sincere repentance. I now pray God that your sad example may teach others to pause, to consider well before they engage in any illegal act of violence, which, tending to the destruction of the lives and properties of others, may, before they are at all sensible of their own danger, seal their own destruction, and their own final doom.</p>
               <p>I pass now to the sentence which the law pronounces against all offenders of your description; I do award, and this Court doth adjudge, that you,

               <p>Q. Which said that? - A. They both spoke; I said they might if they pleased; they said they would search my pockets, and have my money; the shortest came up and stood foremost, and the other man stood with a pistol behind him; he then presented the pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they first pull out the pistol? - A. I saw it when they turned round, before they spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say they might have your money? - A.Because I was frit at them; they took three shillings out of my breeches pocket, and asked me for my watch, and one of them put his hand inside my breeches, but I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see them? - A. Last Monday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How light was it at this time? - A. I saw them, I suppose, forty yards before I came to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the men? - A. I am certain sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the man from you that had the pistol? - A. About the space of two yards, I don't think it was more.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man who stood with the pistol is one of the men at the bar? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What length of time might have elapsed between the time of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090015"/>robbery and the time they were apprehended? - A. About ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. It was half after four, or near five o'clock? - A. It was about half past four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before you went into the office, that you could not undertake to swear to these men? - A. No; I said as soon as I went in, that if they were the men I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Heston, about twelve miles from town.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you knew they were in custody? - A. The constable came to me, and I told him I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, the man who had the pistol was about two yards distance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you saw the pistol before the man's hand was in your pocket? - A. Yes, as soon as I turned round, I saw it. I had twenty-three shillings in my pocket, and I had just before parted my money, and put the rest in my coat pocket; I was going a journey, but that having happened, I went into a public-house, and they advised me to go back to my master's, and see if I could find the men, and I went back.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. It was dark by that time? - A. Yes. At the door of the Bell public-house, at Bedsont, I observed two men on horseback; we proceeded on towards Staines turnpike, which is at the end of Bedsont-lane; about ten minutes afterwards, just as we got to the lane end that goes up to Stanwell, they came up to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a glass behind your chaise? - A. Yes; and Dowsett kept looking through the glass all the way we came, after having seen these two men, they both came up to the chaise on the near side, I sat on the near side, Jones in the middle, and Dowsett on the off side; they both rode past the chaise, and one of them went up to the boy and held up his hand in this kind of way, (describing it); and said, d-n your eyes, your b-r, stop; and the other having gone past, was obliged to turn his horse back to come to my window, he tapped at the window with the barrel of his pistol, which I could see very plainly, and said, d-n your eyes, you b-r, give me your money; I told them not to use us ill, and I would; then the man at the horses' heads said, d-n your eyes, Jack, give it to them -</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's name is John? - A. Yes. And he fired that instant through the side glass, as I was pulling it down with my left hand -</p>
               <p>Q.Which of the men was it that fired? - A. The man who was at my side, and demanded my money; we found, when we got to Bedfont, that the ball had gone out at the opposite frame; I then fired at him, and said to my brother officer, so that he could hear me, I am certain that I have hit him; then the man at the head of the horses fired at the front of the chaise, and if I had not been stooping, had I been sitting upright, the bullet must have hit me; I was going to get out, and the man at the horses' heads says, holloa, Jack, d-n your eyes, are you hurt, if you are not, come this way; then Jones fired immediately, and the man at the horses' heads rode off; I got out of the chaise, and went back in pursuit of the other, but could not find him; it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of observing the horse? - A. I had, from the flash of both pistols, both his and mine; the horse's head being close to the glass, I could see that it was a dark brown horse, I could see perfectly the colour of the front part of the horse, but could not see the man's face, he had a kind of a rough shag brown bath coat on; the horse appeared to be between thirteen and fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about his head? - A. No, I did not observe any white about his head, it was the smallest horse of the two.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen that horse since? - A. Yes, I have, at Mr. Kendall's stables, in Long-acre, and at Bow-street likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak positively to that being the horse which the man rode? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was dark, you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only observation you made upon this horse, was from the flash of the pistols, during the short time which this transaction occupied? - A. And being so close to the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell us, that, by the flash of a pistol in a dark night, you can positively swear to the colour of a horse? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not even know whether there was any white about the horse's head? - A. I did not observe that there was, I took no particular notice of the horse, but its being a remarkable small brown horse; I knew him among a dozen others while he was standing in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you undertake to swear now to the height of the horse? - A. I took it to be between thirteen and fourteen hands high.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of seeing the legs of the horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, in a dark night, you will undertake to swear to the horse? - A. I am certain to the horse, and nobody shall persuade me off of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse that you have seen since has a great deal of white in the face? - A.Very little; I believe there is a little bit of a white spot.</p>
               <p>Q.You were shewn a horse, for the purpose of judging whether that was the horse you saw upon that occasion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And cannot you now recollect, whether that horse had any white in his face, or not? - A. It was never shewn to me in particular to judge; it was shewn to the other and the post-boy.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090018"/>Q. Has he any white in his face? - A. I do not think that he has, I did not perceive any white at all about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him in the stable? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he has no white in his face? - A. I believe he has none, there may be a white hair or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the colour of the horse? - A. A dark brown horse.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you say now whether he has any white legs or not? - A. He has not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. By the flash of the pistols, you not only had an opportunity of seeing the size and colour of the horse, but his shape? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you singled the horse out afterwards, without being shewn to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If there were many other brown horses, could you have picked him out? - A. Yes, if he had been among fifty horses in a field I could have picked him out; he was a remarkable square-built little horse.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a conductor of the patrole; I was with the last witness and Dowsett in the chaise, at Bedsont, I sat in the middle, I did not see the men till they came up to the chaise; one of them went to the horse's heads, and said, holloa, stop, you b-r, stop; then the other man came to the chaise door, and tapped at the window, but whether he had a pistol or not, I did not see, I was looking after the man at the head of the horses; the man at the window demanded our money; we told them we would give it them directly; the man at the horses' heads then holloaed out, d-n your eyes, Jack, give it them directly: he had no sooner said that, than the man at the door fired through the window; Edwards immediately fired at him, and I still kept looking at the man at the horses' heads, expecting he would fire; Edwards had no sooner fired his pistol from the chaise, than the man at the horses' heads immediately fired at the front of the chaise; the ball that came from the horses' heads went through the glass, and cut the side of my face: I could then see him pull his left hand rein, and he went off; we then jumped out of the chaise; I heard Edwards cry out, I have hit him; we could not find the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing the horses? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were in the middle, you say, and of course more forwards in the chaise than the other two officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you do not venture to swear to the horse at all? - A. No, my eye was kept upon the man at the from of the chaise.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOWSETT sworn. - I was with the two last witnesses: I looked through the glass behind, in consequence of having seen two men on horseback, I kept looking back for a mile and a half, and they did not come; just as we had got to the lane that turns up to Stanwell, they came up; I immediately said, here they are, be upon your guard, expecting one to come on each side, but they both came on the near side, I sat on the off side; they both rode past the chaise, the one on the mare, the tallest horse, rode against the post-boy, swinging a pistol round his head, and swore, stop you b-r, stop, and came against the boy with so much violence as almost to knock him over the off horse; the other man then turned his horse towards the chaise, and came to the door with a pistol, tapped against the glass, and demanded our money; Edwards said, do not be in a burry, or something of that sort; he put his hand to the window to let it down, when the man at the horses' heads said, d-n you, Jack, give it them directly; he then fired, and the ball went through the chaise, and out at my side; from the flash of the pistol I could see the horse's head and pummel of the saddle, and the man's flap of his coat; it was a close-bodied short-necked horse, and tight made; a brown bay, you may properly call it, I believe, it was a singular kind of horse; and I am very positive that the horse I have since seen is the same horse; the horse was upon the prance all the time, he did not stand still at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a brown bay? - A. A dark brown; I suppose he was between thirteen and fourteen hands high, it was considerably smaller than the other; Edwards immediately fired at the man, and said, I am sure I have hit him; and immediately the man at the horses' heads fired into the chaise; Jones returned the fire, which I blamed him for, for the other man was coming round, as I thought, to my side of the chaise, but upon Jones firing, he called out to the other man, d-n you, Jack, are you hurt, if you are not come along this way; and then turned his horse and went off; I got out of the chaise, took out the saddle-horse of the chaise, and pursued, but could not overtake him; I went the next day to No. 59, Gee-street, Goswell-street, where I found the prisoner at the bar, and Mrs. Barrington was in the room with him; he was lying in bed upon his back, and seemed to be very ill; I then went for Mr. Andrews, the surgeon, to see if he was sit to be removed; and, in consequence of that, he was removed to Carpmeal's house, in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the matter with him? - A. He was shot, as I understand, I did not see his face that night, or else I should have known it, I know him very well; I saw the horse at the Red-lion, at Hounslow, it was a remarkable horse, and I have not a doubt but it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090019"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was the horse you found at Hounslow a dark brown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any white about it? - A. There may be a grey hair or two in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. For any thing you saw, all his legs might have been white? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. And the hind quarters might be white? - A. No; I saw the hind quarters as he turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will pretend to swear to this horse? - A. I have no doubt about it; I flatter myself I know so much of horses I cannot well be mistaken.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a labourer at the India-house: On Thursday the 8th of November, I saw the prisoner at the Mogul's head, in Drury-lane, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon. I lodge in the same house; there was one Clarke, and Bottom a currier, there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known Clarke any time? - A. I have seen him twice before; Haines said, I was the only person he wanted to see, that he wanted me to get him a horse for to-morrow; I then told him the only person I knew that was likely to got him one was Thomas Coles; he then appointed that I should meet him the next day, at the Green Man and Still, in Cow-cross; I met him there the next day, and there was Clarke with him; I went from there to Coles's, and Coles was not at home; then I went from there to Mr. Brown's livery stables, in Clipstone-street, Mary-le-bonne; I left them at a public-house the corner of Fitzroy-square, I was to call for them if I got the horse; I got the horse and called upon them; Haines desired me to ride through the town, and I rode him to the corner of a street in Piccadilly, I do not know what street; when I got to Piccadilly, I delivered the horse to the prisoner, Clarke was then with him on foot; he told me he was going to Crcydon, and he should return that night, about nine o'clock, I never saw him after that till Monday morning; I made inquiry, and found Clarke near the Elephant and Castle, in St. George's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, by any means, from Clarke's information, find Haines? - A. Yes; there was a person with Clarke who went with me for the purpose of shewing me the prisoner, to No. 1, Union-square, Islington, there I found Haines in bed; I asked him how he did; and he said, he was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what was the matter with him? - A. Soon after the doctor came in, and Clarke with him, and they helped him up in bed, and the doctor examined his wounds; and during that time, Haines said, he was certain it was the Bow-street officers that had shot him, for the glasses were all up, and the door opened a different way from what they in general do; he then said, that after they had fired, they got out of the chaise, and that he afterwards had a great way to come to the public-house, and that, from the loss of blood, he had a hard matter to get there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where it happened? - A. He said it was about four or five miles from the public-house that he came to.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did he say that was? - A. The Nag's-head, at Hounslow; and the landlord there got him a chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity to observe what sort of a horse it was? - A. A dark bay horse, or at least a dark brown horse, it had no particular mark upon it; it was a very remarkable horse, tight made, short necked, and very active.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse that was produced at Bow-street? - A. Yes; that was the very same horse that I had of Mr. Brown for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you a labourer in the India-house now? - A. No, I have been in confinement lately.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it then that you have ceased to be a labourer in the India-house? - A. I have not been there since I was taken into custody for getting the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What jail have you been in? - A. In the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon this business was it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You came from there now, do not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were afraid to trust you out? - A. If I had tried for bail I might have had it.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the horse was hired for yourself, or for the prisoner, we are to learn from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you go about this horse? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been honestly employed at that time, you would have been at the India-house? - A. I sometimes employ myself in buying and selling horses.</p>
               <p>Q. But at this time you neither went to buy nor sell a horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown then trusted you with the horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown did not see where you took him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I am afraid I must not ask you if you went on this horse with him? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did ride it as far as Piccadilly, at least? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a great coat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As persons would have that were going out of town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would think it impertinent in me if I asked you if you had pistols in your pocket? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that, are you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090020"/>Q.Not in your pocket, how far off were they? - </p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that, it is an improper question; it does not bear upon the point before the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you at all go to the India-house on Friday? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you been a labourer there since that Friday? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how came you to tell us you were a labourer in the India-house? - A. I have been there for three years.</p>
               <p>Q.Then on the Friday and the Saturday you absented yourself? - A. Yes, I was employed in seeing after the horse; I got into trouble about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what trade the prisoner is? - A. Yes, a currier.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMMOND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I keep the Nag's-head-inn, at Hounslow: On Friday, the 9th of November, the prisoner at the bar, and another man, named Clarke, came to my house; Clarke's horse had stood at livery at my house I think seven nights.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a horse or a mare? - A. I do not know, I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner come? - A. On horseback, but I did not see him come; I think I saw them both a little before supper, about eight or nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Haines? - A. Not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time they got up next morning? - A. I cannot tell; they had breakfast after they got up; I know that was about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did they quit your house? - A. I did not see them after that, I never saw them to change a word with them, I only served them with what they wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they go away? - A. On horses, I take it, I do not know, the ostler can tell you; I do not go into the stables once in a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see the prisoner again? - A. I saw him about nine at night, that same Saturday night, about nine o'clock, he walked into the fore parlour, and called for sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and then he sat down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether, after that, he changed his seat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular after that? - A. No, he called for a bason of water to wash his hands, the servant girl brought it to him; he asked me if I could get a chaise for him; I sent my little boy for a chaise, and while he was gone, he said, he had been sayed, or shot, in Belsont-lane, but could not tell by whom; then he called for another sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and when the chaise came up, he desired me to ask what the chaise came to to Smithfield; I asked the ostler, he told me fifteen shillings and sixpence, and he paid the boy for the chaise, and gave him two shillings and sixpence for himself, and sixpence for turnpikes; the chaise came up to the door, and he told the ostler to drive the chaise close to the door, for he was rather lame, he said, he would walk to the chaise, and as he was going to the chaise, I saw the back of his coat dirty, I saw no more of him after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem well or ill? - A. He did not seem ill to me in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went, did he deliver any thing to you? - A. Yes, a pair of pistols, a pair of spatter-dashes, and a pair of spurs; he told me to take care of them for him; my girl held the candle for him to go into the chaise, and I stood quite in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to her? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at any of the chairs he had sat upon in the front parlour? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>SARAH MORRIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am servant to Mr. Hammond.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Haines and Clarke coming to your house, and supping there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Haines dressed? - A. In a striped waistcoat and corderoy breeches, with a close buttoned coat, a white neck handkerchief round his neck, and a silk one over it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any great coat? - A. He had one on his arm, and laid it down, it was a brown rough great coat; when Haines came in, Clarke seemed very fond of him, and said he had not seen him for a great while, and was glad to see him, and he agreed to come there, and have something; they talked so while I was laying the cloth; Haines said, he was going to London as soon as he had supped, for he had very particular business, and must go to market, and when I went to clear the cloth, Clarke said, this gentleman sleeps here to-night; I lit Clarke to bed, and then I lit Haines to bed; Haines desired me to call him at five, for he had some particular business to do at market; he had a blue apron on, which he untied while I was in the bed-room with him, and I thought he was a market, gardner; they got up again about eleven o'clock, they had their breakfast; Haines said, he was going to market, and the other said, he was going a different road; I saw Haines mount his horse, but I did not take notice where Clarke went to, and, about nine o'clock on Saturday evening, I saw Haines there again, and he desired a chaise to be got to go to town; he said, he had been sigged; my master sent for a chaise; he seemed to me very uneasy, and put his hand to his back; I did not take notice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090021"/>of it to any body, because I thought it did not concern me; I saw him go away; I offered to light him, and he told me he did not want any candle, I need not trouble myself; I then saw that his coat was very dirty; I went to clean the room, and found the chairs that he had been sitting on were very muddy, I was obliged to take a wet cloth; he had sat in two chairs, he had moved from the chair he first sat in, and sat behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt about the prisoner being the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps knew Clarke before? - A. Yes, I knew him when I lived in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him often at Hounslow? - A.Never before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was Clarke, when you first knew him? - A. I never knew him further than seeing him come into the room; one called himself a market gardener, and the other said, he kept a public-house in London.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Hommond). Q. I think you said, Haines returned about nine in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any horse run out of your yard soon after that? - A. Yes, I heard a horse go out of the yard directly after, but we have a great many horses in our yard.</p>

             sworn. - I am a post-boy: A chaise was sent for to the Nag's-head, at Hounslow, a little better than half after nine in the evening, Hammond told me, to go to Smithfield; I took up some man that I did not know, I went to the Windsor-castle, at Hammersmith, and there the man in the chaise told me to stop and take some refreshment; he called for a glass of brandy and water, I drank after he had drank, and the landlord had drank; then he got out of the chaise, and went into the back room, and I went into the taproom, and he ordered me another sixpenny worth of brandy and water; I had been there about five minutes, when another man came in, and asked, if I was going to town; I told him, I could not take him without leave of the gentlemen that I had brought with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - A. Yes; and he gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You proceeded to town with these two persons? - A. Yes; and the man that got into the chaise last, when I got between Kensington and town, told me to stop at the first house that was open; I told him, there would be none till I got to Piccadilly; when I got to Hyde-park-corner, the same man put the glasses down, and told me to go very softly over the stones to Westminster; when I got to Westminster, he told me to stop, and he got out of the chaise, and went to a public-house, and called for another sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and called another man out.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that got in first, had not spoke to you? - A. No. Then he took some brandy and water to the man in the chaise, but I do not believe he drank any, for I brought the glass back. Then he told me, he wanted to get some assistance for that gentleman, for he had a fall from his horse, and dislocated his collar bone; he then told me to go on to the Obelisk, in St. George's-fields, and I sat him down near the Elephant and Castle. While I was waiting for the other man to come from the public house, the first man seemed to be in a great deal of pain; he groaned once or twice, as if he was in pain, and put up the glasses; by that time, the other man had come back, and said, my man, we do not want you any further, I will get the gentleman some assistance, and take him home in a backney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that near the Obelisk? - A. Yes, within about one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a coat had he on, do you know? - A. It appeared very dirty, and appeared such a coat as I have got on, a rough coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Just before you got home to Hounslow, what did you observe? - A. A Little brown horse loose in the road, he followed me, sometimes behind, and sometimes by the side of my horses; I put him in the stable, and gave him some corn, it was about four o'clock in the morning, I did not take his faddle off, I observed that one girth was broke; I went into the stable about ten the next morning, and saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What size is he? - A. About fourteen hands and an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing further about the faddle? - A. Not till the officer came; I observed, that upon the near side of the faddle, there was some blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any white marks about him? - A. No, only under the faddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there about the head? - A. I do not believe there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shape was he? - A. A tight made little horse, very active, and full tailed, and a shortish neck.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You took no particular notice of the head? - A. Not particularly.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090022"/>Q. Do you know the man that brought him there? - A. I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that was there with Harris, on the Monday? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Harris, you say, then, came and saw him on the Monday? - A. He went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at any conversation? - A. No; Mrs. Barrington was without a lodging, and had been there several days; the two men asked for her, she was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. After Harris had been him on the Monday, how long did he continue there? - A. About four o'clock the same afternoon, another man took him away; Mrs. Barrington did not go away till after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where they went? - A. No; I saw him again on the Wednesday following, at No. 59, Gee-street, Goswell-street; I went there to take some things for Mrs. Barrington, he was sick in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did these men go away the next morning? - A.Clarke rode the mare, and the other man rode the little brown horse.</p>

               <p>JOHN TOWNSEND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. On Thursday, the 15th of November, I went from Bow-street, in company with Harris, and some of my brother officers, at his request, to Union-square, Islington, in order to apprehend the prisoner at the bar; we came there, and found nobody at home; we broke the door open, but found nobody in the house at all; upon enquiry among the neighbours, we found they were gone; we then left Harris at the House of Correction, and appointed next morning to go St. George's-fields after Clarke, and, in consequence of enquiries after him, we learned that Haines was gone to No. 59, Gee-street, Goswell-street, where we found the prisoner, in company with Mrs. Barrington, up one pair of stairs, he was in bed, on his back; we thought it was not right for us to attempt to move him, finding him in so dreadful a situation; Dowsett went for surgeon Andrews, who examined him, and, by his directions, we removed him to Carpmeal's house till he was sit to be examined, and from thence he was committed to prison.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a surgeon: On the 16th or 17th of November, I went to Gee-street, Goswell-street, to examine the prisoner; I found that he was wounded in the left shoulder; he was extremely weak, apparently from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you conceive to have been the cause of that loss of blood? - A. Apparently from balls; one ball had certainly gone through him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a ball do you suppose that to have been? - A. A large pistol ball: he was then removed to Carpmeal's, and some days afterwards I extracted a ball from his shoulder. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Edwards). Have you got the pistol here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the balls that you put into that pistol? - A. Yes, (produces some); I had put four of these balls and one large one into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ball which Mr. Andrews has produced? - A. This is exactly the same kind of ball, so much so, that if it was put with the rest, I could not pick it out.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Andrews). Do you believe there are any balls within him now? - A. I believe there are.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been a considerable issue of blood, from whence did that blood proceed? - A. I did not see him for a week after, but I should suppose from the fore part of the shoulder; one ball passed through, and therefore it might bleed on both sides, between the body and the point of the shoulder</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Edwards). Q. That is a great deal less than the bore of your pistol? - A. Yes, I only put in four of these to assist the other large one, in case of any thing happening.</p>
               <p>Dowsett. A great coat was found in Haines's lodgings, which we did not take away, because he had it round him; it was very dirty, the dirt had not been rubbed off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What Harris has said is entirely false.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you chuse to give any account how you came by your wound-you may use your own discretion?</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no answer.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN HERRING sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. George Seddon the elder, Thomas Seddon, and George Seddon the younger; the prisoner was <rs id="t17990109-12-deflabel76" type="occupation">employed in the feather garret</rs>

               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner? - A. In consequence of a note being dropped in the feather-shop, which said upon it, "Sir, search Giles:" it was picked up by William Marchant, and we agreed to stop him when he left work at eight o'clock; I followed him out of the premises, and called him back; I then called Mr. Thomas Seddon, and he interrogated him whether he had at any time taken property from the premises, and he said he had not; he then asked him if he had any property about him at that time, upon which he said, he had not; Mr. Seddon then told me to feel in his pockets, which I did; I found in one pocket some wood, and in the other feathers, in the half of a pillow, they were delivered to the constable; he then went upon his knees, and said, it was the first time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARCHANT sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Seddons; I found a note at the accompting-house door, (producing it); I took it into the accompting-house, and gave it to one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>JAMES RIDGWAY sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Seddons; I received the note from the last witness; I consulted Mr. Seddon upon it, and, by my direction, he was stopped as he was going out; in short, he had got almost off the premises before we knew of it, for he went before the bell had done going, and I sent the first witness after him; I was present when he was searched, and the feathers taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear they are the prosecutor's feathers? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>ANDREW ANDERSON Sworn. - I work for Messrs. Seddons; about two days before he was taken, I saw that the prisoner had a bundle, but I do not know what it contained, I wrote the note.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES sworn. - I work in the feather-garret for Messrs. Seddons; I saw a parcel of feathers in the prisoner's pocket as his coat hung up in the room, a day or two before he was taken; I told Anderson of it, and he said, it was sitting the master should know of it, and he wrote the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I own the feathers were in my pocket, but I do not know how they came there; I believe it was a spite that

             sworn. - The prisoner is my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the things to pawn? - A. I took them myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your mother know of your taking them? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to take them? - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave her the money, what did she say? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Tell the truth, though I am your mother; I gave them the child.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very much to the credit of the prisoner, rather than the child should go on to perjure herself, as she has done, she confesses it.</p>

               <p>(The case was opened by Mr. Minshull).</p>
               <p>THEODORE-HENRY BROADHEAD Esq. sworn. The prisoner came into my service on the 4th of December last, and continued there till Friday the 10th; about a quarter after five in the evening he was missing; I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment the next day; the clothes were afterwards brought to me, and I knew them again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you not a character with me from a gentleman at Hammersmith? - A. No, I had not; I wrote to a Mr. Rowley, the gentleman with whom he told me had lived at Huntingdon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in fact you received him into your house without a character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DURRANT sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Broadhead. About five weeks back Mr. Broadhead lost three livery coats, three red kerseymere waistcoats, a pair of black plush breeches, two gold buttons of round hats, and a great coat; I missed them about five in the afternoon, and the prisoner was missing at the same time, that was on the Friday; I had called to him several times to bring up the dinner, but he was not to be found; he was detained on the Wednesday after at a public-house.</p>
               <p>MARY DICKIE sworn. - On a Monday night the prisoner came to my shop, I was in the parlour; I went into the shop, and my servant was looking over some livery clothes; he said, they were his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090025"/>own, he had them to sell; I said, how came you to have three suits of livery at once; he said, he had been in a good place, and he did not want money, but now he had left his place; he said, he was going to another to-morrow; I offered him two guineas; he said, he would not take any such money; he took them upon his arm, and went out of the shop; he was not gone long, before he came back again; he allowed them for fifty shillings; I told him I would give him no more than the two guineas, it was the full value of them; then he went away with them again up the street, and returned again, and said, I might have them; I gave him a guinea, a twenty-shilling note, and one shilling.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOWSETT sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the property): I received them at Bow-street, from Mrs. Dickie.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dickie. These are the same clothes, there is the crest on the buttons; this was on Monday, the 10th: on Wednesday, the 12th, there were hand-bills given about, and my man told me, that these livery clothes were stolen; I was very much flurried, and I asked advice; I was advised to send to Mr. Broadhead, and let him know; I acquainted him with it, and he desired I would meet him at Bow-street at seven o'clock, which I did, I took the clothes with me.</p>
               <p>Durrant. These are the same clothes, I know them by the button, I should know them otherwise; I was going to look him out a suit that day to put on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Broadhead. I know them to be mine; they have my crest upon every button.</p>

The next day, about half past ten, I went up to Mr. Choppin's house, to know whether they pleased to come forward; Mr. Choppin was out of town; I took charge of the young woman, Mary Simpson; I went up stairs, and searched a caravan box, which she said was her's; there was another trunk in the room, she said, that did not belong to her; the first thing in that trunk was a chintz gown belonging to her mistress; she said, she had taken it from a closet below: Mrs. Choppin then went down stairs to look if there was any thing gone; there was a paper box up-side down, and Mrs. Choppin said, the child-bed linen was gone; in searching one of the drawers in the pantry, there were some things found packed up, and her mistress asked if she knew any thing of them, and she said, no, they belonged to the house-maid, and then I asked Bevan, and she owned to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it was better for her to confess? - A. No; in her chest up stairs, I found some napkins and some table-cloths.</p>
               <p>Court. They are laid to be a joint taking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man told you he had these things from a servant of Mr. Choppin's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And he told you he was going to Yarmouth with them? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to my Lord Essex; the day after Christmas-day a fire happened at my Lord Essex's house: as soon as my Lord and Lady had got out of the house, I thought it necessary to secure the plate in the dining-room; the moment I came back from my Lord Macartney's, where I had conducted my Lord and and Lady to, I found about a dozen or fourteen people in the dining-room; I ordered them all to withdraw, the prisoner was one of them; three or four of them were very unwilling to go; I desired them to go by fair means, otherwise I should use force; they all went out, and I locked the door immediately, and put the key in my pocket; I then went to my Lord's dressing-room for some writings, and, in about two minutes, I returned to the dining-room door, which I found burst open; I entered the room, and saw the prisoner putting spoons in his pocket; there were six or seven more people in the room with him; he took them from the plates that were upon the table in the dining-room; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090027"/>went towards him, but the other people crouded me so, that he made his escape out at the door; I thought he had been gone through the porter's hall; I went to look for him, but could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to him at the time you saw him taking the spoons? - A. No; I returned and saw him in the room adjoining the dining-room, that we call the drawing-room; he was there handling something at my Lady's writing-desk; I caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had in his pocket; he said, nothing, but his own; I told him I should search him; he told me, I should not; by force I searched him, and took four spoons out of his coat pocket; I took the spoons in one hand, and him in the other, and delivered the spoons up to General St. John, who was at the door; I delivered the prisoner up to two people that I knew, who took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have learned since who this man is, have not you, that he is a hair-dresser, in Wells-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do not you know he was acquainted with some of the servants in Lord Essex's family? - A. He was not, nor I never saw his face till that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Lord Shrewsbury's family? - A. Only the butler, by sight.</p>
               <p>Q.They live in the same street? - A. No, in Stanhope-street, which is close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know he has met with Lord Effex's servants frequently in Lord Shrewsbury's family? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.You are not a livery-servant? - A. Yes, I am, but my livery coat was so bad, that I could not put it on; I was in livery at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he was taking care of them for the family? - A. He did not say any any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you happen to know whether he actually secured any articles for the family? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man had got completely out of your sight, and might have got out of the house? - A. Yes, he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the publican who lives over the way, that day? - A.No.</p>
               <p>General St. JOHN sworn. - I was at my Lord Effex's on the day when this misfortune happened, I was standing before the house soon after the fire; I saw the last witness, with several other people, bringing in a man that seemed to be in custody; Alsbury desired the favour of me to take these spoons into my possession, which he said he had taken from a man who was then in custody; I cannot say whether that man was the prisoner or not; I have had these spoons ever since, (produces them); I know these table-spoons to be my Lord Essex's, there are the coronet and arms upon them; the other two spoons have my Lady Essex's initials upon them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Alsbury. I believe he was in liquor at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is the public-house from Lord Essex's? - A. About one hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body run out? - A. I did not; after I had picked up the pieces that were on the ground, I thought I saw a person running down Argyle-street, which is about two hundred yards from my shop; I pursued him into Marlborough-street, where I saw a mob; I went into the mob, and saw some watchmen had hold of the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090028"/>at the bar, with my prints all over dirt; a piece was cut off and delivered to me, I have had it ever since; it was cut off in order to match it.</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of the circumstance of the prisoner being stopped by the watchman, should you have known the prisoner to be the person that came into your shop? - A. Yes; I was sitting in a very dark room, and there were a dozen candles in the shop; I am sure he was the same person that came into my shop.</p>

             to get change at next door; the prisoner bit the two, and said they were bad, that I dealt in bad money; she laid them down on the counter, and then I gave her another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the third? - A.She put it to her mouth and bit it as she had done the others, and then she swallowed it, I suppose, for I never saw it after; I then desired her to go about her business; a constable came from Marlborough-street, she was taken there, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many seven-shilling-pieces might you have had that morning? - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might you have given change to that day? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces did you take in the course of the day? - A. Not one; them I had in my pocket in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that you gave change to another woman? - A.No; I gave Mrs. Hart one to get change.</p>
               <p>Q.What was done with the guinea - you had the guinea? - A. No, she took it up again.</p>
               <p>Q.When she found she did not get her full change she took it up again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told her to go about her business? - A. I told her to give me my money, and go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. She was searched, but no seven-shilling-piece was found upon her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, and was it not upon that that she was let out upon bail, and has been ever since, that you could not ascertain how many seven-shilling-pieces you had that morning? - A. No such thing, I never said so; that one seven-shilling-piece I never had back from her.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave her first two seven-shilling-pieces, did she lay them down upon the counter before you gave her the third? - A. She laid down one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had you after she went away? - A. I had two seven-shilling-pieces, and seven-shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask again - did you not take off the counter one, or two, of the first seven-shilling-pieces, before you gave her the third? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that the third you gave was not one of the other two that you had given her? - A. I can swear I gave her three, and had but two back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you carry on business on your own account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband has nothing to do with it? - A. He is a tradesman by himself.</p>

             sworn. - I went to Mrs. Wallis's for some tobacco for my husband; when I went in, Mrs. Wallis weighed my tobacco; but before she finished with me, this woman came in for snuff and tobacco that came to about one shilling, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090029"/>she wanted change for a guinea; Mrs. Wallis took out her purse, and laid down three seven-shilling-pieces; Mary Smith gave them all back, and said they were bad money; she bit them all three.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she give them back one at a time, or how? - A. She gave them all three at once; then Mrs. Wallis threw her down another to chuse, that was the fourth; and then she picked out three from the four that she was satisfied with; Mrs. Wallis took one of them out of her hand, and asked me to get change next door; when I came back, Mrs. Wallis took the tobacco and snuff, and gave her a guinea, and told her to take the guinea and give her the other two seven-shilling-pieces; I saw Mrs. Smith give another of the seven-shilling-pieces back; Mrs. Wallis desired her to leave the shop, for two months ago she wanted to cheat her out of a guinea; a great many words ensued because she did not give up the seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you hear the story that Mrs. Wallis told? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not seem at all agreed? - A. I cannot help that.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wallis gave her a fourth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came back, Mrs. Wallis was quarrelling about this seven-shilling-piece? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wallis had the guinea in her hand, and desired her to go about her business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wallis had the guinea in her hand after the dispute had arisen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she threw it down, and desired her to go away? - A.She did not know then whether she had lost the seven-shilling-piece or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that the prosecutrix having a security in her hand it could not amount to a felony, for she returned the guinea before the transaction was compleated, and therefore it was in her own laches.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Wallis.) Did you desire her to take up her guinea? - A. No; I desired her to give me my money and go away; she took it up, I did not desire her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hart.) You say Mrs. Wallis desired her to take up her guinea, and go about her business? - A. I cannot say; I think it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You said she desired her to take up the guinea, - now are you accurate as to that? - A. I think I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take it up, or did Mrs. Wallis desire her to take it up? - A. I cannot say positively.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by mr. Alley. Q. Pray where is the lady that kept the house? - A.She is at home, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q.it was the little girl's business to go into your chamber to make your bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Persons who keep loding houses, I believe, generally keep two keys, one for the proprietor of the house, where one servant is kept, and one generally for the lodgers, therefore that would not have been an extraodinary thing? - A. It would have been extraordinary if they had done it before I had given up my key, which was always my custom; it is known in the house that I am extremely tenacious of any body entering the chamber without my consent; it was understood in the house, that there was no other key but my own.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you seen the money last? - A. At twelve o'clock the night before; I confess, I did not suspect the girl.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any suspicion of the mistress? - A. Yes, I had. From the general good conduct of the girl, I did not suspect her; though, from what turned out afterwards, I was convinced the mistress knew nothing of it, and therefore I did not apprehend her.</p>
               <p>JOHN TMOLINS sworn. - I am a messenger: I was called in on the 10th, by Mr. Jedder, to take notice of the marks on the money; I saw him mark four seven-shilling pieces. a half-crown, ten shillings, and two sixpences; I was present again the next morning, when the prisoner delivered up two shillings and a seven-shilling piece; she was fitting in a chair; I knew it to be the same money that I had seen the day before.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same money that I delivered to the constable, and part of the same money that I marked the day before.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the mistress in your room at the time the girl was? - A. No; I saw the mistress, very distinctly, pass up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a skeleton key? - A. No, it is not; I think she told me, it was a key of one of the apartments below stairs.</p>
               <p>Tomlins. This is the same money that Mr. Jedder marked in my presence.</p>
               <p>the prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think her an object of mercy for her industry, I never had reason to suspect her before, she is a very industrious girl.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Why did not you bring the mistress here? - A.Because I had not a good opinion of her, and I thought her evidence upon such a subject might be a bad one.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer of Excise, in Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Q.On the 12th of April, were you on duty at Broad Oak Down? - A. I was; between three and four in the morning, in company with Hicks, another Excise officer, we saw five men driving four horses loaded with ankers; the prisoners at the bar are three of them; the other two were Richard and William Petherick; I knew Heals before very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you to be an Excise officer? - A. I think he did, he had seen me before.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they carry these ankers? - A.Slung with ropes, some holding seven gallons, some seven and a half, and some four and a half; some of them marked with B, some with G; having a suspicion that it was smuggled spirits, we demanded to examine the goods, and Heals, particulary, struck my horse three different times, and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horse keep his legs? - A. NO, my horse sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of an instrument was it that he struck you with? - A. A large pole, three yards in length; after I had received these blows, I was obliged to retreat as well as I could, the other four men were driving the horses off, and heals went after them.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after this was it before you met with Mr. Couthe? - A. About a quarter of an hour, and we agreed then to follow them, and examine the goods by force; we came up with them about a mile from the place where I first saw them; when we came up again, they took out their sticks again, each of them had nearly the same sort of weapons, and drove the horses up into an angle.</p>
               <p>Q. What weapons had you? - A. I had a stick about the size of the one I have in my hand; Hicks had a stick also, and Coutne had a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first demanded an examination,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090034"/>when Couthe was with you, was that hanger drawn? - A. It was not; they beat us in a very cruel manner; I lost my senses in a very short time, and I lost a great deal of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fire-arms about you? - A. I had pistol, but what became of it I cannot tell; I recovered my seses some time after, and they took me to a public-house, where I got medical affistance; I was confined about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the common sort of ankers, and slung in the usual way that smugglers carry them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was brandy and gin? - A. I have not; Heals said, he would give up a part of the goods, if we would let him have the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. The word goods is a technical word? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them you were Excise officers? - A. Yes, we did; I told them the consequence of their conduct, and Heals said, he could not be worse off than he was, conceiving himself in poverty, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you doubt in your mind of their being the persons? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. The two Pethericks have not been taken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This transaction happened as long ago as April last? - A. Yes, about eight months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any thing commenced, you told them you were Excise officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your habit - do you tell smugglers that you are Excise officers? - A. We do, if they do not know us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of seizing the goods? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all you know about their being exciseable commodities, is from the appearance of the ankers? - A. Yes. Q. Do you mean to swear that B and G necessarily denominates that it must be brandy and gin? - A.They were the usual sort of ankers.</p>
               <p>Q.But of course ankers of that description and size would contain oil or any thing else? - A. if it was oil, they would have looked greasy.</p>
               <p>Q.If they had water in them, that would not be greasy, and the only opportunity you had was seeing a B and a G marked upon them? - A. Yes, in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know Chapman and Avery before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.When you came up the second time, Heals did not them strike you? - A.Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kanapp. Q. These persons were taken up before a Magistrate in Cornwall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They entered into recognizances to appear? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. And here they came to surrender themselves up for trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Heals was not taken up till about three weeks or a month ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of that? - A.We understood he was gone away.</p>
               <p>Q.But you did not take the trouble to enquire? - A. No.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by mr. Knowlys. I am an Excise officer; I was with Morris on Broad Oak Down; we saw five horses loaded with casks, such as are used to contain smuggled spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you benn an officer? - A. Nine or ten years; they had such marks upon them as all smuggling casks used to have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the persons who were with these horses? - A. Yes, Heals, Chapman, Avery, and two other of the, names of Pethrick; the prisoners are three of them; I have known Heals a great many years, and I have known Avery and Chapman before, for they have beat me off before when I have been wanting to examine their goods; Morris and I went up to them, and endeavoured to seize the goods; upon coming up to them, they turned their horses up to the side of a-hedge, and told Morris we had better be contented to take a small part of the goods; Mr. Morris said, he would insist upon examining the goods; and as Mr. Morris was attempting to examine the goods, to take out some of the liquor, Heals made a blow at his mare, he knocked her back to the ground, and made her nose bleed very violently.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of weapons had they with them? - A.Heals had a large pole, better than two yards long, the other had all long sticks and whips; he knocked the mare to the ground, and struck Morris on the arm; Morris then told Heals he had done a bad job, and he would take the law of him; Heals said, if he sent him to h-ll he did not care, he could not be much worse, for he could not afford to lose it; then Morris and I gave up the contest, and gave it up for lost; when we had got a little further, we met a young man, we call a pupil, an expectant, of the name of of Robert Couthe, and we agreed to go after them again; in about half an hour we came up to them, I did not get up so early by two minutes, I believe, as the first got up; Heals was beating Morris: I got off my horse, and began upon Heals, and struck at him: upon that two others sell upon me, and struck me such a blow as brought me to the ground, and struck the stick out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what they did to Morris? - A. No; while I was knocked down, Morris received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090035"/>or blows that laid him to the ground; I did not see the blows given him that brought him to the ground; I had seen him not a minute before fighting with them, I saw him lie bleeding upon the ground; Heals then looked at Mr. Morris upon the ground, and said, I am ruined, I will give up the goods if the rest will; Morris had a pistol which stuck partly out of his pocket; they said one to another, take away his pistol, and one of the Pethericks then took it from him; they then gave an huzza, and began to drive off their horses; then this Petherick that had the pistol went to urge the horses on, and Couthe took out a pistol, and they presented the pistols one to the other as they passed, but what pasled between them I cannot say, I found Morris bleeding upon the ground, not being able to stand, or speak a word of sense; I then bound up his wounds with handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his wounds chiesly? - A. All over his head; I then, with the assistance of Couthe, got him to a neighbouring house, and got him to bed; then I took Mr. Morris's mare to Leskard, to get a surgeon and a chaise, and the next morning we took Mr. Morris to Leskard in a chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be sensible while he was removing to Leskard the next morning? - A. He was insensible all the night, and we could get very few words sensible out of him till after we got to Leskard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you apprehensive of his dying? - A. Yes, I had no idea he could live.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What arms had you? - A. A stick.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Morris? - A. A pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol the first time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Couthe? - A. A pistol and a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if they could see the pistol in his pocket? - A. I cannot say, I did not see till after the bustle was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Chapman and Avery had nothing but sticks, which were not like the stick that Heals had? - A. They all had large sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. But not so large as that Heals had? - A. It was not likely they should.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol in Morris's pocket they saw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you came up the second time, you attacked Heals? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he attacked you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till after you had attacked him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was Heals active in attacking the officers before you meddled with him? - A. He was fighting with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You know Heals lives at Stratton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Port Pennant? - A.About forty miles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.How far is Broad Oak from where he lives? - A. It is a cross country, I cannot exactly inform you; it is about thirty-six miles.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COUTHE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I met with Hickes and Morris, I told them the five men had passed me, and we went up; I went first to a gate at the head of the horses, to come at the goods, and they struck at me before I spoke to them, with a long pole, it was Heals that struck me, and several of them made blows at me, the three prisoners were three of them; I could not get at them with the hanger I had, and Heals said, he would be d-d if he would not kill me; then young Petherick said, kill him, kill him; then Heals made a blow at me with a stick again; I defended the blow with my arms, and knocked him down the blow with a hanger, and then he said he would yield, he would give up his goods if I would not strike him while he was down; then young Petherick engaged me; Heals got up again, and caught me by the collar; now, says he, d-n you, I will do for you now I have got you; I I wrestled with him and got him down in the ditch, and then he said he would yield again, and, while I was down with Heals, young Petherick struck me several times upon the head; I got up, and as he was coming to me again, I made at him, and cut his arm, and then he said he would give up; then I went to look for Morris, and I saw Avery and Chapman fighting Mr. Morris upon the ground with their long poles, with both their hands; young Petherick was upon him at the same time; I thought he was dead, I did not think any other; I then made a blow at Avery with a hanger, I believe he has got the mark in his head now; then four of them sell upon me; young Petherick was searching Morris's pocket, he took the pistol out of his pocket, presented it at Morris's head, and then afterwards seeing I was engaged with the rest, he came over the bridge, cocked the pistol, and said, as he was coming towards me, I will be d-d if I do not blow your brains out; I then took a pistol out of my pocket, and told him, if he did fire, either I would kill him or he should kill me; after I had said so, he said, if you will let me go over the bridge, I will not fire; I was between him and the other four, I let him pass me over the bridge, I kept my pistol cocked, but he did not fire; I then said to Heals, I thought you said you would give up your liquor; says he, I will give up my liquor if the rest will give up theirs; I did not hear them make any answer to that, and then they whipped off their horses and went away; then I assisted Morris; we were obliged to keep three hands up to his head while the doctor sewed up the wounds in his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090036"/>Q. Did you know any of the party before? - A. I knew the three prisoners before; I had seen them a great many times loaded with goods at Port Pennant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the marks upon the ankers? - A. Yes, I understood the marks very well, I have seen thousands of them; there was C P for Christopher Prieux, the Guernsey merchant, and there was a B upon some of the kegs, and G upon some for brandy and gin; and there is another Guernsey merchant of the name of Lukey, he marks with the letter L.(Mr. Knapp addressed the Jury on the behalf of Avery and Chapman, and Mr. Gurney on the part of Heals; as did the Attorney General in reply.)</p>

               <p>Q. That occupation was turning rogue? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did commence rogue then, and gave information? - A. No; I commenced an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were acquainted with this rogue that wanted you to turn rogue; and therefore you did not keep very good company? - A. I did not chuse to keep company with him when I found he was a rogue.</p>

Then do you mean to have the Jury believe that she brought this bad money there for the purpose of selling it to you, although you had sent no message to her by Mrs. Bodensike about that money? - A. It was so - I met the prisoner that very morning as I was going to lodge the information, I met her very near St. Sepulchre's Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, at that time, give her a parcel of bad money, and desire her to keep it till she saw you again; upon your oath, did you or not? - A. I did not; we had a glass of gin together, but I gave her no bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your livelihood now? - A. I live upon my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money? - A. What I received form my agents; I received six pounds that very day that I took her up.</p>

             sworn. - I am the son of the prosecutor: I was in the front of the shop helping to load a cart. On Saturday, the 22d of December, one of the men came forward, and desired me to take notice of the prisoner; I followed him out at the door, and took the rivets from him; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; he said, he had nothing; I then took the rivets out of his pocket, and he said, they were to make a soldering iron for a friend, who had asked him several times to get him one. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER ROSIER sworn. - I am journeyman to Mr. Smith: On the 22d of December, I was desired to go backwards and cord up a chest; I saw the prisoner stooping down and taking up these nails, and putting them in his pocket; I informed my young master of it, and he took them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they nails or rivets? - A. They may be called rivets by people that don't know any thing about it; we call them nails.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. A nail has a point, a rivet has none; these are, most undoubedtly, rivets, they have no points.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took the two rivets from my master's. A friend of mine wanted a soldering iron, and he told me, two of our rivets would answer his purpose, and if I would bring him two, he would give me something to drink, and would pay my master for them; I mentioned it to the people in the shop; I did not mean to rob my master; I have worked for him very near four years; the witness and I had had some words the day before, and he told it out of spite.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990109-33-verdict201" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners? - A. Yes, I know them all. On the 4th of December, the two prisoners, Blake and Stack, came to Mr. Cresswell's office, to prove the will of

               <p>Q. Did Stack or Blake say any thing to you at that time? - A. I do not recollect what they said, but they presented a will to me to prove; after the reading the will, I asked which of them was the executor; I first asked Stack, whether he was the executor; he said, no, and pointed to the other man, by which I understood he was the executor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Blakely say any thing to that? - A. No, he did not. I asked Blakely whether his name was spelt right in the will, to which he answered in the affirmative; after which, I proceeded to write a receipt, and Blakely went with me then to the Court, which was then sitting; after he had been sworn in Court, he came back to Mr. Cresswell's office with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Stack been left at your office? - A. Blake went out with me, I did not observe Stack follow; but when I came back, I found him at the corner of the street; I promised them the probate next day, and one of them said, they wanted it immediately, but I cannot say which of them said that; I asked Stack, if he knew the time of the death; he said, he did not know the time, but he would procure it, and bring it in the afternoon; I did not see him again that day; they then went away, but on account of some suspicions about it, the probate was not proceeded with; the next day, Blakely came, I told him, the probate was not ready; in about half and hour, Blakely and Stack<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090040"/>came again, and spoke to Mr. Carr, who is likewise a clerk to Mr. Cresswell; but I do not know what passed; the next day, Thursday, they came together in the morning; I told them, it was not ready, but desired them to sit down; after which, I was desired by Mr. Cresswell to procure a constable, and take them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing else pass between you and them respecting the will? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner? - A. Not till he was taken into custody, on the Thursday; he was brought by a constable into Mr. Cresswell's office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, (Counsel for Blake). Q. The will was not given you by Blakely? - A. I cannot say, I believe it was Stack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, (Counsel for Stack). Q. When these two men came first to the office, was any body else there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man comes for the probate of a will to your office, it is nothing unusual for a friend to accompany him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you enquired what time the testator died, Stack was not acquainted with it? - A. He said, he did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- CARR sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am a clerk in Mr. Cresswell's office: On Tuesday, the 4th of December, about two o'clock, I was in the office, when the prisoner, Stack, came into the office with information, that he had been to the India-house, and found that the deceased had died in December, 1797, and that he was an armourer, and not a carpenter, as described in the will; he then went away, and attended again the next morning, but the business not being done, he went away, and returned in about an hour, accompanied by Blakely, but the business not being ready, I told them, it might be ready in about an hour more, or thereabout, or if it was not ready at that hour, and the public Register was shut, they could not have it till the morning; Blakely said, that would do; Stack said, it would not do, for it must be taken to the India-house as that day, and they went away, but never returned to see whether it was ready or not, notwithstanding I saw them both in the street after that time, conversing together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other person conversing with them? - A. Not at that time; but about an hour or so after, Corns came in and enquired about the business, asking if the business had been fetched away, by which I understood he meant the probate of the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first time you had seen Corns? - A. Yes, he said Blakely was related to the deceased Ford, and he had lent a little money upon the business; he went away for that day, and on Thursday, the 6th, about twelve o'clock, Blakely and Stack came for the probate; it was then determined to have these men taken into custody; while the constables were sent for, I went out of the office, and saw Corns parading before the house, and before the constables came, I returned and saw Stack going up the street; Blakely was then in the office alone, and was taken into custody by one constable; Stack had at this time got round the corner; I then took a constable up the street after Stack, and I then saw Stack and Corns conversing together, and they were both brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular pass between them at the time of their apprehension? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys, (Counsel for Corns). Q. Do not you know it to be a very common thing for persons to lend money upon a will to persons who represent themselves as entitled to a benefit under that will? - A. I believe it is sometimes done among seamen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Stack told you that Ford died in December, 1797? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That turned out to be a correct account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He also told you that the deceased was an armourer, and not a carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed that the description of the seaman in the will was not a proper description, did not that excite a suspicion in your mind? - A. I had a suspicion before that.</p>
               <p>Q. That of course must have confirmed the suspicion in your mind? - A. It certainly did.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Brookes). You went with Blakely to the Surrogate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Surrogate's hand-writing when you see it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Blakely's defence. My Lord, I most humbly intreat your Lordship's protection, and the mercy of the Court. In my life I never heard of the name of Blakely, nor singed it, or heard it read, till I heard it at Guildhall and here; my name is Blake. - I believe it was not five minutes from the first time that I had seen this deed till I was sworn in open Court at Doctors' Commons; not knowing the custom or manners of the place, I thought this oath, administered to me, was preparatory to what was to be done. Mr. Brookes has said, that he read it, but I most humbly beg his pardon, for it was not read; I neither saw it, nor understood it, but positively thought it was right. A man of the name of Quin was the man that delivered this will to Mr. Stack and me, in the parlour at the Whitehart, in Butcher-hall-lane; he wrote on a bit of paper, his compliments to a Mr. Kiernan, or M'Kiernan, a proctor in the Commons; Mr. Stack delivered this complimentary note to Mr. Kiernan; and Quin not only sent this complimentary note, but said that he had an open account with Mr. M'Kiernan, to the tune of forty or fifty pounds, that he had a great deal of business to do in this way; Mr. Quin seemed to be quite the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090043"/>of business, he said he had business with all the the proctors in the Commons; but, however, my Lord, this note was presented to Mr. M'Kiernan; Mr. Stack, at the same time, had a printed card of Mr. Cresswell's, but said, he gave Mr. Kiernan the preference; upon which Mr. Kiernan said, it was a usual custom with the people in the Commons, when there was a recommendation, never to take the business from one another; in consequence of which, we went to Mr. Cresswell's, where the card directed; I went to the Court, but it was not read at all, as I dare say the young man, upon recollection will acknowledge; something was asked about my name, but I do not recollect what; I went over with a young gentleman to the Court, where the gentlemen were pleading, and there was an oath administered to me; I did not exactly hear the words of it, but that I should true inventory make, and give a just account; I went back to the office, and after that, I attended as the gentleman directed, expecting the business to be done; during all this transaction, I unfortunately had taken a glass or two of spirits at the house where we met; I was doubtful whether it was the same

I attended, as the proctor directed, until we were taken into custody; I was not surprised at being taken into custody in the least, for I doubted throughout that there was something wrong; for I was doubtful how it should come to the ears of Mr. Quin that the man owned me money. We were then taken to Guildhall, and committed. My Lord, I am very sorry to add, that Mr. Stack and Mr. Corns sent this

               <p>Prisoner Stack's defence. I have been for many years in the public life; this man, Blake, came to my home along with a man of the name of Smith, who resorted to my house in the year 1794; sometimes he came with Smith, and sometimes by himself; he borrowed money of me, and got in my debt, with regard to liquors and beer at my house, and when he had got in my debt he shunned my house; I met him by accident, at different times, in the streets of London, and asked him for this money that he was indebted to me; and he made answer, that he was poor, and would pay me as soon as it was in his power. Some time in November last, I met him at the upper end of Drury-lane, I asked him how he was; and he said, very well; I met a person of the name of Read, before I met Blake, and we went into a public-house; we were not long in the public-house before I asked Blake if he could pay me the trifle he owed me, I said, I was out of business lately, and was striving to get in what money was owing me, and threatened to summons him if he did not pay me; he made answer, and said, he had a sum of money to receive from some friend that died at sea; he told me to call at his house, No. 9, Newtoner's-lane, at a chandler's-shop, and if I would go along with him I should receive my money; I went along with him to Doctors'-Commons, he produced this will, and gave it to Mr. Brookes; Mr. Brookes and he went off together out of the office, I waited till they both came back; Mr. Blake and Mr. Brookes spoke together for some time, and after speaking together, Mr. Brookes asked Mr. Blake if he knew what time the man died; to which Mr. Blake made answer, he could not exactly tell; Mr. Brookes said, he could not get the probate ready without Mr. Blake would bring him word within a month or two of the time that he died; upon that, Mr. Blake and I went out of the office, and walked together as far as St. Paul's Church-yard; Mr. Blake says to me, as you are the youngest man, Mr. Stack, will you go to the India-House and find it out; I accordingly went to the india-House, I am well acquainted there, and if I was to do any thing wrong they would know me as well as my father or mother knew me, every one of the gentlemen knew me; I enquired, and they told me, I think, in 1797, such a day of the month; I said, it was Ford, a carpenter; and the gentleman said, there was no Ford a carpenter, there was Ford an armourer; I, my Lord, came back, and left word at the office the answer that I had got; the gentleman, Mr. Carr, I believe, said, very well, that will do, come to-morrow and it will be ready; I then went and told Blake I had delivered the message to the Commons, and that he was to call the next day, according to the order of the proctor; he said, very well, if you will give me a call to-morrow, come along with me, and you shall be paid; I called upon him, and we went there the second time, and were put off then till the third day; I parted with Blake, and said, if I am not paid what trifle is due to me to-morrow I will never come any more; I went along with Mr. Blake the third day, and went into the office; one of the gentlemen in the office asked me to sit down near the fire, he and Mr. Blake stood together; the gentleman said, you may have the probate of the will in a few minutes; when I had walked as far as the top of the street, two constables came up to me while I was speaking to Mr. Corns, and I went with them before the Lord-Mayor. I know no more of its being amiss than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Corn's defence. All that I know of it is, that Stack brought Blake to my house, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090044"/>me if I would lend him some money; accordingly I told him I would if he would give me security for it; upon which, he said, he was going to administer for a relation; and I went to Mr. Cresswell's to make enquiry about the security; I went again the next day, and I was taken into custody; that is all I know of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Blake. I never saw Corns in my life, nor ever had a farthing from him in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were in company with you? - A. Willey, Powter, and Griffiths; we found a boy that we went after in bed with three women; we wanted him for being concerned in robbing a shop in Field-lane; the prisoner at the bar was sitting in a chair by the fire side, very genteelly dressed; I told the boy to get up, and I said to Mackaway, you may as well go with us too, for if you stay here, you may be robbed; Mackaway said, do you want any thing with me, gentlemen; I said, no; when the boy had got up, we went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to take the prisoner at that time? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Black-boy-alley in your parish? - A.Part of it is, but that house is not; when we had got into our parish, I took hold of him carelessly by the arm, then Willey gave me a nudge; the prisoner then asked Willey whether he knew him; Willey said, no, I know nobody; the prisoner said, my name is Carey; Willey made answer, Carey, then I want you, come along; Mackaway then pulled himself away from me, and ran something in my mouth, I cannot say what it was; I said to my partner, d-n his eyes, he has got a knife, mind his knife; Powter was close behind us, and the the watchman, Griffiths, was before with a lanthorn; I still kept hold of him, and he and I russled a good bit, for the space of two minutes or thereabouts; then Powter hit him over the arm with a stick, and, what he held in his hand, I suppose, dropped from him at that time, but I cannot positively say.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any warrant for apprehending him? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place after he had struck you? - A. There was a pistol found.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case, if death had ensued, it could have been but manslaughter; this man was not disturbing the peace at all when he was taken into custody. Gentlemen, you must acquit him upon this indictment.</p>

I knew which parcel they were taken from; every cheesemonger has a different mark upon his cheese, either with letters or figures; all these 1202 cheeses belonged to Barnard and Knight, in Gracechurch-street, and I looked at the third pile, and found there were only eighteen instead of twenty; they were all marked with 5 in a diamond, that mark was put upon them in the country; I am positive that the two that were brought back had been taken from that pile; the prisoner was what we call a scuffle-humer, to do any thing that is wanted at the water-side.</p>

I cannot say which, and offered me a pinch of snuff, saying, she was always afflicted with a head-ach; then she went out of the shop, and had not been gone above two minutes, before I asked my nephew whether he knew these ladies or not, and, in consequence of some conversation with him, I went out to see if I could see them; the laces were then missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss them before you went out, or was it after you came back that you made the discovery? - A. Before I went out. On the 7th of December she came again with another lady, who is housekeeper to a Mr. Gayter, and then we detained her.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss? - A.Twenty-seven yards and a quarter, to the value of 12l. 12s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen the lace since? - A. No; I am convinced it was taken by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they converse together? - A. One of them went out a little before the other; the prisoner went out first.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for this lace? - A. That is the neat value of it in my stock book; I had taken stock but four days before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is any body else concerned in business with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are a silk-mercer and a linen-draper; is it common for a linen-draper to sell these kind of articles? - A.It is.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not you, but your nephew, that served them with the articles they required? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, while he was in conversation with them, go up stairs? - A. I did not, I was in the shop all the time they were there.</p>
               <p>Q.Between the time you suppose she took the lace, and the time she was apprehended, had she not been in your shop? - A. I had not seen her.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not heard that she was? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day that she was apprehended, you took her up upon suspicion of another charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She underwent three examinations before she was committed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge exhibited against her then was for stealing muslin, which turned out afterwards not to be stolen? - A. My nephew shewed her some muslin; he shewed her four pieces to the best of his recollection, and he could find but three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the woman whom you charged to have stolen a piece of muslin, as the companion of the prisoner, discharged by the Magistrate? - A. She was; this was the woman that took the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was also dismissed from that complaint - that is, she was only committed for stealing the lace? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was she not committed for stealing the lace, and not for the muslin? - A. I do not know that; they were not both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate tell you, in my presence, and in my hearing, that there was no pretence for charging a felony as to the muslin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not both you and your nephew swear, that, to the best of your recollection, there was not a piece of muslin stolen? - A. He swore, that, to the best of his recollection there was a piece of muslin stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, that it was in consequence of your not being able to substantiate the offence respecting the muslin, and that there was no such offence committed; that you went upon the lace? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding they were dismissed of that complaint at Bow-street, did you not go before the Grand Jury, and there, upon your oath, found an indictment for that muslin, which was to affect the life of this woman? - A. There it stands upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention one word of the lace at Bow-street till the second examination? - A. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath will you undertake to swear, that at the first examination you charged her with stealing any thing except the muslin? - A. The first examination was for the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q.Then was it not after you found that you were unable to substantiate the charge for the muslin, that you brought forward this charge of stealing the lace, as long ago as October? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you missed twenty-seven yards and a quarter of lace - do you say that from a knowledge of the fact from your own mind, or from your book? - A.From both.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have undertaken to swear you had lost that identical quantity, unless you had looked at your book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090047"/>Q. Did you go before a Magistrate to give any information till two months after the offence? - A. I went to Bow-street the next day to give information.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any Magistrate there? - A. No; only the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Your nephew was the person who served them? - A. Yes; but I took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might have been in year shop between the time of their coming and your missing the lace? - A. No person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that there was another woman came to inquire for some nankeen, before you missed the lace? - A. No; I have not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, when you were taking that woman, and the other woman, to Bow-street, any thing particular that you said to your nephew? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to your nephew, when he said he could not swear to the loss of this lace, that he must be a stupid fool? - A.Possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet your nephew was the man that served in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your nephew then say, as he was determined to say nothing but the truth, he would not swear to it for you or any body else? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when they were taken for the muslin, you would be d-d, if it cost you three hundred pounds, if you would not hang them? - A. It was not in my power to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, at Bow-street, that at the time the people were in the shop, purchasing the lace, you were up stairs, and were called down by a private signal? - A. No; that was at the time we were serving the muslin.</p>
               <p>JOHN HART sworn. - I am nephew to the prosecutor: On the 12th of October; the prisoner at the bar, with some other lady, came in to buy some muslin, and I sold them half a yard, and they paid me for it four shillings, to the best of my recollection; and as they were going out of the shop, there laid some white laces upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they in their reach at that time? - A. They were; they bought two yards of it; and she put her purse in her pocket again, and the other woman paid for it; then the prisoner said, they were nice laces, she should like some too; she agreed for two yards of it, and when she had so done, she took out her purse to pay for it, but she did not pay for it, the other woman paid for it; as she was putting her purse in her pocket, there laid a piece of white lace doubled upon the counter; I observed that the drew it with her purse, as if she was going to put it in her pocket; I put my hand upon the lace, and looked her hard in the face, but when I took it from her I had no idea she had done it with an intention of stealing the lace; there were two particular broad laces lay very near the rest, which I missed about five minutes after they were gone, or less; both together made twenty-seven yards and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time this woman came into your shop, was there any other person in the shop besides you and your uncle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are perfectly sure of? - A. That I am very clear of.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was in five minutes that you missed the lace - did any body come in during that five minutes? - A. No soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went after the woman, you or your uncle? - A. My uncle; and, in the mean time, I was folding up the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you perfectly sure that nobody could have taken any lace from that counter but them? - A. I am sure they could not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Does the parlour adjoin your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your uncle in the parlour while they were there? - A. I rather think he might.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you could not tell the number of pieces that you had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you taken stock? - A. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not carry in your head the particular quantity of lace in each piece of lace? - A. That is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what quantity of lace was missing you could not tell, but by referring to your books? - A. As to these laces I can answer, because they were particularly broad laces.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you heard your uncle examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, when you went to Bow-street, you did not say a word about this lace till the second examination? - A. I believe it was mentioned the first time; when she came into our shop the second time, I told my uncle I suspected she was the person that had taken the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected her - now do you mean by that, to say more than this, that you suspected she was the person? - A. I only suspected her to be the person.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor.) Q.Look at the prisoner, are you satisfied, or not, that she was the person that came in? - A. I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am totally innocent of the charge that is alledged against me.</p>

               <p>Q. He had nothing to do with this butter, had he? - A. No; it was butter upon Mr. Bolt's wharf, under his charge, it weighs upwards of seventy pounds, and is worth thirty shillings; (produces the tub); here is No. 50 upon it, the mark put upon it at Waterford; it is Irish butter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great number of them, perhaps, from the same quarter? - A. Yes, a great number.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am in the service of Mr. Mortimer, gun maker; On Tuesday last, I was sent to the Bull-and-Mouth with a package, about half past seven o'clock, or rather more; I carried a box to go by the Shrewsbury mail-coach; I delivered this box to the bookkeeper, and desired him, if possible, to put it into the coach; he said, he would, if he could; I paid the carriage of it, and desired him to take care of it; my orders were to deliver it to the book-keeper, and see it off, I waited about the yard till the boxes and all the other things were brought out; I desired that my box might be put in the coach, but they said, it could not, it was a box, and must go into the boot; just after, while it was on the ground, the prisoner at the bar came up and laid hold of it, says I, my worthy, that is not your box; he looked at it, and said, he believed it was not; he put it down immediately; and sometime after that, I saw him get up to the boot, I watched his motions, I knew that my box was in the boot; soon after, I saw him jump down from the box close by the coachman, with a great coat under his arm, and said, he was going by the Shrewsbury coach; a lad in the yard desired him to go into the office, and pay the fare; I did not see him go in, and that made me pay more attention to him; when he jumped down from the box, it appeared to me as though his coat was more bulky then it was before; I watched him, and soon afterwards he went out; I followed him, and I spoke to another man, who followed him with me; I caught hold of him with the property upon him; he said, what is the matter; I said, nothing was the matter; I asked what he had got under his arm; he said, a great coat; I asked him what he had under his great coat; I pulled the coat on one side, and saw the two boxes in his hand; he then gave me a blow, which set me a reeling, and he ran away; the other man followed him, and brought him back; he took the great coat and the boxes, and gave them to Mr. Cooke, the bookkeeper, at the Inn.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, did you leave the warehouse safe? - A. Yes, I locked it up myself; the pannel had the appearance of having been broke in; there was a mark of an instrument against the board.</p>

               <p>MOSES EDMONDS sworn. - I am a constable; the bed and blanket were delivered to me by Mr. Cantelow, and the prisoner. (The property was deposed to by Evans).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I ply as a porter; I was going by Mr. Stuart's, there was a seafaring gentleman at the door, and he asked me to take it down to Billingsgate, and just as I had got it upon my shoulder, the boy came up to me, and said it was his; I told him I was to have a shilling for carrying it, and then that gentleman came and took me before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Stuarts) Did you give him any orders to take it? - A. I did not. <rs id="t17990109-52-verdict298" type="verdictDescription">

I went to fetch it out of the stable backwards, and I carried one cask away on my shoulder, and when I went to fetch the second cask, I observed something leak at the bung-hole, as I was rolling it along, and I tasted it and found it was water; then, when I came back, I thought, how the dence could there he brandy there; I turned the head of the cask up, and found a great deal of sand and dirt, as if it had been lying in grease; when I came to clean the top, I found it was a shave to match with the grain of the wood, fixed in like a bung, and a bladder was fixed into the shave, and that went to the head of the cask, and if you tapped that end it was brandy, and if you tapped the other end it was water.</p>
               <p>Q. How much brandy and rum did you find? - A. About half a pint of each in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. How much water was there in each cask? - A. I did not measure it; they delivered them to me as twelve gallon casks; if that was so, there were eleven gallons, seven pints and a half, of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any brandy or rum in the same sized casks in the house before? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is not the first time that you and I have had the pleasure to meet in Courts of Justice before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you live at what was called Ashley's Punch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't mean to say any thing harsh to you - but I believe you have not a licence for that house at this time? - A. No; I believe you well know it; I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore rum and brandy to be sold in your house would be contrary to law? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, at this time, had you no rum or brandy in your house? - A. I might; but not of any such sized casks; I might have a bottle or two, or three; I have a right to keep brandy and rum in the house as well as any other gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, it never happened that either for your own private use, or for sale, you had casks of brandy or rum in your house? - A. Not lately, not these six months I am sure; I perhaps may have had two gallons in a bottle; but I have had none since.</p>
               <p>Q. But I ask you as to casks? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before that time have you had casks of brandy or rum? - A. I believe I had a cask, or I might have casks, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that all the casks of rum and brandy that you have had before, you paid the King's duty for? - A. I never did before this, buy a drop of smuggled goods in the many hundreds and thousands of gallons that I have sold.</p>
               <p>Q. And so for the first time, never before having bought any, you buy it of two soldiers? - A. I should not then if I had had a licence.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the first time, after having kept houses for the sale of punch and brandy, and those sort of things - how many years? - A.Twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you never bought any brandy, rum, or gin, without paying the duty? - A. That I can safely swear; and if I had, I conceive I am not bound to criminate myself; but I tell you fairly, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly right, you are a very good lawyer, you understand, perhaps, the term conspiracy, let us try it a little. - When you first saw Trinfield he was alone? - A. He and Mr. Wightman.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wightman is the gentleman that had the Punch-house before you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at home when the goods were delivered? - A. No; but I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house might they be deposited? - A. In the chaise-house, behind the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very snug retreat for goods that have not paid the duty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say they were not covered over? - A. Trinfield and Thompson had covered them over with straw, and shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been often examined in Courts of Justice, I don't say in what character, because that has no business here; but do you mean to say upon your oath, that these were exactly the things put there by the prisoners, you not being present when they were put there? - A.They shewed me that those were the two casks that they had put there; they said, they were the same as the sample, and they were in a hurry, for they had got a great many more to deliver.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a communication from your back premises into Fleet-market? - A. No, that door is nailed up; Mr. Littlemore has those premises to keep fruit in, and he has the key.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never saw these articles from the Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090053"/>till the Sunday? - A. I did not remove them till the Sunday, I had seen them very safe under the straw.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the Sunday did you look at them? - A.Between five and six in the morning; I took care to get up early, because I did not wish any servant or any body else to know it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was as snug and comfortable as could be? - A. If it had been such brandy as the sample was, it would make any body comfortable, for I could not get such fine coniac brandy if I was to give 24s. a gallon for it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many people come to your house? - A. I dine thirty and forty of a day sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. And are obliged to send out for all the liquor that you want? - A. Yes, I send to the Bell-Savage tap for every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This note you speak of was dated as long ago as March, and made payable to yourself? - A. Yes, I had four of them out, at two, four, six and eight months; those men paid it to the cooper who made the casks for them, and I thought I was not bound to pay the note;I was arrested for it, and it is now to be tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy brandy so cheap in your life before? - A. Yes, I have bought brandy of Mr. Willey, of Basinghall-street, at ten shillings a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of such brandy at that time? - A. I should suppose I had it about five shillings a gallon under the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is about six pounds saved? - A. Yes, somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you have no licence, and dine so many people every day, you hold the situation of Serjeant at Mace of the City of London? - A. I certainly hold that place, but I give no securities, and have not done for a long time; I purchased the place, and therefore I have a right to hold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you are pretty well acquainted with the laws of your country? - A. I think I am.(Mr. Knapp then addressed the Jury at considerable length on the part of the prisoners). Both <rs id="t17990109-54-verdict310" type="verdictDescription">
