                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Warren, of 3, Nelson-street, Plaistow Marshes—I know the prisoner—he came to stay at our house about three mouths before last September—he was only a lodger—he slept with another man up stairs—I take in single men lodgers—he paid me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for his board, lodging, and washing—he had not much clothes then, scarcely a second suit—he always paid me his rent when he fetched his money from his work—he was in work then at a sugar bakery—before that, he worked at Mr. Wagner's, a butcher's, but he was not lodging with me at that time—he came to lodge with me when he joined the sugar bakery—I knew from him that he had been at a butcher's—he left my house about the 20th September—he said he was going to Germany—after some little time, he returned—I don't know the date; it was on a Wednesday—he had been gone about a fortnight, as nigh as I can recollect—when he came back, he came in company with a young man—he brought him with him—he asked me if I could oblige this young man by taking him into my place, and he told me that he was a gentleman—I said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, if he is a gentleman, our place is only for poor men lodgers"—he called him "John"—he was a very handsome, nice-looking young man, a gentleman in every appearance—he was not much taller than Kohl, but a different made man altogether; he was very fair and slight, a gentleman built—I told the prisoner that my lodging was not fit for a person in that station—I ultimately agreed to take him in, and he came—after he had been with me some time, he asked me to take care of some things for him—it was six</p>

               <p>sovereigns, a silver watch, an Albert chain, a gold one, as I reckoned, it was a yellow one, a gold ring, and a neck-handkerchief ring with a piece of coral in the center—he also left a white pocket-handkerchief with me; that he returned for the next day—the prisoner was frequently with him after he came to lodge with me, inviting him out with him, two or three times a week perhaps, sometimes more; and if there was anything I could not understand, I used to go and fetch <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> to tell me what he meant—the prisoner was not in work at that time—the deceased left me on the Monday, and came on the Tuesday for his things—it was just a month from the time he left me to his body being found—he owed me something at the time he left—I wanted fifteen shillings—he came with the prisoner on the Monday night for his things—there was an objection made to his paying so much—I charged 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was a balance of fifteen shillings—<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> said that it was too much, and I kept his things that night in consequence of his declining to pay—on the following day, a man they called Butcher came, and fetched his things away, and paid me the money—when we were talking about the amount he owed me, the deceased told me in the prisoner's presence that he had four sovereigns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if he changed the four sovereigns, he should not have sufficient money to go to New York—he said nothing about any other money—he asked if I would take the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "No, "and Kohl said he was a friend of his, and a dear friend—I saw him once after his things were fetched away—that was on the same day, the Tuesday, when he fetched pocket-handkerchief—I never saw him alive after that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at several articles produced by Sergeant Clarke</hi>) I believe this to be the deceased' swatch and chain, and his portrait is in this locket—I believe this gold ring to be his—I don't know this gold handkerchief-ring; I have never sworn to it—it is not his handkerchief-ring—this is his pin; the ring I have not seen yet—I have examined the clothes—I am sure they are the same the deceased entrusted to my care—here are two pairs of shoes—these I do not know; these I do; and there was a pair of spring sides—this is a likeness of the young man (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should know him by that—I am sure these things were his; his portmanteau was full of things—I helped to lift it once; it was perfectly full, and locked up, and his hat-box was sealed with three different seals, to go to New York, as he told me when he left my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Whitmore—we occupied a back room in the prisoner's house, in Hoy-street—we went to lodge there on 11th October—we paid four shillings a week—I remember seeing the prisoner go out on Thursday morning, 3d November, about half-past 9 o'clock—the young man that they used to call John was with him, the young man who is now dead—the prisoner was dressed the same as usual, with a rough coat on and dark trousers—that was the only dress I ever saw him in—the deceased had on black trousers and a long overcoat—the coat was very dark, but I can't say whether it was black or not—he generally wore a little tie, and a turn-down collar—I did not notice whether he wore that on that morning—I did not notice how high the coat was buttoned—he generally wore it buttoned all up; but I do not remember how he wore it on that morning—he had a cap on his head—I next saw the prisoner at very near 3 o'clock—I heard him when he came in at 1, but I did not see him, only through the window—I saw him when he came in the hall, through the back parlour window—that was at 1 o'clock—he was then brushing his coat—he had his coat off—I was in the back parlour, and he was in the yard—I saw him through the window;—I saw that his coat was muddy—no other part of his dress was muddy that I saw—he stayed at home about a quarter of an hour—I did not speak to him at all during that time, or he to me—I saw him pass my door as he left the house—I next saw him a little before 3—he said he had been to look for the young man that he had missed, and. I asked him if he had found him—he said, "No"—he said he and the young man had been up to London, and he had missed him in the Commercial-road; that he went into a sugar-house, and left the young man outside—he did not say what sugar-house it was—he said it was a sugar-house in the Commercial-road—I asked him if he would go to Germany without the young man, as he had missed him—he said, yes, he would go; then he said he would wait two hours, and see if he came home before he would go—he then looked up at the clock, and said if he waited that time he should be too-late to go, as the boat went at half-past 5, and he would go at once and break open the young man's boxes—I said I thought the young man had missed him on purpose, because he had no money—Kohl said he had money, for he showed him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that morning—he then took a little poker out of the kitchen fire-place, and went up stairs with it—I did not go up with him; his wife's cousin did—he was in the kitchen, and Kohl said, "Some one come and see me break the boxes open, "and he was the only one that would go up—when the prisoner came down stairs again, he said he had broken the boxes open, and John would never come back, for all his things were gone—the prisoner did not go out again quite directly—he said he could not go to Germany then, for he had not got money enough—nothing more passed until he went out again, at a little past 4—he came back about 5—I noticed that he looked very ill when he came back, and I asked him if he had had any dinner that day—on the evening of that day he came to my door and said, "You know I was asking you about a knife I had missed in your room some time ago; here it is; I have found it in John's boxes;" and he showed it to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—I had seen that knife before—the prisoner was putting up a roller with it in my room the day I went into the house—that was the first time I saw it—he showed it</p>

I am a boiler-maker, and reside at 8, Hoy-street—in September lost I became acquainted with the prisoner—he was then lodging at Mrs. Warren's, he was then employed at a sugar bakery—he requested permission to pay his addresses to my sister; he became engaged to her, and ultimately married her on 2nd October last—before the marriage he went over to Germany—he said he was going to bring money and property to England to marry my sister—he was away between a fortnight and three week—he came back on a Thursday and he was married on the Sunday, 2nd October—when he came back he brought with him a young man by the name of John—I don't know that he said who the young man was, no more than he said he was John, and that he had brought him from Germany—he did not say what his business was, but the deceased told me that he was something in the merchant line, and he also told me that he was about going to New York—he did not say in my hearing where he had come from, but I believe he came from Hamburgh—the prisoner said they had known one another from childhood, and that their mothers had known one another from their infancy or for years—what he brought back with him from Germany was such as two small feather beds, a basket of apples, and two canaries in cages, and such trifling things as that; if he brought any money with him it was very little: the only money I ever saw with him was a sovereign, which he changed to pay for the marriage lines on 2nd October: that was the only coin of English money that I ever saw him with—the</p>

I went to the reed bed on 9th November, about half-past six in the morning, to search for the head of the body that had been found—I was searching for about an hour and half—I met the last witness Jones about half-past 7 near the spot—he called my attention to a hole in the ground where blood could be seen; it ap<lb/>peared to be a rat's hole—I removed the earth and found the head of a man, which I dug up and afterwards conveyed to the Graving Dock Tavern, and gave it in charge of K 82, who had charge of the body—the earth round the hole appeared to have been trampled down as if by a foot, but no im<lb/>pression of the heel was left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Barking-road, Plaistow—on the morning of 8th November I was sent for to see the dead body of a man about half-past 11, at the Graving Dock Tavern—the body had no head at that time—I found the muscular fibers of the neck all eaten away, appa<lb/>rently by the rats; the clavicles and vertebrae were laid bare—the cervical vertebrae had been severed as if by a chopper or some sharp instrument—there had been an attempt to sever the vertebrae a little lower down, but it had only partially succeeded—there were several incisions on the skin at the front part of the neck, partially dividing the skin—a knife or some sharp in<lb/>strument had been used in the first place, and there had been several at<lb/>tempts made to divide the skin, as if it had been done by an instrument that was not very sharp—the instrument was sharp enough to divide the skin and muscles, after several attempts being made to do it—two instru<lb/>ments had decidedly been used, a knife or an instrument of that kind, and a hatchet or chopper or some heavy instrument, I mean an instrument of the kind produced—the body was eaten by rats in different parts; the skin and part of the muscular fibre of the left shoulder were eaten away, and also two places on the right arm, and the flesh from both hands was gnawed away, but more extensively from the left—I did not discover any marks of vio<lb/>lence upon the body except those I have spoken of about the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you judge from the appearance of the body how long it had been dead! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—taking into consideration the state of the weather, being dry and cold, it might have been dead four or five days—on the next day, the 9th, the head was shown to me—it was covered with dirt—a clayey</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501110018"/>
               <p>mud—I gave directions to have it washed, I afterwards examined it that same evening—I found part of the right check and some portion of the scalp eaten away—I found an extensive wound at the hack of the head—on the left side was a fracture of the occipital bone; there was a fracture of the angle of the left jaw and laceration of the left ear—there were two fractures of the frontal bone, one on the right and the other on the left side; the one on the right side was done apparently by a chopper or hatchet and the one on the left side by a hammer or some similar instrument, a blunt instru<lb/>ment—that was the external examination—on the 11th I made a further examination of the head and body, and, in addition to the injuries I have already described, I found a very extensive fracture of the left temporal bone—that would be done by a blunt instrument—such wounds would cause death—two of the wounds were inflicted by a sharp instrument and two by a blunt one—this chopper is a weapon that would produce both kinds of injuries—in my judgment all the wounds I saw on the head could be inflicted by that instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having spoken of the body and of the head, can you give any opinion as to whether that head had been cut off at the time of the murder, when the body was warm, or subsequently, after the body was cold.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say how long after! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not say how long after, but in my judgment it was decidedly out off after the body had been cold some time, from the appearances—there was no muscular contrac<lb/>tivity; the skin did not contract or the muscles either, which would be the case if cut off warm; it would be at least some hours after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of chemistry—I was consulted upon this matter, and had the hatchet that has been produced handed over to me—I examined it by such tests and means as I possess—I found on this broken part of the edge a small quantity of brownish matter, which I re<lb/>moved and submitted to examination under the microscope—I have it here in the same state in which it was when I removed it—I found some fibres of cotton and also some fibres of wool, some of which were dyed of a red colour, and one of the fibres of cotton was dyed with magenta red—those fibres were bound together with a brownish matter, mixed with rust of iron; the nature of that brownish matter I could not determine; it must have been liquid originally, for the fibres were bound together by it—I also found there some of the epithelium or surface skin of the human body; it was altogether mixed with this clot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to that clot, were you able at this distance of time to discover whether it was human blood or not! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If it had not undergone what may be termed an artificial coagulation, that is, coagulation by the agency of heat, I could have determined that point, but it was a brown matter, such as any blood would be coagulated artificially, and I could not determine the nature of it under these circumstances—the piece of skin I speak of was very minute, but still it was very marked—there are, I should say, at least thirty scales of epithelium here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you distinguish the scales of the epithelium of the human body from any other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the epithelium of the human body is very marked—I ascertained this to be human skin, I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>the hatchet! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, it was very firmly fixed, so much so that I had the greatest difficulty in removing it—I did not perceive any motion in it; it was very tightly fixed—at the time I saw it it had on it the paint that is there now—it is now in the same state, with the exception that at that time it was not broken around the edge between the wood and the hatchet, it was then perfect—I should say the paint had no effect whatever in tighten<lb/>ing the handle; there was no paint between the hatchet and the handle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the brownish matter you speak of the same sort of thing as the paint! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there is a great deal of difference between the colour of the paint and the other—I have examined the paint—the brownish matter was here, where this broken notch is (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say you took the handle out and found no traces of paint below the surface! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A little had soaked in, but there was no trace of the wood having been covered with paint when the blade was out, nor could I find any blood there—I have had some clothes delivered to me by Sergeant Clarke—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the prisoner's coat produced by Clarke</hi>)—I examined this coat, and cut a piece from the lower part of the left skirt, a portion of which I have examined chemically, by solution in water—the other portion is here untouched—the result was that it was a blood spot, a stain of blood—it was about the size of a sixpence—I should think it would have covered the whole surface of a sixpence, or very nearly—you can see where I cut it out, it is rather larger than a sixpence—there were other stains on the coat, but I could not find any other blood stain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether that blood spot was human blood! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say positively as to that; it had all the characteristics of human blood—the blood of many other animals is like human blood—it was not the blood of a reptile, or of a bird, or a fish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What kind of analysis did you make! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first place a portion of the surface of the cloth was scraped off on glass and examined under the microscope—it was observed that the blood had coagulated upon the fibres, and that the coagulation was of that kind which we call living coagulation; that is, that the blood had coagulated by a living process upon the cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean shortly after it bad left the body! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Shortly after—blood immediately removed from the living animal coagulates by a spontaneous process—the coagulation had gone on upon the cloth—the micro<lb/>scope does not discover albumen—the coagulation was fibrinous, not albuminous—the living coagulation is by fibrine, not albumen—the piece of cloth was then put into a test tube with a few drops of water, and I obtained a solu<lb/>tion of blood which, contained the colouring matter of blood, not bleachable by common processes—it was tried with chlorine, which will bleach almost any other colour, but will not blood—it was then subjected to heat, and I found that it contained soluble albumen which was thus coagulated—those are the characteristics which enabled me to speak very positively that it was blood, and that it was living blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you could not say whether it was human blood! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the measurement of the globules, they were about the same size as the human, about the four thousandth part of an inch, but as many animals have the same sized globules I cannot undertake to say it was human blood.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501110020"/>
               <p>in the same way, I discovered to be blood, and living blood—I mean it must have been there within a quarter of an hour after it escaped from the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long does blood live! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a quarter of an hour, it will then set, and then it will undergo no further process of living coagulation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there spots of paint on the waist-coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I found paint on the back of the waistcoat of exactly the same description as that on the top of the chopper, and also on the lower and out<lb/>side part of the left leg of the trousers—that on the waistcoat appeared to have been smeared as if rubbed over something, the other appeared to be splashes—I was not able to discover whether there was anything underneath the coating of paint on the hatchet or on the clothes—I submitted all these to careful examination, and I did not discover, where the paint was, any signs of blood—I expected to be able to do so—I removed a portion of this, thinking that as oil paint is not soluble in water, I should be able to get at it in that way, but I did not find any blood on the top of the chopper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and reside at 15, Princes-street, Mile-end-road—on Saturday night, 26th November, I was proceeding to my house, about half-past 11, going along High-street, Whitechapel—when I got about five doors this side of Osborn-street, the prisoner and four others came up to me—the prisoner took me by the throat with his right hand, and passed his left hand right round the back of my neck, and so throttled me by pinching my throat to such an extent that I could hardly breathe—while he had hold of my throat, another one came and rifled my right hand pocket—two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and a little silver was taken from it—I felt a hand in my left hand pocket—I had in that pocket, a silver watch tied up in a pocket-handkerchief—I immediately grasped that hand with my left hand—two of them immediately came; there was a signal given; a kind of whistle, the two immediately took hold of my left arm by the wrist, and completely screwed it round—I felt great pain, so much so, that I was obliged to go to the hospital—the prisoner let go his hold, and ran away—they all ran away up George-yard—immediately I recovered myself. I made a communication to the police-inspector—I gave him a de<lb/>scription of the prisoner—on the following Friday, I went to the police-station, Leman-street, Whitechapel—I there saw the prisoner amongst seven or eight other persons—I immediately went round and took him by the collar, and gave him in charge as one of the men who had robbed me on the Saturday previous—I have no doubt whatever about his being the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Whereabouts were you robbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close by George-yard—I did not pursue you; I was unable to do so—you all ran down George-yard—I did not see you exactly at the time—I don't know the distance between where I was robbed and George-yard; perhaps thirty yards—I could see you run down George-yard from where I was standing—George-yard runs out of High-street—I was robbed between George-yard and Osborn-street—the description I gave of you was about five feet ten inches high, dark hair, cut rather short, a slouched cap on, and a pocket<lb/>handkerchief round your neck.</p>

I am a milkman, living at Chelsea—about half-past two, on 22d September, I was in Sloane-square, and saw the two prisoners in a cart, they got out of the cart and enquired for change of any persons who might be passing by—knowing them before by seeing them about the neigh bourhood, I went and gave information at the police-station—I then came hack with a policeman, and saw the prisoners and another man with the cart in Eaton-place, South—Murray was then getting change from the postman, Sweetlove—I am not sure whether Jones was in the cart or behind it then—when I saw them in Sloane-square he was out of the cart with Murray—they were together when they were asking for change—I saw Murray leave the postman and get into the cart—the postman called out "Stop thief!"—the cart made a plunge off—the policeman went after the cart, laid hold of the horse and stopped it—Jones jumped out at the near side of the cart and ran up Chester-terrace, the policeman ran after him; I then laid hold of the horse's head, and Murray jumped out and ran down Burton-street, I ran after him—Sweetlove said to me, "That is the man who had my sovereign;" a waterman stopped Murray and took him to the station—it was in cones<lb/>quence of something I said at the station before, that the policeman was sent with me to Eaton-place, South—he was sent by the inspector.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had your clerk any authority to deliver the bonds without the cheque? A. He frequently leaves bonds without having a cheque immediately; we may have a large account with a man—the cheque that is received must be a cheque that goes through the clearing-house—a cheque uncrossed would, of course, do as well—the time for the deli<lb/>very of the stock is up to half-past 2; it must be delivered by half-past 2—the cheques are cleared before 5—they must go into the banker's before 4—my clerk took this cheque in the ordinary way of business—he did not bring it to me—he paid it in, in the course of business—it was after<lb/>wards returned dishonoured.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> urged that the act was to be regarded as simultaneous, that dominion I over the bonds was never parted with until the cheque was received; in the same way as a tradesman would place his goods on the counter before he was paid for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi> did not think the objection removed, he regarded it as a delivery on credit, in the full belief that a valuable cheque would be given; but it would be better, as there were other transactions alleged, to proceed upon them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Moulsey—I am not in business there—on 27th December, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Bushy Park, going towards Teddington—I met the prisoner—I knew him to be a neigh<lb/>bour, nothing more—I talked with him, and he turned back with me—we went together to the Adelaide Tavern, Teddington—I asked him what he would have—he said a pint of half-and-half—I gave it to him—we then went into a room, where I saw a person who recognised me, and asked me to taste some purl they were drinking—I did so, and said, "It is very good; we will have a quart"—we stopped there till a little after 6—we then left, and went towards the park—Stone then wanted to go back, and we went back to the Adelaide—he said something to Mr. Hammerton; I did not take any notice of it—I went back—we had very little more to drink; we only stopped a very few minutes—they then went and fetched a policeman to see whether I was right, and the policeman said, "There is nothing at all the matter; I don't consider you want me"—Stone then caught hold of my stick, and said, "Come along, uncle"—I said, "We have come here together, and we will go out together"—he told the others he was going towards my house, he would see me home—after we got some distance into the park I was tripped up—there was nobody else near—I received a blow, had my coat torn open, and my watch, locket, and two chains taken—I said, "Don't do that"—he said, "I can take better care of it than you can"—he left me on the flat of my back, and I never heard anything more of him till the Thurs<lb/>day morning—he called me "uncle"—we are no relations—I knew him by</p>

I have been in the Army—I have been in the police force eight years—on Sunday morning 4th December, about two o'clock, after midnight, I was on duty at Millwall—I was by myself—Mare's gate is the end of my beat—when I was near Mare's gate some men made a communication to me—in consequence of that I walked on—walking on I heard cries of murder and police—in consequence of that I ran to the Great Eastern public-house, and then into Cahir-street—I saw a woman coming out at a door there—she called out, "Oh, oh, you murder<lb/>ing brute"—I went across the street and saw a tall man come out of the house, and before I had time to speak to him, I saw he had something in his hand—he made a blow at my head—I bobbed my head on one side, and my hat fell off—he then struck me across the head with some hard substance and knocked me down senseless—I have the mark still, (<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>) across the temple—when I came to myself I crawled upon my hands and knees ten or twelve yards towards the main road—when I had somewhat recovered I walked to the time-keeper's office at Mare's—I spoke to the</p>

I was in Cahir-street—I had got ten or twelve yards down Cahir-street when she used the expression, on the opposite side of the way, nearly opposite the door—it was not 39 yards from where I stood in Cahir-street to the main road, only 10 or 12—I saw Clares the night before—I do not know whether Mrs. McGeehan spoke to me the night before; some woman spoke to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon to the police, and reside in the East India-road—on Sunday, 4th December, about four o'clock in the morning I was called to see the prosecutor—he complained of a wound on the scalp—I found two lacerated wounds of the scalp; one, two inches and a half long, and the other about three inches—there was a great deal of blood—a poker would produce such wounds as I saw—if it was only one blow it must have been an instrument of unequal thickness, terminating abruptly—he was off duty a fortnight.</p>

               <p>about half-past 12—when we got to the pillar letter-box at the corner of the turning to my house we stopped—I had not noticed any constable before that—I had hold of Mr. Barber's hand wishing him good-night, when a policeman came across the street to me—it was the dark-complexioned man—I saw him at the Thames Police-court, and identified him there—I don't know his name—(<hi rend="italic">Claret was here called in</hi>)—that is the man—he came cross the street from a tinsmith's shop—he left another policeman standing there—when he came across he looked in my face, and gave me a chuck in the neck with his open hand, nothing to hurt me, and asked me what I was doing there at that time of night; before I could reply, he turned round to Mr. and Mrs. Barber, and Barber and he had a scuffle—Barber said, "If you are doing your duty," or something like that, and then there was a scuffle—when the scuffle was going on the other constable was coming across the road—the prisoner is that man—he had a stick or a staff of some description in his hand—he made an attempt to walk towards Barber, and got very near him, and Mrs. Barber shouted out, "James, run"—he turned round, passed me, and said, "I will soon do for you," and he hit her a violent blow on the back of the temple—he was about three yards from Mrs. Barber when he said, "I will do for you," and about half a yard from Barber—it was not a second after his saying that before he struck her—the blow was in<lb/>tended for her, because he could have struck me if he wished, but he stepped past me, and struck her—it was a very heavy blow—she would have fallen, but I caught her—I put my arm up to her head, and my sleeve was full of blood in a moment—when Brown had struck the blow, the second policeman turned immediately upon Barber, and she shouted again to James to run, or they would murder him—he ran backwards three or four yards, and then turned and fled, and those two after him—I wanted Mrs. Barber to come into our house, but she would not, and in a couple of seconds she ran out of my arms after her husband—I saw that the police<lb/>men were so determined that I went into my own place—I afterwards went down to Mrs. McGeehan's, and found Barber there and his mistress, who was bleeding dreadfully, and Mrs. McGeehan was holding a bit of wet cloth to her head—this was between 12 and 1 o'clock—it was ten minutes past 1 when I got to McGeehan's—I stopped in my own house ten minutes or so, and then I went down to Mrs. McGeehan's, and found Mr. and Mrs. Barber there—I saw no weapon with Barber—I had only been drinking a glass or two of wine, I was quite sober, and so were Barber and his wife—I was not making the least disturbance, only bidding them good-night.</p>

I work at the Millwall iron-works—on Saturday night, 3d December, I was passing along the road between England Cottages and the pillar letter-box, going from the King and Queen, Limehouse, home to Union Cottages—that is not far from where Patrick Smith lives—I met him, and bade him good night—Mr. Barber and his wife were with him; they were coming down the same road as I was, and walking in the same direction—I passed them, and bade them good night as I passed—I saw the two police-men standing on the opposite side of the road, about twelve yards from the pillar letter-box, just across the road—when I got home I heard the scream of a woman, but did not go out again that night—when I did go out I noticed blood near the Great Eastern, on the pavement and up against the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Heath-house, Commercial-road—I first saw Mrs. Barber on Tuesday, 6th December—she had been attended by Mr. Serjeant before—I found her suffering from a wound on her forehead, about an inch and a half long—the head was inflamed, and erysipelas was commencing—the condition of the wound was therefore very much altered from what it would have been the day previous—there would have been erysipelas if it had not been attended to and poultice—it was not a serious wound, except so far as every scalp wound would be serious—I cannot say how it was caused, from the inflamed condition of the parts—whether it could be self-inflicted would depend on whether it was with a sharp or a blunt instrument; I cannot tell which it was—it might have been caused by a fall—Mr. Serjeant saw it first—a clean-cut scalp-wound will heal better if it is sewn up, but not if it is on the hairy scalp—this was on the forehead.</p>

On Monday morning, 12th Sep<lb/>tember, about ten minutes to 7, I was walking down Queen-street; I saw a man standing at the corner of Thames-street and Queen-street—he appeared to be watching me—I was on the left-baud side coming down, and he was on the opposite side of the street—I crossed Thames-street, and went down Three Cranes'-lane, leaving the man in the same place—I stopped there two or three minutes, came back again, and he was gone—I went up College<lb/>hill, looked down Maiden-lane, and saw Messrs. Franks' warehouse doors standing open; I also saw a horse and cart going down the lane towards Garlic-hill—there were two men at the side of the cart, and two more rather at the back—Church-alley is about twenty pieces from Mr. Franks' door, and runs parallel with Garlic-hill—I ran back into Thames-street in order to meet them—when I got up to Garlic-hill I found the cart standing, and the men had disappeared—I left a man in charge of the carl, and ran round through several of the courts, but I could not find the men—I did not run down Sugar-loaf-court—that is almost a continuation of Maiden-lane; the men might have gone down there without my seeing them—I then took the horse and cart back to the warehouse—I found that the cart contained six bags of tea and this horse-cloth—it was a chestnut horse with a few white hairs on its face, blind with one eye, and rather lame of it* near foreleg—there were five bags filled with tea standing in the ground floor of the ware-house, and on them were five <hi rend="italic">jemmies</hi>, a coat, and a hammer—I sent for the sergeant, and he came down, and examined the doors—one of the men I saw with the cart was without his coat—the prisoner appears to be about the height of one of the men who was behind the cart with the man without his coat—he appeared to be about the same height as the back of the cart, or rather higher—the tail-board was up.</p>

I am going on for thirteen years of age—I am in the employment of Mr. Dean, wholesale stationer, of 32, Great Carter-lane, Doctor's Commons—William Freeman was also in his employment—on 9th December Freeman and I were engaged in wheeling a baud truck along the Old Bailey, towards Skinner-street, it contained ten reams of paper—I was on the left-hand side of the truck, the side next the kerb, and Freeman was on the other side—there is a cross-bar at the end of the handle, so that each could pull—we were scraping the kerb as we pulled it along—a cart was standing at the other side of the road, against the kerb, at the London coffee-house, with the horse's head towards Ludgate-hill—when we got abreast of that cart I saw the prisoner driving a two-horse van, laden with goods—he was five or six yards off when I first noticed him—deceased and I called out, "Stop!"loudly, because there was danger; if we could have got by we could have gone into Lavington's, the carrier's gateway—there was not room for the van to go by when we were abreast of the cart—the prisoner kept driving on, he was going at a moderate, quiet pace, walking; the fore wheel of the van struck the iron part of the wheel of the truck; we called out again, "Stop a minute, and we will back, "and we reversed the truck a little, and then the front wheel of the van struck it again—the effect of that was to throw Freeman under the hind wheel of the van, with his head towards Ludgate-hill, and the cross-bar of the truck across his legs—it also threw me on the pavement—I got up and took the handle of the truck off Freeman; the hind wheel of the van had passed over him—the prisoner went on five or six yards further, he then pulled up and got off his van—a man named Seymour came and picked Freeman up; some policemen came up, and he was taken to the hospital—I ran home and told my master—our truck was scraping the kerb when this happened—the cart on the other side remained standing all the time—the pace of the van was not slackened at all from the time I first saw it.</p>

On 9th December, I was on duty at the end of the Old Bailey, by Ludgate-hill, regulating the traffic—I heard some one cry out, "Stop!"—I turned round, and saw the off wheel of the van catch the off wheel of the truck—the next instant the deceased was drawn under the hind wheel, and it immediately went right over his leg—I should say there was time for the prisoner to have pulled up, from the pace at which he was going—if he had pulled up the instant the cry was raised, he might have had time—I was from twenty to twenty-five yards off when I saw this—the prisoner stopped his van after the occurrence, got down, and gave me his name and address.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Manor-street, Old Kent-road—I am a cab driver and proprietor—on 9th December, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Old Bailey, driving a four-wheeled cab behind a Pickford's van, which the prisoner was driving—it was going slowly, steadily along, and I was following it—there was a cart on the near side, and a truck coming up on the right-hand side—a man was drawing it—as the van got to the truck, the truck stopped, just by Lavington's yard, and before the van had got quite by, the man pulled and twisted the truck to get it out-of the gutter, and twisted the neck of the truck between the hind wheel of the van; by so doing he fell down, and was run over—I called out to the man to stop, and he stopped instantly, just as it went over him, in about two and a half yards—I did not bear any body call out from the truck—I have been a driver of cabs and omnibuses all my life—in my judgment, the prisoner could not have prevented what occurred—it was very slippery under foot that day—I called out about half a second after the wheel went over the man, not before—the man was down and the wheel over him in a second—if the deceased had stood still and not endeavoured to get his truck forward, the van would not have touched him, it would have been able to pass by.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Barber, a boiler maker, who occupies rooms at 4, Cahir-street—Mr. Cannon is the landlord—I know Patrick Smith—he lives at England Cottages—I also know Mr. and Mrs. McGeehan, who live in Kingsbridge-place—they are in the same line of business as my husband—on Saturday evening, 3d December, Patrick Smith and my husband and I, went to Mrs. McGeehan's—it' was nearly 12 o'clock when we got there—we stopped there about half an hour—there was a person named Connolly there—Smith and my husband and myself walked home together as far as the corner of England Cottages, where there is a pillar post letter-box—when we got to that corner we stopped walking to bid good-night; and while doing so, I saw two policemen on the opposite side of the road—one of them crossed the road—that was Aaron Clares—he pushed Smith in the neck, and asked him what he was doing at that hour of the night—he gave him a good push—my husband said, "If you were doing your duty you would not do that"—Claret then turned and struck my husband on the mouth—the other policeman, the prisoner, then walked across the street with his baton in his hand—I then said to my husband, "James, run"—the prisoner might be then about a yard from him, or less,</p>

               <p>and Smith was nearer to him than I was—on my saying, "James, run," the prisoner said, "I will do for you," and struck me on the temple with his baton—I said that I was killed—I should have fallen, but for Smith—I told my husband again to run or they would kill him—he was running backwards towards Cahir-street, keeping the police off him—they were following him—he might hate run backwards three or four yards—he then turned and ran—the two policemen followed him up, and I went up after him to Cahir-street—the policemen were standing at the corner of Cahir-street when I got up—I heard them say, "She is coming; watch where she goes, and we will find the Irish b,----"so I went past my own street, and went against the Great Eastern public-house, but they would follow me—I was then getting weak, and turned back to my own street, they still following me—I went down Cahir-street to No. 4, and the two policemen were close upon me when I went in at my own door—my husband was at home then—there was some conversation in the passage with Mr. Cannon, the landlord, and I saw my husband leave the house for a doctor as soon as I went in—I saw nothing in my husband's hand—he went out—I think the door was on the jar—I went to the door some minutes afterwards and saw the two policemen attack him again—they had their batons in their hands—I ran out crying for him to run, and Mrs. Reid came to me in the middle of the street, and asked me what was the <hi rend="italic">to do—she</hi> took me in again, and Mr. and Mrs. Reid took me to Mrs. McGeehan's as soon as Mrs. Reid had her bonnet and things on—we left the house together in about ten minutes—when we got to Mrs. McGeehan's my husband was there—I did not see his watch at that time—I then went in a cab to Poplar Hospital—my husband went with me, and was in my sight—they washed my head there and shaved the hair off the cut—they went to put strapping on it, but it would not stick—it had stopped bleeding when I went there, but it began to bleed again—Mr. Serjeant dressed it on the Sunday morning—that was the first time it was dressed—he told me to go to bed, and I did so at Mrs. McGeehan's—I believe I was in bed a week; some days—it might be four days before I went out of doors, I went to the Thames Police-court—I cannot say on what day—I do not think I had been out of doors between the Sunday when I went to Dr. Serjeant's and when I went to the Thames Police-court—the shawl and apron which Mrs. McGeehan has are mine—I had them on on this night—I had not been drinking at all, nor had my husband, or Patrick Smith—they were sober—I received no violence that night, except from the defendant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 257). On Saturday night, 3d December, I was on duty at Millwall, and heard a disturbance about 2 o'clock in the morning; I am sure of the time; I looked at my watch—I was then near the Ironmonger's Arms, and proceeded to Cahir-street, about 150 yards off—I was by myself—I saw Barber come away from No. 4, and knock Brown down with a poker or a bar of iron—he was nine or ten yards from No. 4—he only gave one blow; that felled him, and he was senseless—I ran after Barber, who ran away, and tried to catch him—there was a lamp close by—my truncheon was in my pocket—I saw no truncheon in Brown's hand—I did not see him use one; on my oath I saw no truncheon in the hand of any man or woman that night—I did not see Smith or the two Barbers that night, till I saw Barber at 12 o'clock—I saw a woman in the street at the time the prisoner was struck, but cannot say whether it was Mrs. Barber or not—I had not seen Brown before that—I had not been in any public-house that night—I had not been standing anywhere in Cabir-street with Brown that night—I did not catch Barber—I turned into Cahir-street, but could not find Brown—I went a little further up towards the public-house, and a man whistled out of Mare's yard, in consequence of which I went and found Brown bleeding very much—he appeared shaken, and very weak, I had to lead him to the station—blood was running from his head; he was covered with blood—when I got to the station I made a charge, and the particulars were taken down by the inspector—I think it was on the 7th that we first went to the Police-court, when the charge of assault was made by Brown—the inspector went too—I was not present when anything was done on the 7th—mine is the nearest beat to his; when I go this way he goes the other—my beat takes me about an hour and twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Inspector K</hi>). I have been in the police nearly twenty-two years and inspector over eleven years—Clares came to my office at the station at a little after three in the morning, and in consequence of his information I went to 4, Cahir-street with Somers, Edwin Cleave, and the other witnesses—we found Mrs. Reid there—I immediately asked for Barber, and she said that he was not at home—I went into the passage and said, "What is this blood doing here?"—it was just outside the parlour door—she said that Barber and his wife had been fighting—I am sure those were her words—she did not make a word of complaint at that time of any assault by a constable on Mr. Barber—with that information I left and posted two men not to leave the house during the night, but to apprehend Barber—on complaint being made to me of an assault on the police, I im<lb/>mediately take the complaint down or tell them to write to the Commis<lb/>sioners—I took down what Clares told me on this occasion, and made a report to the superintendent—the usual course is to go to the inspector and make a report—I made a report to that effect to the Commissioner—I ap<lb/>plied to the Commissioner for a warrant, as we could not apprehend Barber—that application caused delay, and at the moment the constable was able to attend the police-court I directed him to go there—the usual course was adopted on this occasion, the Magistrate declined to issue a warrant but granted a summons, and at the end of the time they returned it, but there was no person there, I then applied to the Magistrate for a warrant; that was about ten days afterwards—it was obtained then—Brown was very weak, before he could apply to the Magistrate I had to wait for the surgeon to certify that he was fit—I have known him some years in the police, and ten months in Poplar—he bears an excellent good character in the force.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a labourer of 12, Maxey-road, Plumstead—on 6th November, about 11 o'clock, I was going home with my wife—we heard some angry words near the King's Arms, and saw the prisoner there disputing with Mr. Campbell, who he said owed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw him knock Campbell down, and before he had time to get properly on his feet he knocked him down again—I went up to Campbell and asked him whether he' was hurt—he told me his leg was broken—I went to the Arsenal for a stretcher, and they went to the police-court—the prisoner called on me a week afterwards, and said that he would pay for my loss of time if I would speak on his behalf.</p>

I am servant to Robert Montgomery, of Sydenham—on Tuesday, 13th December, at 5 o'clock, I put two sheets and a table<lb/>cloth on a line in the back garden to dry—there is a gate leading from the backgarden to the front—at about a quarter to 6 I heard footsteps pass the side-door—I went out, and found that the clothes were gone—I went to the gate, and saw a person with a bundle, about six yards from the house, going towards the village—I saw a policeman with the prisoner next day, and believe her to be the same woman—I called a girl, who traced her to Wells-road, and then gave information to the police—her walk and her figure make me believe she is the same person—I saw the articles next day in the policeman's possession, in the prisoner's house—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them.</p>

On the 14th he came to my place, between 10 and 11, and said, "What bundle is that?"I said, "Some bread and potatoes for my children's supper"—he said "There have been some things lost in the neighbourhood, and I believe you have got them, I shall make it my business to have your place searched." He went and found the things on the landing, and then had me up; 1 said, "Why should you have me; he said, "If there were one hundred I should have you, and if you do not come out directly I will put a rope round your neck and drag you out." I went, and he said to the sergeant, "Do not you know her figure and walk?" He said, "No; in and this man said, "Any evidence will do against her, she is a ticket-of-leave, and is condemned already. There is no ground for my being taken up except that I am a ticket-of-leave. I have been two years and seven months away, and a month here waiting for my trial.

Woolwich—he is a very respectable man—he asked Burley if he should get him any legal assistance—he said, "No; I shall not require it; I shall plead guilty to receiving a load or two, and try and get it settled here"—on the 20th, I apprehended Malem at the Dockyard at work—I told him I wished him to go with me to see the man who he had offered some coals to on the 9th—I took him to the Prince of Wales, and there showed him to Thomas Burley, who was a waiter there—I believe he is another brother of the prisoner Burley's—Thomas Burley said, "That is the man who offered me the coals on Friday"—Malem did not say anything—I then charged him with stealing a quantity of coals belonging to the Government—he said, "I shall speak the truth about it; the first day that I was carting coals to the Hospital the private soldier, who was taking the tickets, said, 'You must find a shop to put away a few tons'—I did not want to have anything to do with it till after I had seen Steve Burley, and on Thursday, the 8th, I took him a ton load, and shot them in the shed, and Burley paid me in his house ten shillings for them—I went back to the wharf, and took another load to the hospital, and gave the two tickets and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the private soldier, who was taking the tickets, and the rest I spent in drink"—I then took him to the station—he commenced making the same statement before the sergeant—he was cautioned, and then he made the same statement two or three times—he seemed over anxious to make it—the 8th was Thursday—none of the other prisoners were present when Malem made that statement.</p>

Q.</hi> What time was this shirting pledged on 2d December? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think between 11 and 1—the policeman brought the prisoner into the shop some days afterwards—Mrs. Bonniface told roe that she sent Carter to pledge this piece on the Saturday evening—I think the policeman asked me what time Mrs. Bonniface had pledged the two pieces—I said it was about from 11 to 1 or 12 to 1—no conversation took place between the policeman and the shopman that I am aware of—the policeman asked the prisoner how she came by the property, and she said she bought the two pieces of Mr. Lainson—I don't remember what day she said; it might have been Friday, I don't know—I don't know which Mr. Lainson's she said she had bought it at, I think it was the one in High-street, Deptford; I would not swear—the assistant in our shop produced another piece at the policeman's request—my brother said at the time that he did not believe Mrs. Bonniface was the woman who pawned it—the policeman made no remark on that, that I recollect—there was no one else in the shop—I think the policeman told me there was another piece at Mr. Phillips's—I think that was in the prisoner's presence—Mrs. Bonniface has pledged things with us before many times, and taken them out again—I have known her a great number of years—I should always expect her to come back and fetch anything she pledged—I think she earns her living by going about to fairs; I only know that by hearsay—I did not hear the policeman say there was a lot more lost, and that Mrs. Bonniface was answerable for it.</p>

Crossley and Phillips's; I think that is nine yards too"—she said, "I know nothing about them"—I then took her to the police-station and sent for Mr. Lainson—he went with me and identified a portion of the property pledged at Mr. Sharp's—she said it was on the Saturday night that she had sent the piece to be pledged, and, I think, on the Friday afternoon that she pledged the piece which bore the mark—she first said it was in the fore part of the day that she pledged the thirteen yards at Mr. Sharp's—I asked Mr. Reed, in her presence, what time it was, and he said it must have been between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, to the best of my belief.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>was his duty to write out a requisition in the request-book for such articles as were required; he would then get those goods from the general stores department, and see them forwarded and directed—there is a counterfoil to the request-book which Fuller keeps—if I was not there he would write out a request on the counterfoil as well, but if I was there I should do it; he merely wrote it in my absence—I wrote both the entry, the request, and the counterfoil if I was there—I occasionally left a request signed in blank, if I had to go down the line; that would be filled up by the prisoner and checked by me on my return—I have seen an account of the stores which were found at Cudham; they were such a class of stores as were found in the locomotive department, and which would be delivered on requests.</p>

               <p>is part of his duties—there is a person named Marks who has bought the stores for seven or eight years past—the Directors conclude the contract, and Mr. Stratton, the general storekeeper of the line, receives the money.</p>

I am superintendent of the police of the South Western Rail way Company—I know Fuller as a labourer employed by the Company—on 2d September I went with Inspector Bushnall to a farm at Cudham, and found Smith living in the house with his wife and family—other labourers were on the farm—Fuller was then in custody—I searched the farm, and found two ten-gallon cans containing linseed oil, other cans containing tur<lb/>pentine and linseed oil, a five-gallon can of black japan, a fourteen-pound can of red paint, also, a cask of white lead, twenty-two and a half sheets of tin, a metal gong, and a large quantity of other property, as much as three of our very large horses could draw—I put it down as weighing two tons, or two and a half—I cannot give the value of the whole—I found a cart on the farm, and said, "Who made that cart, Smith?"—he said, "I did, I made every bit of it myself."—I said, "Are you sure?"—he said, "Yes, I am quite sure"—I said, "Smith, I do not want to deceive you, we have lost a two-wheel truck," and gave him as good a description of it as I could—he said, "Well, I made that cart all myself"—it was a rough-made cart, but the bottom of it, I have no doubt, was the bottom of our truck which we lost, though I had no one with me to identify it—I examined the cans, and saw the remains of a brass plate which had been taken off, which bore a number containing the name of the stations, and "L. &amp; S.W.R."—on other cans there was "L. &amp; S.W.R." only, and there are the remains of those tablets—I hired a cart, and took the property away the same night—I went to the farm on the Tuesday following—after asking Smith's wife whether there was any<lb/>thing in the house, I went into the shed where the carts had stood the previous day, turned over a lot of things, and found another ten-gallon can empty, and three ten-gallon tubs, which oil had been in, and which had been there the previous day, had been broken up.</p>

I am a carpenter in the service of the South Western Rail way Company—I know Fuller—I recollect a truck having been made for Fuller more than twelve months ago—it is my duty to brand all the trucks for the Company's use—I was about to brand this truck about 5th October, twelvemonth, to put the Company's initials on it—I was branding some work to go to a station down the line, and Fuller passed me—I went down to him and said, "Shall I brand this truck!"—he said, "No, you have nothing to do with this truck, it is making for the me of the stores, you mind your own business"—I did not brand it—I have seen the cart that is here—to the best of my belief it has some of the materials of that truck about it—the tail board is hung by a pair of back flaps that was made to keep it from falling—I don't know anything about the axle or boxes or wheel!—I did not make the truck.</p>

I am the daughter of Mrs. Somers, who keeps the Duke of Clarence public-house, St. Pancras-road—on Saturday morning, 10th December, a cab drove up, and three men came into the bar—I recognise Harrison—(<hi rend="italic">Goldstine was placed at the bar</hi>)—that was one of them—I don't recollect Streeton; there was a third man—the cabman came in, had something to drink, and went out directly—Harrison asked me if I could take in a large bundle, and I refused—he then asked me if I would mind it while they fetched a cab to go to the railway—I refused, because they had a cab outside—I afterwards told them they might leave it in a corner if one of them would mind it, as our man was busy at work—a parcel in a wrapper was then brought in and put in a corner, and Goldstine re<lb/>mained with it—I saw two pieces of cloth—I had occasion to go out of the bar, and when I came back Goldstine was not there—my mother came down and asked me who the bundle belonged to—I said to a gentleman at the bar—Goldstine then came in, and I saw rather a light piece of cloth—I asked him if it was a lady's knickerbockers dress—he said no, it was gentleman's cloth—I then saw him take one or two pieces of cloth out with him—my mother was at the window; she called me, and I saw him go into No. 38 St. Pancras-road, which is close by our house—there is a shop there; the shutters were up—the shop was not occupied—I believe there were some people living in the house—Goldstine afterwards came back, took the re<lb/>mainder of the cloth, and I saw him go into the house again—the police-officers called shortly afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>, G.) On Saturday, 10th De<lb/>cember, I went with Ranger to the Duke of Clarence, and afterwards to Golden-square—Goldstine and the property were then at the station—I said to the prisoners, "You are all three charged with being concerned, with another man now in custody at Clerkenwell Police-station, with having in your possession a large quantity of cloth, supposed to be stolen"—at that time there was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—Harrison said, "I know nothing of it"—on our road to the Vine-street station, Gordon said, "We brought it from the Goswell-road"—Sydney-street runs from Goswell-road—I lodged them at the station, and went with the cabman to the house in Sydney-grove—I there found a coat, which has been identified by the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gordon.</hi> I told Potter that Streeton told me the cloth came from Gos-well-road.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harrison's Defence.</hi> The only evidence against me is my getting into the cab containing the stolen property. I will explain how I came to be there. I was walking down Carnaby-street, and was stopped by a man named Fisher. He called a cab, and drove me to the Prince of Prussia. On being asked inside I went with him to Lower John-street, where Goldstine was. I then went with them to the other public-house, and I was asked by them to ask if a parcel might be left there, and I did, not knowing the property was stolen. I wish my employer to speak as to my character. I believe he is in Court. The woman living in Berkeley-street positively said at the Police-court that she did not know the other man who came, and now she says that she believes it was me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gordon's Defence.</hi> I am a barman. I left home about four months ago, and had plenty of money, which I had saved. I have never been in such a place before, and when I get out I will never come again. I can assure you I am innocent. I was walking in Carnaby-street, and met Streeton, and he said, "Will you have a ride?"He called a cab, and going along, I said to him, "What have you here?" He said, "Cloth." I said, "Where did you get it from?" He said, "From the Goswell-road." When we got to Poland-street we met Harrison, and he said, "You are to drive to Golden<lb/>square." They then said, "You had better ride outside," and I did. After we got to the Duke of Clarence, they took the cloth inside, and treated the cabman. I then said, "I am going home to dinner." Streeton said, "We</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501110121"/>
               <p>are going all the same way, we are going to the Prince of Prussia, Golden<lb/>square, because I have a friend to meet." We went there, and waited, and Inspector Potter came and charged all of us with the robbery, which I am innocent of. It was committed by Streeton and another man named G. Fisher, as I have heard since I have been in the House of Detention. I never saw the cabman till I saw him in Carnaby-street, neither did I give him any cloth, on my oath. The cloth was taken to Goldstine's place at King's-cross.</p>

From information I received I went on 10th December about half-past 10 to the Duke of Clarence public-house, and then to 38, St. Pancras-road—I knocked at the door, which was opened by a little girl—as I was going down stairs I heard some one coming down from up stairs—I came back, and saw the prisoner—I asked him whether he had received a quantity of property that morning from three men—he said, "No"—I told him that I was a police-officer, and I should go up stairs and search his room—he said, "My God! you will be the ruin of my family"—I went up stairs with him, and when we got to the first-floor front room he gave me the key to unlock the door—I asked him whether he lived there, be said, no, he hired a room there—I found about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cloth, I should think, in the room, in pieces, and some coats—this cloth which is now produced is some of it, also this coat, and another coat—I believe one coat has been worn, Mr. Terry has the other on—I found two new coats, and two which had been in wear—I told him I should take him in custody for having a quantity of cloth in his possession—the cloth was put into a cab, and I called a cab for the prisoner—he said to me in the cab, "I am going to buy this cloth of three men, I am to give 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I have paid a half-sovereign off of it"—there is a shop to this house, shut up—there are other people living in the house, downstairs—I did not see the name of Goldstine outside—there was no furniture what<lb/>ever in the room-having taken the prisoner I went down to Golden-square and apprehended the other men.</p>
