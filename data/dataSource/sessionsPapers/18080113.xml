               <p>Q. Had you occasion to go to Islington on the 16th of October. - A. Yes. I cannot say what day it was; it was about the beginning of October; between eleven and twelve o'clock I came down Goswell street, I turned down Fann street into <placeName id="t18080113-1-crimeloc4">Bridgwater Gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you retire with them to any private apartment. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any liberty or any familiarity with them when they were there. - A. No; we did not stop there two or three minutes; when we came out in the street I had a conversation with them about three or four minutes. I stopped about three or four minutes, and one of them left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their persons at that time, so as to distinguish one from the other. - A. I cannot say I did, I was a little in liquor; after the other woman left me I stopped about three minutes with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she leave you or you her. - A. She left me. I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any liberties with her. - A. No, I did not touch her; I have no recollection of either of their persons, I never saw them before. When I was going to bed I missed my watch. I went to bed about half an hour after I went home; it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch before you saw the prisoner. - A. I had my watch when I was in the gin shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the watch again. - A. I saw it again at Worship street. I knew it to be mine.</p>

I laid hold of him; and then he said it was his partner's plow. I said I would take him to the owner, if that was his partner; I called this young man out, and he owned the plow directly.</p>

On the 18th of December, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came in my shop, she said she wanted a gown; I showed her what I had.

               <p>Q. Did you get the gown again. - A. Yes; that very evening, about half past nine, I found her in a public house with my gown upon her back. She was taken to the watchhouse with my gown on her.</p>

            . I went with the last witness' husband on the 18th of December in the evening, to the sign of the Angel, opposite Whitechapel church; there we found Mrs. Ward and the prisoner in a strong dispute; Mrs. Ward told me that the gown that the prisoner had got on was her gown. I took her in custody and put her in the watchhouse; I insisted of her taking the gown off and putting her own gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her own gown about her at that time. - A. No, she sent for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any of your property from your house on the 30th of December last. - A. Yes, I lost a ten pound note, from my tea chest; I had seen it there the day before; I remember turning the key of the lock, but I did not try to see if it was locked; I left it in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other notes in the chest. - A. I had two tens, besides the one I speak of; a five and some other small notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you perceive that one of your notes were missing. - A. On Wednesday the 30th, about four or five o'clock; I found my tea chest open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count all the notes that were in the tea chest when you opened it between four and five o'clock on the Tuesday. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that one out of the number of the ten pound notes was missing. - A. I am sure that one of the ten pound notes were missing, and likewise a one, I believe but I will not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a ten pounds bank of England note. - A. It was; the prisoner was my <rs id="t18080113-4-deflabel22" type="occupation">errand boy</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you understand before that that he was to leave your service. - A.

               <p>Q. Was the tea chest ever taken out of the house before you missed the note. - A. No, it remained in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. Yes, in his master's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the master present. - A. I do not remember that he was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to tell if he did the act. - A. No, we just asked him if he knew any thing of the robbery; he said, that he had taken the ten pound note, that a helper belonging to Mr. Verney's yard gave him the keys to open the chest, and he gave him the ten pound note; at the second examination before the magistrate, he said he changed the ten pound note with Mr. Strachn, in Swallow-street; Mr. Strachn was sent for, he swore before Mr. Brodie that he never saw the boy; the next time he was examined, he said he had tore it to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the helper. - A. The helper was taken up and discharged on the second examination; there was nothing found on him.</p>

               <p>Q. He says that you told him if he would produce the ten pound note you would acquit him. - A. No such a thing, I never promised nor threatened him; he said, that he had certainly robbed his master of a ten pound note and a one pound note; he shewed me the tea chest; he said out of that, I took out the ten pound note and the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He told me that if I would say I had the ten pound note he would acquit me; and being frightened, I said I had the note; I did not know who to bring in that had it of me. On the night I left my master they were all merry making; I left the shop before my usual time; I was afraid of coming to the shop in the morning; I went down to Mr. Porter. My father told me to go back to my master; I went back along with my father to my masters shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the prisoner had an opportunity of taking the note, if he had been so disposed; and instead of staying at his master's shop till eight o'clock on that evening, his usual hour, he went away about four o'clock, and did not return till his father brought him back to his master's shop; that is the part of the evidence which presses mostly upon him; he has varied in the account he gave before the magistrate; you have heard his defence. If you are of opinion that he stole the note you will find him guilty; on the other other hand, the note not being found upon him, nor traced to the hands of any person; if you are not sufficiently satisfied that he stole the note you will then acquit him.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went out did you fasten the door and windows. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the lower window fastened. - A. The prisoner was a lodger in the lower room; I lived in the one pair of stairs room; I fastened my one pair of stairs door when I went out, and the key of my padlock I took with me; I am sure I locked my door; there are only two rooms in the house; I came home about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130005"/>o'clock, I went into the Cock and Neptune opposite of my house; the prisoner came to me; he says, you have left your door open; I said no, I am sure I have not; it is a thing that I never do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you are certain that you had locked the door, because it was your custom, or are you sure that you did lock it at that time. A. I am certain that I did. I asked the servant of the public house to go to my room and see if it was; fastened, she did, and returned and said it was; when I went home, I observed the padlock had not been picked, it was locked; I observed that the staple had been pulled out; I went into my room, I found my drawers open and the corner of this pillow case was out of the corner of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawer was partly open was it. - A. Yes, it was broken open; I cried out, I am robbed; I went down stairs to call for assistance, Mrs. O'Hara, my neighbour, told me I could do nothing at that time of night, to make myself as comfortable as I could and tomorrow to go and see after my property I went immediately to my drawer; I missed a silver watch, two silver seals, a pair of silver salts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the silver salt cellars. - A. I gave thirty five shillings for them; the silver pepper box I gave one pound eighteen shillings for it; I missed that and a pair of silver table spoons, they are worth about thirty shillings, and a silver mustard pot two pound, a pair of silver salt spoons I gave fourteen shillings for them; the two silver seals were marked with E. P.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen these things before you went out. - A. I put the watch in the draw from off the mantle piece, and then I saw all the other articles there just before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged with you. - A. A month and three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever been in your room where you left the things. - A. On the Sunday morning his wife was very ill, he came in the room and asked me to lend him a spoon for some company that he had; I looked for a pewter spoon, I could not find it; I went to the drawer; I gave him one of the silver spoons, I said Mr. Davey, I will beg of you to take care of this spoon till you return it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he standing at that time, when you opened your draw. - A. At my room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see where you took it from. - A. Yes, my drawer fronts the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so situated that he could see what was in the drawer. - A. Yes, it was the middle drawer he could see.</p>
               <p>Q. This you say was on Sunday morning - on what day did you miss the goods. - A. On Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides the prisoner on the Wednesday. - A. Nobody but him.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a married man, I suppose his wife lived with him. - A. Yes, they lived together, she was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was out was he. - A. My husband is at sea, and there was no person left in my room when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade does the prisoner carry on. - A. He is a journeyman carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things again. - A. The next morning Mr. Grindel brought all the things forward that I lost; they are here. The prisoner took the two seals off the watch, and had them up his coat sleeve; I saw them the same day they were found, with the duplicates. I saw the officer search him in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out at four o'clock on the 17th of December. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it, light or dark. - A. Darkish; I could distinguish any body.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell what time the property was stolen. - A They were pawned between six and seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Court. That you cannot know yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Monday night did not you set my wife's gown and petticoat on fire. - A. No, I never set any thing on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send me to pledge the goods to make up the affair between us. - A. No, I never clapped my eyes on you that day; the night before that if I had not gone down stairs just as I did, my place would have been on fire; you and your wife were both in liquor; she sate her own gown alight by smoking; I said to her, ma'am, your gown is on fire; I put it out myself, I came down by accident to get a pitcher of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you drinking all that evening till you was so drunk I was obliged to put you out of the room. - A. I never was in the room to drink any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I go to the magistrate to get a warrant and the magistrate would not grant a warrant - did you not take me to the Cock and Neptune and make me drunk, and you was drunk yourself. - A. No, I never saw you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tie up the things in your handkerchief, and tell me to pawn them for three pound; you told me they had been often there before, you told me not to tell any soul. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You called me up in the room in the morning, you asked me if I would be any thing towards making up your loss; I said I did not care if it cost me five pounds, so as you lost nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any truth in that. - A. No truth whatever; I never set sight of the man all the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever pledged any of these things. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you keep an house of ill fame. I was deluded to go and live with a woman that was not my wife; by this woman's persuading her she let me have the room. - A. I have not a creature in my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By being down at that house I have made all my friends my foes.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Shadwell office. On Thursday morning the 17th of December, Mrs. Sibley came down to our office and told us she had been robbed; I went with a brother officer; the prisoner was at home; he was some time before he would open the door, but he did open it at last; we told him he was the person that we suspected had robbed Mrs. Sibley. We asked him if he would give us leave to search him, he did. I found two duplicates upon him, which exactly answered to the property that was lost. We took him down to Shadwell office; my brother officer found the seals. I was not present.</p>

             told her she had left her door open.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it. - A. About eight o'clock; she said she was quite sure it was not, she had got the key in her pocket; she asked me if I would go and see; I said I was going out with my eight o'clock beer, I would look. I did go. I found the street door open; I tried the room door that Mrs. Sibley lives in, it was fast; I put my hand against it. I had no candle, I did not examine the lock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All that I have got to say in my own defence is, that this woman sent me to pawn the things; that we were drinking together on Monday night, and the greater part of Tuesday till the evening; she wanted some supper, I told her I had got no more money; she said if I would go and pawn the things she would have a good supper. I pawned the things for her; I told the pawnbroker my name and where I lived. We went to a house, we had a goose and half a pig, but where it was I do not know. The next morning she called me up, and said she was robbed; I thought she was in joke, as the things were pawned, because she told me I was not to say any thing to any body about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN - You must be satisfied in the first place of the prisoner having broken open the apartment of this woman, and that it was so dark that the face of a man could not be distinguished. By her own account she went out at four o'clock. We have no means of knowing the precise time when these goods were taken, if they were taken; - it might be two or three minutes after she went out, or it might be two hours after she went out. The best way is to take it the most favourable to the prisoner, and that this was not done when the face of a man was easily mistaken. Then the main point to consider is this - whether he stole the goods or not; - that these goods were pledged by this man is quite clear, and he does not deny it. - On the part of Mrs. Sibley she would have you believe that this man must have taken the goods, because he pledged them; - on the other hand the prisoner would have you to believe that is not the case, but that they were given to him by her to pledge; that this woman gets drunk, and that it is a house of ill fame. That it is a disorderly house the pawnbroker has proved it. - He further stated, that she set his wife's gown and petticoat on fire, after having been drinking together; they had a quarrel, and they were to have a supper to make it up; that is the account he gave. - It is remarkable that the watch was found at the pawnbroker's, accompanied with all the other things; the seals to be sure were found in his pocket; that is a circumstance which appears as if he was acting for himself, and that he was doing business for himself, and not for another, because he put the seals in his pocket; he did not go to a pawnbroker at a considerable distance, but one that is near, and where in fact he is known; that is a circumstance in his favour; add to this he gave the pawnbroker his name and where he lived. The pawnbroker said that he did understand there had been words, and that was the occasion of his pawning the articles. - The officer found these two seals in his pocket, which is a symptom that he had taken them; these he converted to his own use. - If you think there is sufficient said upon the testimony of the prosecutrix to be satisfied that he was the person who did break this door, enter the room, and take the goods against her inclination and pawned them, then you will find him guilty of stealing in the dwelling house to the value of more than forty shillings. The prisoner so far from concealing his name, he pawned them in his own name, and to a pawnbroker in the neighbourhood. Another circumstance in his favour - she has told you she had never parted with any part of these goods; whereas it does appear by the pawnbroker that she had pawned the watch. - If you are of opinion there was a matter of dispute to be settled between him and her, she wishing to make it up, and at her desire a sum of money was to be raised on these goods, and that he pledged them for that purpose - if you are satisfied that you are upon good grounds that he did not actually steal the goods, you will upon that acquit him.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you know of her coming to your master's house. - A. Yes, on Friday the 20th of November, about five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she come for. - A. A half pint tin pot; I believe it came to three pence, she gave me a shilling, I gave her change; then she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the shilling before you put it into the till. - A. I did, there was a black kind of grease upon it, I put it into the till; in the course of that evening Mr. Masterman shewed me that shilling, and said it was a bad one; I recollected it was the shilling that I took of the prisoner; there were but three shillings that I had in the till besides.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not that black and greasy appearance, had they. - A. There were three or four shillings in the till but none of them having that appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that shilling. - A. I put it in the ink-stand in the accompting-house. This is the shilling (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her coming to your house again on Monday the 23d of November. - A. Yes, then she asked for a metal spoon, that came to three pence; then she tendered me a bad shilling, (I produce it.) I detained her and told Mr. Masterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that she was the same person that came on the Friday before. - A. Yes, I had seen her several times before that in our shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes. On the 15th of December, she came in and asked for a lodging; I refused her three times, she told me she was a relation of Mr. Hanson's a publican that I knew; I took her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her the next morning. - A. Yes, she came down stairs about nine o'clock, she breakfasted in the bar with my family.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did your family consist of that she breakfasted with. - A. We breakfasted before she came down; there were the maid and two of the children in the bar when she came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they continue the whole time the prisoner was at breakfast. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she set after breakfast. - A. Till about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you between nine and eleven o'clock. - A. I was in the bar almost the whole of the time, except going into the tap room to take a pint or a pot of beer, and the children and the maid they were in and out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the prisoner left the house. - A. I was just gone into the tap room with a pint of beer; I did not stay there five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went from the bar into the tap room who did you leave in the bar. - A. I left the prisoner alone in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that had she been left alone to your knowledge. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your any money in this bar. - A. Yes, I fetched it down to pay the brewer; I expected the brewer in every minute; I brought down four score pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of it consist of gold. - A. I took out nineteen guineas in gold, for my distiller; sixty pounds I left in one bag, that was for the brewer.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you placed in the bar. - A. I had placed it in a cupboard in the bar; twenty pounds in one bag and sixty pounds in another; it was all in the cupboard at the time when I left the prisoner alone; the brewer had not called.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in the tap room did you go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130008"/>into the bar again. - A. Yes. I was not gone five minutes; when I returned she was gone. I found nobody there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she before signified her intention of going. - A. She said before, she wondered a gentleman had not called upon business, she was an independent gentlewoman at Richmond; she had not paid her reckoning, that made me distrust that she had taken my money. When I missed her I looked into my cupboard directly; I found twenty pounds was gone, and the bag with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not described the gold that was in the bag. - A. Twelve guineas in gold, and fourteen half guineas and one shilling; I am sure that was the contents of the bag. When I perceived this money was gone I was very much alarmed, I called my daughter down stairs; some people at the door heard me, they came in, and she was pursued; my maid and some of my neighbours went after her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go after her. - A. No, I did not; she was taken in less than an hour by Mr. Newman's servant; they took her to the magistrate, I saw her there. When I went into the room at the magistrate's I sat down, she came to me and went down upon her knees; she said, oh, my dear Mrs. Potter here is your money that I robbed you of, I ask forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to her before that. - A. I never spoke to her before that; she gave me the bag and the money; I took it out and told it, it was right, and the bag contained the twelve guineas; I cannot be positive as to say that there was the exact quantity of half guineas; I was flurried; they told it out, and they told me it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bag that the money was in. - A. In their giving me the money I put it in my pocket, and I was going home; I dropped the bag, I did not think the bag was of any consequence as I had got the money. I begged forgiveness for her; Dr. Glasse would not let her go, he asked for the money; I gave it him. I should have taken care of the bag if I had known it had been of any consequence; but as she gave me the money I took no notice of the bag.</p>

When I came up to the prisoner, I asked her whether she had slept at Brentford last night, she said no; I told her I thought she had, and she must be the person that robbed the widow woman at the public house, and she must go back with me; I took her back a little way to meet Mrs. Potter's servant maid, to know whether it was the right person or not; she said she was. I sent for the constable and took her to Dr. Glasse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took her to Dr. Glasse did you stay there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise of forgiveness if she would confess. - A. No, nor any body else that I heard, no more than Mrs. Potter wished Dr. Glasse to forgive her.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed. - A. Directly Mrs. Potter came into the room she was very ill, the prisoner immediately came to Mrs. Potter and downed upon her knees, and put the money into her hand in a bag, then the money was taken out of the bag; Mrs. Potter first told it; I believe she said it consisted of the same money that she had lost; the prisoner said nothing but begged for mercy of Mrs. Potter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say whose money it was when she put it into Mrs. Potter's hands. - A. He said it was Mrs. Potter's money.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are you sure that the prisoner at the bar is the same person. - A. Yes.</p>

             BUTLEN. I produce the money; I saw it in the office in Marlborough-street, of which I am chief clerk; I received it in the presence of Dr. Glasse and Mr. Brodie; it was laid down on the table in a piece of paper; I was directed by Dr. Glasse to take it up and put it in the paper. I did and Dr. Glasse wrote his name upon it; I put this office seal upon it directly.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I was present when the money was delivered to Mr. Butler.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Butler open it and see what it consists of. A. Twelve guineas, fourteen half guineas and one shilling; there was one guinea which Mrs. Potter thought she could swear to particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Potter look at that money, do you know any particular piece of money among it. - A. Yes, I can swear to this guinea, only by the crook.</p>
               <p>Q. Another guinea might be the same. - A. Another might be the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mrs. Potter when you received the money in the bag, did you know that bag to be yours. - A. Yes, it was the same bag; I should not have dropped the bag but I did not know any thing would occur further.</p>

               <p>Q. to Brooke. What month was it, December or November. - A. It was December.</p>
               <p>Broad. It was the 22nd of December, between the hours of one and two; I was going to my dinner, I saw both the prisoners lurking from one shop to the other, they were going into the different shops and asking the price of things and not purchasing.</p>
               <p>Q. That you could hardly tell, you were in the street. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you only saw the prisoners go in and out of the shops. - A. Yes, exactly so; they went into one shop within a door of my master's shop; they tried on gloves, they stopped there what time I cannot say; I saw them come out and go to the prosecutor's house, and they looked through the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go to any other shop. - A. They went to several shops, I saw them go in, but I saw them in the glover's; I saw the prisoner Humphry look through the window, and Brown went in; I saw nothing in his possession when he went in, but when he came out I saw a bundle of black velveteen under his arm, without any covering or paper at all; he touched me in passing. Humphry remained at the window till Brown had passed the corner of Compton-street, opposite to where the prosecutor's house is; then Humphry followed Brown, after he had passed Compton-street, and looked upon all sides of the way, as if he did not know which way to go; I saw no more of him for some hours, he went down to St. Giles'.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go the same way as Brown. - A. I cannot say, he went in the same direction as Brown did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he followed Brown down the street he had gone. - A. Yes, in a direction down St. Giles's. I went to Mr. Brookes and told him what I had seen.

             was with me all the time; we went in search of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw the prisoners afterwards. A. At the bottom of Dyot-street; that might be six hours afterwards, it was quite dark, they were both together; I had been in pursuit of them the whole afternoon, I could not find them till this time. When I came to the bottom of Dyot-street the prisoner Humphry ran against me with a bundle in his hand, he met me full but, he was coming from St. Giles's into Dyot-street; I perceived a bundle in his hand in a blue handkerchief with white spots. I followed him to the Turk's Head, Dyot-street, they went in and stopped at the Turk's Head about a minute and a half; I did not go in. After they came out of there I watched them through the different streets, I cannot say the names of the streets. Humphry had the bundle in his hand; I watched them to the sign of the Horshoe in Bainbridge-street, it lies out to the bottom of Tottenham Court road as you go from Dyot-street. I immediately went and told a constable what the proceedings were. Poole was with me, Fusman the constable, and Poole and I went to the sign of the Horshoe in Bainbridge-street, we took two watchmen with us; we went in, I looked round the room, the room was full of people, they were dancing and fidling, that I could hardly perceive the prisoners. I came out again, I told Mr. Fusman I could not see him, the room was so full;

               <p>Q. Did you see any bundle there. - A. We told the watchman there was a bundle near to where they were sitting. I saw the prisoner take the bundle in the room. I had not seen the bundle after he got in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watchman afterwards with the bundle. - A. Yes, at the watchhouse: it was the same handkerchief, and it had the same appearance, it was a bundle in a blue and white handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners or both of them. - A. Both of them. In Compton-street was the first place that I saw them at; they went into a hosier's shop and tried on some worsted gloves; they came out of that shop, and they looked into other shops as they passed up the street. When they came to Mr. Brookes's, Brown opened the door and went in, without any thing under his arm.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did Brown remain in the shop. - A. About three minutes, or hardly so much; then he returned out with a bundle of black velveteen under his arm, without paper or any cover over it. I was on the opposite side of the way. On his coming out of the shop with it he went along the street with it as if he was going with a message.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did he pass by you. - A. About five or six yards, as near as I can judge; he went down the street on the other side of the way; I cannot recollect the name of it, although I know it so well.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Humphry. - A. He ran after him as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Humphry remain at the shop window before he followed. - A. About a minute and a half, and he was quite confused to know which way Brown went.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards went in search with Broad of the two prisoners. - A. Yes, It was about six hours before we discovered them; the first place that I saw them was at the bottom of Dyot street, that end which comes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130010"/>into St. Giles's, they were both together; Humphy had a bundle in a blue handkerchief with white spots in his hand; I followed them up Dyot-street; they went into the Turk's Head in Dyot-street, they staid there about a minute and a half; from there they went into the Horshoe in Bainbridge street, both together; Humphry had the same bundle then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you got assistance of the constable and watchman. - A. Yes; I went into the public house before the constable and watchman; I saw the prisoners, there were about fifty or sixty people drinking and dancing, men and women. Brown was sitting down and Humphry was standing up about a yard and a halt near to him; I pointed out the two prisoners to the constable, Broad took the prisoner Brown. I and Fusman took Humphry. The two watchmen were left to look for the bundle; they brought it to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Broad and Mr. Poole on the 22nd of December to the Horshoe in Bainbridge-street. - A. I did, I went along with Mr. Fusman, Broad and Poole; they took Brown and Humphry out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after they were taken out of the house find any bundle. - A. The constable desired me to look after the bundle. I went and took the bundle away and brought it to the watchhouse; that bundle was upon a form; it was wrapped in a blue handkerchief with white spots.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this form where the handkerchief was, to where Humphry's was sitting. - A. He was sitting close to it when I came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then supposing you to have said when you came in Humphry was sitting down by the bundle or close by it. - A. Close by it; I took it to the watchhouse and delivered it to Mr. Fusman, as soon as I came to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>- FUSMAN. You are a constable of St. Giles's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 22nd of December go with Broad and Pool to the Horshoe in Bainbridge-street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There the two prisoners were apprehended, I understand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Humphry when you went in. - A. I believe about two yards from where the bundle was found, he was standing in the room when I first saw him; there were about fifty or sixty people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got in the room did he set down. - A. No. I did not see him sitting at all. This is the bundle that was brought to me by Foley. (produced it.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Foley. You said Humphry was sitting when you first went in, which do you call Humphry. - A. The tall one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sitting or standing. - A. I cannot tell; I was the last that went in, he was the nearest person to the form where the bundle was, he was sitting, as nigh as I remember.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. But whether he was sitting or standing you do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Open the bundle and see whether there is any thing that you can speak to as being your own, or whether you have any reason for believing it to be your own - what is there in that bundle. - A. A remnant of velveteen, I believe it is two yards. There is no mark upon it by which I can certainly say it is my own; I produce part of it that was not stolen. On comparing them together they appear to me one piece, the breadth is exactly the same, and the substance and shade is the same; the dye is the same, and the quality appears to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment do you think they are parts of the same piece or not. - A. I do think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of the two yards. - A. A yard is three shillings and fourpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Are there any marks upon the piece that you have now brought that you would know it to be your particular property.</p>
               <p>Court. He has brought it from his own house, he must know it to be his own property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Yes; but are there any marks upon it that you should know it if it was out of your possession. - A. Yes, there is a cut to it.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the two yards there is no mark to it for you to know it by, how long have you had it. - A. I had it in my possession the evening before at seven o'clock; I bought it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Humphry's Defence. I went to Mr. Thomas, pastry cook, in Princes-street, about half after one; he asked me if I would go of a errand for him to the Seven Dials; I said I would. As I was going I met this lad in Compton-street, he went in and looked at a pair of gloves, he came out, and I left him at the corner of Frith-street; I never saw him no more till night.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. As I was standing at a shoe makers shop a man came up to me, he asked me if I would carry a parcel, he said he would give me a shilling; I said I would; I was to carry it to Covent Garden, and he would be after me at a public house; he came after me, I took it to the public house; he asked me if I knew the Horshoe in Bainbridge street, I told him no; he said if I would come there he would give me a shilling more, and when I went there at night an officer came and took me and this man.</p>
               <p>Humphry called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Brown called no witness to his character.</p>

No; I returned down, and the young woman that I had at work with me; as we came to the bottom of the stairs to go into the shop, we heard a clutter of the glass of the window; I ran to the window, I looked and missed a piece of gingham; the window was cracked a few days before; I had put a large cabinet against it; the glass was drawed out, it laid about a yard distant from the place. I shut up the shop directly and went to the pawnbrokers and I found three pieces of the gingham. It was whole when I lost it; the piece contained twenty nine yards. I bought it on the 2nd of January; I lost it on the 4th, I meant to return it, as it was dirty before I had it; I knew the pattern and the quality. I am positive it is the same. I found one piece in half an hour after it was taken; between eight and nine o'clock I found the next; the third piece was not found till the next day.</p>

               <p>Somers's Defence. Last Monday night was a week, this young woman and I were going to get something for supper; we met four girls, they asked us to have something to drink, we scrupled at first, at last we did; they asked us to pledge some cotton for them, we did; she went into Mr. Lane's, I went in with her, I went to Mr. Dobree's and pledged a piece for six shillings. I brought the money to them, and they gave us a shilling a piece. The next day this young woman had occasion to go to the pawnbrokers, they took her in custody. I delivered myself up.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What was the price of the whole piece. - A. I paid one shilling and ninepence a yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. - The two prisoners are indicted for a burglary, but with respect to the capital part of the charge, namely the burglary, it is an essential circumstance to constitute a burglary that the offence should be committed in the night. You find this offence, whoever it was committed by, was committed at half after four, or rather before that. At the time the robbery was committed the sun did not set till five minutes before four. It is not night, within the meaning of the law, till after twilight: as long as the light of the sun is remaining it is not night. It is a capital felony for any one to be found stealing in a dwelling house to the value of forty shillings; the value of the article stolen has not been valued at a great deal more than that; your enquiry is whether the case is brought home to either of the two prisoners, and whether you do not think it sufficient if you find them guilty at all, to find them guilty of stealing to the amount of thirty nine shillings only. That they are found in possession of part of the property is beyond a doubt and also of pledging it. One of them went to the pawnbrokers the next day, where she was apprehended, and the other prisoner coming to Bow-street, where she was apprehended, which is a circumstance for your consideration. It is for you to decide how far you think the prisoners were either or both of them innocent or guilty.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday I was sent for by Mr. Windus. On the 11th of December I apprehended the prisoner with his two brothers, about seven o'clock in the evening, I took them to Mr. Windus; I fetched Mr. Peto the pawnbroker, he pointed out the prisoner at the bar as being the person that pawned the time piece. The prisoner begged for mercy; he said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>

From suspicion, on the 22nd of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, I took an opportunity of watching them; I posted myself outside of the stable; I heard Hugger say to Wright, look out. Wright took his station at the door; Hugger went to the corn bin, and was filling his pocket; one of my servants was coming into the stable where they were; Wright gave Hugger a signal by a nod of his head; Hugger left off and pretended to be looking for a bottle. My servant left the stable, he only came for his whip; Hugger began filling his pocket again at the same place; then on two of my servants coming into the stable to finish the horsis, Wright gave Hugger the signal as before; I sent for a constable, he searched Hugger in my presence, he found upon him the chaff, oats, and beans in question, about a quart. They both acknowledged themselves guilty; said it was their first offence.</p>

On the 16th of December about seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at a watch; being engaged myself I directed my shopman to shew him one; the prisoner made an objection to a watch, and requested to see another, and while my man was gone to the window, he went out of the shop and took a watch with him; my man gave me the alarm; my man and Mr. Lydiard pursued after the prisoner, and they took him to Mr. Hillier's shop; I went over and saw my watch, I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>MR. HILLIER. I am a linen draper in Ludgate-street; I was in Mr. Miles's shop at the time this happened; the young was shewing him some watches, he made an objection to them; he went out of the shop as I thought to point to one, he did not; I pursued him, he ran into Union-street, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing found upon him. - A. The patrol searched him in my house, where he was taken to; the watch was found close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time. - A. He implored for mercy, and wished to see Mr. Miles alone; they went into my back shop together.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was he from the waggon, when you saw him with this truss. - A. About twenty yards from the waggon when I first saw him; and when I first saw him he was running; as soon as he saw me, he stopped running, and walked the rest part of the yard till he come to the gate; then he turned round to see if I followed him, and ran down Long-lane into Cloth-fair; I followed him; when I first met him in the Red Lion yard, the direction on the parcel was outermost; in Cloth-fair he shifted it next to his shoulder, so as nobody could see it; he came into Aldersgate-street, I followed him; when the prisoner came to Little Britain he made a bit of a stop, looked to see if there were any body after him, and then run as fast as he could, till he come into St. Ann's-lane; I collared him in St. Ann's-lane; I said you are a pretty rascal are not you, this property is not yours; he throwed the truss off his shoulder, said let me go, my master does not live far off; I said you shall not go from me; I took him and the truss into the Castle and Falcon, and had him secured; the truss has been in the constable's hands ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have been drinking a little to night. - A. No, I have not been drinking to night; I have had only one pint since dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before. - A. No, not till I saw him in Red Lion yard, and then my eyes were never off him till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted all the time you saw him his back was towards you. - A. No, he turned round and went on again; I saw his face at the Red Lion yard, when he passed me, and I saw his face in St. Ann's-lane; I can swear that is the lad.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fearn. On the 23d of December, about half past five o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop window, two other persons were with him; they said go in and take the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at that time, could you see. - A. No. I was sitting behind the counter; I could see all over the place; he came some way into the shop and took the waistcoat out; there was a pair of gaiters on the waistcoat; when he took the waistcoat the gaiters fell. I halloaed out, and the constable was on the other side of the way looking at him. The prisoner ran down Gun-square, and threw the waistcoat down; the constable caught him, it being no thoroughfare. I am sure he is the same person, he had a Belcher handkerchief on.</p>

I did not actually see him go in, I saw him come from the door, with the waistcoat in his hand. The two others that were with him held their coats out to shade the light, that no one should see what was done; the lad came out and cried give me my waistcoat; the prisoner made a turn, and threw the waistcoat down in Gun-square; I was quite close to him when he threw the waistcoat down. I watched his coming out of Gun-square; I knew it was no thoroughfare. I apprehended him; I have had the waistcoat ever since. The prisoner when I took him said he was the wrong person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any handkerchief about his neck. - A. He had a Belcher handkerchief on and a brown great coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 11th of December last. - A. Yes, all the articles in the indictment, my property and my lodger's; my lodger had left the property with me, I was answerable for them if any lost. I left my house on the 10th of last month; on the 11th it was broken open; I returned on the 17th and applied to the office; I went down with the lodger that part of the property belongs to to Gravesend on business, and was absent a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in your house. - A. No person at all. I double locked my door, and fastened my windows with a pin and key. I found two trunks broken open; one contained my property and the others my lodger's; I had seen my things on the day I went away. On coming back on the 17th I found the door in the same situation as I left it; the front and back windows were both broken open; the window shutter was wrenched open, and part of the board was broke where the bolt is in; the front window pane of glass was taken out, apparently with a penknife; the point of the penknife was found in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things again. - A. On the following day; they were produced by the pawnbrokers.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of police. - A. Yes; on Saturday the 19th of December I was going up Noble-street, near Wood-street in the city, about ten minutes after nine; I met the prisoner and two others with him, he had this bundle on his shoulder I crossed over, followed him, and catched hold of his collar, I asked him what he had got there; he instantly threw it off his shoulder; I laid hold of him, he attempted to run; in struggling to get away he tore his shirt. I secured him with my right hand, a scuffle ensued, I pulled of one side and he of the other; he tried to put his hand in his pocket, and when I found that I struck him once or twice with my fist; I afterwards examined his pocket, I found this knife; the other two escaped. I took him to the Bell public house and secured him; he told me he came honestly by it. This is the bill of parcels, and this is the carman's note.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account did you take him. - A. I knew the persons that were with him; I never saw the prisoner before that morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he a candle. - A. Yes; I was about six or seven yards from him, I saw him with his hands under his apron, fumbling with something, I could not tell what; he took his hands out and pulled his apron down to make it appear as if there was no bulk there. He then began to proceed toward the stairs; I walked backwards in the dark, he could not perceive me nor hear me; I asked him for the candle to reach down a bottle of stout. When I came to the foot of the stairs he was standing, he offered me to go first, I told him to walk up first; as soon as he was up stairs he asked me for the change that he was to take to the gentleman where he was going with the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to carry some wine out. - A. Yes, a single bottle; I told him the change was ready, but I wanted something with him first; I laid hold of his leather apron, I said what have you got in your small clothes, you have got a bottle of wine here; I told him to pull it out, he resisted and shook his apron over it again. I went for the constable, and while I was absent he took it out, my wife saw him, she is here; when I came back I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said if I must tell the truth, he meant to have a bottle of wine for his Christmas day's dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any body following of you as you was going there. - A. Yes, a man with a long rough great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you first observed him. - A. At the top of Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he follow you. - A. He followed me quite down to Hans-street</p>

               <p>Q.Having taken the shawl from out of your hand, what was then done. - A. He ran off with it. I got up and went into a green grocer's shop, and told the man that I had been throwed down; I asked him to go with me to Hans-place. When the boy was going to take me to Hans place, I said the man had taken a crimson shawl from me; a milkman heard me, he pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the milkman. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were going with the green grocer's lad to Hans-street you met a milkman. - A. Yes, the milkman said he saw the man run round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned it to the milkman and he pursued him. - A. Yes, the milkman pursued him after I left the green grocer's shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130017"/>Q. Did you see the man's face before he throwed you down. - A. I saw him just before we got out of Sloane-street to go into Hans-street; he turned round and I saw his face, I saw the man turn round.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face. - A. He had his coat buttoned up round his neck, I could not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of his coat. - A. Rather a dark olive colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice whether he was a short or tall man. - A. He was shorter than me, I observed, when he turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the shawl again. - A. Yes, I saw it that night when the man was confined; the milkman shewed me the shawl again at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man at the watchhouse. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief, was it left with the milkman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose shawl was it. - A. Mrs. Thornborough's of Hans-place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her husband's name. - A. John.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it made of. - A. Silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it only silk, was there no other material in it. - A. I do not think there was any other material in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says she came to see her shawl at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Court. She says the shawl was shewn to her at the watchhouse by the milkman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said very wrong.</p>
               <p>Witness. I do not know whether it was the watch-house or no; it was the place where he was confined all night till the next morning.</p>
               <p>EDWARD COLTEN. Q. Were you in Hans-street any time on the 8th of December last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time. - A. About half past five; I was coming out of Sloane-street to go into Hans-street; I saw the man run round the corner to go into Sloane-street again, towards Sloane-square; then I went round to go into Hans-place to serve two families; I saw this young lady, she said she had been robbed; I told her I would go after the man and catch him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean by the lady, the last witness. - A. Yes. I went after the man, I caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man you saw run round the corner. - A. Yes; I caught him almost down to Sloane terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where you met him. - A. Almost a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shawl. - A. It was stuffed in his coat at his bosom; I took it from him; that was in Sloane-street where I took the shawl from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you took the shawl away immediately upon laying hold of him. - A. Yes, I took it immediately away when I took him over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then where did you carry him to. - A. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar the man whom you saw run round the corner. - A. Yes, he looks like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him and see whether he is the man that you took to the watchhouse. - A. He looks a great deal like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it. - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Then why did not you say so. - A.After I took him to the watchhouse I took the shawl home, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed. - A. In a dark rough coat, apparently a dark brown. I produce the shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the lady it that night at the watch-house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner. - A. The next day he was carried before Mr. Dudley and committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say the lady came to see the shawl at the watchhouse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not see her. - A. No, you was locked up, and she was in the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any body follow after you in pursuit of the prisoner. - A. Yes,

               <p>Q. You are not sure, perhaps. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he make any resistance when you first seized him. - A. Very little; there were a great many people came round; then he struggled a little, we had a little bit of a rumble; then we went down to the watchhouse together.</p>

            . My master's name is Walker, he is a green grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did miss Little come to your house and complain that she was robbed. - A. Yes; I went with her from my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Going away from your master's house to her house what happened - did you pursue after any person that robbed her. - A. Yes, I followed the milkman; he pursued a man in a rough great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that man in a rough great coat when you pursued him. - A. Almost down to Sloane Terrace. We saw him tumble down by the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him fall down. - A. Mr. Colten did.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, did you see him fall. - A. I did, before I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. What made him fall. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he fell down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Colten had got hold of him did you come up to him. - A. He was at the place where Mr. Colten first laid hold of him; I saw Mr. Colten take a shawl out of his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the watchhouse with Colten. - A. No, I went to fetch the lady; I went with him, but I did not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he at the watchhouse when you went to fetch the lady. - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his face so as to swear to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he was a man in a rough great coat. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the person running when you saw him tumble down. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Colten. I saw him running, he was running when he tumbled down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you run after the prisoner did he seem to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130018"/>stoop down or did he fall down. - A. He fell down; I have asked a man in Sloane-street that knew him; he says he is a hard working man.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at the shawl, is that the shawl. - A. That is the shawl, I know it by the grease that is in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. - A highway robbery consists in taking away goods in a violent manner on the King's highway; and the fact of this young woman being robbed by somebody there is no doubt. She has told you some man caught her by the leg just as she got into Hans-street, threw her down, and took the shawl away from her; that in law is enough to constitute a highway robbery. - The next question is, whether the prisoner is the man; she says it was a man in a dark rough great coat; a man in a dark brown rough great coat is seen turning round the corner of Hans-street into Sloane-street by the milkman. Upon her telling the milkman that she was robbed, he pursued after the man and caught him; that man turned out to be the prisoner; and from under his breast is the shawl found which was taken from her by a man in a rough great coat. Likewise Hicks as he was going home with the lady, upon his meeting the milkman, he likewise pursued after him; - he has told you when he came up to him, from out of the bosom of the prisoner at the bar was taken that shawl. There is no accounting how he got this shawl in any other way than he being the man that laid hold of her leg, throwed her down, and took it from her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she a work woman there. - A. I am informed she had worked before I was warehouseman; I never saw he before, I catched her as a thief; I saw the cotton in her arms; when she saw me she let the cotton fall down; going out of the door she fell down, I picked he: up, and brought her into into the accompting house, till my master came home; then he sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, me and my husband had worked for Mr. Taylor many times; I asked Mr. Taylor in the morning, if he could get me employ; I went to the west end of the town, and drank with two of my shopmates: then I went again to Mr. Taylor; after I had been in the accompting house and could not see him, I went up into the warehouse; that bag of cotton stood by me; thinks I, I will not be caught with this; I took it in my arms and threw it in doors. My husband is a wicked man; he has made Mr. Taylor believe I wanted to rob him; I have two children, and a bad husband that would do me all the harm in his power, though I have done him no harm, God forgive him; Mr. Taylor is a worthy man, he would not have done what he has, if it had not been for my husband; my husband was an Irish fortune hunter. I had a few hundreds a few years ago, when he had me; I believe him to be an honest man to his master, but I may say he is the worst of his country; he was in a little business of his own, when he got acquainted with the woman he now lives with, and him and her eloped away together; for months I have not received a farthing from him; I believe him to be an honest man in many respects, but he is an unworthy man to go to Mr. Taylor and get him to do what he has to me.</p>

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker. - A. I am, I live at 134, St. Martin's-lane. On Wednesday the 30th of December the prisoner came to my house between eleven and twelve; he brought three silver desert spoons, on one of the spoons was the letter S, he had a decent appearance then; he asked me to lend him one pound; I weighed them and offered him fifteen shillings; he said that his mother gave them to him, and that he was going to be married. When he gave me the name of Matthews, I told him that was not the name on the spoons; he said his mother gave them to him, I need not be the least apprehensive but that they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the real value of them. - A. They are worth twenty shillings; I gave him a duplicate. I went to the office from the information of my son; I did not see the prisoner then, he was sent to Tothill Fields. On the Thursday following I went up to the office again, finding the prisoner there; I knew him directly. The officer had some more plate of the same description and the same letter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he pawn them. - A. No, I did not take them in; I asked him if they were his own, he said yes; I asked him a second time if they were his own, he said no, they were his mother's; I then asked him what they cost, he did not know; I asked him if his mother could come herself, he said yes, she should come; upon that he went out of the shop, leaving the spoons.</p>

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker, No. 92, St. Martin's-lane. - A. I am. On the morning of the 30th of December, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner offered me a silver sauce ladle, he asked me twelve shillings on it. From his appearance, and the questions I asked him, I immediately suspected they were stolen; I went round to the place he was in and took him into the inner part of the shop and detained him. I sent one of my lads to Bow-street for an officer; the officer found five desert forks on his person, a table fork broken in two, besides the sauce ladle he had offered to me; the sauce ladle is worth about fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS: Q. You are an officer of Bow-street. A. I am; I found the prisoner at Mr. Gordon's house. I searched him, he reluctantly let me search him; on his person I found five desert forks and a four-pronged fork, broken in two pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the ladle. - A. I did, I have had it in my possession. Mr. Gordon wrote his name in the bowl of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this plate, Mr. Gordon. - A. Two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Read. Look at the desert spoon - first, whose property are they. - A. Mrs. Shum's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there initials or crest upon them. - A. There is; I am certain they are her property. The others have the initials; these two spoons have the crest; the sauce ladle is Mrs. Shum's. I have not the least doubt of the whole being Mrs. Shum's property.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed them all at the same time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Bedford-square is in the parish of St. Ann. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of January had you your shop window broken by any body. - A. Yes, between seven and eight at night. I was in the parlour adjoining.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear it break. - A. I did not; my little boy, between nine and ten years of age, was looking through the glass door, he heard a noise; I immediately rose and went into the shop. I observed the window broken.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the time that you was alarmed had you observed that window before. - A. I had not observed it for some time; I think it was about an hour before. I think if it had been broken before my people would have told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that window in the course of the afternoon, to see whether it was broke yourself or not - A. Not particularly, I had not; I do not know that I had taken notice of it in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your going into the shop and observing a window broke, what then. - A. I observed a piece of Irish linen and three handkerchiefs were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from. - A. They were taken from near that part where the window was broken; they were laying against the piece of glass that was taken out, and the three handkerchiefs were upon it; they were laying on the frame, which is a kind of thing made on purpose for putting these things on; they were not leaning against the window, but almost close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the time of your alarm had you observed the handkerchiefs. - A. I cannot exactly tell; I had observed them there before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130021"/>Q. Having found that your window war broke, and some of your stock was gone, what did you do. - A. I went out immediately and went towards Hyde Park corner; not seeing any person that I suspected I was returning; in a few yards from Knightsbridge barracks I observed the prisoner Coates on my left side, with something under his great coat; upon that I seized him, and putting my hand within his coat I felt the cloth, I asked him where he got it from, he said he did not take it, but he got it from two boys; at that instant I observed two boys close to him; a person passing by I desired him that he would seize these boys, he seized Badger; the other prisoner and the other boy made his escape. We took them to Knightsbridge watchhouse; I asked Coates what he had done with the handkerchiefs he took out of the window; he took them out of his pocket and they were delivered to me. Badger denied any knowledge of the transaction. Coates said he received the goods from Badger, and a boy of the name of Lacey, that made his escape; Badger was by at the time; Coates was afterwards searched, and various other articles were found in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not yours. - A. No. In the first instance I observed blood upon the hand of Badger, it was cut down on the back part of it, and bled very fresh, as if it was fresh cut, and the blood was quite wet upon the back of his hand. I did not examine the window till the next morning; I found a piece of glass taken out, it appeared to be done with a sharp instrument; it was taken out nearly whole, and the piece laid by the side; I should suppose a knife had been put in between the putty, and there was some blood upon the window frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the handkerchiefs and the piece of Irish cloth. - A. I have not; I left them at the watchhouse; they were brought to Bow-street the next morning and delivered it into the care of Adkins the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that piece of cloth and the handkerchiefs that were delivered to Adkins at Bow-street office the same as were taken from your house. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Bow-street. - A. Yes. I produce the linen and the handkerchiefs, that were brought by the constable or the watchhouse keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Doward, look at them again and see whether that linen and handkerchiefs are the same that were taken out of the shop window. - A. It is the same, I know it by the number upon it; it is the same piece of linen, and they are the handkerchiefs that I took from the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the piece of cloth. - A. It cost me above five pounds; I valued it at four pounds, it cost me four shillings and two pence a yard; the handkerchiefs are of the same pattern, and of the same quality; I have no particular marks upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the materials of which they are made. - A. Two of them are muslin, and one of them silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were two of the handkerchiefs that you lost made of muslin, and one of silk. - A. Yes; the boy gave them me out of his pocket, and they were of that pattern; the three cost me about half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. They are common handkerchiefs, they are common in town. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your mark to the linen, or the wholesale dealer's mark. - A. The wholesale dealer's.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you do not know, but what he sends out other linen of the same quality, with the same mark. - A. I do not know it.</p>

               <p>Q. It is not your own mark. - A. It is not my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you took no particular notice of this window during the day. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Though Coates made this confession, Badger he denied it. - A. He did before.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by denying it before; when he was first taken to the watchhouse you said that Badger denied any knowledge of the transaction; Coates said he received them from Badger, and the boy that was not taken; you have introduced a confusion in the business, by using the expression, he denied before. - A. Coates said he received them from two boys; Badger denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he received them of Badger, and Lacey on a subsequent day, what did Badger say. - A. Nothing; he afterwards said so at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Doward's parlour at the time the alarm was given; I heard a window break, I did not know it was in the shop; in the course of a minute afterwards the little boy saw somebody take the things out of the window; I run out directly. I observed the window was broken and some blood was on the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it at that time. - A. I did; I ran after them, I did not take them; on our returning to the watchhouse, I found these things; they do not belong to Mr. Doward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Who was in the parlour with you. - A. There were Mrs. Doward, the three sons, and Mr. Doward.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so much quicker of hearing than them - were they all deaf. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. I shall not ask you any more questions.</p>
               <p>Court. You asked him if they were all deaf - he answered you no.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked if all the other people were deaf - did any body else hear the window break. - A. The little boy heard it, and I think Mrs. Doward heard it.</p>

            . Q. You I believe were required by Mr. Doward to lay hold of Badger. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was the person he spoke to at Knightsbridge. A. Yes. I laid hold of Badger immediately, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130022"/>other made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear them say. - A. I heard Coates say that he had got the property from Badger, and the other boy Badger said he did not know any thing about it; going along I felt his hand, and his hand was all wet with blood; then we took him to the watchhouse, and then Badger owned that he was a confederate with Coates; Badger said that he had been with him all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat the words that Badger said, as near as you can. - A. He said, they had been with him all that evening; Coates and Lacey that run away, had been with him all that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Badger to say that he had been with them all the evening. - A. Coates said he had the things from Badger and Lacey, Badger said he had nothing to do in it; after he was searched, he said he had been with them all the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Badger to say that. - A. Badger said he come down to see his aunt; I asked him where his aunt lived; he said, he could not tell me; I said that is a queer piece of business, you come to see your aunt, and do not know where she lives; then we were going on towards the watchhouse, then he owned he had been along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right, as you were going to the watchhouse, he said he was going to see his aunt, you asked where she lived, he said he could not tell where she lived. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was a queer piece of business, and he could not tell where she lived. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards he said he had been with them all the evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Coates's Defence. I was going up to Brompton; I was looking for work there; in returning home, I met two lads, they said they would give me two half crowns to carry these things; thinking no harm I carried them.</p>
               <p>Badger left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN - The circumstances against the two prisoners are first, that on Badger being apprehended, his hand was bleeding, and the widow frame having blood upon it; that when Coates was taken by the prosecutor with the goods in his possession, Badger and the other boy were seen near in company with Coates, and the assertion of Coates, uncontradicted by Badger, who acknowledged that they were in company all the evening together; there appears to me to be very strong circumstance against the two prisoners; however, it is for you to decide, how far in you opinion the prisoners are either or both of them innocent or guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. Repeat what you last said. - A. I told her that I must take her in custody if she did not acknowledge who she took them from, and if she would go quietly with me probably the person that she took them from would shew her that lenity that the nature of her case admitted of; I took one of my servants with me and her in a hackney coach to Mr. Bruce, and the articles along with me. I staid there till she was taken in custody. I produce the articles.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent to Mrs. Hollis. - A. Yes, I was. The prisoner told me it was in the King's-road, near Chelsea; she did not know the name, nor whereabout the house was.</p>

               <p>Q. You found Mrs. Hollis there, did you receive from her what was in the basket. - A. I received from Mrs. Hollis a bundle in a basket; I have had it in my custody ever since. I produce them. She told me in Mr. Bruce's house; then I took Baker with me and her, and she shewed me the house.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. Q. Did you accompany Jones when these articles were received from Mrs. Hollis. - A. Yes. I was in the coach with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what he has told, do you agree with him. - A. Yes, they are facts that he has told.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Bruce look at the things produced, first of all look at the silver forks - A. They are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before in your house. A. I had seen some of them a few days before in my house, perhaps two or three days; there is a crest upon them and the motto.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own crest. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of these being your own. - A. Not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You never parted with these. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts may be the value of these forks. - They are certainly worth fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak of that with certainty. - A. Yes; they cost me upwards of twenty pounds. I have looked at the desert spoons, they are marked with my crest and motto both; I have not the smallest doubt but they are mine; they are part of the articles lost from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. The desert knives and forks with silver handles, have they the same mark. - A. No, but they have a mark; these are mine also.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark upon them. - A. It is a spread eagle; those I missed were marked in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. The articles of furniture of the house, can you speak to. - A. Yes, the bed furniture is mine; I merely judge from the appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner directing the officer to go to Mrs. Hollis. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was brought to your house was any thing said by you to induce her to confess. - A. She fell down upon her knees; I said nothing to her what I should do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any house at Brompton. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg and pray for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed to go on any errand on the 11th of this month. - A.

               <p>Q. What way did you go from thence. - A. I was to go down Plumtree-street, and to go down Drury-lane; instead of that I missed my turning and went down Dyot-street instead of Plumtree-street.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the evening might it be then. - A. It was about seven o'clock then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner standing. - A. Inside of a passage door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go in the passage, did you, before she laid hold of you. - A. No; as I was going by the door she laid hold of my arm and dragged me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you resist. - A. I could not get out, she laid hold of my arm, and when she got me in she locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go willingly in. - A. No, I pulled back as much as I could.</p>
               <p>Q.When she got you in the room what then. - A. She called to her daughter to lock the room door outside.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she was her daughter. - A. She called her her daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the door of the house or the door of the room. - A. The door of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When she locked the room door on the outside what followed. - A. Then after that she searched my coat pocket, the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to her searching your pockets. - A. No, she would search me; she knocked me down several times with her flats.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive the blows. - A. On my breast. Then after she bent me, she said if I made a noise she would murder me; she searched my coat pocket, then my waistcoat pocket; she could find nothing there; then she unbuttoned my left hand breeches pocket, and took out half a crown; after that she took my hat away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the hat that you have in your hand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the band on them as it is now. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the hat when she had taken it. - A. She throwed it under the bed; after that she called to her daughter to unlock the door, when she found I had no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Her daughter did unlock the door did she. - A. Yes. She said if I made any noise when I went out she would murder me. She told me I might go when she had got my money; while she was calling the daughter to open the room door I got my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time. - A. She was at the room door, she locked it inside too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you when you got your hat, or was her back towards you. - A. She did not see me take it; while she was opening the door I put it behind my back; when the door was opened I come away with it; then afterwards she went into the room and missed the hat; she followed me again after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that. - A. Just as soon as she missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you suppose; I want to know how short a time after you came out of the room was it that she came after you. - A. She came directly after me</p>
               <p>Q.When she came out of the door did she take the same course as you had done. - A. Yes. I was almost at the bottom of the street; she ran after me and laid hold of my hat; as soon as she laid hold of my hat these was a man come up to me that knew her, that belonged to her, he took me up in his arms, he said he would take me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he belonged to her. - A. I suspected that he belonged to her.</p>
               <p>Q. But you do not know it. - A. No. When he said he would take me to the watchhouse some people came up, knocked the man down, and then he run away. When the man knocked the man down there was a mob, and the watchman came, he told me to go up the other side of the way, and he would follow me to the house to take the woman; he put his coat over the lanthorn, and when we came up we see her in the passage, she was talking to a man; as soon as we went in the man ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the man she was talking with. - A. No, I should not know him again. When the watchman went in she said she never saw me; when she got to the watchhouse then she said she would give me the half crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take out the money to give to you. - A. She took two shillings, and wanted her daughter to lend her sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the half crown that she took from you. - A. She gave it to her daughter in the house before I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you first come away. - A. Yes. When she got to the watchhouse she struck at me, and said she would murder me; that was when she was going to be locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. You refused to take the money, did you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not go of your own accord into this house. - A. Yes; I should not have gone down the street if I had known it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been taking any liquor that afternoon. - A. I never drink any kind of liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can contradict him in his saying I knocked him down.</p>

I did; I took the charge of her, and locked her up; previous to that she wanted to make it up with the prosecutor, she offered him two shillings, and called to her girl, who she stiled her daughter, to lend her sixpence, that was to make up the half crown; I would not suffer it, she was very violent against him when I would not suffer the boy to make it up; she swore and damned his eyes, if she would not murder him; she offered to strike him, and the watchman got in between them.</p>
               <p>Q. When she offered the half crown, did she say what it was for. - A. No, only in general, that it was to make it up with him; he had charged her with taking a half crown from him, and using him ill, and endeavouring to take his hat from him; the next morning we took her to Marlborough-street; there before Mr. Conant she set up a plea, that he wanted to take liberties with her.</p>

               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. The circumstances are proved by the witness necessary make it a stealing; all this is done by force in the manner the boy has described; the case rests solely upon the evidence of the boy. If you see any improbability in his relation, I must confess I do not, if you believe what he has told you, you will find her guilty; if you do not believe the story he has told you, you will then acquit her.</p>

The doctor came, he pulled the deceased's shirt of one side and looked at the wound, he tried to put the bit of flesh in, he could not; he touched her arm; they went to the door of the bed room together, he spoke to her two or three words, I could not hear what it was; then he said the man must be sent to the hospital immediately; she was crying freely; the doctor went away; there was a coach got; after a black man came in, he began scolding the woman, I said it is of no use you saying any thing more about it; she sent for some vinegar and washed his face and gave him some vinegar and water to drink.

            . - Mr. Pooley. Where do you live. - A. I lived in the same house with the prisoner at the time. On the Saturday night this accident happened, I was at the public house, the sign of the Kettle Drum in the neighbourhood, I was asleep there; a man awaked me, he said there was murder done at home; this was between eight and nine o'clock at night. I went home with him, I saw the deceased in the front room, I went for the doctor; when I returned he was in the back room; the doctor ordered the man to be sent to the hospital. The prisoner told me he had been ill using of her, which he frequently used to do; she told me he had been beating her. I had seen him beat her many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you that he had been beating her in the hearing of the deceased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you have been witness of his ill treatment to her. - A. I have, but not at that time.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITH. - Mr. Pooley. You are a police officer. - A. I am. I know nothing of this transaction but what the prisoner told me. I apprehended her on Monday the 28th; I was informed that a man lay dead at the hospital that had been murdered; I went to the hospital to make enquiry, I found that the man lay dead there. When I went to Denmark-street I found that it was a black man that lived at No. 9, that was murdered; I went to the prisoner's house, her room was fast; I went up one pair of stairs, there I found the last witness with another girl, she said she expected her home every minute; she did not come; then I desired her to go with me to shew me where she was; she was at a neighbour's house a few doors off. I took her in custody and took her to her own house; she opened the door, and the window shutters; I searched the house, I could not find the knife; I asked how this man came by his death, she said they had been quarelling, he had beat her, she got him out of the house into the street, she then bolted the door and the shutter to keep him out; then he got round the house, over some paling; he pulled a pane of glass out of the back window and came into the bed room, then he began beating her cruelly, and no person was there but themselves; in the scuffle she said it was done. I asked her if she recollected taking up a knife, she said she could not recollect whether she did or not; she then shewed me her knee, she was very black on one side of her knee and bruised, she said he had given it her by beating her; she was likewise bruised across the eyes and nose. I took her to the office. I received the knife before the coroner at the London hospital, it was produced by the young man who gave evidence here; it was swore to then; that knife I have kept ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH JACQUES. - Mr. Gurney. Did you lodge in the same house with the prisoner and the deceased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night the accident happened did you come home. - A. Yes, between seven and eight o'clock. I knocked at the door, the deceased came then to the door, she would not open it, she said she would not open it even for her mother; the deceased went right down the street and I went away; that was an hour before the accident happened, as nigh as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would not she open the door. - A. I cannot say; the deceased was outside of the door as well as me. I was there first.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe she and the deceased had both been in your house in the evening. - A. He had been in my house two or three times in the course of the evening; I think she was there about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased sober that night. - A. He was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed at your house in the evening. - A. Yes, for a few minutes; when she was there I saw the prisoner very much agitated; the deceased exclaimed against her, says he, I will be with you presently; she left the house, he followed; he appeared to be in anger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. You say that the prisoner seemed to be agitated, and the deceased seemed to be in anger, he said he would soon follow her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about nine o'clock. - A. It may be a few minutes over or under; he had been in my house three hours, backward and forward; I live about an hundred yards from the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she and Walker were in the house were they drinking together. - A. I do not think they were drinking together; there were two or three neighbours with this man; he had been singing and hooting, I called him to order once or twice; when she came in he sat at one end of the box and she at the other; he was in and out in the course of the evening; when he went out he might be gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he left your house was it that you heard there was murder done. - A. I believe it was twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she been saying to him when he said that he would be after her. - A. I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether she asked him to come home. - A. She exclaimed against his coming home, she said to him I have kept you long enough; you shall not come any longer. In about twenty minutes after they went out I heard of the accident.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN. In this case you are to consider whether you are satisfied that the account the prisoner gave of the matter, and the witnesses severally and respectively give, who as they happened to have business, did meet this man in a very angry and intemperate state of mind, one of them hearing a rumbling as if something had been thrown, and some of them hearing the prisoner cry out murder - if you should be of opinion any such scuffle happened between them, and in fact that there was enmity between him and this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130028"/>woman, and the story to be true, that he had been beating her before - if you believe that to be the case, and that this woman under these circumstances committed this act of violence, although perhaps she might have gone further than she ought to have gone; - in consideration of human infirmities, persons under these circumstances not having their recollection and reason and government of their passions, as in cooler moments they would have it. The law in that case extends the crime to manslaughter only. That they had been engaged in a dispute and a scuffle is manifestly proved by the witnesses; I must own that they do not say enough for you to be sure it was of that nature that called upon her, as a human being, to protect herself in that way which she has done. - If you see there is malice plain and clear in this case, you will find her guilty. I own it does not appear to me to have been done with that malice which the law requires to constitute murder; - if you should be of that opinion it reduces the crime to manslaughter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 15th of December. A. Yes, twenty eight yards of cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that. - A. Fifty shillings; I had seen it a few minutes before we missed it, it stood on the counter a few yards from the door. In the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I was standing in the shop; the prisoner came in the shop and made an attempt to steal this piece of print; she laid hold of it, and when she saw me observe it she let the print go and went out of the shop; upon which I took my hat and went out to watch her, thinking she might come back again. As I went from my own door the prisoner passed me; I then went nearly in the middle of the square, opposite of the door; I found her go to the shop again; not seing any person in the shop she went in and took the print.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person in the shop. - A. There was a person in the shop, I had observed to him not to notice the door; I was opposite of the door, I saw her take the print, she came out with it; I let her go from the door a few yards, I took her in custody and brought her into the shop; I found the print under her cloak; I saw her take it off the counter.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I happened to lose a frock; I came to this shop to look out a bit of cotton to make a frock; I did not take it out of the house; I wanted to buy a piece of cotton to make a frock, to return it to the owner.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that they were two houses, and that you built a wareroom in the yard; are both the houses that you speak of in Russell-court. - A. No, one in Russel-court and the other house comes into White Hart-yard, Drury-lane; there is a door comes out of each house.</p>

               <p>Q. A door opening from either, it comes into the warehouse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these houses do you and your family live in. - A. Occasionally in both, but our chief residence is in White-Hard-yard; we have a better sitting room in Russel-court where on particular occasions we go.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Evans's family, where do they reside. - A. We eat together and sleep in the same house; Mr. Evans's room adjoins mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you, both the houses are connected by this warehouse, and are entirely used as one house. - A. I would observe to your lordship, that our young women sleep in Russel-court house, and the other part of my family in White-Hart-yard house.</p>

               <p>Q. At which house is that. - A. In White-Hart-yard. She came down stairs again directly, and went to Mrs. Morhall in the dining room, with the parcels.</p>

             gave me three five pound Portsmouth notes, a two pound bank note, a one pound note, half a guinea, and a seven shilling piece; I tied it up carefully and put it in my handkerchief at different corners, and the mistress of the house said there was rum people behind me, I had a deal of money, I had better take care of it, I had better put it in my smallclothes; I said I am very well able to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober. - A. Yes, as sober as I am at this time; these men came in and seeing me tie up the money, Moore, Butler and Foggerty, they stood at my back while I was talking to the mistress at the bar; Butler touched me by the side, he said do not make any noise to the mistress at the bar; I said my friend, I do not want any concern with you; I stood talking to the mistress a minute or two, I put my hand in my pocket, my handkerchief was gone and the men had all quitted the house; I found I had lost all the money; a woman came up to me, she said you may depend upon it they are the men that have got the money. I did not feel them take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Butler. - A. I do not know, I never saw him nor Foggerty before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all three come in together. - A. Yes. This woman went with us to Butler's house, we could not find him, the place is somewhere about Field-lane; we went again the next morning, he had not been home all night; in the course of the day I went up to the office and gave a description of the men; they went and found Butler; they searched him and found but six shillings on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Foggerty. - A. I did not. I knew Butler and Moore they used Mrs. Murphy's house.</p>
               <p>Butler. This woman has been at the bar before ever I have, she has been here for robbing a gentleman of a watch; she has been in divers prisons, although she had the good luck to get off; I find myself aggrieved that she should give her evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. If you want to impeach her evidence, you must prove it from the record of the trial.</p>
               <p>JOHN HANCOCK. I am an officer. On the night the robbery was committed, me and my brother officers were looking in at the different houses round St. Giles's. At the Black Dog St. Giles', we saw Butler, and two men answering the description of the two other men, they were drinking mixed liquor; when I went in I heard the prisoner Butler say, do you want me, or something to that purpose the expression he used was to Price; I did not know any thing about the robbery at that time, or else I should have proceed to have searched him, and the two other men; this was the very same night of the robbery a little before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Murphy. What time of night was this robbery committed on. - A. About seven.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hancock. You are sure they were all together. A. Not Foggerty; there were two men in company with Butler, they answered the description of the other men that the soldiers gave me; Butler I knew was there the other two I cannot say, I did not see Foggerty.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EKELSOE. I am an officer. On Friday the 8th of January, Wood and I were in St. Giles's; we apprehended Butler in Dyot-street, I took Foggerty on Sunday morning in Field-lane. I found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Butler's Defence. My defence is as this; on the 7th of January, which was my birth day, I was then thirty one years of age, I had some money in my pocket, which I chused to spend upon the spot where I was born, which is Plumtree-street Broad-street, St. Giles's. I went from the Thatched House, Field-lane, to that part, between the hours of seven and eight o'clock at night; I drank freely as many other persons might do Mr. Hancock might see me undoubtedly, I asked him to drink, but with regard to my asking if I was wanted it is wrong.</p>
               <p>Foggerty's Defence. If I was dying this moment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130032"/>the last word should be that I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price. Q. You are beadle of St. Andrew's parish. - A. Yes. I have known Butler for a length of time: when I went into the Black Dog with Hancock, Butler said, Price I shall not drink with you, for you will not let me get a shilling since you have walked Holborn; d - n me, says he, if you want me here I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop there. - A. I do, for the sale of ribbons and other things of that sort. On the 13th of January last, between the hours of three and four o'clock, the two prisoners came into my shop, they asked to look at some ribbons and were shewn some; Mrs. Burford<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130033"/>served them, and likewise one of my young men.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked for them. - A. I do not know, they came in for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Burford here. - A. No, nor the young man; I was called from the back shop in to the front shop; upon my coming into the front shop I observed the man run out. I saw them in the shop together.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they came in together before. - A. I saw them together; they came in to look at some ribbons.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that. - A. I was informed that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they both looked at the ribbons. - A. I saw the drawer before the woman when I came into the shop, I was then informed that there were some ribbons gone, and the prisoner was suspected, I then laid hold of the woman prisoner, I asked her what she had; the said she had got nothing; upon that I searched her, I found a piece of ribbon; I have it in my pocket. By that time the other was brought back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How much ribbon was it. - A.About eighteen or nineteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the price of it. - A. About twelve shillings; it cost me more than that. I know it to be mine; I saw it in the morning; there is the cost price on it in my own hand writing; I then took the prisoners, the woman and the man, myself to Marlborough-street; the other prisoner was brought back; I desired a person to watch her, that she throwed nothing away; I suspected she had more. She was searched at the office, I saw three pieces more taken from her by the officer; the officer has got them.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MINNIS. I am an apprentice to Mr. Burford. On the 13th of this month, between the hours of three and four, I saw the two prisoners come into Mr. Burford's shop; Mrs. Burford served them; after they had been in some time I heard Mrs. Burford call Mr. Burford forward, I ran forward, I saw the prisoner Theway run out of the shop; I suspected him and ran after him, and at a little distance I saw him throw away a piece of ribbon; I got up to him and caught hold of him. I picked up the ribbon afterwards, I brought him back and helped to take him to Marlborough-street. I produce the ribbon, it is marked with our private marks; half the marks are torn off; there is enough left that I can speak to its being Mr. Burford's property.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street, I searched the woman prisoner, I found three pieces of ribbon on her which I have here; one piece under each of her arm pits, and one in her pocket.</p>

               <p>Fitzgerald's Defence. I bought the three rolls of ribbon, the officer took from me, before I went into the prosecutor's shop; I came from on board a ship on Tuesday morning, from my husband, with two of his shipmates, to buy things for him, as the ship expected to sail in a fortnight; the three rolls of ribbon I bought to sell on board the ship to any of the women that might like to bye them; the next day I took one of his shipmates with me, he wanted to purchase a pair of shoes for himself; the gentleman told him he did not sell men's shoes; not liking the ribbon I had purchased, I wanted to buy a ribbon for my own wear; the gentlewoman shewed me some ribbons, I took up the ribbon in my hand, she snatched my hands together till she called the master; she told him I wanted to steal it; I declare it was not my intention.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no truth in what she has said Mrs. Burford had got hold of both her hands when I came into the shop; I took the piece of ribbon from under her apron, it was tucked up under some tucks.</p>
               <p>Theway's Defence. I came from on board a ship on Monday night, this young woman came with me; I went with her to buy a pair of shoes, then I went with her to the shop were she said she wanted to buy a ribbon; I saw the gentlewoman lay hold of this young woman, she said she had stole this ribbon; I thought I saw one of my shipmates coming past, I went cut to him, I dropped the piece of black ribbon out of my pocket in Oxford Market; I bought that ribbon to tie my hair with.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep at home on the 4th of December last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before you had gone to bed seen your poultry house. - A. I had; I secured it just after dark, about five o'clock; I fastened it with a nail, top and bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that the fowls were all in it. - A. Yes; at four o'clock, when I fed them, there were just four dozen and six, they were all in the coop; I do not breed any fowls, I only fatten them; I was disturbed about half past three in the morning by the fowls, I was rather suspicious, I got up, I had a rush light in my room; I lighted a candle and saw what o'clock it was, it was half past three; I went down stairs into the kitchen at the back of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how the poultry house is situated with respect to the dwelling house. - A. The poultry house is attached to the house, so far as it is a bit of a shed built against the house; the beams of it run against the walls of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in an enclosed yard. - A. Yes; the house is enclosed all round, with paling, and one side a ditch. When I got down stairs I heard the noise more and more in the poultry shed; I went to the shed, I found the door of the shed was wide open; I had a candle in my hand, I observed Mr. Baker come out of the shed, he advanced rapidly with his face towards me; there is the person [pointing to the prisoner]; he knew me and I knew him very well, the prisoner is the person, he is the man, the very man; he had a sack on his shoulder, the sack had some loading in it; he kept it on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how he was dressed. - A. He had a coloured handkerchief and a dark waistcoat on; he came out of the shed, and gave me a blow on the side of my face, and said, God d - n your eyes, what do you want; the blow knocked me down, the blood ran out of my nose; I halloaed murder, Baker ran away, I could see no more of him; I was a good deal hurt. Several of the neighbours came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Betts the constable. - A. In about a quarter of an hour I saw him, I sent for him; I sent Mr. Betts to go after the prisoner when I found out who it was; I went with him as far as the prisoner's house, he lives about a quarter of a mile from my house. They brought the prisoner to me about half after five, he was in the custody of Betts; I said that is the man that knocked me down and robbed me of the fowls; his waistcoat and his handkerchief were the same; the coat I cannot say, because he had a sack over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you there. - A. He said I was a very false man, it was not him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the prisoner Baker knocked you down and absconded, did you examine the poultry house. - A. About two minutes after Baker had ran away. I had put a cloth of one side to keep them warm, that was removed, and the door was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the fowls. - A. That I cannot say; there were ten missing, I have never found any of them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. There is no internal communication from your house into the shed. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you fasten it. - A.About five; my servant went in the shed in the course of the afternoon to feed them; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs you went with a candle. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found the door wide open. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a man whom you say was the prisoner came running upon you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came running rapidly upon you, as fast as he could, therefore you could not see him only momentarily. - A. So I could; and when he was brought back he had a coloured handkerchief, and a dark waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you you was a false man for charging of him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no moon that night. - A. It was a dark night. I had a candle in my hand.</p>

            . Q. You are a constable at Feltham - A. Yes. On the 5th of December last Mr. Pottier sent for me to apprehend Baker. I went to Mr. Pottier's house about four in the morning. I and Pottier went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Baker. - A. No, not directly; there was a light in a room, which I took to be a bed room; we waited near three quarters of an hour, and then we saw Baker get up from his bed side, we were about twenty yards off; he was swinging his clothes over his head, and then he came down stairs and went into his stable to his horse; we did not go in directly; he made a little fire and called his people up; then I went and rapped at the door, he opened it; I went in and catched fast hold of him and said he was my prisoner; he seemed very much surprised what it was for; I told him it was for robbing Pottier of his fowls and knocking him down; he said, I knock him down! he is a very false man for so saying, he wished he had the knocking of his bl - y French head off for laying such lies to him; he said he never robbed him nor knocked him down, nor never went into his house at all. We took him to Mr. Pottier's, and then to the Red Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Pottier, when he first saw Baker when he was first brought back to the house, did he say he was the same man that robbed him. - A.He said he was the same man and no other.</p>

A little after six o'clock I was going to my labour; I found a chicken coop in Smitcham-lane, about threescore yards from Mr. Pottier's house; I also found a gander in a bag close to it, in a gateway; a prong was put in the mouth of the bag to keep the gander in; the prong was marked J.

               <p>Q. During the time from one o'clock, to the time which you and the servant went to bed, had the prisoner got up. - A. No, he could not, for the stairs that we had cleaned after they went to bed, came down into the room that we were cleaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he could not have got up and come down without your knowledge. - A. He could not.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner and you live together. - A. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the night before he was taken up coming home. - A. I do, I had been to town with poultry; I came home about eleven o'clock, I went to bed; after the horse had been done up, it was near upon one o'clock, when I went to bed; Baker went up to bed before me, and I followed him up stairs; I sleep in the same bed with him. He never went out of the bed till near five o'clock, I looked at the watch, I called him up myself; we were to go to Kingston market. I swear solemnly, and declare to God, it is the truth, that he never went out of his bed and never went out of the house till near five o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. What age are you. - A. I am sixteen. Last Tuesday night at half, past twelve o'clock, I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18080113-39-crimeloc225">Bush-lane, Cannon-street</placeName>

                        targets="t18080113-39-off222 t18080113-39-crimeloc225"/>; I had been with some young men to spend the evening, there was my brother and a few friends in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking to excess at all. - A.No, I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone when you lost the watch. - A. Yes; the prisoner, with two or three more with him, hussled me; the prisoner shoved against me, and took my watch out of my pocket; I catched hold of his coat, I said you have got my watch; he said no I have not I saw him take it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it done too quick for you to lay hold of his hand to get possession of the watch again. - A. Yes, he put his hand behind him and gave the watch away to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the watch in his hand at that time, you were not sure that he had the watch in his hand. - A. No, it was his right hand he put behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the others leave him. - A. Yes, they went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him loud enough with having your watch, do you think, for his companions to have heard you. - A. I said it in the same tone of voice, and as loud as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they must have heard you; when the other men went away did you call the watch. - A. No. I said you have got my watch; I had hold of him, he said he had not; I replied you have, give me my watch; he said he would not; then I said I will put you where you ought to be. I called the watchman directly, and when the watchman came, I gave charge of him for stealing my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it. - A. A silver watch. I bought it myself, and worked hard for it. I gave two guineas and a half for it; I valued it at forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a key and seal. - A. Yes; I have never recovered it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. This was between twelve and one o'clock - what time did you go to your friend's house. - A. About eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking any thing. - A. A little wine and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live. - A. With my father, 139, Tooley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the place where you lost the watch. - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the watchman before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the watchman to drink. - A. Coming past the watchman, I ran against him I begged his pardon; I said will you have something to drink, he said no; then I says, here is sixpence to get you something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you when you gave the watchman sixpence from the place where you lost the watch. - A. About four yards; they met me as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. They met you, you said to the prisoner you have got my watch, you said it loud enough for the other men to have heard, and watchman he was about four yards off; how many watchman were there. - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130036"/>cannot say, there was this old man that I ran against, and another on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from him and you when the watch was taken. - A. About four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they that took your watch could see them as well as you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called out watch these four men could have easily rescued him if they had thought fit to have done it. - A. Yes; he put his hand behind him and gave the watch away; he was searched at the watchhouse, nothing was found; I will take my oath that he took my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, you believe it. - A. I do not believe it, I am sure of it he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be running along the street at this time of the night. - A. I had been spending my evening in Clare-street, Clare Market; I was running as fast as I could to get home, because my brother was sitting up for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was searched it was found that he had some money of his own. - A. I do not know that it was his own; there was a pocket book and six pounds, I believe, in it.</p>

I saw him; he rather pushed against me, he asked my pardon, he asked me if I would have something to drink; he was going rather fast, he gave me sixpence; I stopped and put my lanthorn down at the corner of Turnwheel-lane; he called watch, I went directly to him, he had hold of the prisoner, and I laid hold of him, he charged the prisoner with taking his watch from him; I took charge of him. The prisoner said he would go quietly to the watchhouse; the young lad said he saw him take it; I took him to the watchhouse. I was not above five yards from him when it happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember last month buying any sheep at Smithfield market, part of which you afterwards lost. - A. On the 28th of December I bought seventy four sheep between me and Mr. Swain.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name -

            .</p>
               <p>Q. After these sheep were brought, where did you put them. - A. They were brought to my house about half after three o'clock, or four to the outside, No. 5, Sharp's-alley, Cow Cross. After they came to my house, I eat a cold dinner; it might be four o'clock when I took them from my house to a field which I rent of Mr. Bennet, at <placeName id="t18080113-40-crimeloc231">Battle Bridge</placeName>

I took seventy three to that field; there was one tired, we were obliged to kill it. I left them in the field and fastened the gate; it fastens with a catch staple; I put a bit of stick into the staple.</p>
               <p>Q.Were any of the sheep marked - A. There were twenty marked across the nose with dark ochre; the were bought of Mr. Ebb, a salesman; they had no other mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wethers or ewes. - A. There were about three wethers in the twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the others marked, the other fifty three that were in the field. - A. There were twenty five of them marked double across the loin with ochre; they were all ewes; there were twenty three marked on the shoulders with ochre; they were bought in two lots, thirteen in one lot, and ten in the other. The other lot were G branded on the near hip, I believe; there were six of them; I believe they were ewes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave them in this field. - A.Just before five o'clock, I could just see to put them in. I went on Tuesday, the next morning, about nine o'clock, to the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them all there. - A. No, I did not; the gate was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep were gone. - A.Twenty five; I found forty eight in the field; we missed ten of the twenty that were marked over the nose, seven of them that were marked double on the loin, one with G branded; the others were them that were marked on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. That is seven that were marked on the shoulder.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130037"/>A. Yes. I found the sheep on the same night, about half after eight o'clock, on the Tuesday night; I found them at the prisoner Rudd's house at Pimlico; I believe it is in Chelsea parish, close by the Union Tea Gardens. I found five of them dressed in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Is he a butcher. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these five in the shop were your sheep. - A. The first I took hold of, I was sure by the mark on the nose; they had not took the skin off clean; the head is here now. The other four that were hanging in the shop were not marked in the same way; we found the skins and the sheep we found eight dead in all; we found five in the shop, there were seven of them killed with the mark across the nose; when I went in I asked how many he had got of them ewes; he said that he had got nine. I asked him where the remainder of them were; he went into the back place, where he was working, there were two dressed there, and one not quite finished, about half dressed; that made eight dead ones.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the two that were dressed were yours. - A By the skins, all the skins were in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these skins any mark over the nose. - A. Seven out of the eight had.</p>
               <p>Q.I thought that you told me in the shop were five sheep, one you knew by the mark on the nose, the skin not being taken off clean from the head. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether the skins of the four sheep that you saw afterwards, were in the shop. - A.They were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw two dressed in the back place, where were the skins. - A. They were in the back place, where he was at work, and five skins were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that was half dressed, how was that marked. - A. On the nose, the skin was upon the sheep in all the four quarter, that I finished myself, he could not finish it. I asked him where the other one was; he said he had nine at first; he answered he had got no more; upon that I lifted up a bit of cloth, that was hung before them on a rail, and there were three live ones. One of them were marked G, brand, and the other two were marked over the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any more any where else. - A. I was left in possession of the things; the officer took him to prison; after the officer came back they asked the woman and the boy for the key of a stable he had got; the wife and the boy said they had no stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get into the stable. - A. They did, I believe, by force; they broke it open. I went afterwards to the stable to help take the sheep out; there were there fourteen sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe what they were. - A. It was so dark, I did not take any particular notice; Mr. Swain did.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes twenty five. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The sheep were found on the Tuesday; they might have been some time in the house, because you found some of them killed. - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went in the house what did you say. - A. I went up to the door, I asked him for a pound of mutton chops; when I went in he held the candle in his hand, and dropped back, he seemed suprized; I laid hold of this sheep; I asked him how many he had got of them; he said nine, I asked him where he had bought them; he said at Smithfield on the Monday; I asked him of whom, he said he had bought them of Mr. Ireson; I told him he could not, Mr. Ireson was not up that day, which he was not. That was the whole of the conversation that I had with him before the officer came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say he had bought them on the Monday or the day before. - A. The day before, I understood him.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was the market over at Smithfield. - A. Some people will stay at this time of the year till almost dark; I believe Mr. Ebb was the last that was there. I believe it might be near five o'clock when he went; I was not there, I went to the field with the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what time the market finished that day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you buy that day. - A. I bought seventy four sheep that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How were these sheep marked. - A. There were twenty I bought of Mr. Ebb marked across the nose; the other fifty four I bought of Mr. Billing; there were twenty three marked red shoulder, thirteen and ten, they were in two lots; there were twenty five marked twice over the loins, and there were six G branded between the hip, they were not particularly nearer one hip than the other; that makes fifty four of Mr. Billing, and twenty of Mr. Ebb, is seventy four.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the field at Battle-bridge. - A. I went part of the way; I was going out to spend the evening with my mother.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go the next morning to the field first. - A. No, my partner went first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Rudd's. - A. Yes. I went there between seven and eight, on the next evening; I was called in, and the officer and Mr. Smith the butcher then went in; Mr. Bunnell went in first, then I was called in, he said he had found the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon going in what did you see. - A. I saw the five sheep hanging in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were some of them which you had bought - were there any marks upon them. - A. Yes, there was one left with the mark on, about the nose; there were four more with the marks almost left on, but the marks were not so much to be seen as they were on the other one; the skins were not quite taken off; there were two more hung backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the skins in the shop. - A. I did not take particular notice, but when I looked over all the skins, they were all nearly together, close to the door that goes to the back place.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two more in this back place. - A. Yes; they were finished dressing; they had marks on the nose, he had not skinned them clean. There was one more half finished dressing; the mark was on the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin separated from the sheep. - A. No, it was on, half way down the back; the last sheep I am not positive whether it was one of Mr. Ebb's sheep or not, they had ochred them afresh to disfigure them, but I am positive that he killed seven out of Mr. Ebb's.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130038"/>Q. Having found these three, at you described them, did you find any more afterward. - A. Yes, three more live ones.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that part separated from the others that they were dressing. - A. There was a cloth hung down before the rails that went across; these three had been disfigured, two of them were Mr. Ebb's and one Mr. Billing's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that of Mr. Billing's a red shoulder. - A. Yes; but they had been ruddling it down the back to take the mark out.</p>
               <p>Q. Any of these three with a G brand. - A. No, neither of them; there was but one G brand lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find any more. - A. In a stable, about an hundred yards up the town, we found fourteen there; some of them were marked twice over the loins, and some red shoulders, and there was one of Mr. Ebb's marked all down the back to disfigure it, and one G brand; that I took particular notice was in stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say anything about them. - A. I went with him to prison, I asked him where the remainder of the sheep were, we only found eleven at the house; he said he had no more I asked him to tell me how he came by them; he told me that he got them of a person that sent him them to kill. I asked him if he could not inform me his name, he said he could not; then I asked him whether the person sent him them or brought them himself; he said that a drover brought them. I asked him the drover's name, he said he could not tell; that is all that past.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear that they were part of the sheep you had bought, and that these were the sheep you had lost. - A. I bought the sheep myself; Mr. Bunnell was with me at the time I bought them, and I am very clear to these being part of the sheep that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the skins and the head here. - A. Yes. She skins stink very much; I have both the skins and the heads.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Are you at all able to six the time when the sheep were lost. - A. I cannot be positive, I cannot say the time; this is one of the heads bought of Mr Ebb, there is red a cross the nose.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is very plain to be seen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swain. Here are four heads marked the same. This is another, he has disfigured the appearance of the skin; this head was marked across the nose, it was one of Mr. Ebb's, he has marked this skin down the back to disfigure it. This is another skin, he has been putting the mark on the back; this had the reddle on the shoulder, that is one of Mr. Billing's; they have put the additional mark on the nose to make them all look alike.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office Hatton Garden, I apprehended Donovan in White Bear-yard, near Hatton Garden; I think on the Thursday was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any promises or threats made to him when he came to the office. - A. Most of the questions that were put to him were by the keeper of the house of correction; he was asked whether he knew any thing of the sheep belonging to Mr. Bunnell and Mr. Swain; he several times declared that he knew nothing of it; the governor then said as that is the case lock him up again; one of the turnkeys was going to take him away; when he was going out of the office, he acknowledged that he was one of the men that did drive the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the very words he said. - A. He said, I did drive the sheep, I was one of them; that Moore and himself were engaged to drive them for the other prisoner, he said, for the butcher; he did not mention the name of Rudd; and Moore was engaged to pay him, and he thought he had done no hurt. After that he mentioned which way he drove them, that was up the New-road to Hyde Park corner, through the turnpike, and there he enquired which was the way; he drove them to the butchers; he had seen Rudd then at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the conversation all at one time. - A. No, it was not. When he said Moore was engaged to pay him, he drove them to the butcher's, he thought he had done do harm, that was at Queen-square; Rudd was taken there and I took Donnovan there. It was after he had seen Rudd he said he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he enquired the way. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that he and Moore drove them. - A. I did. He saw

The next day I went to Rudd's to see the sheep were safe delivered. Moore paid me, and I knew not that the sheep were stolen, or else I would not have drove the sheep; I was in no ways concerned in this transaction no more than being willing to earn a few shillings. On the next day I saw Moore, he is a master drover; he gave me part of a pint of beer and some beef steaks; he parted with me; I did not know they were stolen.

When asked by the witness where he got them, he first said he bought them in Smithfield market of Mr. Ireson; he might have called him to prove it. He is afterwards asked how he came by them, then he says he got them of some other person to kill; who that person was, he could not tell. He is asked if the person brought them himself - he said a drover brought them; who that drover is he cannot tell. He is asked whether he had any other sheep besides these seen by the witnesses - he said he had no other sheep. - When these fourteen sheep were found in his stable, being called on for his defence, he tolls you he did not know they were stolen, they were brought to him by Donnovan; therefore he would have you suppose that Donnovan stole them.</p>
               <p>DONNOVAN's case stands upon his own confession. He is asked, after he was apprehended, if he knew any thing about the sheep - he said, over and over, he knew nothing about the sheep. He would have said, if he had been an innocent man - yes, I know who employed me. When he is ordered to be locked up, he then said he drove the sheep, and he had them of Moore to take them to the butcher. That there was a connexion between these two men Mr. Carpenter has proved. On the Monday Rudd was at his house in the evening, and the boy told you he was sent for him between seven and eight o'clock, and he saw Donnovan at the place where his master kills the sheep. On the 29th Mr. Carpenter has told you these two persons were in his house for about an hour, they were together; there it a connecting proof of these two prisoners being together about the time the offence was committed.</p>

               <p>The case against RUDD is - he is found in possession of the sheep, and the false and contradictory account how he came came by them.</p>
               <p>Against DONNOVAN is - he drove them there, and his denying he drove them. His defence is - he thought the person who brought them came by them honestly. - Donnovan's confession can have no weight but against himself. - You will consider the evidence against one prisoner distinct with respect to the other, and judge how far either of them, or both, are innocent or guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he strike him. - A. He struck him on the head.</p>
               <p>A. Who struck him. - A. This Adams struck Lee on the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him. - A. Yes, he gave him two blows, I think; it was with an iron instrument; after he struck Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee fell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he lodged it at his side. - A. He drawed the instrument from his side, and struck Mr. Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the weapon in his hand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by lodging it on his side. - A. He hauled his hand from his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he listed up his hand with a weapon, and struck Mr. Lee, is that what you mean. - A. Yes; he struck Mr. Lee and he fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Now describe the weapon as well as you can. - A. It was a square weapon, a square bar about three feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it square the whole way up, the whole length. - A. All the way up.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was square the whole way up, it was the same thickness the whole way up, what was the colour of it. - A. It appeared to be black.</p>
               <p>Q. After he brought Lee to the ground what did this person do. - A. Then he began upon me and struck me upon several places upon the head; there is the dent upon my hat; he struck me upon my head several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you to the ground. - A. I ran, and he ran after me, beating me about my back, about three hundred yards, till I was so hurt by the beating in my loins, I was obliged to drop from the blows I received.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you at all judge what this weapon was made of. A. Iron.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he struck you upon the head, what effect did it produce upon your head. - A. One cut, of about two inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were confined by reason of the blows some time. - A. About a couple of months; Mr. Tatem attended me, Mr. Maxfield's assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you cut on any other part of your body besides your head. - A. I was bruised, not cut; this is the hat I had on, it is cut in two or three places by the blows I received from the man (The hat shown to the court and jury.)</p>

               <p>Court. You said there were more cuts than one, I do not see more than one. - A. There is one cut just below of the same side where the other cut is; one cut is near to the crown, it is cut right through, and the other cut is near the band.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did these blows render you senseless. A Yes, for a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is it in where his happened. - A.In the parish of Stepney in the hamlet of Poplar</p>
               <p>Court. I understood from you that this appeared to you to be done by a square bar of iron. - A. Yes. This is the handkerchief I had on and this is the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your head was cut. - A. The right side of my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did the person say any thing to you at the time. - A. Not a word; only repeating them words, d - your eyes I will learn you to come this way.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the cut in your head occasioned by the blow that made that hole through your hat. - A. Yes, it was the upper blow in the hat that occasioned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Do you know who that woman was. A. I never saw the woman before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether he is the man that can swear I did it or not.</p>
               <p>Court. He has not said it, that depends upon other evidence.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEE. Q. You are headborough of Poplar. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on duty on the 19th of June last in company with Mr. Barret. - A. Yes, I went with him on that night to Noble-street, about the hour of twelve; we met a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you got there. - A.We went up Noble-street; the second time I was at the left hand of Mr. Barret; there was a woman standing facing of Mr. Barret and me, on the other side of the way; Mr. Barret said, good woman what business have you in the street at this time of night, I desire you will dispatch and go to your lodgings; she said she had none; then instantly this Adams rushed out from the side of her, ran by her, and crossed over to him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Adams. - A. He came and rushed from the side of the woman; then he struck me with some weapon that he had in his hand, I cannot justly say what it was, although it was moonlight; he carried it by the side of him.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was moon light. - A. Yes, but not perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>Q. That I understand you to say it was moon light. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But not very clear. - A. Not perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was there light enough for you to distinguish his person and to be sure of it. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130041"/>Q. He struck you you say. - A. He struck me twice the second blow I fell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weapon he struck you with. - A. I cannot justly say, it was something that was very heavy and sharp; with all he cut my head on the side. I was under the surgeon's care for two months and three weeks of the two wounds I received.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be an iron bar. - A. It was something very heavy, it cut so; it was about the length of two foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what shape it was. - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say the second blow brought you to the ground. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike you any more. - A. I do not remember he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to Mr. Barrett. - A. Yes, after I recoverd myself from the ground, I made into the street, I heard Mr. Barrett cry for mercy repeatedly, several times. I was at the distance of twenty yards from them; I said to Adams are you murdering this man; he looked over his shoulder and said if I have not it was my intention.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time were you at the distance of twenty yards from him. - A. When I came to them; when I first heard Mr. Barrett I was more than a hundred yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon hearing Mr. Barrett crying for mercy did you go towards Mr. Barrett. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you get to him. - A. I was at the distance of twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him. - Q. I did, I said you scoundrel are you murdering the man; he said, if he had not done it, it was his intention.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had said that what did he do. - A. Then he ran strait down Poplar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understood you, you never got nearer to him than twenty yards after he knocked you down. A.No, I do not think I was, I was about the distance of twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. When he first came out of the alley towards the woman, was his face towards you or his back. - A. His face was not towards me, in a strait and proper direction, he turned and spoke to the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When Adams spoke to the woman, was his face towards you. - A. Exactly then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the alley out of which he came. - A. About nine yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he come out of an alley. - A. Yes, the house was facing of us up an alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer my question - I asked about the alley not about any house in the alley - how far was the woman from the alley. - A. She stood in an alley and Adams rushed by her.</p>
               <p>Q. How far where you from the place where the woman stood at the time he rushed by her. - A. I was more than nine yards, I have measured it since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing him, before he struck you. - A. Not half a minute, we will say, he dashed across and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole opportunity of your observing his face was at the time of rushing from the alley and striking, was that the half minute. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, was the only time you had of observing his face. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see him so as to distinguish who he was when you called to him, when he was twenty yards off. - A. Yes, perfectly, because the moon light was clear, then I could see more perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen him without Mr. Barrett being there should you have known him at the distance of twenty yards. - A. Yes, perfectly well, because he is bare of hair upon his crown.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was beating of Barrett you were twenty yards from him there was light enough for you to know him. - A. I am very sure of that, I am very clear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Do you know the woman, have you ever seen her since. - A. I cannot say; did I ever see her afterwards, did you say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that woman since. - A. Yes, it is a woman that goes for his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the woman that lives with him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity before had you of seeing him, you said you saw him before in the watchhouse, how many times had you seen him before. - A.Several different times; if I was to say ten or fifteen times I should not speak out of compass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lived. - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you make search for him. - A. At his house at the time Mr. Barrett was dressing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house. - A. Noble-street.</p>
               <p>Court. It is in this alley. - A. It is at the corner of this alley, it opens in the alley, from where he come out of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. In what state did you find Mr. Barrett when you came up to him, was he standing, sitting or laying. - A. Laying. I thought absolutely he was dead; I lifted him up, he tell with his head doubled, he had no life at all, as I thought; we took him to a neighbour and rested him against a door, we could not call them up at last we took him to Mr. Greaves; when we got a light we saw he had a cut on his head, there was a cut on his head about two inches and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. The surgeon is the best judge of that - when did you afterwards see Adams. - A. I saw him at Hicks's Hall, Clerkenwell; I knew him directly, in a moment, as soon as ever I saw him. I was perfectly sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw him at Hicks's Hall. - A. Last sessions, on the Friday in the sessions week.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of seeing him there. - A. I had got a warrant with me at the time, that I took out in June last; I desired

             to execute that warrant upon Adams.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Robertson to execute it. - A. He did not stand his trial that day, it was Monday he took his trial, he was acquitted; I was with Robertson to execute that warrant, I stood upon the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Adams. - A. I did not; when he went out they said Adams was out. Robertson went after him; after he had taken him. I met them in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether he know whether I am the man that struck him or not. On the 19th of June last there were two men came to my wife, she had occasion to be up, having a sick child.</p>
               <p>Court. That is your defence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to his house that same night. - A. Never at all, I was not in the house that night not till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130042"/>some days after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know whether he can swear I am the man that struck him positively. - A. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to me when you never saw me nor spoke to me - A. I have seen you in the watch-house; I saw you on that night.</p>
               <p>Q. He cannot swear that it was me that struck him. - A. I can with propriety.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw me with your eyes before. - A. You are the man, and the man only.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see him before. - A. Several times; I have seen him in custody several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in custody at the watchhouse more than once. - A. I cannot say that he was; he has been there for misdemeanors; he was there all night once at the watchhouse he was brought in about eight o'clock in the evening and remained there till eleven o'clock the next day, till he went to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to the magistrate the next day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the same part of the watch-house with you, so as to give you an opportunity of knowing his face. - A. I suppose for the course of an hour; they were talking to him, they let him out of the lock-up place for an hour, to know how he could be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was in the same room with you. - A. Nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him that night. - A. Not any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. None in the least. Mr. Greaves conversed with him; he will be a witness against him by-and-by upon this very thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between him and Greaves. - A. I cannot say I did; I was on particular business; I observed his hair was gone from the top of his head; I many times have been called up to turn him out of public houses for rioting.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he was in the watchhouse in the same room as you was. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he conversing with. - A. The headborough; I did not give any head to what he was talking of, because Adams was in liquor; he ran out of one thing into another; I dare say he was more than an hour, rather more than less.</p>

            . Q. You are a surgeon, I believe. - A. I am assistant to Mr. Maxfield, surgeon and apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the 19th of June called to Mr. Barret. - A. I was; about three o'clock in the morning; he was in bed at his own house, I found him nearly in an insensible state; he had been partly dressed by another surgeon; upon taking it off I discovered that some plaisters had been applied over the wound; they had been separated by bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this wound. - A. It was on the back part of the head; it might be two inches in length.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had it penetrated. - A. I penetrated the integumen through the scull, but there was no fracture.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was he in as to danger. - A. In this case it is not possible to discover immediately; he appeared insensible; when he was moved he did not seem sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this wound occasioned by. - A. By some weapon; there was a great contusion, it was what we call a contused lacerated wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Not what is called inscised wound. - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not what we call a cut, but rather a bruise; this wound had been made by a blunt instrument. - A. This wound had been made by a piece of wood or iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you understand by a cut, a wound made by a sharp instrument. - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How then, I ask you this; when we speak of a cut, or when a thing is said to be cut that wound is made by a sharp instrument. - A. Not in general; it may be cut with a blunt instrument, not particularly sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. A wound being made by an edged instrument, is called a cut; you may have a cut with a hatchet - does not the cut of a wound imply it being done with an edged instrument. - A. My lord, I have seen cuts from a stick, not particularly sharp; I have seen a cut with the knuckle or falling on a piece of timber; that is the distinction we make; a cut with a knife, that is called an incised wound, and a cut with a stick it is called lacerated.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it that the separation of the flesh by a sharp instrument is called a cut; in common language it is called a cut; when a person has fallen on a piece of timber and hurt their hand, they say I have torn my hand or bruised it; lacerated is a harder word. Suppose you pound a piece of flesh with a pestle, would you say you cut it. - A. I should say it was bruised.</p>
               <p>Court. So I should think.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he during the time this accident happened. - A. Yes, in a little house near Noble-street; the house is in an alley close to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in common with others hear the affray on the 19th of June. - A. Yes, on the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of hearing it, say any thing to Adams about it. - A. Yes on the Sunday morning after, as this happened an the Friday night, I told him there was a fine piece of work; that I understood he was the man that hurt the officers; he said he knew nothing of the matter, and so did his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else to you. - A. He added that he knew something about it; that somebody had done it. On the Tuesday following I was standing at the butcher's shop; I collect rents about that neighbourhood. He came by me, I said, here is a fine piece work, you dressed pretty well most of our officers that night; he said d - n me, I did, and I would do so again, if they come to my house, he said; but I did not know they were officers; then he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time go with Mr. Lee, in search after him. - A. I went with Lee about half an hour afterwards to the house, and the house was locked up; I never saw him in Poplar afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Adams at that time. - A. He was at the bar in the sessions house, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. He was acquitted of the charge. - A. He was; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130043"/>found it was going in his favour. I then went to the door, I desired one of the constables to assist me if there was occasion; when Adams came out he turned his coat up under his arm, and ran as fast as he could about a mile from the sessions house; I came up to him, I said to him, I have got you; he said you have. I said, suppose you know for what, yes, he replied, I suppose it is for that business at Poplar, it is said I. I then secured him, and brought him down to Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, with the greatest respect, I most humbly solicit your goodness to condescend to hear this my defence. The prosecutors on the 19th of June came to my house, between twelve and one o'clock, my wife having a sick child was the cause of her being up at that late hour; I was a bed and asleep with my other children, my wife went out to fasten the window shutters; when the prosecutors asked my wife to give them a lodging; she desired them to go about their business; they began to use her ill. she got in doors, they followed her, and when they got in they put the candle out and began to behave indecent; she called me to give her assistance. When I got up I thought the house was on fire, she called to me and said, dear husband, here is two men ill using me; upon which one of them run out of the door; I expected them to be thieves. I caught hold of a broomstick and struck one of them; one of them says d - n your eyes, whip it into him; they then ran down the lane, one run against the post and fell backwards, which I suppose to be the shortest of the two; I did not go out of the door, as I had nothing on but my shirt. On the next day I told my wife to go and get a warrant; the magistrate would not, they being parish constables, when they got a warrant against me, the magistrate told the clerk to make it a common assault, and desired me to get bail; when I was brought up for the next examination they brought a shirt stained with blood, upon which I was committed. I am a poor labouring man; I never was in any trouble in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any order for the payment of thirty three pound and nine pence bought into your house on the 5th of December. - A. Yes, it came from Mr. Johnson; I believe it was delivered to Mr. Begbie by Mr. Johnson's clerk; Mr. Begbie, one of our clerks gave it me; I put it on the tin box on the desk and locked it up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. About what time of the day did you receive that order. - A. I got it a quarter after three, and it wanted about twenty minutes to four when I left the accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the accompting house when you went out. - A. A young man of the name of Osborne, a clerk in our house; I am not quite sure whether Mr. Sowel had come back or not I did not look particularly at the order. I knew the amount and the drawer.</p>

               <p>COURT. - The prisoner's counsel has made an objection about the word London on the draft; you shall see it. At the same time it is my duty to declare what the law is; if the word London had not appeared on the face of it, the prisoner would have taken the benefit of it; but as it is, both law and ets are mixed together, the word London being expressed, and it actually was drawn in London and therefore you are to say whether you are satisfied in point of fact that he stole the note if you are, then the prisoner has committed the larcency; however, you are to judge of that; you have heard the evidence of persons both in the house of Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Stunt; Mr. Stunt's foreman has told you upon his oath the prisoner at the bar was the person who presented that draft, there can no imputation at all to Mr. Osborne.</p>

On the 12th of December, the prisoner, in a one horse chaise, came to my house, he drank tea there; he told me his horse was tired, and he was afraid that he would not be able to take him to town that night; he asked me if his horse could be taken care of till the Tuesday following, and then he should return to the Red Lion; he said, he was acquainted with Mr. Watson in Messrs. Esdaile's house, bankers, and asked me to give him change of a fifteen pound note; I gave him fifteen pounds in paper and cash; he ordered a chaise; he left his horse and whiskey at my house, and went off with the chaise, and his two sons with him; about four hours after he was gone there was a hue and cry after him.</p>

               <p>Q (To Prosecutor), Is that such indigo as you had in your warehouse. - A. It is such Indigo as we lost - it is worth nine or ten shillings a pound, we never gave him any authority to sell any Indigo.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Defence, My lord understanding that, although I have a Solicitor and Counsel, who are fully informed of the subject, yet it will be expected that I should make my defence. Feeling a consciousness of the falsehood of the allegation might over power me, I have determined to commit to writing this my solemn declaration. Although Messrs. Coles's business was regulated by method, yet it was in a great measure left to my discretion, I acted the best I could for them, but having entered into no specific agreement with them, I certainly considered, I had a right to reimbursement by every emolument. Under these circumstances, for near two years and a half, I had the uncontrouled management of their concern, wherein I had from seventy thousand to an hundred pound's worth of goods under my care. Surely then it could not be imagined that I could deem it worth while to commit the offence which I am charged and to which there could be no temptation. I was asked for an account, I rendered one, I wished the prosecutors to fill up the blanks with the sums which I considered my due; however, as far as it was I considered it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130047"/>acquiescent. I continued to pay and receive as usual, I was not charged with any omission or I should have answered any question that might have been stated. I was proceeding to wind up every transaction when I was apprehended in my chamber by a writ for 500 and the same day and following I could obtain no satisfaction for their extraordinary conduct, nor could I discover there was any criminal action against me. They made use of an engine to extort confession when I was under arrest, to which I was a stranger: their evidence has been obtained through terror. I utterly disclaim the charge and proclaim my innocence. I rely on the liberality of this court to save me from the power of wealth and the violence of wrong.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnsses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT, Every man found in possession of stolen goods, it becomes him to say where he got them from, the possession of stolen property, in law the presumption is that his hand is the hand that has stolen it. You have heard a long defence, and not a word in answer to the charge.</p>

               <p>Q. On what day before the robbery did you come there. - A. I think the Thursday week prior to that. I was in the habit of coming there once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on there on Sunday the 13th of December. - A. I did, on the 13th, Mr. Cox, and me both, went in the room; we found the room had been robbed; we imagined they came in the room by what we discovered by the window, there seemed a pane of glass broken sufficient for a person to have introduced a hand by which means they might have opened the shutters; we saw the drawers had been broken open we observed the Pier Glass was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that glass. - A. about six pounds. There were several articles taken from the drawers, they were all found in the house; there was a violin, two coats, and a waistcoat, some towels, a table cloth or two, and a few linen things. I cannot speak to exactly, they were my wife's, she was in the country; I was in the habit of going to my room once or twice a week. I left the key with Mrs. Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the same house. - A. Yes. On the next day we searched his room, the officer found the glass under the bed clothes, we found a small bit of India Ink, which I was well satisfied was mine, and we found a hammer in his room. I went with the officer to the fleet prison, he was apprehended there, and was taken to Bow street and examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing upon his examination. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. STAFFORD Mr. Gurney, You are the principal Clerk in Bow Street office, were you present at the examination of the prisoner. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. was it taken down - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Court, How came you not to take it down. - A. We do not in general take it down unless the prisoner makes a formal confession. I rather think it was a conversation of the parties</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, Did you make any promises or threats, or did any person say any thing to induce him to make the acknowledgement. - A. No. He acknowledged to Mr. Read that he had taken the pier glass from the window, the glass that was stolen; he acknowledged he had taken it.</p>

             Mr. Gurney, I believe you are one of the Bow Street Patrols. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 14th of December, did you make search in the prisoners room for the discovery of Mr. Basket's property. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. did you find a glass concealed in the manner he has related. - A. I did in the back garrett. I found a piece of India Ink and a small brush; I found a hammer which corresponded with the marks on the drawers, I found two picklock keys in the back garrett, on the floor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130048"/>I afterwards apprehended the Prisoner and took him to Bow-Street. (The Property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had that hammer out of the closet on the sunday morning following to which the robbery was done. I know nothing of the glass, nor did I know any thing about it 'till Friday morning. I went out on Thursday morning very early to an acquaintance in the Fleet prison and came home about half past eleven very tipsey with wine. The next morning I got up about eleven; I had not been down stairs above an hour before the landlady came in and said what had happened - I said I was very sorry for it. I went out and staid my usual time on Saturday, and on Sunday I was out all day. On Monday at the Fleet prison Mr. Basket come down to me with the officer. - They took me to a house in Fleet Street, and searched me. He asked me how I came to be so foolish as to take the glass. I said I did not take it; he said at Bow Street you say you found it, and that you took it in to take care of it, he said he would not appear against me, if sufficient was made up to him for his time and trouble. I told him I could not settle it, he must go to my grandmother; the Street door generally was left open all the day to a late hour at night. The parlour windows were left one night open the whole of the night, I have two witnesses to prove it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the street door in the habit of being left open. - A. Very often, the Street door was left open in the evening till eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there any men who live in the house besides Mr. Cox, Mr. Basket and the Prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q To Mrs. Cox, was not William Cox in and out of the house several times in a day, and even his workmen of an evening. - A. Yes, his workshop was backward; he was oblidged to come there, his paint was kept in a vault under the area, they had no business in the garret.

             once went up stairs to speak to his father, but the men never go up.</p>
               <p>Court, If you should be of opinion that the prisoner in the night time, between the 10th and the 11th of December, took the opportunity of getting in this room, by lifting up these sashes, and got into the room and stole the glass, he is guilty of the whole charge. If the sashes had been left open, and he took the opportunity of getting in and stealing the glass, then he will be guilty of stealing the glass, and not the burglary. In the first place you are to consider, whether he is guilty of stealing it at all. The evidence that effects him principally is, that the glass stole out of this room was found under his bed. How it got under his bed without his putting it there, I cannot say. You will judge what probability there is in the defence he has set up, that this glass was stolen by somebody or other, and carried up there; I do not find by the evidence that Mr. Coxs's men were found going to his room, you have the evidence of

If you see any reason to suppose that somebody else threw up the windows and he stole the glass you will find him guilty of stealing under 40 s. if you have no reason to suppose that any body throwed up the window than the person who stole the glass, you must find him guilty of the whole charge.</p>

I took the prisoner up about the latter end of May for taking away these three sheep from Finchley-common; he owned that he took these sheep, and he wished to make us any recompence. He made his escape out of the cage at Hendon; I did not see him after till the 10th of December at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. When you are giving us what the prisoner said, you should give us exactly what he said - was it not said by him that some sheep joined his drove as he was going over Finchley-common, it was dark, he did not see them. - A. No, he said, he had them off Finchley-common, but whether he took them or they joined the drove, that I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say at the time he was going over Finchley-common, it was dark, he was driving a drove of sheep some joined his drove, he did not observe these sheep till he got to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he say that, sir. - A. He did say that, and he wished to make us any recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. You stick to that like a parrot - he wished to make any recompence - did not he say when he came over the common, it was dark, he did not see them till he got to Holloway. - A. When he had his hearing, he said he come over the common in the dark, he did not see them till he got to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say when you first took him. - A. He owned that he had taken the sheep, and he would return the money back again; he said I will make you any recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he took the sheep from Finchley-common. - A. He did not say where he took them; when I took him at Sandrich he said, I know what you come after, I will return you the money back and make you any recompence; before the magistrate at St. Alban's, he said it was dark, he did not see the sheep till he got to Holloway.</p>

We took him in his garden at Sandrich; he said, Mr. Osman, I know what you are come after, it is about them three sheep I brought to you to sell; Mr. Billing laid hold of him. I said Smith how do you you do, he immediately said what I have related; we did not tell him for what purpose we came. I told him he must go along with us; he said, he meaned to give the man the money for the sheep, if he come after it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were your plates on the ground. - A. No; I cried stop thief, he was pursued and taken by Mr. Carpmeal; I never lost sight of him from the time he stumbled till the time he was taken; I was close to his heels. There was no plates found on him. There was a man walking close by the side of the prisoner as we were going up Holborn; I lost sight of that man.</p>

When I got there I took the box out of the cart to make room for a cask of liquor, and left it on the pavement; I went down the White Horse cellar for the cask; when I came up again the box was gone.</p>

               <p>PETER MASON. Q. You are an officer - on the 27th of November last, did you in company with Armstrong and Bishop, go to the house of Metcalfe. - A. I did; between eleven and twelve o'clock. We went to a house in Red Lion market, leading out of Whitecross-street into Golden-lane; Metcalfe acknowledged it was his house. Mr. Armstrong went in first; we went through the first room into the back room, and there Metcalfe, the woman, and Benjamin, the three prisoners, were all standing in that back room, and a quantity of linen was laying in the middle of the floor. Armstrong asked who the linen belonged to; they all denied it belonged to them. Mr. Armstrong said as there were none of them that owned it, he would take and see if he could find an owner. Bishop, I believe, found something in the bed; we took them and the linen to the office.</p>

I directly followed her and brought her back, when I had got her in the shop I charged her with having the piece of print, she denied it; while I was talking to her I saw it drop from her on the ground; I picked it up and gave it to Mr. Davies.</p>

I went and found the prisoners in the street, drinking saloop; they were taken to the watchhouse, and nothing found upon them. The watchhouse keeper told me to go back for the saloop woman; I did, she was gone away; she has not been out for weeks afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 4th of this month, going up Bethnal Greenroad I met Ives near his own house; I took charge of him, and took him to his house; I asked him if he had any deals brought him within these two or three days; his answer was that he had none. He has got two small yards, I looked over the first yard; there was none there that Mr. Weston knew; we went a little further from his dwelling house, looking over there there was one Mr. Weston knew was his property; I asked him how he got that, he said it was brought him to be sawed by a person, he could not tell where that person lived; I then asked him if he had not sold a deal that morning: he hesitated for sometime, he then said he had sold one; he told me it was brought by a person that he thought he could make free with to sell it for him. I put my mark on them; this is the deal I received from Ridley, and the other is just here.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified</p>
               <p>Houndle's Defence. On the 4th of January, as I was going to work, between seven and eight o'clock, I met a man with two deals; he asked me if I knew any body that could cut him a deal; I shewed him this yard, he pitched them there; I went down and spoke to the boy, I said is your master going to cut these deals for the man; I did not know where the man got the deals; I did not bring them.</p>
               <p>Ives's Defence. I was in bed when these deals were delivered in my yard; the boy did not say they were brought by Houndle.</p>

            . I am a watchman on Saffron-hill. On the 13th of December, about a quarter to one, I stopped the prisoner Wells, he had this sack and the potatoes in it; I asked him what he had got, he said hog potatoes; I told him I must stop him, unless he gave me a satisfactory account to pass; Wheeler said they were his property, he had bought them; he lived at No. 1, Black Boy-alley, Chick-lane; I asked them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130055"/>go to the watchhouse with me, and if the constable of the night was satisfied, then I should be satisfied they both seemed willing to go to the watchhouse. Turning out of Saffron Hill into turnstile that leads into Hatton Garden, Wells threw the sack off his back, he swore d - n his eyes, for my giving him that trouble, I should carry the sack; I sprung the rattle, one of the watchmen came; Wells was conducted to the watch-house with the potatoes; Wheeler got away. I told the constable where Wheeler lived; he sent the watchman and a patrol after him; he was brought to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I was officer of the night of Saffron Hill liberty. On the 13th of December, about one o'clock in the morning, Wells was brought to me with the sack of potatoes on his back; I asked Wells where he had brought it from, he said Clare Market; he said it belonged to Wheeler, and he was employed by Wheeler to carry it to Wheeler's house, No. 1. Black-boy-alley; he said they had stayed rather late drinking after they had purchased them. I sent for Wheeler, he said he had not purchased any potatoes that evening; he did not know Wells, he had not employed him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Wells's Defence. I met a man at Chancery-lane, he said he had slipt down and hurt himself, and he wished some one to carry the sack to Saffron Hill; I told him I was going as far as Saffron Hill; he said if I would carry the sack he would give me a shilling. The watchman stopped me, he asked me what I had got; I said, potatoes, I believe, by the appearance; he said, I must go to the watchhouse; I asked him to look after the man that owned them. I was detained. This man was not with me at the time I undertook the job.</p>
               <p>Uwin. I am convinced that Wheeler was along with Wells at the time I stopped him.</p>

               <p>PETER KAY. I am a shoemaker, I live opposite of Mr. Turner's. On the 21st of December, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and a man come up to Mr. Turner's door, and the man that was with him lifted up the latch and looked in, he lifted up the latch again, and went in; the prisoner staid at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the other man came out. - A. Between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour; he handed these two trays to the prisoner at the door; I went out and asked the prisoner what he was going to do with these two trays, he made me no answer, but put the two trays just at the entrance of New-court in Church-street; I took them up and put them in a neighbour's house and followed the prisoner. In about two minutes I came up to him. I am perfectly sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What become of the other man. - A. I do not know, he went the other way; I and a neighbour secured the prisoner and took him to the office. I delivered the trays up at the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a quantity of wearing apparel at any time. - A. Yes, on the 5th of last month. I lodge backwards in the yard; the prisoner lodged with me for a week, in the same room; I go out washing. I did not miss the articles till I came home; I kept these things in my drawer and in my box; there were no locks to them. I went out to work on that morning about half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130057"/>after six, I returned home about half past ten at night; I found all these things; gone they were all safe in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return to her lodging. - A. No. I saw my things on Wednesday the 6th of January; I saw the prisoner the next day where she had lodged that night in Chick-lane; she had part of the things with her. I gave her in charge of the constable, he took the things and the duplicates.</p>

I spoke to my brother about it, and said Bowles is a thief. In about five minutes afterwards there were two dozen of whisk brooms thrown out; I let them all hang just as they were till eight o'clock in the evening. When he left work, he bid us good night as usual and went away; then my brother and I followed him. We found him in the court behind the water tub; we found this mat and the other things. I asked him how he could think of robbing me in this way, and what he could say for himself; he said; what can I say. I said you must go with me to the watchhouse; he begged me to let him go and he would call the next morning and settle it with me. I gave him in charge; and he without any promise or threats said he was tempted by the devil to do it. The bands I found in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these things. - A. I missed my watch on the 29th of December last. When I went to bed at night I put it under my pillow; the prisoner lodged in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed. - A. At twelve o'clock. The next morning when I awoke I put my hand under my head, the watch was gone; I got up and took all the clothes off the bed, and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep in the same bed with you. - A. No. I looked about the room; I could not find it; I went to work. When I came home at night I told the people of the house what had happened, there was another man that slept along with him; I accused him of it, he said he did not know any thing about it; I did not say any more about it. On the Saturday I came home wet, I went up stairs to put my things on, I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. This was about half past ten at night. I lost a great coat, an under coat, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, a neck handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and a tobacco stopper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were all these things. - A. In the room where I sleep. The prisoner left his lodgings on Thursday the 31st.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your things between the Tuesday and the Thursday. - A. Yes, I think they were taken on the Thursday; I had suspicion of the prisoner by his not coming home to his lodging; I told my father of it, he got an officer to search him, and about him they found the tobacco stopper and gloves; the tobacco stopper I left in my waistcoat pocket, and the gloves in my great coat pocket. I have never found my watch nor my clothes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - I am assistant teacher for the asylum of deaf and dumb; the prisoner was one of my pupils under my instruction. I can make him understand.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is he. - A. He was put apprentice to a shoemaker; [the witness by motions and by writing related the evidence.] - Witness. He says the gloves and the tobacco stopper he found in his bed room.</p>
               <p>JOHN GEARY. I am an officer. On Monday the 4th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130058"/>of January I searched the prisoner, I found a pair of gloves and a tobacco stopper, and about nine and sixpence in money; when I got him to the office in Worship-street, I wrote to him with chalk, and he wrote to me; I asked him what he had done with the clothes, he informed me that he had changed them for a dark brown coat that he had on, and fifteen shillings besides. After he was examined I took him into the public house, I asked him where; he said Wapping, but where he would not tell. The watch, he said he knew nothing about that. I have never been able to trace the watch nor the clothes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner wrote for his defence - I did not steal watch - I did not steal clothes.</p>
               <p>The gloves produced and identified.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>JANE CROUCHER. Q. I believe you reside at Brompton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 3d of December did you see the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, a little of this side of Hyde Park corner; I do not know where he came from; I was going into the city; he accosted me, he said he was surprised at the improvements in town, or the buildings, I cannot say which, but it was one of them; he said he had not been in town for seven years, that he had a son lived in Broad-street, No. 15, he kept a grocer's shop; as for his part he would not live in the city if any body would give him a house to live in. He walked on one side of me till we came opposite of a house (we were in Piccadilly); he asked me whose that was, I said I believed it belonged to the Ranger of the park; he then stooped down and took up a parcel; I immediately said I wish the right owner had it; he replied, so do I; he said, if I had not picked it up somebody else would. He was going to put it in his pocket; I said I should like to know what it contained, as I thought it might be the means of the right owner coming to the property; he said he would go to a private place and examine it; then he said we may as well go into the Green Park; we were standing on that side. He went in, and went to the third bench; he opened the parcel, he took off the brown paper, and there was a red morocco pocket book; he opened the pocket book, it contained a diamond cross. At this time there was a stranger going by; the prisoner accosted this stranger and desired him to read this paper -</p>
               <p>'a diamond cross, one hundred pounds ten shillings' - I then proposed to him to find out the right owner; this stranger said, madam, that would be very wrong, some person or other would own it that it did not belong to, it would be in the paper the next morning. Then the stranger proposed that he should leave some property in my hands, either thirty or forty pounds. I replied whatever you leave in my hands shall be safe. The prisoner at the same time said there was a man in Pall Mall that had fifty pounds of his money, and he would go and get the sum. He took me to a room in a public house, I think in <placeName id="t18080113-68-crimeloc412">Duke-street, St. James's</placeName>

The prisoner said your will be sure to deliver up the cross-tomorrow, when I come at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them your address. - A. Yes, and they gave me their address; the prisoner wrote his address, 15, Bird-street, and the stranger gave his address, 17, John-street, Westminster. They seemed so fair I had no idea what they were about. The stranger desired I would carry it home and lock it up before I went into the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the stranger since. - A. No. On the evening of the next day I went to Bow-street office and gave information; the magistrate was kind enough to speak to me although I went after the office hours were over. The officer said if the lady is not afraid of trusting herself with me, he would take me to a public house in Leicester Fields where I might see him. I saw him near the Ship in Leicester Fields; he was walking fast along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the prisoner. - A. Yes, I have no doubt of his person; I thought he was an honest country farmer; the watch and the five pound note the officer has; it was produced at Bow street.</p>

I was going through Leicester Fields, he was walking just before me; I saw the lady up with her arms, I catched hold of the prisoner at the bar; he looked round and said, I know what the lady wants is her gold watch again; I said to him I have got what I want at present, you shall go with me; he said, I dare say if the lady gets her gold watch again she will be satisfied; I replied, I do not know that she will, there is a five pound note besides; he said if I would let him go, I will take you to a man who has the duplicate of the watch, it is in pawn; he did not tell where. Going along the prison kept talking to the lady; I told the lady not to talk to him, but to go on before. I took him to the

            . I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street, attached to Worship-street office. On Tuesday evening the 15th of December, Valentine and I were going down Brick-lane, Spitalfields; we saw the two prisoners at the bar, Cox went into Mr. Wilson's shop, he put his hand to a shelf that was at the window; he took something off that shelf, but what I did not know; Cox went in again. Evans and Cox were close together, Evans went in after him; Evans had got an apron on, in that apron he had got that half tub of raisins. Valentine caught hold of him and threw him down in the street in the mud; I took hold of Cox; we took them back into the shop and secured them; we went and picked up the plums in the street.</p>

            . Q. You are a patrol likewise. - A. Yes, I was in company with Gleed. On the 15th of December last as we were going down Brick-lane, Spitalfields, I saw Cox go in Mr. Wilson's shop, and snatch something out of the window; he came out to Evans, and they both went into the shop again; I saw them both come out, Evans had something in his apron, they both crossed the road; I took Evans by the collar, I asked him what he was carrying off; he immediately threw down this tub of raisins; I took him and the tub into Mr. Wilson's shop I asked Mr. Wilson if he had lost any thing; he said he had, a half tub of raision; he said this was the tub, and he had lost three sticks of Spanish juice. Just by were I took Evans these three sticks of Spanish liquorice laid in the mud.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Evans's Defence. When first we were taken in the shop, they asked Mr. Wilson if he had lost any thing; he said he did not know that he had; then when he searched his shop he said half a tub of raisins and nothing else; they took me in custody, I told them where I belonged to. That gentleman in the white coat said I had been to school with him; I said I had been to sea for three or four years I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Cox's Defence. I was going along the street to see for work, and I was going from there home to my father; I had not been out before for above half a year.</p>
               <p>Cox called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Evans called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I did not go immediately, being about something else, thinking he might want to purchase it; when I saw him go out with it I followed him, I took hold of him at the next door with one hand, he dropped the turkey; I picked up the turkey with the other; he went across the road, I put him in a silversmith's shop, there I secured him till an officer came.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's; when I apprehended the prisoner, I searched her and a box; I found nothing relating to the watch. Mrs. Straker missed some lace from a habit shirt of hers: I found the lace on the prisoners cap in the box; the prisoner said she took the lace and sewed it on her cap, to make Mrs. Straker a present of it.</p>
               <p>MRS. STRAKER. Q. You are the wife of William Straker. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the officer was giving his evidence about searching the box. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be the prisoners box. - A. Yes, it was locked; I saw a cap found with lace on it, the lace is mine, it was upon my habit shirt; I do not recollect seeing it since. The Sunday before it was dirty I believe it was in the foul clothes bag, but I am not certain; the habit shirt was found in the prisoners box with the lace taken off; I knew the lace again, but there were no particular marks on it; I should not like to swear to it, I am sure it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise of favour about the watch the night before. - A. I told her nobody should know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of your watch. A. It cost me three pounds ten shillings, second hand, five or six years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord - with most perfect consciousness of my innocence, I throw myself upon the mercy of the court and the jury. The watch which I am accused of taking, was perpetually left about the house, and in rooms through which many persons were passing. It is true I and many persons might have purloined it; but the rectitude of my conscience would not suffer me to do it. I ever protest my innocence with regard to the lace; - could it have been possible for me to commit a theft of the kind, I had frequent opportunities of so doing to a much larger value. The most perfect confidence was placed in me by the prosecutor and his wife. I have hitherto passed through life without a stain on my character. I trust in this instance I have not deviated from the principles of virtue and honesty, by which I have been brought up to from my infancy by my parents.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>ROBERT FAIRBURN. I met the prisoner at the top of Bond-street on the 21st of December, between nine and ten in the evening; she wished me to go with her and give her something to drink. I went to her lodgings in <placeName id="t18080113-73-crimeloc447">John-street</placeName>

I did not at the present moment make any resistance by taking it from her, she told me she took it to look at; I then remained in the room without taking particular notice what she had done with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. I was perfectly sober. While I was looking at a picture that was in a corner of the room, Cannon came into the room; I afterwards asked for my watch; Werrelley denied having seen it, nor had she taken it; I then said if she would not deliver it up to me I would call the watch; I asked Cannon if she had not got it from her, she denied having it. I went down stairs and called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Werrelley's Defence. He gave me the watch into my hand, he did not give me any money; I put it in a proper place; as I was in the habits of bringing different company home. The gentleman asked me for the watch several times; I did not return it him, as he had not gave me any money; I put the watch by until such time as he should please to call to give me some money. At the watchhouse I sent this woman to give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How was this, is it true that you gave her no money. - A. I gave her a shilling to get something to drink, and I gave her a shilling besides.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence. She did not like to be in the watchhouse; she told me to go home and get the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. What man was that. - A. I did not know that person, I passed him, I thought he was a tradesman of the town, till I got within sight of my own door, then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130061"/>I met the prisoner at the bar about fifteen yards from my door, with the two pieces of stuff that are here, he was coming towards me in a direction from my shop; I saw him come direct from my shop door; my shop rather stands out of the main street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him come out of the shop door. - A. No, I do not believe he came out of the shop door at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, how near was he to the door. - A. Close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing there or walking. - A. Just as I turned round to the main street, he was walking from my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses or shops in the recess where your house stands. - A. Not linen draper's.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other houses that are out of the main street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come up to you. - A. I met him within fifteen yards from my door; I caught hold of the stuff, and asked him how he came by them; he immediately ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same. - A. I believe he is the same; I have not much doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you judge from your recollection and the figure of his person. - A. From the appearance of his person, and from the observations that I made; I described his dress to my wife; when I went in she said the prisoner had been in the shop,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to pursue him when he run off. - A. No, I took the stuff first; I went out to see if I could find him or his comrade with the other two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance from your shop was it that you had seen the other man. - A. It might be an hundred yards down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What success had you in searching after the prisoner and his comrade. - A. I had been to a pawnbrokers in Old Brentford; in about three quarters of an hour after, as I was returning up the street, the prisoner was standing up against the wall. I stopped and looked at him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from your own shop. - A. It is about a quarter of a mile down to Old Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped and looked at him. - A. Yes; he asked me if I knew him; I told him I thought I did; and I asked him if he would walk up the street with me, which he did; he did not resist. As I walked up the street with him, I asked him if he had not bought a silk handkerchief at a linen draper's up the street, he said, no, he had not, he did not want one; when I took him into my shop, I sent for a constable; and my wife recognized him being in the shop a few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the two pieces that you took from him. - A. Yes. These are the pieces; there is my private mark on them; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not disposed of these pieces in the way of business. - A. I am certain I had not; the four pieces were there when I went out in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of them. - A. They are put down two pounds in the indictment; one of them cost me forty shillings, discount two and a half; the other twenty five shillings.</p>
               <p>MARY DAVISON. Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do, I saw him in my shop on the 6th of January about five in the evening; he came into my shop to buy a silk handkerchief. I asked him six shillings for it, he asked me to let him have it for five and six pence; he gave me six shillings; the money I had asked him before.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was there was it light. - A. It was; I had candles in the shop, I distinguished his face, and likewise a scar he had on the upper part of his lip; I remarked his dress. I was just gone out of shop a few minutes when Mr. Davison brought in the two pieces of stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call them. - A. Bombazets. He told me he had taken them from a boy in the street; he went out and brought in the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at these bombazets when they were brought in by Mr. Davison. - A. I did; I had seen them in the shop a short time before the boy came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before. - A. A short time; I cannot say; they lay within side of the shop door, close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from that part of the shop were you when when you sold him the silk handkerchief. - A. Not above two or three yards; our shop is very small.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy go out. - A. Yes, and I went into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course they could not go out with such a thing under his arm at that time. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went out of the shop a very short time before your husband came in with the bombazets. Did you leave no one else in the shop. - A. There was no one else in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door wide open. - A. The shop door was wide open, and the bombazets were against the door, they kept it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband afterward come back with the boy; did you then observe the person of the boy. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alteration when he was brought back by your husband. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that mark on the lip. - A. Yes, it was by a cold, I believe; I do not observe it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the mark was not a scar, but something broke out on the lip. - A. It was. He gave me a seven shilling piece for the handkerchief, and I gave him a crooked shilling. When he came back to the shop he had a crooked shilling but I would not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband and you occupy the whole house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop a part of the house. - A. Yes, we have no lodgers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to see my uncle at the next town to that; I was coming back to take the coach at Kew bridge; that gentleman stopped me as I was making water, I asked him if he knew me; he asked me if I would come up the town with him, I said yes; he asked me if I had bought a handkerchief, I said no.</p>

            . I am one of the conductors of the patrol of Bow-street. On the 18th of December I was in Holborn; I saw Macrae and Wood in a stocking shop; Jennings was out side of the window; Wood and Macrae came out; they went up Holborn about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the shop of Mr. Wasp. - A. About thirty yards; I saw Jennings standing at the corner of Chancery-lane, that is about eleven yards from Mr. Wasp's, on the same side of the way. I went down Holborn, and Jennings passed me running, she had something in her lap; I went up Holborn again; I met Macrae and Wood, they were coming down Holborn, they were between Mr. Wasp's shop and Southampton-buildings, as if coming from Mr. Wasp's shop. Macrae called out Mary three or four times, they crossed over the way and stood against Gray's Inn coffee-house; I saw them all join; I sent Lines and Preston to watch them; I went to Mr. Wasp's shop to know if two women had been there; they told me they had. I suspected they had when I missed them. From information I went over to Warwick-court, there I saw the three prisoners together I went and took hold of Jennings and Wood; Macrae run away. I got hold of Jennings with my right hand I found something drop from her; I had got hold of Wood with my left hand, I was between them; the shoes dropped close to my right foot on the side Jennings was; then we took them to Mr. Wasp's shop; when I heard them fall I stooped down and picked them up immediately; I have had them in my possession ever since; I searched Wood; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130063"/>did not find any thing upon her. I took the prisoners to Mr. Wasp's shop, and then to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. It was Macrae that called out Mary; you have no doubt that the shoes that fell at your right hand were dropped by Jennings. A. No doubt at all.</p>

On the 18th of December, I was following Smith down Holborn; when I came to 317, the stocking shop, I saw Macrae and Wood in the stocking shop; I left them there, in two or three minutes they came out of the shop; we followed them till we came to Chancery-lane; we waited at the corner of Chancery-lane four or five minutes, Macrae walked by me and went down Holborn again alone; I crossed over the way, hearing a person calling out Mary.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Monday night, I was standing in Long Acre with a young woman, about half after eight this young man came up to us, and asked me where was Long Acre; I told him he was in Long Acre; he asked me if I lived far from there; I told him I did not; then he asked me if I had a room of own, I told him I had not; he said he would give me a shilling for his pleasure, which he did; after that he very much ill used me, and coming into the street, he took me to the watchhouse; this money I had saved up ever since Christmas last to buy me a gown; he has sworn so false, I must leave it to the jury.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no pretence for making it a highway robbery, if you believe his story she picked his pocket; she took the opportunity as they were walking towards the place to take his purse out of his pocket; there is no doubt but what she stole it, if you believe the prosecutors story; but you will acquit her of the highway robbery. He says he was sober when it happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge the waggoner having any butter consigned to Mr. Todd. - A. Yes. On the 21st of December a certain quantity arrived by the Exeter waggon, it was put into the warehouse, as is usual, till the owner applied for it; it was marked I T and a diamond.</p>
               <p>Q. How many firkins, were there. - A. Five firkins and three half firkins, marked 17 to 24; in consequence of Chapman the officer making application to the inn concerning a firkin of butter marked I T 19, with a diamond, we observed one of that number was gone. I attended the office in Hatton Garden when the persons were examined; I knew Parsley very well, he was in the habit of coming from Messrs. Todd and Benson at Pentonville, to our inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was their mark the same as this, I T. - A. No, T B.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN. Q. You are an officer belonging to Hatton Garden office. - A. I am. When Ekelsoe, a brother officer, and I entered the prisoner Martin's room on Saffron-hill, she turned her back on the butter and opened the cupboard door; she said we might look there for any thing; I pulled her of oneside, and upon the ground, between her and the foot of the bed, the firkin of butter stood; I told her that was partly what I wanted; a child in the bed about five years old cried out, mammy, Thomas brought it; I said I know your husband deals in a great many comical things, I did not know that he dealt in butter; I took her to the office and the butter; the next morning I saw Parsley and her husband. I introduced them into the office. I went to the Bell in Friday-street, I found the butter belonged to Mr. Todd, of St. Paul's church yard. Parsley said he carried it for Mr. Todd of Pentonville; he was so intoxicated he could not carry it there.</p>

            ; I live at Islington; we receive butter from the Exeter waggon; the mark was T D.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner on the 21st to receive any butter. - A. I believe he was, I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Parsley's Defence. On Monday the 21st, I was employed by Mr. Todd at Islington, to go to the Bell inn, Friday-street, to get the firkins of butter for him; when Mr. Todd is there he puts them all right, as I am no scholar. I found but three; he told me there were four; I carried these three to him. In about four hours afterwards they had found the one; I went back for it, I was so intoxicated I fell down; I went to Mrs. Martin's with it; I there fell fast asleep against the fire place; when I awoke I told them it was late to go to Islington, and being intoxicated, I asked them the favour of letting me leave it there till the morning, and then I would take it up to Islington; they granted me the favour; I went home to go to bed; sometime after I had got home Martin came to inform me that the firkin of butter I had left at his house I had stolen, his wife was in custody for it. I told him it was wrong I would go to Chapman's house; I went, Mrs Chapman told me he was not at home; the next morning I went to Chapman's house, the boy there told me to go to the Royal Oak and he would be with me; I did, and saw Chapman there. As to this woman she is entirely innocent of it.</p>

               <p>Martin said nothing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Parsley called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . Q. Are you a servant at the Bull's Head. - A. Yes. I was in the bar, I saw the prisoner go down stairs into the kitchen, and I saw her go out in the street. After she came up I followed her in the street about the distance of an hundred yards from the house. I asked her to come back with me; she said - child, who wants me? and she came back with me. When I got her in the house I asked her what she had got under her gown. I saw my fellow servant's apron in her pocket, I took it out, and the gown fell down; it was tucked under her gown. She then said she would do any thing in her power to make me amends. I knew the gown and the apron to be my fellow servant's.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Carr. On the 6th of January the prisoner was carrying goods backwards and forwards into the warehouse; I saw him go from the warehouse into the necessary, and I observed something in his pockets. I informed Norman, the porter, of it, and told him to watch him. I took the candle and the lanthorn, and there I discovered the articles of earthen ware concealed in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what it was in his pockets. - A. No, I only saw a bulk. After he had left work, he was going home; about the distance of an hundred yards off I met him, and asked him what he had got about him; he said nothing but a cracked bason. I clapped my hand upon his bosom and told him I felt more than that; he immediately pulled out four basons from his bosom and gave them into my hands. We immediately took him to his master's house, and there were taken from him twelve cups and twelve saucers; they were distributed about his person, and some in the crown of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of these articles - were they worth four shillings all together. - A. More than that.</p>

On Saturday the 19th of December, at six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and two others came up to my shop window. They seemed to be viewing what was in the shop window; presently after they came to the door. I had suspicion that they meaned to take something; I went into a dark passage and watched them. I saw them make several attempts; at last the prisoner took a piece of bacon out of the window and delivered it to one of the others. I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bacon. - A. It lay in the window on the top of a butter tub; when he had delivered it to one of the others, he began running directly. I came out of the passage and passed them that had it. I said I would have him that did take it. I caught him; I am sure he is the man. I never got the bacon, there was about six pound of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been of an errand, I was running by this man's door and many people ran, he halloaed out stop thief. I stopped, and he charged me with stealing it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

In consequence of suspicion on the 12th of December, between five and six o'clock, I concealed myself in a ware room adjoining my shop; as I went in I met two of the men coming out of the shop going to their tea; the prisoner was then the only person left behind; I then went in my place of concealment, I might be there about five minutes. I observed through a hole in the partition the prisoner coming from an upper shop into a lower one; he left his candle in the upper one, consequently I could not see him in the lower one; I could hear him distinctly in the lower shop, as if he was taking up some loose materials that sounded like brass I could hear them drop as if into a bag or pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in this lower shop. - A. About a minute and a half; he returned from the lower shop into the upper, and put out the candle; then he came down and went into the retail shop; I followed him; when I came in the front shop, he was asking my man to change a bad shilling I had given to him a day or two before. I desired the man to change it, and I walked out of the door and stood upon the pavement; the prisoner came out and passed me; as he was going about half way over the street I hailed him, he came back to me; I took hold of him and told him he had robbed me. He said he had not. I told him in positive terms that I heard him doing that which he ought not, and insisted upon it that he had something upon him. On this the prisoner fell on his kness and begged my pardon, saying he had robbed me and would come in the shop and take the things out himself. He walked into the back shop and took it out of his pocket himself. - These are the pieces of brass, I have no doubt but they are mine.</p>

               <p>Q. There has been a bed produced worked with yellow silk; have you seen that bed before in the hospital. - A. Yes. I saw it in Mrs. Hutchinson's ward; it a flock bed belonging to the hospital; the other bed worked with brown I saw made in the hospital three weeks after I was in the hospital - it was kept in Mrs. Hutchinson's ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Perfectly well; he was a watchman of the hospital. He breakfasted, dined, and had his tea with Mrs. Hutchinson for five weeks, and his supper was sent to the gate every night. I did not know but that he was Mrs. Hutchinson's husband till his wife came to make a piece of work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of these beds taken out of the hospital - A. I did not. I saw sister Hutchinson carrying one of the beds into her own room in Aldridge's ward.</p>

The prisoner was there on the Tuesday evening as she left the ward on the Thursday; and then the ward was put in darkness. - At the time that Mrs, Hutchinson ordered the ward to be in darkness, the prisoner and a young man were in sister Hutchinson's room; sister Hutchinson went out into the lobby, she said now all is safe - come along. - The prisoner and the young man that was there, assisted in carrying two or three bundles.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoner at the bar. - A. I know Mr. Henshaw by being a customer of my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of December do you recollect his bringing any rivets to your master's house. - A. I saw one; he asked my master, the old gentleman, if such things would suit him my master made answer he could not say, his son was not at home; he said he would send a twopenny post letter the next morning if Mr. Henshaw liked. Mr. Henshaw said he would not give him the trouble as he was coming that way on the next day, he would call; Mr. Henshaw did call the next day about twelve o'clock, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then. - A. I did not see; he went away, having left the rivets on the first day; on the second day the rivets were brought in the evening, by a soldier and Mr. Henshaw's apprentice, they were brought on a truck, I took them in: when I had put them in a back place in the yard, Mr. Griffiths and master came and took possession of them; and the soldier and Mr. Henshaw's apprentice were taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q.What quantity of rivets were there. - A. The bags and all weighed one hundred, three quarters, and nineteen pound.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. Are you an apprentice to Mr. Henshaw. - A. Yes. I was sent with these rivets on the 24th of December, I took them from my master's No. 28, King-street, Tower Hill, to Mr. Tylers house in Cripplegate-building's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master give you any directions when he gave you these rivets to carry. - A. He only told me to carry them to Mr. Tyler's.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought them according to his direction and then you were taken in custody. - A. Yes; I remained in custody from that night till Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had your master them rivets from. - A. From Haley, the other prisoner; it was in the evening I carried them, and he had them of Haley on the same day between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it you took them to Mr. Tyler's. - A. Between four and five o'clock. When the rivets were brought in I was sent for two bags to put them in; they were brought in baskets by Haley at twice; they were weighed in the bags.</p>

               <p>Q. What their names. - A. Francis and James Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. In their business do they use rivets. - A.They do; they are all marked W T; formerly the firm was Thwaites and Co. and all the tools that we had in the shop at that time had W T; it is impossible for a man to make a rivet with these tools without W T being stamped upon the rivet. We have lost a vast quantity of rivets and copper; these rivets are all wrought with the hammer; there is W T upon them all; I believe them to be the property of Messrs. Morgan.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. Q. You are an officer of Lambeth street office. - A. I am. On the 24th of December last, from information, I went to the house of Mr. Tyler with Mr. Keate, and about five in the evening I observed Mr. Henshaw's apprentice and the soldier in the warehouse of Mr. Tyler; I took both of them in custody, and put them in the compter. About seven o'clock the same evening I took Mr. Henshaw in custody; I took him into the back parlour, I told him I had taken in custody his apprentice, I had put him in the compter along with the soldier for delivering some copper rivets at Mr. Tylers, Cripplegate Buildings; I asked him if he had sent any with his apprentice and the soldier; he said he had, he wondered they stopped so long, he was going to send after them; I asked him who he bought them of, he said a man brought him a sample of them the day before, and he believed he was an Irish man, he was a dirty looking fellow in a smock frock; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130070"/>that he did not buy them on that day, he would not buy them except he could sell them again, he was to call on the next day for an answer; he went to Mr. Tyler's that evening to see if Mr. Tyler would purchase them; he saw old Mr. Tyler, he could not give him an answer except his son was at home, if he would call the next day he would give him an answer; he said he did call the next day on Mr. Tyler, and they agreed for him to send them in; that he was to give him thirteen pence a pound for them; he then returned home and sent his apprentice and the soldier with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Henshaw. - A. He sells allsorts of ironmongery. I asked him where this man lived that brought them, he said some where near Petticoat-lane, he could not justly say where; he said, he had been there at different times before; at first he could not recollect his name, then he said his name was Haley; I said I knew Haley very well; he said, he expected him in every minute for his money, he was to give him ten pence a pound for them; I took him to the magistrate, leaving my brother officer to wait for Haley; soon after I got to the officer my fellow officer brought Haley. Haley was put to the bar and asked where he got the rivets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what was said taken in writing. - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. From the information you received, no matter what it was, did not you find every thing he told you true. - A. Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mr. Henshaw's mother pointed out Haley to you. - A. Yes, she did, she sent him into the room where I was; I told him as soon as he came into the room, I had a charge of felony against him concerning some stolen copper; I asked him if he knew any thing about bringing any copper to Mr. Henshaw's he said, he did; I asked him if he could account how he came by it; he said, he met a countryman driving a team in Whitechapel, he asked him if he wanted a job, he told him he would give him five shillings if he would carry these two parcels to Mr. Henshaw's, King-street, Tower Hill; I asked him if he knew the countryman's name, he said he did not know his name nor where he lived; he said he had come on purpose to receive the money and he meaned to keep the money till he saw the countryman in the street, and then he meant to return the money to him. In taking him along the street to the office he resisted a great deal, and tried to make his escape; I secured him, and conveyed him to the magistrate, and he was committed. (The examinations of the prisoners before the magistrate read.)</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Haley's Defence. I was employed to bring them from Whitechapel to Mr. Henshaw's. I have a great family.</p>
               <p>Henshaw's Defence. I had not the least idea that these articles were stolen, or else I should not have offered them to so respectable a tradesman as Mr. Tyler. I lament that their religious principles prevents them from coming forward. They offered me thirteen pence a pound for the copper.</p>
               <p>Haley called no witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Henshaw called twenty one witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into a public house in Broad-street, I saw this young man setting there; he said he was going my way. We went into Market-street; he said stop here, I am going into this house; he went in and came out, and said step in; I went in and stopped inside of the door a minute; I believe when he came out he had a bundle, I am not quite sure whether he had or not; the lady came out and made an alarm. That is all I have to say.</p>

On the evening of the 11th of December, I wanted to go to that part of the distill house, where my partner was; on returning back to the accompting house I saw some person endeavouring to conceal themselves; I asked who was there, I received no answer; I took a candle to see who was there, and found it to be the prisoner; I asked him what he was about, he replied nothing; I requested to see what that nothing was that he was about; I found that he had filled a two gallon cask of gin; he was in the act of putting it behind an empty pipe; when I took up the cask and took him to the accompting house, I searched him; I found this tin case of foreign brandy, about a pint, I found this key of the vat; we have two keys which open almost all the vats in the house. There was no cork in this cask, it was just filled; he told me he had drawn it out of the foreign cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of Tuesday the 15th of December, were you in Bartholomew-close. - A. I was, about twenty minutes after eight, soon after it was light, Mr. Ellis was with me another officer; I saw Bray and Potts come out of a public house, called the Baker and Basket, in Cloth-fair; Bray came out first and Potts followed; Bray had a bag twice as large as Pott's, they had each of them a bag; Bray's bag was the largest considerably, there was double the quantity in it; by the bend of the bags on the shoulders both of them appeared to be grain of some sort. When they came out they went down Middle-street, towards Bartholomew-close; they appeared to be in company together: I watched them; Bray and Potts turned into Half Moon-alley, and the moment they turned in Bray mended his pace and ran; Potts was behind him. I lost sight of Bray, when he turned the elbow of the alley. I could not pass Potts the passage was so narrow; Potts went into Aldersgate-street, he appeared to be looking about for Bray, he had lost him by his manner; some man came up to him and asked him to have something to drink; he turned into a public house, I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the contents of the bag on his shoulder. - A. I did, I found it contained forty two pounds of cochineal; I took Potts in company of my brother officer to the custom house. When I got out of the public house into the street, I saw Bray about forty or fifty yards off at the end of Hare-court, he appeared to be looking for Potts. He had no bag then.</p>

I did not know at that time what it was: I saw it afterwards when the two gentlemen stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that first bag. - A. It was emptied all out into two bags, one of which I carried and one Bray carried; I do not know what became of that bag; Bray took the largest bag, and I had the smallest; he went out first, I followed him; I lost him all at once; when I got into Aldersgate-street, I looked all round, I could not see him; when an opposite neighbour of mine, his name was Sadler, asked me to have something to drink; I put the bag down in the public house, and while I was going to have a glass of something to drink, Mr. Ellis and the other gentleman came in and took the bag from me.</p>

Yes, I have seen him in the house at different times having a pint of beer, and stopping ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then going away again; I never saw Potts before that morning; Mr. Bray came in between seven and eight o'clock, with a bag on his shoulder, and Potts followed him; when they came in master was not up; I called him down to get a pint of beer; they stopped some time in the back room, I do not know what they did; I was cleaning the kitchen, I never went in the room; they drank the purl and gin; they went out with these two bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the first bag. - A. No, I never saw it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. What did these bags contain. - A. I cannot tell, I never saw any thing it contained; I never went into the back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130073"/>room; they came into the tap room to drink the purl and gin. I did not go in the room after they went out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read). My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. I am innocent of the charge of uttering in the way alledged to me; I never in my life wilfully passed a bad shilling, or any current coin of this realm. On the day mentioned in this indictment I purchased a ticket of a watch pawned in Holborn. I stood at the shop of my prosecutor, to separate and take out this duplicate from my money. I was rather weak in my person, having been lately discharged from the house of recovery, of the fever. I fancied one of the buns in the window, I asked the price of them, she said one penny; without my having any forethought that I had less change, I threw down one of the shillings that I had in my hand; I went in the shop and got the change; I had got change of a pound note of Mr. Nowland, a victualler, and the change he gave me was found on me when I was taken in custody. I have endeavoured to subpoena Mr. Nowland; therefore I hope you will take my case into consideration, and restore me to my liberty again.</p>
