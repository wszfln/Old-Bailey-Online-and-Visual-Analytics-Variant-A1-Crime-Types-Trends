On the night of Sunday, the 28th of April, our house was broke open; the shop was made fast on the Saturday night, and it was locked up all day on the Sunday; we went to bed about ten; we were alarmed about two in the morning by a violent knocking at the door, I believe, by the watchman; my husband and I both went down; I found that a shutter had been forcibly taken down and a square of glass entirely out, and the watchman's lanthorn put into the window through the broken square of glass; I then examined to see what we had lost, and found that end of the shelves next to the window, stripped; we then had the shutters secured, and went to bed again; when I came in the morning, I missed twelve pair of girls' black hose, fifteen pair of women's black worsted hose, twelve pair of boys' speckled worsted, twelve pair of girls' cotton hose, twenty pair of women's cotton hose, and one leather wrapper of sewing silk, about a pound or a pound and a half.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On Sunday, the 27th of April, myself, and Carter and Robertson, agreed to go to Mrs. Pead's in Whitechapel-road, which we did between the hours of twelve and one in the night, and with an iron-crow we forced the corner window shutter, that corner next Mile-end turnpike; we took down the shutters and broke a square of glass; then Carter got half-way into the window and could get no farther; he said there was a parcel of wires before him that he could get no further; then he came out again, and Robertson, and me and Carter put our hands in as far as we could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300004"/>reach, and took out several papers of stockings, and a small sample of sewing silk of various colours and some thread, which we conveyed to the house of Mrs. Starr the same morning; me and Robertson went in, and Carter stopped outside the door; Mr. Pauling was in the shop, and Mrs. Starr sitting backwards; she desired me to come to her, we had the property in a bag, and she took it backwards into the wash-house; we shook them out upon the bricks, there were children's black stockings, and children's white cotton stockings, and other colours; I asked her four guineas for them, she gave me three; me and Robertson came out, and told Carter, that we got but fifteen shillings for them; he was standing over the way, in an Alley; we gave Carter five shillings, and Robertson and I divided the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any stockings amongst them like these? - A. There were some of them of the same sort, I cannot say that these are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up? - A. In June; and then I gave information against Robertson and Carter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You got three guineas from Mrs. Starr? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought there had been some honour among thieves, but you gave Carter but five shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in this Court? - A. I was here twice last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Those are the only times? - A. This is the third time.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you here before? - A. It is so long since that I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. You can recollect whether you were a prisoner at the bar, or a witness? - A. To the best of my knowledge I was a prisoner then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you tried here then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What for? - A. They told me I had stole a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Jury believe it? - A. Yes; it seemed so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were convicted, were not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And imprisoned for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. I believe it was two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you whipped too? - A. Yes, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time you have been in Newgate? - A. That was the only time.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, the moment this robbery was committed your conscience smote you, and you gave information? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, perhaps, that by giving evidence to-day, you save yourself from being tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had a country jaunt - you were never tried at any Assizes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pead. There were three pair of stockings that I lost, exactly corresponding with these in size, and in the clocks, but there are no marks upon them.</p>

On Friday the 19th, I went on board a ship at Princes-stairs Tier, to apprehend Shropshire.</p>
               <p>Q. The examination was taken in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Magistrate sign it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner sign it? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was in the office at the time the prisoner was examined; I have very often seen Mr. Herriot write, I saw him sign the examination, and I saw the prisoner sign it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner signed two or three papers, will you undertake to swear that you saw him sign that identical paper? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>- SHROPSHIRE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Vaillant. I am a Custom-house-officer; I was on board the ship Kerie: On the 30th of June last, the prisoner came on board, about an hour after me, he was mate on board, she was lying at Princes-stairs, Rotherhithe, and was taking in her lading; about the 14th or 15th of July, he said, if he had had some on board the ship that he had had before on board of other ships, he said, you might put a hundred pounds a-piece in your pocket; I told him I did not wish to be seen in any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What kind? - A. Plundering.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express what he meant at all? - A. No; I told Mr. Fraser of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q. How came you by the hat that was taken from you by Perry? - A. Bentham gave it me down the stairs; it was about five days after the conversation: I was in the steerage, and he came out of the cabin, and asked me for my old hat, I gave him a hat with an oil-skin on it, and in about fourteen or fifteen minutes, he returned me the hat that was taken from me by Mr. Perry, with the oil-skin upon it; and said, here is the hat I promised you; he had promised me a hat: while I was hoisting some trunks forward, my old hat fell off, and he said never mind your hat, I will give you a better one than that: that was the same day that we had had the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you been in custody since the hat was taken from you? - A. No; I was taken in custody with the hat on my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at large since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken, upon the information of the man at the bar, for stealing the hat yourself? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You turned evidence before the Magistrate? - A. No, I did not; I did not know where the property came from.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a new hat, was it not? - A. No, it was greased in the fore part and in the hind part.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hats do custom-house officers bring on board in general; not two, I suppose? - A. Sometimes one, and sometimes two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now a custom-house officer? - A. No, I am suspended till this trial is over.</p>
               <p>Q. And if you swear yourself innocent, and convict the man at the bar, you will be restored? - A. Yes; I am as innocent as the child that is unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith.) These hats have the general manufacturing mark of Mr. Borrodaile? - A. Yes, two L's; they are plated hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the kind of hats that are sent to the West India market? - A. Yes; we send all sorts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. All the hats that you make have the same mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. About nineteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Shropshire was the man who gave the hat to me; he was also employed as a lumper on board the ship. I was absent from the ship several days, and during that time there was no officer on board; the captain was always on shore: and what might be done in my absence I cannot say. Shropshire gave me this hat in <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300006"/>consequence of my signing his weekly note for payment of his wages.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I then delivered him into the hands of the constable; I did not deliver the trunk to the constable, I ok it down with me directly to Bristol. The articles mentioned in the indictment were contained in the trunk and box. I did not see the boxes packed, but found those articles in the boxes which were taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he have got beyond the coach-office? - A. I suppose thirty feet from the door, and ten feet beyond the long window; he was between a run and a walk.</p>

The Magistrate gave me the half crown; I had no other money but one bad halfpenny; the Magistrate searched me before I went out. I received them from Mrs. Connell; Mr. Connell and Mary Waghorne were by at the time. I kept them in my hand in a bit of paper, till I gave them to the officer, Mr. Hamilton, which I did the moment I got out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This is a bad trade you have got into? - A. I don't think it is a bad trade to inform against all rogues.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stories of this kind have you hatched before? - A. I never hatched any before, and I am very glad I have informed against them; and I will inform against any body that I can find out coining money.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of your husband; he was transported, was he not? - A. He has served his king and country, and is now in Greenwich Hospital, where every vagabond cannot go.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you follow? - A. I sell apples in the summer, and go to the wash-tub in the winter; I had better be any thing than a smasher.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a strange term? - A. I dare say you are very well acquainted with it; I have heard them call one another that every day these seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were taken up to Marlborough-street? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you never taken up for a smasher yourself? - A. I give my oath I never was. When I went down to the prisoner's house there was Molly outside the door selling apples.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you to get for going to buy this money? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you leave your business to go about and buy bad money? - A. Yes, and I would leave my business a month to find out such another set.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrates had so good and opinion of you, that they would not trust you with the half crown, without the officer going with you? - A. Yes, and a good thing too.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the house where these people lodged, you discovered a man, his <rs id="t17991030-7-deflabel36" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Q. It was the man that made the bargain with you? - A. No; he went up stairs and fetched the money, but the mistress served me.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a good bargain, did not you, seven shillings and sixpence for half a crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say that either of these prisoners served you with a farthing's worth of bad money? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate desired you to tell them a lie? - A. Yes.</p>

             to go to the prisoner's house; I furnished her with a half crown piece; she had given me some information respecting them; I searched her, and she had no other money about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that half crown piece again? - A. Yes, perfectly; I have it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did she return to you? - A. From ten to fifteen minutes; I was in waiting near the house of these people.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of her information, did you go to the house where these persons were? - A. I did; the house is in Flying-horse-court, Oxford-street; Warren was with me; the three prisoners were all at dinner in a back room; she moment I got in, I seized the prisoner Waghorne, I began to search her, I found in her pockets bad money in this bag, (producing it;) there is one paper with five sixpences and two shillings, all bad; here is another paper with four shillings and seven sixpences, all bad; here is, in the same bag, a box containing some blacking.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use to which that blacking is applied in coining? - A. It is generally used upon bad money before it is attempted to be passed into circulation. I then searched the man, and in his sob I found this paper, containing five sixpences and one shilling, all bad. I then searched Mrs. Connell, and found, in a pocket in which was good money, the half crown that I had before given to Lewis, and one bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the half crown you found upon Mrs. Connell is the same that you furnished Lewis with? - A. Perfectly sure. I heard something which I desired Warren to take notice of; he will inform you about that. When I met Mrs. Lewis she produced to me this money in this paper, nine sixpences and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these nine all represent the coinage of this country? - A. No; one of them appears to represent the French coinage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that money good or bad? - A. It appears to me to be all bad.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not chuse to trust this honest Mrs. Lewis, without searching her? - A. No; I have understood it is the usual mode, and I did it by the direction of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. That blacking you found upon one of the women? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing uncommon in that? - A. I think there is; I know of my own knowledge that it is used in coining and colouring.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This bad money does not seem much burnt, that you say was thrown upon the fire? - A. Some of them sell through under the grate.</p>

            : On the 21st of October in the morning, about a quarter before eight, I came in a hackney coach from the Swan-with-two-Necks, Lad-lane, the coach stopped at the end of Black Raven-court; before the coachman had got off his box, I saw the prisoner come out of our vaults, apparently loaded; I let him pass the coach door; I immediately jumped out at the coach door, and called out to him, stop; I then went up; to him, laid hold of him by the collar, and said he had got our property upon him; he said he had not, and begged for God's sake that I would let him go; I said I would not let him go, and that they supposed they had me very safe, for they did not expect me coming form the country that morning; I then carried him into the kitchen and sent for a constable; before the constable came, he said he had got three bottles of wine, but he had brought them from a man of the name of Grant, No. 64, East Smithfield; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said it was for his own drinking, and he had been upon the sick lift, and the doctor and prescribed it for him; I then felt his breast, and said to him you have got something else besides wine? he said he had got a sample of rum, he was going to take to a customer of his masters; I told the constable the man had robbed me, and desired him to do his duty; he searched the prisoner, and found upon him one bottle in the right hand pocket, one in his side coat pocket, and another in the left hand coat pocket, and another in his small clothes; and a phial containing about half a pint of rum, that he said he had from a Mr. Butler.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. From the situation in which you were, it was impossible you should see him come out of the vaults? - A.

               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell her what you wanted the money for? - A. I pretended I wanted it to pass. She told me her mistress, Mrs. Connell, was not at home, I must come in the morning; I went on the Tuesday morning, and I saw Molly, she pulled a paper out of her bosom, and served me with six sixpences for a shilling; I asked her if I could have any more; she said, yes, whenever I liked; I might come again the next morning for some. She gave them me in a paper, and I kept them in my hand till I gave them to Mr. Hamilton, the officer. I was searched before I went, and I had no other money about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I work for my living; I neither go smashing, whoring, nor thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. And you endeavoured to trick this poor woman into the commission of this offence? - A. Yes, and I would do it again, for it is worse than a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been employed on business of this sort before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You prosecuted the mistress here last night, and she was acquitted? - A. Yes; so much the better for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You prosecuted the master as well as the mistress, and the master was convicted? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Croos-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not searched Lewis, upon this occasion, before she went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore she might have bad money about her, for any thing you know? - A. I cannot say; I searched the prisoner afterwards, and found two parcels in a bag in her pocket, one containing two bad shillings, and five bad sixpences; and the other four bad shillings, and seven bad sixpences. I found this box of blacking, which is a composition made use of before the money goes into circulation.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I attended Mr. Ford as his laundress: On the 29th of September I left Mr. Ford's chambers, about half past six at night, as near as I can recollect. Q. Was it light or dark? - A. It was not very light, or it was not very dark; it was between both; the lamps were lighted in the passage; I secured the doors and windows of the chambers when I left them; the door locks three times; I am positive I locked it three times that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the chambers upon the ground floor? - A. Yes; when I returned it wanted a quarter to seven by St. Dunstan's dial, I live just by Temple-bar; I turned down Middle Temple lane, and went to the chambers; I went to put the key in the door and found the door was unlocked; with that, I opened the door, and found that the middle door was open; that alarmed me very much, and I instantly clapped to the outside door and put my back towards it; I then screamed out, finding the chambers were broke open, and a man immediately run out; it was not so dark but I could see the people passing; the person that was inside pushed three times against the door; he then pushed me quite back against the staircase, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you, in the hurry of the moment, enabled to see who that man was? - A. Not at that moment; but I saw the colour of his clothes; I cannot say I saw the colour of his face; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300014"/>dressed in a light coloured coat, dark coloured breeches, and light coloured waistcoat; his hair was powdered, and a round hat, half boots, or gaiters, I will not be sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a soldier's dress? - A. No; he ran up the middle of Temple-lane; upon my screaming, Morgan, one of the Temple porters, came to my assistance; Morgan then went into the chambers, I said in the passage, and the prisoner at the bar came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a considerable crowd at that time, I suppose? - A. A very great mob indeed; the prisoner asked me what I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed in the same manner as the man that you had seen before? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you had seen before? - A. I cannot say, only that he had the same fort of dress on; he asked me what I had lost, and I told him I believed he was the man that robbed my master; he made no reply, but immediately altered his countenance and went away; his countenance changed; I afterwards went into the chambers and observed my mistress's clothes lying upon a great coat in the bed room; shirts, shifts, and waistcoats, and other articles of wearing apparel, all spread upon a great coat; Morgan rolled them up in the great coat, and I saw them afterwards at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time you left the chambers you might see the face of a person exceedingly well? - A. Yes, if the face was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back, then could you have seen the face of any person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the man go out, you only saw his back? - A. He went out side ways, and I saw his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out very fast, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A crowd assembled, and in the crowd was the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he did not stop in the crowd but came up the steps to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say your suspicions fell upon him, did you desire any body to stop him? - A. No, I had no thought of it; he did not run, he walked away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am porter to the Middle Temple: On the 28th of September, from ten minutes to about a quarter before seven, I was alarmed by a woman crying, and a dog barking; I saw the last witness standing at the entrance of No. 5, Brick-court; upon her information, I ran up the lane after the man, but did not see him, and I returned to the chambers and got a light; I went into the sitting room first, but saw no mark of violence there; I then went into the bed-room, and saw a great coat lying, with a quantity of clothes upon it; upon turning round, I found to my right hand, a set of drawers, there were five drawers and every one broke open, and the drawers emptied; there was scarce any thing left in the drawers of any value; I then searched the chambers over but found nobody; in the pocket of that great coat was a pocket-book; I opened the pocket-book, and the first thing I saw was a soldier's furlough,

            , and there were two letters in it, one directed to a person in the Borough, and the other to one of his comrades; the pocket-book I took possession of immediately; I left the great coat till I got a warrant, and then I took possession of that; on the 31st of October, I took the great coat and the property to Bow-street, the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What was said was taken down in writting? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I was present, and it was not taken down.</p>
               <p>Morgan. He partly owned the great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by Partly? - A. He hardly said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the second examination? - A. Yes, he then denied it; he said the great coat was not his; he said the pocket-book was his, that he had lost it through a hole in the pocket of the coat that he then had on; upon trying the hole, it could not have been dropped out at that hole.</p>
               <p>(Produces the pocket and the pocket-book.) It was handed to the Jury.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury, It will come out without any force, it might work out (produces the furlough): it is read, dated the 25th of September (Produces two towels, four shirts, three waistcoats, and a pair of breeches); these are the things I took out of the chambers.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Ford) You were present at the examination? - A. I was; the prisoner then said that the coat was his, and he said the pocket-book was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time about having lost a pocket-book? - A. No, he did not; he said he had lost his great coat, on the Friday preceding the Saturday, with the pocket-book in the pocket; at the second examination he denied the great coat to be his; but stated that he lost the pocket-book on the Saturday evening, about five o'clock out of the right hand pocket of his close coat, and said he was not in the Temple that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You and Morgan give us a directly opposite account? - A. I cannot help that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you speaking of the same examination? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. At the first examination was the corporal examined? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Jones. At the second examination he was asked if the great coat was his, and he denied it; he said he had lost his pocket-book, and then put his hand to his right hand coat pocket, and said he had lost it out of that hole; I examined the hole, and tried the pocket-book with it, by the order of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible that the pocket-book could have gone through that hole? - A. I think not; several people tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the hole would get larger or smaller, from being frequently tried? - A. I should think it would get larger.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you apprehended the prisoner, did you tell him what you apprehended him for? - A. I told him, I wanted to take him to Bow-street; he came along very quietly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know any thing about the prisoner wanting to have his furlough renewed? - A. Yes; on the 28th of September, we were together at the Blue Anchor, in Feather's-court, Drury-lane, and had some beer together; during that time, he asked me if I could speak to serjeant Morgan, to get his furlough renewed for a few days; his furlough expressed the third day of October, he pulled out his pocket-book, and I read the furlow myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the furlough? - A. This is the furlough; this was on the Saturday; I told him I could not do it then, but I would speak to Mr. Morgan about it; then he went to the Conduit, in Conduit-street, to see a serjeant that was very ill; I stopped an hour and went away; I left them there together about five o'clock in the evening.</p>

I afterwards went with Mr. Wild and the prosecutor, the same day, to execute a search-warrant; the prisoner had lived there for years; we found some sacks under the sacking of the bed, and others with apples in them; there were eight in all; the prosecutor claimed them to be his property; the prisoner had been his servant. I apprehended the prisoner; I told him I had a warrant against him for stealing the sacks; he said he had had the sacks at different times of his master; that he had bought corn of him; he was taken before the Magistrate the next day, and committed.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner, two or three years ago, used to have corn in sacks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have bought bushels of corn of my master that is at home these twenty-three years; I owed him for some beans that I had home in these sacks now; and I have borrowed sacks to cover me when I have been going home at night when it has rained, and my master never denied me.</p>

I stopped her and called her by her name; says I, Mrs. Wilson, that cry is after you; No, says she, it is not; says I, you must stop till the man comes up; and then he gave charge of her for robbing him of two half-crowns; as I was going to the watch-house with her, she slipped two half-crowns into my hand. I have had them ever since.(Produces them.) The beadle marked them that night; he told the constable of the night he could swear to one of them; it had a cross on the head side.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This half-crown I can swear to; I was as sober as I am at present; I had been sitting up with an acquaintance that was sick.</p>

             sworn. - I am a labourer: On Wednesday, the 9th day of the month, I was at the Seven-stars at Hammersmith; about eleven o'clock the prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer, and while he was drinking it, he said, d-n the boys they will not let the sheep alone; I got up and looked out at the window, I saw he had got four; then, instead of taking the high road, he went down the lane, where the water was up to the horse's belly, where I knew it was impossible to drive sheep, and I followed him full a mile towards town, by Shepherd's-bush; he came to a slough, and he got over into a field, and listed the sheep over till he got past the slough, I followed him to the Bull at Hammersmith, it was a private road all the way; I asked him where he was going; he told me he was going to town with them; I told him; I did not think he had come honestly by them; I then took him by the collar, and led him into the Black-bull; a constable was sent for, and he took charge of him, the constable locked the sheep up in a stable at the Black-bull; Finch came in the evening, and the landlord of the house shewed him the sheep, they were the same sheep that the prisoner had brought there; they were marked T D upon the near side, just behind the shoulder, a single W upon the hip, and they were fresh ruddled; he told the constable he was going to Kew-bridge; and then he told me he was going to the Black-lion at Kensington Gravel-pits, and he sent me with a note to the Black-lion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was it not in consequence of what the prisoner said that you went to Kensington Gravel-pits? - A. Yes, he sent us there.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable at Hammersmith: I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody on Wednesday the 9th of October, about twelve o'clock in the day; he told me he met with the sheep the other side of Hayes, and told me they belonged to a gentleman, and he was going to Kew-bridge with them; afterwards he told me he was going to a Mr. Pike's, at Kensington; I asked him if he knew Mr. Pike; he told me he did; I immediately wrote a line to Mr. Pike, and kept him in custody till I took him to Bow-street the next morning; I put the sheep into the stable at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300018"/>the Black-bull; the drover came in the evening and abused the landlord for detaining them from him, they were delivered to him the next day; Finch said he knew who had got them, for he had been drinking with him that day; he abused the landlord, and said, he knew the man was driving them to Kensington Gravel-pits, and he told him he was as bad as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Finch.) Q. What did you mean by saying you knew the man was driving them to Kensington Gravel-pits? - A. I did not say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard such a thing, since this man has been taken up, as a reward of twenty pounds for sheep-stealing? - A. I never knew any thing about it, because I never was in a hobble before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Hammersmith, and I met with these sheep; I meant to give them up to the first Majesty I came to.</p>

            , a person belonging to Mr. Wood, informed me there was somebody stealing coals from the craft; Vent then ran over the craft that I was in, with Bellamy, it was a very light night, me and Bellamy rowed the boat out, and Vent was in the same boat, and he loaded his blunderbuss; the two men that had been robbing the craft were in a skiff, and had rowed away; they were in blue jackets, and long blue trowsers, they were shoving the skiff from the craft in which the coals were.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that craft from the craft in which you afterwards found the deceased? - A. Nearly one hundred yards; the men made their escape over the craft where the deceased lay; there were two men in the boat that had the coals; they ran the boat ashore; I saw one of them make for the shore; the other disappeared, I did not know what became of him; one was a good deal taller than the other, and the tallest of the two went ashore.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the deceased one of those persons? - A. No. I remained in the boat that we went out in; the watchman gave me charge of the skiff with the coals in it; Bellamy went about his business; being towards high water, he had the craft to moor; the prisoner at the bar went in pursuit of the man that disappeared; he could not find the man, and he said to the watchman belonging to the other wharf, an man of the name of Brodie, why do you not come and assist; the man said he could not get at him; says I, I will put you over in the boat, which I did, and brought him to the assistance of the other watchman: I saw them go over several of the craft; the prisoner fired his blunderbuss at the time that they made their escape; as the men got away, he loaded the piece again, and then they went over the cabin of the deceased's barge, and as they stumbled over the cabin, they awaked the deceased, and I heard the deceased say, if I had fire-arms, I would shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased at that time? - A. No, I believe he was in his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether he was in such a situation that he could have seen any body? - A. No, he could not; the prisoner went away, for about ten minutes, in search of the men that made their escape; and then he came back again to the barge where the deceased lay, and he desired Bellamy to turn him out, that he might see who he was; Bellamy did not attempt to turn the man out; I did not hear him say any thing: Brodie also declined, and the prisoner said, then I will have him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bellamy or Brodie assign any reason why they would not turn the man out of the cabin? - A. I did not hear any; the prisoner then came to the cabin and desired the deceased to turn out, that he might see who he was, and what he was; he said, come out, that I may see who you are and what you are; the man did not come out immediately; says he, if you do not I will fire at you: when the prisoner at the bar requested him to come out a second time, the deceased came up the steps from the cabin into the barge, and said, do you think I am afraid to see such a rascal as you.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could he have mistaken him for either of the men that disappeared? - A. I should think not, because he came up in his waistcoat and breeches, without his coat or stockings; and he was a smaller man than either of those who made their escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. A very clear night; I think it was a moon-shiny night. The deceased put one hand across his belly, as if he was making a kind of guard, putting himself in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300019"/>a posture of defence, and held the other hand up; I do not know whether he meant to strike.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he hold it in a threatening posture? - A. He did. He then said again, do you think I am afraid to see such a rascal as you; then there was a word or two passed between them, I do not remember what; they looked at one another very stedfastly in the face, and then the piece went off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Some words passed; were they words spoken by the prisoner or the deceased? - A. There was something said by both.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which was said, in an angry tone, by either or both of them? - A. There appeared to be anger in the face of both.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How many persons were there near the deceased and the prisoner, at the time the piece went off? - A. I was so agitated I cannot say; Bellamy says he was in the barge, I did not know it; and there was a little boy in the barge with me, and I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What length of time had elapsed between those angry words, and the piece going off? - A. Not two seconds, I suppose; it was immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. What sort of craft was that in which the deceased was? - A. It was a sailing-barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain? - A. I believe it was empty.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing on board to protect? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The skiff had coals in it? - A. Yes; there might be eight or nine bushels in it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time these two men made their escape over the barge, in your view, you say you only noticed one of them who got completely off? - A. I saw one go over Mr. Wood's craft on to their wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the other went you do not know? - A. No; he disappeared.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period was it that Vent fired the first time? - A. At the time they were making their escape over the barge where the deceased lay.</p>
               <p>Q. You conjecture that upon the man's stumbling over the cabin, it awaked the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said, if I had fire-arms I would shoot you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased did not make any enquiry what was the matter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean by you, when he said, if I had fire-arms I would shoot you? - A. I suppose the persons that had stumbled over the deck, and awaked him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a lighterman, in the employment of Mr. Wood; between one and two o'clock in the morning, I perceived two men upon Mr. Wood's wharf, stealing coals; it was a very moonlight night, and a very clear moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the persons who were stealing the coals? - A. I could distinguish their cloaths, but not their persons; they were dressed in blue jackets and trowsers. I then went to Vent, he was fishing for ells with a found net; I told Vent what I had seen, and he requested me to call one

            ; I thought him a long time coming, and I saw Germaine upon the wharf; I desired him to help me row after them; they brought their boat right up towards the deceased's barge's stern; they both went over the deceased's barge's stern, and rowed right round to another wharf directly; as they were rowing towards the deceased's barge's stern, Vent said, come to, d-n your eyes, come to, or I will fire at you; as they were getting up the barge's stern, he fired at them; they did not make any offer to stop; I went to the deceased's barge's head, and holloaed, stop thief! and I saw both these men quit the barge where the deceased was, and run the other way; then I desired Germaine to bring Brodie on shore; I went on board the deceased's barge, for I expected he had wounded one of the men, for I saw one of them limp; but the mast being in the way, I cannot say I saw them both go clear away from the barge, but I saw them both clear of the cabin; Vent came half way after me, and said, d-n him, I will have him out, for I had told him I had seen one of them limp, and that I thought he had shot him; in consequence of that, he said, come out, you rascal; says I, for God's sake, mind what you are at; that is an innocent man, you may depend upon it, that is in the cabin. I did not know then who it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then how came you to say it was an innocent man? - A. Because I saw them go clear away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300020"/>Court. Q. Then how came you to look at that barge, to see if you could find one of them? - A. I was sure one of them went on shore; but as for the other, I did not know but he might have dropped in the craft; a man came out and said, I am not afraid to come out to such a rascal as you; and then he put the blunderbuss about three inches from him, and fired directly; and I saw his shirt all in a blaze of fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did he hold up his hand? - A. He put his arms upon the scuttle sliders to lean in that position to talk to him, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not hold up his hand then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How did he hold the blunderbuss? - A. In this way; half bent, as it were, and it was about three inches from the deceased, at the time, or four inches at furthest; I was close to his right elbow, and Brodie and Germaine were in the boat; upon my turning my head, to say, look at the man's shirt all on fire, I heard Vent say, there, d-n you, take that; and then he took up the but end of the blunderbuss; but I cannot say that I saw him strike him; and he ran away that moment; I cannot say which way he went; I saw him upon his legs about half a minute afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he live? - A. Not more than half a minute; he fell down side ways into the barge's cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got quite clear of the cabin, so as to be upon the floor of the barge? - A. No; he was on the steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure that the person who came from the barge and had robbed the craft, went to the deceased's vessel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And one of them so lame, that you thought he could not get clear away? - A. I thought he he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had never seen the person of the man in the cabin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the deceased came up, he was leaning over the scuttle? - A. Yes; when Vent said, d-n you, you rascal, come out, and as the man was coming out of his cabbin, he said, I am not afraid to fight such an old rascal as you; he leaned upon the scuttle sliders.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of talking to Vent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any words took place between the deceased and Vent? - A. No farther than I have said, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Germaine by at the time you were by? - A. Yes; both him and Brodie.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swear that no words took place, except those which Vent made use of? - A. No more, I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased make use of any words at all, except those you have stated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Vent? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of seeing every thing that passed; upon your oath was not the deceased with one hand round his belly, in this way, and the other held up so? - A. No; the man that was in the boat might say so, but he could not see so well as I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Germaine was in the boat, and not in the barge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the boat from the barge? - A. Five or six feet; it was upon the barge's quarter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How came you not to go in to the cabin to turn the man out? - A. I said, no; it is an innocent man, why should I take an innocent man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say he was an innocent man? - A. Because I saw the two men clear away from the cabin of the barge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was upon the shore, joining my master's wharf, a little before two o'clock upon the 15th of September, I perceived two men coming down from the upper side of Mrs. Hodges's wharf, the adjoining wharf to my master's; I saw them halt at the bottom of my master's craft; I did not think they were going to plunder my master's craft till Bellamy came to me, and told me, there were two men loading away on the outside; I said to him, go to Hungerford and get a wherry; he made answer, there were no sculls to be got; I told him to go to the Waterman's-arms, and call Nicholas Vokins, tell him it is for me, and he will lend you a pair; he went to Hungerford, and procured a pair of sculls, and a wherry; Germaine at the same time came up the water with some wood; I asked Germaine to accompany us in pursuit of the people that were taking the coals; they rowed me round the craft, till we could see that the men were actually loading the coals out of my master's craft into a skiff; as soon as they saw us coming towards them, one that was upon the put, jumped into the skiff, and they rowed up to where I first discerned them come from; they rowed the skiff to the stern of the barge, where the deceased was; I called to them to surrender or I would fire at them; they were not inclined to surrender; they both got out upon the cabin of the sailing-barge; I fired after them; I was then a considerable distance from them, and one of them immediately disappeared, and in a very small space of time we came up to the stern of this sailing barge, we came nearly to the barge's quarter, before the cabin, and there was the skiff, with a quantity of coals of my master's property; I saw one of the men retreating along the side of the same sailing barge towards the shore; I called to him; says I come to, or else I will fire at you;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300021"/>Germaine said, there is one of them gone into that cabin, and said, he is in there now, I saw him go in; I repeated my call again to him that was in my sight, retreating towards the shore, and told him to come to or I would shoot him; the man in the cabin, answered from the cabin, you bloody rascal, if I had fire-arms, I would shoot you, you b-y b-r; upon his threatening to shoot me, Germaine said, mind that, mind how you come on, he says if he had fire-arms he would shoot you; with that I called for Brodie to come over to assist, and Germaine, I believe it was, rowed the boat across to fetch him over; he came, and I desired him and Bellamy to fetch the man out of the cabin that had threatened to shoot me, that I might see who he was, they both declined it; I called to him, and said, what do you say you will shoot me, then come out and surrender yourself or I will fire at you; he made answer, fire and be d-d you b-dy rascal; he told me, he would turn out and fight me, or any old b-g thief like me; when he stepped up the cabin steps, he put his hands in a position to fight; and said, now you b-r, come along; I stepped back one step from him, and the ring that fastens the rope was in the way, so that I could not get clear away to the shore; then he ran towards me; I was in danger of being thrown over board, and I unfortunately fired at him; I then went to the foreman belonging to my master, and desired him to see if any medical assistance could be got for the man; he came back and told me the man was no more; he went with me to the watch-house; I directed them which way to go to the bottom of Northumberland-street; I went home; I told them I should be there if they would call for me, and in about twenty minutes they called and I surrendered myself up at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Germaine.) Did you apprehend at the time you saw one man go towards the shore, that the other remained in the craft? - A. I conceived that he had concealed himself among some of the craft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate that to the prisoner? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him to mind what the deceased said, when he said, if I had fire-arms I would shoot you? - A. I believe I did.</p>

               <p>Q. The watch was on your left, and the prisoner was on your right? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come into the room while she was there? - A. Yes, a French Priest; she staid about four or five minutes after he came in; he called for a watch that I had of his, to know if it was ready; I told him it was not, but if he would call about Wednesday next it would be done; at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300022"/>that instant I got up from my chair; I turned into the room to see if my linen was right with the bill; I took my own watch out of my pocket, looked at the regulater if it was right, and then I went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the French gentleman gone before the prisoner went? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. Was she gone when you went to look at your linen? - A. No; when the French gentleman was going away, the prisoner was standing about the work-bench, and asked me what was the price of a vice; I told her she could get a second hand one for our shillings; at that instant, I proceeded to see my linen; while I was looking at my linen, I had my back turned to the prisoner, and to my watches; then I went to the corner of the room to fetch some money to pay her; I gave her the money, and she went away; I missed the watch in two or three minutes after she was gone, and I never saw it again.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Glover: My mother, in the country, desired me to ask the price of a bed-tick; I asked the man in the shop, the prisoner at the bar; he said, if I wanted a tick, he would let me have one much cheaper than I could have it of my master; nothing more was said for a fortnight afterwards; then he came into the kitchen, and asked me if I should want a tick; I told him I should not want it till my mother came out of the country in February; he said, very well; I was to give him a guinea for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the bed-tick of him? - A. No, I did not; a fortnight ago last Friday, I told my master of it, and he desired I would buy it; my sister had the tick from him on the Friday night; the 17th of October I received the tick from my sister, my sister went with him and took them of him; as soon as I got it home, on Sunday the 20th of October, I gave it to my master, and the bolster-tick that I had from my sister; I paid him for them on Monday the 21st of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long, before you told your master of this, was it that you asked the price of the bed-tick? - A. About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner then told you he had one to dispose of? - A. He said he could help me to one.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and you lived in the house together? - A. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any less good understanding between you lately than at first? - A. No; we agreed very well all the time we lived together.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to the time that he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Public-Office, Bow-street: On the 23d of October, I searched the prisoner's lodgings in St. John's-street, and found two blankets on the bed, which Mr. Glover said were his property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Glover. This is the bolster-tick, it has our mark upon it; it is marked 7, 8, 4 treddle, with U and E upon it, that is our shop mark; the bed-tick is marked with a bu and u; we had missed them, and I am very confident we have never sold any such articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the blankets? - A. This is our blanket; it is marked with a G; we had four of them lying in the shop, and we missed two; the other blanket I cannot swear to, but this, I swear positively to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How do you know you had not sold them? - A. I had these very ticks in my hand, about seven weeks ago, and we had no such thing set down in our books; we have not sold any one tick of this sort since they have been marked, previous to that; there has not been any besides the one that we missed, but what has been sent out to customers in beds.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man lived with you? - A. Twelve months last June, we had him from Mr. Seddon's in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a good character with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not often happen that a blanket is lent to the servant to carry out goods in? - A. No; this is a fine large blanket; the blankets we use for wrappers are smaller than this, and old ones, and always marked with our name.</p>

             lodged in the house; when I came home I went to my chest to take some money out; the chest stands under the window in the room where I sleep; and the key would not open it; I put my hand to the lid of the chest, and it opened directly; I am sure I had locked it on the Monday morning when I went away, and took the key in my pocket: I had left six half-guineas and two whole guineas in the chest, two watches, one was a French watch, and the other repeats the day of the month, and the moments; four pair of shoe-buckles, a pair of silver knee-buckles, three gold rings, and a pair of light blue velveteen breeches; there was one of the gold rings dropped just by the chest, that a little child picked up; I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday, the 29th of September, in an alley in Ratcliff-highway; I sent for Mr. Rogers, and he found a large pair of silver shoe-buckles in his jacket-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know those buckles to be your's? - A. Yes. Rogers also found a pocket handkerchief and a stock that I had lost. I then went with Rogers to the house where I took him from; I do not know whether the prisoner lived there, but he ran down that alley, and into that house; Mr. Rogers searched the house, and left me in charge of the prisoner. Rogers then produced to me two watches, a pair of silver knee-buckles, and an old guinea; one of mine was an old guinea, and the other a new one. He was taken to the lock-up house, and brought before the Justice on Monday; then the prisoner said, it was not upon Friday that he robbed the house, he said, it was Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what was said before the Justice taken down? - A. No; the Justice said, it was not worth while to put it down: the prisoner said, his own chest had been robbed of three hundred dollars coming home.</p>

             sworn. - My husband went out on the Monday before the 27th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lodged in your house? - A. A man of the name of Shannon. The prisoner came to our house on the Wednesday, to enquire for a lodging; I knew the prisoner three or four years ago, he lodged in Brick-lane; he said he had been on board a ship, and was very ill indeed, and could not work; he sat there some time, and I asked him to have a cup of tea, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the Friday? - A. No; I left home a few minutes before two in the afternoon, and locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your family consist of? - A. A Mrs. Barrett and my little girl, they both went out with me; John Shannon went away on the Thursday night for Norway. I locked the room-door where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300029"/>the chest was; I had moved the chest the day before, and it was then locked; the street-door goes with a spring-lock, and I had put the key in a place over the door, where I always put it, in case my husband or the lodgers should come home while I am out. About half past six in the evening I returned with Mrs. Barrett and the child; I found the key where I had left it, and the street-door was locked; I went up stairs, and found my chamber-door had been forced open; the first pannel was split, as if it had been wrenched; I immediately called to Mrs. Barrett to get a light, and we searched the house, but could find nobody; I looked at all the boxes that I had the keys of, and found my things all Safe; and there was a little watch hanging at the bed's head; I thought then it was all safe: I had not the key of the chest.</p>

We went past the door to the bottom of the alley, to the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes, to see if he was there, for I did not then know that that man was him, because I did not know him: we returned up the alley again, and as we walked up, he was standing in the same posture again; as soon as he saw us he ran up the same stairs again, I saw him up the fifth or sixth stair; Forbes was then coming up the alley, and I left him at the door while I went to fetch an officer; I could not find an officer, and I learned that he was gone with Mr. Forbes towards Shadwell; I did not see him again till I got near Shadwell Church; Rogers then came up, and Forbes gave charge of him. I saw a pair of buckles, a pocket handkerchief, and a stock taken from him.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer; I met with the prisoner on Sunday the 29th, in Ratcliffe-highway; I took him into custody near Shadwell Church; I took him to the public house, and searched him in the presence of Forbes; I found in one of his pockets a pair of silver shoe buckles, Forbes said they were his; I asked him what marks there were; he said, one of the rings was broke; I then shewed them to him, and it was so. I found also upon him an old linen stock, which he claimed; and there was an old pocket handkerchief that he said was his; I immediately put him in a place of safety; I asked Forbes which was the house he had seen him go into; I instantly went to the house with Forbes and the other young man; there were a number of women there; I searched them, and immediately went up stairs, and turned out an old bed that was on a bedstead, and between the bed and the sacking I found a piece of old Carpeting tied up in a lump; curiousity led me to open it, and there I found this pair of breeches (producing them;) and in the pocket of the breeches were these two watches, and a pair of silver knee-buckles; and in the fob of the breeches was this guinea; I carried them down to Forbes, and he said, they were all his property except the guinea, which he said he could not say any thing to. I told the prisoner what I had found, and asked him where the remainder of the articles were, he said, there was not so much gold as you say; he said, there were only four. He said, some time ago, he had lost a great quantity of dollars when he came into this country, and that he had been very scarce of money, and that was his reason for taking it: he said it was not on Friday, it was on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Forbes. These are my buckles, I described the mark before they were shewn to me; and these are my breeches; there is my name upon the watch and upon the seal, and I have the number of the French watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Forbes.) Have you any reason to know that the prisoner expected you to go out that day? - A. No; but there is a public house opposite. I know this handkerchief and stock to be my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I knew this woman about four or five years ago; I wanted to lodge there; I was at <rs id="t17991030-36-deflabel205" type="occupation">work on board a ship</rs>

I asked her for money, and she said there was some in the chest, but it was locked. On the Thursday she was going out; I was very ill, I could not go to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300030"/>work, and the child was gone to school; and the child came home, I gave the child tea, and put it to bed, and they both came home drunk at ten o'clock at night, and made a riot with their neighbours; on Friday she told me she had got a guinea and a gold ring out of the chest, and on Sunday they took me up. She is not married to that man, she is a woman of the town, she lived with me three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Forbis.) Did you ever pawn any of his cloaths? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever point out those things that he might satisfy himself? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do in your house on the Thursday? - A. No, I was not out of doors all day long on the Thursday; I was in bed before eight o'clock.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gangsman under Mr. Bolt: I was landing sugars on the 11th of October; there was one hogshead came in in a very bad state, the head was nearly out, and the hoops on the outside were all broke asunder; we took it as far from the scale as we could, that we might land other sugars, till we got a cooper; Bryant called to me, I went to his assistance immediately, he had hold of the prisoner at the bar by the collar; I saw the prisoner take his hat from his head, I saw him throw the sugar from his hat upon the ground; I immediately secured him, and told Bryant to pick up the sugar; Bryant put it in his apron till the officer took it from him; I compared the sugar with the sugar in the hogshead, it was exactly of the same kind; there was no other hogshead that he could have got it from. (The sugar produced).</p>

There was one of the hogsheads that the head flew out, and a great deal of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300033"/>sugar slipped, and the coopers asked me to lend them a hand to pick it up, and I put some into my hat to throw into the hogshead, and that young man came and knocked it out of my hat.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he come home that morning? - A. Between twelve and one; he went out again in a few minutes, and returned in about an hour and a half, about half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark then? - A. Dark; he came up stairs, and Moore followed him; Moore had the copper and the linen; he had nothing with him; he came up stairs first; I was in bed; they put the copper and the things into my room, and they continued there till morning, when Moore put them upon the garret-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time the next morning did they go out? - A. Not till four o'clock in the afternoon; the officers came on the Sunday in the morning, about half past nine; the prisoner and Moore were neither of them there. I did not go up stairs with the officers, but I saw them bring the things down; there was in the copper, a nankeen waistcoat, a child's frock, a cotton bed-gown, and a piece of calico, like a breakfast-cloth; when the prisoner came home he was secured and taken to the watch-house; I was afterwards taken to the watch-house and put into a separate cage; he said he was very sorry for the situation he had brought me to; he asked where Moore was; I said, he ought to be taken as well as he; he said, no, never mind, don't say any thing about Moore: he said he was sure of suffering himself.(The property was deposed to by Mrs. Hopwood.)</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. It weighed near thirteen ounces, it is worth full three pounds. On the 26th of September, about a quarter before eight, I was opening the shop, I had carried part of the shutters up the passage to the private door; I was coming back for more shutters; I saw the prisoner, and Mr. Boggis called to me to come to his assistance; in looking round upon the grating of the kitchen window, under the shop window, I saw this tea pot; I suspected the pot had been stolen, and helped to secure the prisoner; in one hand he had got this knife, which Mr. Boggis has produced; we continued holding him till the knife was taken from him; we secured him, put him in a coach, and took him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it of a modern make? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so modern perhaps but it may have been in use two or three years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of the fashion of the thing, do you mean to say, it is worth three pounds? - A. I think it is worth more; it has the weight marked at the bottom, thirteen ounces five penny weights, which I observed when it was brought to me the night before.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was quite sober; she said her husband was a blacksmith, and so I went with her to an alley adjoining <placeName id="t17991030-48-crimeloc273">the Blue-Angel, in Cable-street</placeName>

             sworn. - I did live with Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Cable-street: On Wednesday, the 25th of September, about nine in the morning, the prisoner brought a blue coat and pantaloons to pledge; she asked half-a-guinea upon them; she said, she did not think that would do, she would go and ask her husband; she returned in about fifteen minutes, and said, it would do; I gave her the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the duplicate to Myers.</p>
               <p>Myers. I never had a duplicate from her; I found her husband out, he had inlisted for a soldier, and was in the rendezvous house, that was the way I came to find out where the things were. (The property was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man came home with me, and said he had not a farthing of money, but if I would let him sleep with me all night, I should have these things for as much as I could pawn them for; I returned him the duplicate, and I got him some breakfast; he did not come again for two or three days after. <rs id="t17991030-48-verdict274" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you a Bow-street on the Tuesday, the first day? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined there? - A. I was asked where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the Justice then, what you told on the Friday? - A. No, I was not asked any questions.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the prosecutor examined? - A. No, I was taken away, I was not permitted to stay there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him tell his story then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not tell the officer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoners were discharged? - A. No, not till Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not communicate it to the officer or the Justice? - A. No, I did not; I should have told it the first night, but I was threatened so in my own room that night; they threatened me for making them take the watch away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the Friday before they were taken up again? - A. They were discharged in the morning, and I gave information to Mr. Donaldson in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoners before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You see each other every day, I suppose? - A. Yes; I could not do otherwise, when I walked up and down the streets with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You mixed with them? - A. Yes, formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been quite so great since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had had a quarrel then? - A. No, I have not; but if people are unfortunate, they may keep themselves honest, and that is the reason why we have not been so great.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the gentlemen that use their house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor they any of the gentlemen that come to your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never had a quarrel with them about any gentleman that frequented your house, and had afterwards gone to their's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why you have not been so great? - A. Because they followed rules I did not like.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you lent them your key that night? - A. I did lend them the key; I did not know what they might want.</p>
               <p>Q. That was because they followed rules that you did not like; how many persons live in the house in which you live? - A. Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. Men or women? - A. Women.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same way of life? - A. Yes; three of them; there is one that is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any gentlemen lodge in the house? - A. Only the landlord and his son.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had some conversation with them about the watch, and you afterwards saw the gentleman; why did you not tell him of it? - A. Because I was afraid of my life, and am now every day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Box. Q. Were you frightened when you came to Newgate to see us, and drink tea with us? - A. Her friends desired me to come; Frances Smith's man, whom she lives with, wished me to come; I said I should be ill used, and they told me, no, I should not: I went, because I thought to hear something more about the gentleman's watch.</p>
               <p>Box's defence. I am an innocent woman; I never saw the prosecutor before the watchman brought him to me; when the watchman asked him if I was the person, he said, no, I was not.</p>
               <p>Frances Smith's defence. I came up to the end of the court where the watchman and the gentleman were standing; I stood there a considerable time, and the watchman asked him if I was the person, and he said, no, and it was that that cleared us at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Smith's defence. I never saw the watch in my life, nor the gentleman, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Street's defence. I am innocent of the affair.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You lost one plank of mahogany? - A. Yes, ten feet long, about twenty-four inches wide.</p>
               <p>Q. You employ servants in the timber yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or your servants mark your timber? - A. I speak to this from a mark in the grain of the wood, a curve in the grain.</p>
               <p>Q. The next cut to that would of course have the same curve? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not your servants have sold that plank from your yard? - A. If they had, it would appear in my books.</p>
               <p>Q. But, in point of fact, might they not have sold that plank? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear to the goose at all? - A. No, it is not in my power to do that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When was it that you lost this goose? - A. The 29th, or 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Just at Michaelmas you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the persons about London, if they can, will have a goose upon Michalemas-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What does I stand for upon the towel? - A. Townley; it was given to my little child by a relation that is dead, but she is not of age, it was given to me for the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the child living? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that the towel ought to have been laid to be the property of the child, but the objection was over-ruled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You spoke to Sparrow about it, and he brought Roberts to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Sparrow claim these things as his? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true, that that man at the bar ever said that this property was his, and that he was going to take them into the country? - A. He never did in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if any such thing has been sworn to have been said in your presence, it must be a mistake? - A. Yes; I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you remember meeting with Ray and the prisoner, and Roberts? - A. Yes, in Finsbury-square.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any conversation took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Ray has sworn, in direct and pointed terms, that the prisoner said they were his own, and that they were going to a country job; - now do you mean to say, upon your oath, that that conversation did not pass? - A. It did not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has passed, must you have heard it? - A. I must have heard it to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Roberts say any thing about it one way or the other? - A. I understood Roberts they were his, that he was going into the country to work.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ray.) Do you insist upon what you have sworn now? - A. I do; and I wish your Lordship would ask him whether he was sober or not; when I went for the property, he said, d-n my blood you shall not have them out of my place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This man was a witness of your own, for the prosecution? - A. Yes; but he is subpoenaed for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this man contradicted you, why did not you tell the Court that he was drunk? - A. He is seldom sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had confirmed your story, would you then have said he was drunk? - A. Yes, I should, if I had been asked the question. (The property was deposed to by Wheeler).</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent-character.</p>

             were with me in another part of the room: Gibson is a cabinet-maker, he works for his father; Larman is an apprentice to a printer, and Samuel is a cabinet-maker, a journeyman. When the brewers' servants had done singing, I gave some young men two pots of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I had been drinking, but I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300045"/>Q. How came you to be so generous; did you know them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give them two pots of ale then? - A. Because they were very merry.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink? - A. Ale; we had nine pots amongst us all; seven pots in our party with the brewers' servants, and two the young men had; I paid three shillings and sixpence as part of the reckoning, and Gibson paid one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the brewers' servants, did you? - A. No; we went in accidentally, from hearing the violin. When we came out this party of young men came out with us; I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of this party? - A. I cannot be certain; there might be seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to treat them? - A. They sung some more songs.</p>
               <p>Q. You treated the whole of the company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been pretty merry yourself? - A. Yes. When they came out, they took me across the road with them; they all came round me, and I went with them; but finding my own company did not follow me. I insisted upon going back to them; one of them held me by the collar of the coat, and asked me why I could not go with them; I said I would not, I would go back to my own company.</p>
               <p>Q. They were pretty merry too, were they not? - A. I suppose they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you tell who it was that laid hold of you by the collar? - A. No; it was dark; then I came back to my own company, and walked as far as Sadler's Wells with them; then another party came round us, I do not know whether it was the same, or another company; when we had got as far as the Quakers' Workhouse, which is a few yards below, they threw me down without saying a word to me; they came all on one side of me, and pushed me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you could not stand very steady? - A. Yes, I could; as I was falling, by the light of a lamp I could see the face of the prisoner, and another that I could swear to if I was to see him; then they all fell upon me together, I cannot say how many there were upon me; I felt a hand in my left-hand breeches pocket, and I put my hand down to endeavour to keep it there; but I could not; I called out for the watch as loud as I could several times, and the watchman came up, and I said, take charge of them rascals in the road, for they have robbed me of seventeen shillings, I said; but upon recollection, I found it was only fourteen, the watchman said he would not take charge, it was out of his beat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before? - A. No; not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner hold of you? - A. No; only I saw him and another as I was falling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know each of them as well as the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of observing this young man? - A. A very short time, not a minute; I knew the prisoner again as soon as I saw him in Bagnigge-Wells Gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your companions? - A. They were three or four yards before me when I desired the watchman to take charge; the other party all went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away? - A. I was in such agitation that I cannot say whether they walked away or ran away, but they were in the road when the watchman came; then we met the witness's father, and I went to Clerkenwell watch-house to tell the case, and to report the watchman for not doing his duty; and I learned that he belonged to Pentonville watch-house. On Monday I went to Hatton-garden, and laid an information, and on the Sunday Brown and I were walking in Bagnigge-Wells Gardens.</p>

               <p>Q. What had you to do with Bagnigge-Wells on a Sunday? - A. Only for a walk: we watched him out, then we watched him into the Blue Lion, he took a glass of something at the bar, and then he went down the passage towards the Wells again; and then we watched him to the Blue Lion again, and I desired Brown to get some more, and we followed him to the Bull in the Pound; we knew it to be a bad house, and were afraid to go in; then there came out twenty or thirty of them, with the prisoner at their head, with sticks; he said, here are two of them, d-n their bloods, it is of no use for them to holloa now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been drinking a great deal? - A. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you served your time to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you came there? - A. In Cary-lane, at a haberdasher's.</p>
               <p>Q. You never served an apprenticeship to any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner till you saw him by the light of the lamp, the night you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, am I to take that as an answer, that you had never seen him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, upon your oath, was he not in the public house with you? - A. I cannot say whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he was? - A. He very probably might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300046"/>Q. Will you swear he was not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you swear you were sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he or not one of the people that you asked to drink of the two pots of ale? - A. I cannot say; I did not particularly notice him.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name before this time? - A. I did not say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you met him at Bagnigge-Wells? - A. The Sunday week after.</p>
               <p>Q. So you haunt public houses and Bagnigge-Wells on a Sunday evening? - A. I do not haunt either.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the landlord turn you out of the house? - A. No; we went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it threw the half-guinea upon the ground? - A. The landlord chose to swear that; but it is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you throw the money upon the ground, and swear that you would have more liquor? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you call at the public house again? - A. The Sunday following, to ask the landlord if he knew any of the party who were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention the name of the prisoner at the bar to the landlord, till after he had said that he knew only one of them, which was the young man at the bar, his neighbour's son? - A. I cannot recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But you must. Were you sober then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went for the very purpose of knowing whether the man knew any of the company, and therefore you must recollect? - A. He said he did not know them, and a person in company said one of them was a neighbour's son.</p>
               <p>Q. You left that house without your companions? - A. No; when we came out they took me across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to walk at that time, and were they not capable of assisting you? - A. No, they were not; I could walk as well as I can now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been falling in the dirt? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the watchman reprimand you, on your way home, for the riotous manner in which you conducted yourself? - A. No; he said something, I cannot tell what; but I said we did not want his assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. For what was it that that watchman accosted you in the road; did he not offer to assist you, on account of the situation in which you were, tumbling about? - A. I told him we did not want any assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far from the house was it that you were robbed? - A. It might be one hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it more than forty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not swear at Bow-street that it was not forty yards? - A. No; Gibson did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard of a forty pounds reward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate at first reprimand you, and discharge the prisoner? - A. He did not reprimand me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the prisoner must be discharged; and reprimanded you for your ill conduct? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been at the public house drinking? - A. As soon as I came here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect drinking such a toast as this, may

               <persName id="t17991030-56-person572">
                  William

            , and Larman. Samuel went home, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Balding were perfectly sober? - A. A. I can answer for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Balding? - A. I think he was 
sober.</p>


               <p>Q. Who came out of the house first? - A. Roberts's party and our party were intermixed; as soon as we came out of the house, I perceived Balding to be in their company across the road; Larman being intoxicated, I took care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had enough to do to take care of him, I suppose? - A. Yes; we walked a little way on the road, and Balding came over to us; we went on about the length of this court down the road, Roberts's party came up to us again; I got on a little forward with Larman; when I turned my head, I saw them all upon the ground together; I went up to him and he told me he had been robbed; he immediately called the watchman to take those rascals in the road, for they had robbed, him; they were still going down the road, and the watchman said they were out of his beat.</p>
               <p>Q. And the robbery was spoke of loud enough for the man to hear it? - A. It was loud enough for the watchman to hear, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the persons of any of them, to know them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think that an odd sort of robbery without any noise? - A. No; they made no noise.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not rob you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not struck you as a very odd thing that you should see your friend down, and he should say he was robbed, without any thing being said; did it not occur to you as a very extraordinary thing? - A. They did not know that I had any money about me; but they saw his money. He paid the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. And you paid a part? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the other shilling? - A. There was no shilling in particular; I gave Balding a shilling before the reckoning was paid, that one might pay the whole.</p>

               <p>- LARMAN sworn. - I was at the public house with the two last witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at any other public house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You got rather tipsey? - A. Yes, rather so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any body in the house? - A. Yes, I knew the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Gibson saw you speak to him? - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke to him as knowing him, did you call him by his name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Roberts, come Roberts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300048"/>I will give you another pot of ale to sing again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it said that? - A. I believe Balding, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Balding upon the ground? - A. No, I did not see him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not see your old friend Roberts there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the next day you told him Roberts was one of the party? - A. I told him that I knew Roberts, and that he was in the house.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman, No. 1, Sadler's Wells: A few minutes after eleven these three gentlemen came down from the Woolpack, I heard the alarm of their coming, they were very much in liquor, and one of them fell down against my box; I went over to help them, and this gentleman said they did not want my assistance. They seemed to me to be all in liquor. They went down the road, and I came back; I heard them call the watch, and I went to them, and one of them called me an old vagabond for not taking charge of those people; I did not see any one but themselves; there was an old man on the other side of the way, and they said he was not one of them; I saw nobody at all about; I saw nobody else going down or up.</p>

               <p>Q. What did Monk say she was worth? - A. He said, he thought she was worth about 4l. she was very poor; then he asked me where the man was; I told him in the tap-room; then Mr. Monk asked him if he could bring any body to witness who he was; he said he could not then; Mr. Monk sent for an officer and he was taken into custody; he said he had brought her from his brother's a horse-dealer; that his brother had sent him up to sell it; but I cannot recollect where he said he came from; the Police-officer found out the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy the horse? - A. Mr. Monk, and all the boilers, allow me one shilling a piece for every horse that I get them; I bought it for Mr. Monk.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street: On the 22d of October, I met Palmer in Whitechapel; he asked me to go with him to the Star and Garter public-house, to take charge of a man on suspicion of having stolen a horse; when I went into the public-house, he was sitting in the box; I asked him who that horse belonged to that was tied opposite the door; he said it belonged to him; I asked him where he had it from; he said, he had it from his brother; I asked him where his brother lived, and he said in Hoddesdon; I asked him what his brother's name was; he said, his name was White, that he dealt in horses; I searched him, and found some horse's hair in his pocket, which corresponded with the hair upon the horse's tail; I asked him how he came to cut the hair off the horse's tail; he said, he had a right to do as he pleased; I found a turnpike ticket in his hat, which belonged to Stamford-hill turnpike; I told my brother officer, I suspected it had come off the Forest; I went next day, and met a man in the forest; I described the mare to him, and he told me he knew the mare; I found Hills, and shewed him the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hills). Was the mare that Nowlan shewed you, the same mare that you lost? - A. Yes; she had lost part of the hair off her tail.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she worth? - A. Six pounds; she is found, as far as I know, wind and limb.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she had a foal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. Only one; she had a wen upon the side of her belly, which I cut off by tying a horse-hair round it, and there is the mark of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the mare of my brother, at Hoddesdon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Furness is a very considerable manufacturer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he deals with other houses of course? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you examined, for the purpose of ascertaining whether you did miss a ream or not, you could not miss it? - A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long has he lived with you? - A. Four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions about it? - A. He said, in a confused manner, that it was given to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who had known him from his infancy, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

            , and Solomon Robus came up and knocked down Riley with his sift; then Davies came up and struck me; then I went back to Mr. Gilson's at the White-swan; I left Riley lying in the kennel, and Colley, Robus, and the prisoner round him; they were kicking him; I was afraid I should be hurt, and I went back to Gilson's for assistance; Gilson and Bush came with me, but he had got away; I did not see him again till the next morning, I found him all over mud, and his eye cut about an inch long.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he appear to have lost much blood? - A. I cannot say; he appeared bruised, and so very much hurt, that he could hardly speak the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you hear of a charge of robbery either that night or the next morning? - A. The next morning I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing like a robbery while you were there, before you went to the public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath do you believe, from what past, that there was a robbery committed upon Riley's person or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said since that you did not believe there was a robbery committed? - A. I did not say that; I did not believe it, because I did not know any thing about the robbery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Had you an opportunity of observing, as an indifferent spectator, or were you looking after your own head? - A. I had my arm cut in two places.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your attention directed to your own life then, or this poor man's situation? - A. My own life.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you much wounded? - A. Yes; I lost a deal of blood.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you conceive your own person in danger? - A. Yes, indeed it was.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Riley) Do you mean to insist upon it that it was Davis, who knocked you down and took your money? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you in liquor? - A. No; I had only drank one pot that day.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to say, then, that you were perfectly sober? - A. I had no concern in liquor at all; when I waked I found my breeches unbuttoned; I might be asleep about an hour; and a woman said directly that I was robbed; I saw my watch just before I fell asleep, and the woman of the house likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to look at your watch in the public-house? - A. I had come from Romford with a drove of pigs; when I waked I missed my watch, I have never seen it since; there was no other person in the house but the prisoner and the woman that waked me; he offered to let me have the watch again directly, if I would give him a leg of mutton and trimmings.</p>

               <p>Q.Was that woman the landlady? - A. Yes; when I waked the prisoner was gone; I took him the next morning, at the Three Compasses, about half a mile from where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>- BROUGHTON sworn. - I heard the prisoner say that the prosecutor had got a watch, and he would have it; that was the same afternoon that the man was robbed; I was in the next box to the prisoner; I saw the prosecutor lie down and go to sleep, and I fell asleep too in the adjoining box; the prisoner was in the tap-room at that time; I did not wake till the people were all gone, the landlady awoke me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Which was the nearest to the prosetor, you or I? - A. I was; the box parted us.</p>

               <p>Q.Had the prosecutor drank any liquor? - A. No; he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the last witness? - A. Yes, he is a young man of very good character, he lives servant with a brother of mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not you in the tap-room all the time that I was lying in the box where the prosecutor was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your back turned at any time? - A. No, but I did not think of taking any account of what passed; I might be asleep myself, for it was after dinner, and I was sitting down, having nothing to do, leaning upon the table with my hand before my face.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sitting or standing at the time I was lying in that box? - A. I was sitting by the fire side, in the box opposite to them.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There were two in company with me, but they went away before I fell asleep.</p>

               <p>Q.Were the fences in good order? - A. Yes. The next morning I went to the field, and missed a ewe lamb, there were but thirty-seven, they were all ewe lambs; they were in an inner field, the outside gate was locked, then there was a gate to the inner field, and that was withyed up, and the withy had been burst open, by the sheep being drawn, as I suppose; there were the marks of their having been drawn, they were drawn close to the gate.</p>

               <p>Q.There were no signs of any thing having been killed in the field? - A. No, no blood, or any thing of that kind; in search of that one I went down to the wood, within about forty poles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300055"/>of the field,

             went with me; the wood belongs to Mr. Redgrave, in the parish of Pinner; as soon as we got into the wood, John King and and myself looked a very little way before we found the skin, with the entrails tied up in the skin; it was covered over with a little bit of grass, just a handful over the top of it, near the entrance of the wood; the skin and the entrails were warm. I did not search after the blood, to see where it had been killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear that skin came from your lamb? - A. Yes, it had the marks upon it very plain indeed; the skin is here; the head was not with the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been accustomed to kill sheep yourself? - A. Sometimes I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin taken off the lamb in a butcher-like way? - A. No, it had been taken off very badly indeed; some of the bark of the body had been left sticking to the skin; in going a little further I found the prisoner Monday and another man, lying about eight or ten poles from where I found the skin; they were lying down by a sack full of things; I asked what they had got there, and Monday said, nothing belonging to me; I told him I would see what he had got in his sack; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he got up and undid his sack, the other man got up and did nothing; the first thing he pulled out of this sack was a tin kettle, and in the kettle were some ribs of lamb and potatoes boiled, and a bit of a loin.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you ascertain, in that state, whether it was mutton or lamb? - A. Yes, pretty well; there were two legs and two shoulders in the bag that were not dressed, that was lamb. I asked Munday where he got his meat; he told me he bought it at Watford, he said he gave sixpence a pound for it; I asked him if he would shew me the shop, and he told me he would go along with me: the man that was in company with Munday, and myself, and John King, and Munday all set off together towards Watford; as we were going along, the other man said, d-n my eyes if I will go any further; accordingly he stopped, and Munday and I and another man went on; I left him behind along with

            ; I went a very little way before Munday said to me, it is of no use to go any further, for I cannot shew you where I had it; I never bought it. Then I asked him how he came by it; he said, it was brought to him while he was asleep; well, says I, you must go along with me, all the same; he told me he did not much care about it, for he was a deserter, and so we went together, and I delivered him up to Mr. Birch, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not find the head? - A. Yes, I did, the very next day, very near the same spot; but that had been boiled; the four joints were warm; he had a black jack-ass with him, but he said he had nothing to do with it, it was not his.(The skin produced, with the mark I W upon it.)</p>

Ward asked Munday how he came by the meat; he said he brought it at Watford; he asked him at which butcher's, he said he did not know, but he would go and shew him where it was; then we took the skin and the tin kettle with the ribs of mutton in it, and went towards Watford; we left the ribs behind in the kit; when we got about half way there, Hawkins swore he would not go any further; Ward and another man went on with Munday, I stopped with Hawkins, and before they came back, he got away from me.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you very sure the joints of meat were warm? - A. Yes.</p>

On the Wednesday following, in the evening, he came again, and asked me why I did not come; I told him my man did not like to go out after six o'clock; I was to fetch it from Tavistock-hill, on the Hampstead-road; I then declined having any thing to do with it, and I recommended him to a neighbour who had light carts and small horses, his name was Webb; I went with him to Webb, and he told him he had twelve or fifteen trusses of hay to part with, and he was to go the next evening about six o'clock for it; and the next evening Webb overtook me as I was going there; I walked up Tavistock-hill to a public-house, the sign of the Load of Hay, and called for a pint of beer; I was not present at the conversation between them; that is all I know of it.</p>

I keep horses and carts for hire, on the Hampstead-road, about nine doors from the Adam and Eve; On Wednesday evening, the 9th of October, the prisoner and Dayson came to me, Dayson asked me if I wanted any hay; I told him my horses went to grass at present, and I had hay enough for them in the mean time; Dayson said, because this man has got ten or a dozen, or fifteen trusses of hay to dispose of; I agreed for it; the prisoner asked me whether I could fetch it that evening; upon that, I asked the prisoner where the hay was; he told me close by Tavistock-hill; I told him I could not fetch it that evening; then the prisoner said, can you fetch it in the morning, I told him, no, I could not fetch it in the morning; I would fetch it in the evening of the Thursday; he told me to come to the Lord of Hay, upon Tavistock-hill, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know in what service he was? - A. No, I did not; I gave information of it to Crocker, the officer, at Bow-street, because I began to have some suspicion of him; I went on the Thursday evening with my horse and cart; I overtook Dayson on the road, and he walked with me as far as the Load of Hay, there I saw the prisoner; we called for a pot of beer, I sat there about a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner followed me; he desired I would go with him, and he would shew me where the hay was, and not to bring my cart up first; I told him I would stop till he was ready, and I stopped about a quarter of an hour at the public-house; I did not see Crocker, but he was waiting somewhere about the neighbourhood; my horse and cart stood in the road facing the public-house; the prisoner came, I followed him up to the farm, and he laid hold of my horse's head, and led him into the rick-yard; he turned the horse about, and the tail of the cart stood against the barn-door, I was in the cart; he said, you have no occasion to come down, I will give you the hay up; then he gave me some hay out of the barn, done up; in trusses, there were twelve truffes in all, as they were counted afterwards; says he, stop, and I will cut some more; then he cut another truss from the rick, and was making the band for to tie it up, when his master, and Taylor, one of the Bow-street officers, came and took him; Crocker came up directly afterwards; Mr. Allaney said, what, Mr. Holyoak, I have got you at last; says he, master, I think you have got me first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was all a contrivance of your's to induce that man to do what he ought not to do? - A. No; it was no contrivance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not a contrivance of your's and Crocker's, and Dayson's, to entrap this man into a selony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You made a bargain with the prisoner for this hay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you not think it would have been more kind and moral in you to have said, I do not think you are doing that which is right, and I will tell your master if you do it? - A. I do not know his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think it would have been more honest, more moral, and more humane, to have told the man he was doing wrong? - A. I do not think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Allaney that you were to receive this hay from this man? - A. No; Crocker did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Allaney knew of the fact, did he not? - A. Certainly he must.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore Mr. Allaney was robbed by his own consent? - A. I have said all I can say; Mr. Crocker had told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you at all persuade this man to make you an offer to fell hay that did not belong to him? - A. No; he came to me without my expecting it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; as I was calling the hour of four in the morning of the 7th of October, I heard a person call out, watch, come up stairs; it was in Crown-court, Broad-street, St. Giles's; I went up stairs and found the prisoner standing in one corner of the room; the prosecutor was in the room; I asked him what was the matter, and he told me, he had been robbed of one pound two shillings and seven pence; I asked the prisoner if she had any money, and she said she had only two shillings and seven-pence half-penny; he said, he could swear to one of the shillings, it was marked with an L and No. 4, he told me that before he looked at them; I then told the woman she must go to the watch-house; then she said, I have got half-a-crown more, but that is not his money; then I took her to the watch-house, and in searching her I found half-a-crown more upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was my own market-money that I work very hard for. (The shilling produced, and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you unload any sugar from the Nile, on account of Messrs. Thellussons, on the 24th of September? - A. I did; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17991030-77-deflabel442" type="occupation">carman</rs>

               <p>Q. Look at that ticket? - A. This is my handwriting; I delivered it to a man that we generally employ to load the cart, and he gives it to the carman who drives the cart with the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner drove the cart, No.385, that day? - A. Yes, I saw him with the very sugars in his cart; the goods should have been delivered at the Doublet warehouse, Upper Thames-street, in a strait line, just by Dowgate-hill; it belonged to Mr. Georgius Street: we always deliver the carman one of these notes, and they give us their number, and we tell them where to go. The carmen sometimes come to us for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the value of this sugar; is it worth forty pounds? - A. Yes, and more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What becomes of that ticket? - A. It is signed by the warehouse-keeper when the goods are received, and brought back to the master carman, as a voucher that those goods have been delivered by his carman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you deliver these very sugars to the carman? - A. No, I ordered them to be delivered in our presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that person here, or did you see the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300063"/>hogsheads of sugar put into the cart? - A. Yes, I saw them put into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The hogsheads of sugar have been delivered to Mr. Street, have they not? - A. Yes; the prisoner was apprehended by the officer of police, and then the sugar was delivered; he was in custody then.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not very often happen in Thames-street, that there are stoppages of carts? - A. Certainly it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen when there is a stoppage, in order to save time, that the carman goes forward, and gets a ticket for the delivery of the goods? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know a carman receive a ticket from the warehouseman before the goods are delivered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean between the time you deliver the goods with the ticket, and the time that it arrives with the warehouse-keeper, have you not known, from the stoppages in the street, that the carman has applied for the ticket before the goods are delivered? - A. I have certainly heard that they have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that while they have been doing so, and applied for the ticket before the delivery of the goods, that persons have gone away with the cart, and the cart has not been to be found? - A. I never heard of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the person, for whom you act, upon that become liable for these goods? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What warrants the carman to call upon you for the cartage? - A. This ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive these sugars? - A. Not till the evening; they were brought back by the officer, in the same cart, No. 385, some time from three to five o'clock; they were brought back by Edward Smith, the officer, and the carman; the cart contained two hogsheads of sugar. I don't remember that the carman said any thing.</p>
               <p>Q.Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You do not know who delivered the ticket? - A. No; there were so many I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You signed it and sent it away again? - A. No; I put the number of the cart in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen that there are stoppages in Thames-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not often happen that before the delivery of goods, the carmen apply for tickets? - A. They do sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it has happened be fore now, that while the carman has gone for his ticket, his cart has been taken away? - A. I never heard of that.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was the driver of the cart when he returned with the officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect what he said? - A. I cannot say positively, but I think he said something about losing his cart.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he gave as a reason why he did not deliver the goods within the time in which he would have done? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was taken to Lambeth-street office? - A. I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations did you happen to attend? - A. I attended at the Mansion-house three or four or five times.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in custody all that time? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a carman; On the 24th of September, between eleven and twelve, I was coming through Chambers-street to take up a load, and I saw a cart with two hogsheads of sugar, or three, I am not certain which, standing without any driver at all; it had the name of Barnjum upon it, but I do not know the number.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect you had been examined on this business before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you know who was the driver of that cart? - A. I did not know till afterwards; I went to load a load of timber in Mill-yard, Chambers-street; I was there a long time loading the cart, I was there an hour, or an hour and a half; and as I was coming out of the yard, I saw the prisoner driving the same cart towards Leman-street; I asked him where he had been stopping so long; he told me had lost his b-d cart for two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him if he had been to look for it? - A. No; he said he was going to street's; I said I had been there twice to-day; he said he had lost it from Mr. street's.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he driving the cart? - A. From Chambers-street towards Leman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Lord-Mayor how long after this? - A. I was there two days.</p>
               <p>Q. One or two days after you had seen this man? - A. It was some time after; I went afterwards to Mr. Street's; I always had my note signed before I delivered the goods; but Mr. Street refused to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300064"/>sign it, because he said there had been two hogsheads lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word of this before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I was not asked as to it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not know that he was charged with stealing these goods? - A. Mr. Street told me the cart was driven away; I thought I was to give an account what was become of it; I was not asked about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If you had been asked these questions, I presume you would have answered them? - A. Yes, I should have said what I have now said.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you an hour and a half in the yard that you speak of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the horse and cart were then standing without any driver? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was that he told you he had lost his cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have been walking or running? - A. He seemed to be vexed like, and his face was very red; but whether he had been walking or running, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for a carman to get a ticket signed before he delivers the goods? - A. Yes, if there is one cart or more under the crane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you staid there at a time before you could get your ticket signed? - A. Two hours; There has been sixteen carts there.</p>
               <p>Q. But how long have you staid before you could get your ticket signed? - A. Sometimes there is nobody in the way to sigh it; I have staid, I dare say, ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might drive your cart away in the mean time? - A. The warehouse is up a gateway.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were examined before the Lord-Mayor, Smith was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention one word of this? - A. To tell you the truth, I am a poor man, and have got but one cart, and could not well afford to lose the time, and therefore I did not say any thing about it; I once lost a cart with sixteen chests of tea in it, and found the horses in Cornhill going homewards.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to Leman-street; is that the way to Mr. Street's? - A. The way that the horses stood when I first saw them; there was a waggon stood across the street; it certainly was not the nearest way.</p>
               <p>Q.What number is your cart? - A. 69. 101.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from goodman's-fields? - A. About ten minutes walk from Chambers street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar? - A. Yes, I remember him very well; I never saw him before; I was standing at the front door of my house in Petticoat lane, the back-door is in Cobb's-yard: On the 24th of September, between twelve and one, within a few yards of the India warehouses, I saw the prisoner looking about; I asked him what he was looking for, and he said it was not material; he then asked me if I knew one

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. A. dealer in iron and copper; he said he owed him some money for some articles that he had sold for him; says he, by his using me so ill and so roguish, I will not go to him any more; I said, have you got any thing particular to say; come in, and I may answer you, may be; he said he had two hogsheads of sugar to suppose of, in a cart in Chambers-street; he said, if you have a place to put them in, I will take fifteen guineas for them; says he, they are worth eighty pounds; he then pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said, here is the note that they are delivered; they have signed the bill, says he, and they cannot mils them; I then told him I had no place sit to take two hogsheads of sugar, neither did I know any people that would take them in; he went out at the front door in Peticoat-lane, and I went out the back way up to Red-lion-street, to see if there was a cart with two hogsheads of sugar in it; and I saw two hogsheads of sugar in the cart, but did not know that that was the cart. I immediately ran to the office to see if there was any officer there, and I gave information to Smith, and Mr. Thompson, the clerk of the office; Smith, the officer, went with me to see if there was a cart standing there, and I shewed him the cart; I pointed out the prisoner, sitting at the public house; I told Smith I did not wish to come forward; I saw Smith apprehend him; he had got to the cart, and was driving it from the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner before? - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew Mendez? - A. Yes, very well,</p>
               <p>Q. So this man, whom you had never seen before, had all this conversation with you, being a perfect stranger, directly and voluntarily, without your having known any thing of him? - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q.And you have not seen him since, I suppose? - A. Yes, I have: I went to the Compter to see him, the Friday before I went before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that you pointed the prisoner out to Smith? - A. It was the 24th, I behave.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the day of the week? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.How many days was it before the Friday? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300065"/>A. It might be a week or ten days before I was summoned before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Smith apprehend him? - A. Yes; I told Smith I did not with to come forward at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you desired by Smith to go to Lambeth-street? - A. No; I told him I did not wish to come forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at all to Lambeth-street? - A. I did not; I told Mr. Smith and Mr. Thompson that I did not like to go in.</p>
               <p>Q.You gave the information to Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they suffered you to go away without laying your information before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, before the Lord-Mayor, you were extremely willing to give the account you have now given? - A. No, I will contradict you in that; for I was not. I told the Lord-Mayor I did not wish to come to the Old-Bailey; I thought my duty was finished when I gave information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Lord-Mayor threaten, or not, to commit you, if you did not give an account of it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you would not give your account before the Lord-Mayor, in public? - A. His Lordship heard me in private.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not refuse to give your account, unless you could do it in a private room? - A. I deny it; his Lordship ordered me to go into his parlour, and I then told him the same as I had told the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness here before? - A. You must know that.</p>
               <p>Q. That won't do; were you ever a witness here before? - A. Yes, in a just cause.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stood at that bar, I believe? - A. Yes, and honourably acquited.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you were honourably convicted once? - A. Yes, that was for bad halfpence. I was convicted for three months.</p>
               <p>Q. For coming? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time you have been here; how many times have you been at the bar, though you have been lucky enough to be acquitted? - A. About six or seven months ago I was tried here, and false sworn against.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been tried in any one session? - A. You know very well that the fellow took the advantage to try me both in the city and in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner in the Compter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk with the prisoner at all about any money that you were to have? - A. No; when I went in, he said, I was terribly frightened that you were coming against me; no, says I, I am not; says he, were you ever in a place in King-street, that encourages all these kind of things: I asked him if he had offered them for sale there; and I said, may be somebody might overhear him there; he said, no, there was nobody in the shop but a woman and a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always gone by the name of Barnett Solomons? - A. At the time I was convicted for three months I was ashamed, because my friends were very honest, and then I put in the name of Barnett Barnett.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not gone by the name of Bullhook? - A. That is my Hebrew name.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never gone by the name of George Britton? - A. I cannot help what people call me; they call people twenty names there, and I cannot help it, when we are drinking in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at Guildhall? - A. I was never tried there.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever there upon any charge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor perhaps ever in a little strong place that we have in Bridge-street, Blacksriars, called Bride well? - A. A good many else have been there; I was not there long; I was looking in at a lottery-officer, and I was taken up for insuring. I was very innocent of it, and in nine days I got a pardon.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel; I apprehended the prisoner by the information of Solomons, in Chambers-street, Goodmans-fields; I I found the cart standing there with two horses, and two hogsheads in it, apparently of sugar; Solomons and I went into a public-house, facing the street, where we could see the cart as it stood; he described the prisoner to me, and I went round into Rosemary-lane to see if I could see him; as I came back, going into the public-house, I saw the prisoner driving the cart; Solomons was in the public-house at that time; the prisoner was coming out of Chambers-street, and turned up Leman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner was the man? - A. Because I went into the house and asked Baruett Solomons; I went after him up Leman-street, he had got half way up Leman-street, from Chambers-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the nearest way to Thames-street? - A. No; he was going the direct contrary, while he was in Chambers-street, but when he was out of Chambers-street, he turned the nearest way that he could go; when I laid hold of him, I asked him what he had got; and he said, some sugars;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300066"/>I told him, he had been offering them for sale; he he said, no, he had not, he was going to Mr. Street's warehouse with them, and he pulled out a note with the name of Street upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. I have no doubt but this is the same, it has not been in my proffession; he told me, he had taken the sugars from Wiggins's quay, and had lost his cart; I asked him, how long he had lost it; he said, he had got his note signed about ten o'clock; he said, he had been running about a long while, and could not find it, and at last he met a man in the Minories that told him there was a cart standing in Chambers-street; I then went with the prisoner to Mr. Street's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you been an officer? - A. Four years next February.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever, in the course of your experience, upon the apprehension of a prisoner for felony, find a man more ready to give you information than the prisoner at the bar? - A. Never; he said, you need not take me into custody, for I will not run away; he was one hundred yards from me at one time, for I was talking to the foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever differ in his story at any one time whatever? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pulled out this very note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went down to Wiggins's quay to know if he told the truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>RAINSDON sworn. - I manage Mr. Barnjum's business, he is in the country; I have myself lost my cart for two and three hours, and found it two miles off, it is a very common thing; I drove one of these horses myself, and I know he is very spirity, and if he can get his head on one side he will go away, and very often ill-disposed people will do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you keep your horses? - A. In Woolpack-alley, near Houndsditch; he has always bore a very good character; his master gives him more than he does the other men on account of his good behaviour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you observed any body about your cart? - A. No; I saw the property again at the office, the first of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state whether this is or not the same property that you lost? - A. I positively believe it to be mine; I am sure it has been drawn this year, that I am very positive of, because it gets thick; it now weighs eighteen pounds ten ounces; it has been shifted twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any thing else? - A. I am confident it was drawn either in August or September; this year there are not more than three about here that draw it I believe; I draw more than any body else; I have heard that there are some at York in that way; that quantity can only be wanted by a very respectable chemist and druggist or distiller, they use a great deal; the value when I lost it was sixty pounds eight shillings, and it has been rising in price ever since; a pint weighs a pound, it was sixty four shillings a pound at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe I heard you right, that though you have a very strong belief on the subject, you will not undertake to swear that it is your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lost it, I believe, it was fastened up with corks of your own furnishing? - A. Yes; it was contained in six Winchester quarts, corked by myself, and put up by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it again was there the same corks or the same bottles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to a house in Old-street, kept by a person of the name of Jacklm, and charge it with having come to that house? - A. I went with two men, but I did not go in, for I was very ill treated; I was taken into custody and detained.</p>
               <p>Q. At Jacklin's house? - A. Yes; Mr. Nares very much reprobated their conduct; Rixen keeps a public-house, the Rodney's-head, in Old-street, just by Jacklin's door; he is a constable, and he used me very ill, and would not let me send for my friends; and when my friends came, he said, he would forgive me; but I did not chuse to be forgiven by them, and I went with them to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did you not indict them? - A. The Magistrate said, there was not ground, or else I would at any expence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How long might they contrive to keep you? - A. I suppose about an hour; I wrote a letter to my cousin, at Apothecaries-hall, and the letter was intercepted; Jacklin came out and said I was a thief, and charged me with a constable.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a chemist and druggist in Whitechapel: On the 27th of September in the forenoon, the prisoner Dacosta, and De Silva, brought me a sample of oil of peppermint.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you buy from sample? - A. Yes; that is the usual course of the trade; we can tell from the sample what the quality is; I told them to call at three in the afternoon, and I would give them an answer; they told me there was about eighteen pounds of it; in the interim, about eleven in the forenoon, I went to the Magistrate's at Lambeth-street, having heard that a quantity was stolen in the trade; I mentioned the circumstance to them, that I had a sample of all the peppermint brought me for sale, which corresponded with the peppermint that I heard was lost; two officers, Griffiths and Nowlan came to my house, and at three o'clock Dacosta and De Silva came for their answer, and I told them to bring the goods at their price, sixty shillings a pound; at half past four, Dacoster and De Silva, brought one quart bottle; the officers took them into the laboratory, and charged them with knowing something of the goods; they said, they knew nothing at all of it; that Martin was coming, who belonged to the goods, with the remainder part of them; a few minutes after, Martin and Samuels brought five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300070"/>half gallon square bottles more, they were not full; Martin said to Samuels, go to a public-house and call for something, and I will be with you directly; Martin asked him if Dacosta had been there with any oil of peppermint; I told him, yes; he then asked me who was the master of the house, I told him I was; he then said, the oil of peppermint belongs to me, you must pay nobody for it but my self; Griffiths, upon hearing that, took him backwards with Dacosta and De Silva, and asked him how he came by the oil of peppermint; he said, he had bought it, he did not know who the man was that he bought it of, but he should know him again if he saw him; then they were all four taken into custody; Samuels said, he was not concerned in it, but he would go with the officers.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does the sample, produced by Mr. Moore now, and the bottles, and the sample, brought to you, all agree? - A. They do, to the best of my judgment; it is impossible to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The mode of ascertaining the quality of oil of peppermint, is by mixing it up with other commodities? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that by taking a sample, you can form an accurate judgment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If oil of juniper is mixed with it, by mixing it with other commodities, you discover it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The weight is the same? - A. No; the oil of peppermint is the heaviest.</p>
               <p>Q. The difference is very flight? - A. It is considerably heavier.</p>
               <p>Q. Your searched Burgin's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the least trace of bottles, or boxes, or any thing of that kind? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. What is he? - A. A corn-chandler, and gingerbread baker, opposite Old-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know Dacosta before? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I went to Mr. Jordan's on Friday, the 27th of September, in company with Nolan, about three o'clock; we stopped there some time in the kitchen backwards; Mr. Jordan informed us that one of the parties was course; that was De Silva, and we went and took hem into custody; I took him into the back room, and asked him if he knew any thing of the oil of peppermint; he said, he had nothing at all to do with it; that Martin was the owner of it, and was coming with the other part of it; some time after, Martin came in; I heard Mr. Jordan ask Martin, who was the owner of that property; he made answer, and said, it was his property, that he was the owner of it; I then took him in custody; I took him into the back room to De Silva, I asked him who he had got that oil from; he said, that he had bought it of a man, but did not know where he lived; he said, he thought he could find him; after stopping there some time, I took him down to the office, and Samuels was brought by Nowlan; he said, he could tell us where they bought it; he went with us to Burgin's house; my brother, who is one of the officers of the same office, went in with Samuels, I remained outside, till the coach came to take him away; I went in the coach with Burgin; Burgin requested that he might go into the house, while the house was searched, because, he said, his wife was not at home; I consented to that; I then took Burgin out of the coach into his house, I went up stairs, and Burgin said, we were very welcome to look over any part of his house, for he had no such thing as oil of peppermint in his house; I had told him what we apprehended him for, we found nothing; we then returned to the coach, and coming along in the coach I asked Burgin, how he came by this oil, that the other men were in custody and had accounted how they came by it; I told him it was traced back into his hands, and that he had a right to account how he came by it; he answered me, that he kept an open shop, and that he had a right to buy; that he was in the habit of making peppermint drops, but after he had bought it, he said, he found that it was rank, and not fit for his use.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He did not say who he bought it of? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I keep a fish-stall in Petticoat-lane: On Friday, two days before Michaelmas-day, I went to one Mr. White's, at Islington, he is a beadmaker; I was going to carry him some fish-scales; I was coming down Sun-street back again, about half past three o'clock and I saw Martin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - A. Yes; Mr. Burgin and a man that keeps the Blue Anchor, in Petticoat-lane, and Belasco.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; Martin asked me if I could lend him any money; I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out some silver and three guineas; he took the three guineas, and gave earnest for some goods to Mr. Burgin, he did not mention what goods; after that, Mr. Burgin returned him two guineas back, and said he did not want but one guinea earnest; at that time Martin and I went away together and

            ; Burgin said, you must call upon me in an hour, or else you will forfeit the earnest; we left Burgin and the publican together in the street; Martin said to me, get me what money you can, you shall have a guinea for your trouble; then we all three went to the Black-lion public-house, in Petticoat-lane; when we went in Martin went back wards to the parlour; Mr. Adshead, the landlord, was sitting in his parlour; Mr. Martin called out Mr. Adshead, and said to him, you promised to lend me seventeen guineas; he did not make any answer to that; Belasco said, as I have come all the way with you, and as I know you to be an honest man, I will lend you five guineas; when he had lent him the five guineas, I gave him back again the two that he had returned to me, and that made three; then Adshead gave him eight guineas, a one pound note, and one shilling, which made nine guineas; then we went away for the oil of peppermint.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know it was oil of peppermint? - A. Martin mentioned it after we came out of the public-house, and asked me to go with him to fetch it; I went with him to Old-street road; I saw Burgin standing about five or six doors from his house; then Martin went with Burgin to Burgin's house, he is a gingerbread baker; then I and Dacosta went to a public-house and had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find Dacosta? - A. At the Black-lion; Belasco did not go with us for the goods; I said to Belasco, you had better go and see where he stops so long, and he went out, and then I went to see where they were stopping, and I saw them in about two minutes after; I saw Martin come out with a basket upon his head, I did not see Dacosta; I went with Martin to Bunhill-row, and then Martin said, you had better go back, and see where Dacasta stops, I went back to Burgin's and Burgin told me, he was just gone down Golden-lane with one bottle; I came back to Martin, and took the basket upon my head, and carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Martin? - A. He deals in sugar and peppermint-drops, and sugar-cakes, and all these sort of things, and carries them about the streets in a box: then I went to the Black Lion, and asked if Dacosta was there; he was not there; then I went back to Martin, and told him he was gone to Mr. Jordan's, in Whitechapel; the people at the Black Lion told me so; then I carried the basket on my head to Mr. Jordan's, in Whitechapel, and there Martin told me to put it down; I did put it down, and he told me to go and have a time of beer, and then I was taken before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was given for it? - A. No, I cannot say; there were seventeen guineas borrowed, but I cannot say what they might give for it; then I went with the officers to Burgin's house, and he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were in the coach with Burgin and Griffiths? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any such thing as this, said by Griffiths to Burgin, that as the peppermint was found, he had better acknowledge it? - A. Griffiths did say to Burgin, you had better tell how you came by it, for it will be better for you, and the people that are taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been a previous search made at Burgin's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And no trace of any thing of the sort to be found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you to have any of this peppermint? - A. I was to have a guinea for my trouble in raising the money for him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a confectioner; and one part of the year, when our business is dead, I am a dealer and chapman, and go to sales: On the 26th of September I saw Martin at the Black Lion, he shewed me a parcel of peppermint, he asked me what I could give for it; I told him I could give him 38s. a pound for it; he said, it cost him more money; I offered him two guineas; he said it cost him forty shillings, he should get but two shillings a pound by it; I desired him to give me a sample of it, which he did accordingly; I then went from him to Mr. Dacosta's house, and said, here is something that we can get a shilling by, if you can get a customer for it; he went with me to Mr. Adcock's, in st. Marry Axe; he said it would not do, for it was mixed with some chemical oil; I went to another place, and they did not want any; then I went to Mr. Jordan's, they told me he would be at home in the morning about ten o'clock. I got Dacosta to go with me; he said, what should I ask for it; I said, ask three pounds, and then I shall have room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300072"/>to abate; when we got to Mr. Jordan's, we shewed him the sample; he said, what do you ask for it; says he, sixty shillings a pound; I knew the value of it nearer than DeSilva or Martin, I have used a great deal in my time. Mr. Jordan said, if we would call at three o'clock, he would give us an answer; we went, and Mr. Jordan said, if you cannot take any less, you may bring the peppermint; Dacosta asked me what he was to have for his trouble; I told him I would allow him one shilling out of every pound weight that was sold. Then I came to Martin, and told him he must get it delivered as soon as he could; I had another appointment, that I could not go then, and I told Dacosta if he would assist Martin in carrying the bottles, for fear they should be broke, I would make him a compliment of something farther for his trouble, and he said he would. I told him I would meet him in half an hour at the public house, which I did; and Dacosta came in with a bottle under his arm; I went with the bottle to Mr. Jordan's, and I was taken into custody by Griffiths; I told him I had it from Martin, and that he was coming with the remainder directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were admitted an evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The account you gave there convinced the Magistrate you were a fit person to be a witness here? - A. I spoke nearly the same then as I do now; but I was slustrated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no enquiry where Martin got it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I must beg the favour of you to recollect yourself: did you, or did you not ask him where he got it? - A. He told me of a very respectable gentleman that he worked for, and served with goods, that satisfied me that it was safe to buy it. Martin and Dacosta had been at variance together.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Martin tell you who he had it of? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The first you saw or heard of this, was on the 26th of September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. How came you to ask him who he had it of? - A. Because I thought he might be imposed upon by some artful person or other.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On a Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a Thursday? - A. Yes; it was on Friday that we were taken.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You have seen the oil brought here? - A. Yes, and I have seen the sample; I have compared them, and cannot find the least difference: I took the means that I always take when I mean to try a sample of oil that I mean to buy.</p>
               <p>Q. This commodity is, I believe, very apt to vary in colour? - A. Yes, it does; but I can discern no difference in the colour of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this genuine, or adulterated? - A. I conceive it is; I should be satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not mean to swear positively that it is the same oil? - A. Certainly not; but it is so like that I cannot find any difference.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a thing extremely liable to adulteration? - A. I dare say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. To an ignorant person a mixture of oil of juniper might appear to be nearly the same? - A. I should consider not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this was adulterated, one in four, with oil of juniper, might it not appear to be nearly the same? - A. It might to a person not conversant with the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. All that you say is, that persons not understanding either might be imposed upon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Seventy-two shillings; it was worth sixty-four shillings at that time. The same peppermint would differ, both in colour and in smell, drawn from the still by two different operators.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you, in your mind, satisfied that it is the same? - A. It is the same in quality, in flavour, and in smell.</p>

My Lord, and Gentlemen, I am a confectioner by trade; I have served Mr. Burgin for several years with confectionary goods; and coming one day to his shop, he asked me if I could do any thing with oil of peppermint; I did not know the value of it; I told him, if he would let me have a sample, I would try to get him a customer for it; I carried it to De Silva, and he told me, the next morning, that he had sold it for sixty shillings a pound; I went to Mr. Jordan's, and told him that it was left in my care, and begged he would pay me. I have a wife and five small children; and if a poor man cannot buy goods of a responsible man, not in the street, but at his own house in safety, how is a poor man to know what to do.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep a shoe-warehouse, at the corner of Brewer and Warwick-streets, Golden-square: On Monday the 24th of June last, the prisoner, Tyler. called upon me, his son lived errand-boy with me; he asked me if I served merchants with shoes; I told him, yes; he then said, for my kindness to his son, he had recommended me to his master, who was a very capital man, and dealt very largely in shoes; he said, his master was a merchant; he said, he would bring him the next morning to look over the different sorts, and make choice; he did not say any thing about my charges then, he appointed nine o'clock the next morning; I waited till nine, but I did not see them till the Wednesday morning, they both came together; I saw Mr. Mason, and Tyler addressed him to me as his master, and I shewed him different sorts of goods, and he made choice of some; he gave an order for ten dozen of men's shoes, I am not quite certain of the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they worth three pounds a dozen? - A. Yes, more than that; and there were some Spanish leather shoes, and two dozen of Moroccos; Mason then desired me to send them to his accompting-house, at No. 11, St.

Yes; we all three stood together, and they both went away together; Mason said, he hoped I would put them in at a low price; I told him I would, but that I always dealt for ready money; Mason said, he meant ready money; he said, he had frequently large orders of shoes, and I might send them another time, without his coming down, and the reason of his coming down was, that he might see the different sorts, that he might send his orders another time; I sent them home the next day, which was Thursday, but being very busy on the Thursday, I had not an opportunity to look at them, and the clerk,(as he pretended to be) Tyler, called on the Thursday after on wondering that I had not brought them, and to know the reason; he said the money was sure, that his master was an honest man; he said, he was the most punctual man possible, but he would be a good customer. if I pleased him in that order; I asked him what time would be the best to see his master; he said, the middle of the day; I told him, I should bring them myself, as I was to be paid ready money for them; and in the middle of the day, I locked them up in a trunk, and took my shop-man with me to No. 11, Great St. Thomas Apostle; there was written at the door, "Compting house bell," but no name up; I wrapped at the door, and the clerk, Tyler, came to the door; he had a pen in his hand, sitting at the desk, apparently at writing; I ordered my man to put the trunk into the passage of the accompting-house; I asked Tyler if Mr. Mason was at home, and he said, no, he was obliged to be out upon particular business, and would not be at home till three o'clock; this I think was past one, I cannot be certain to half an hour; he persuaded me to leave them and call another time; she trunk was not then unlocked, I had the key in my pocket; he said, for fear he should not be in by three, I had better make it half an hour after; I desired my man to go home and leave the truck opposite, the house, there being a stable-yard opposite, in case I should not get the money, to bring the goods back again; I took the key with me, and left the trunk there; I went to St. Ann's-lane, and returned again, for I was rathes uneasy from the ap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300077"/>pearance of the house; it had the appearance of a merchant's accompting-house, but not in the style that I expected; I returned to enquire their character in the neighbourhood; when I came back in a very short time, I dare say not a quarter of an hour, I saw Mason near the hose, seemingly standing in the street, I think I spoke to him first; I said, I have left the goods at your accompting-house and I will return and shew them to you; he returned with me to the accompting-house; the prisoner, Tyler, opened the door to us when we went in, I unlocked the trunk; says I, here are the goods, will you be so good as look over them, as I have got the truck here in order to convey the trunk back; he pretended to be in a hurry, and said, I have not time to look at them now; Tyler was present all the time; I asked him if he would pay me for them; he said, oh, yes, and put his hand to his pocket as though he was going to pay me; he turned round immediately and said, I cannot now, I should not wish to pay for them till I had looked them over, I have not time now, nor cannot before to-morrow morning; but, says he, I will look them over and call upon you and pay you; if not, I positively will on Monday morning, for may be I may be busy to-morrow morning; I said, it is not usual to leave goods without payment the first time of dealing, and as I agreed for ready money, I expect the payment; surely, says he, you cannot doubt me till to-morrow, morning, you would not have me pay for them till I have looked them over; says I, sir, but my man and the porter are waiting to convey the truck home; then says he, I will pay the expence of the porter carrying it home; I put the key in the trunk and came away; I was not perfectly satisfied in my own mind, and in consequence of some information I received that day, I went the next morning by three o'clock, I thought they could not have had the impudence to remove them so early; I went to the accompting-house at three o'clock in the morning. I watched the door, and about seven I saw the window open; I then saw the door opened by a woman; I then went up to the door, I did not see Tyler, but I went into the accompting-house, put my hand to the trunk, and found it was empty; from information I received, I went to Goswell-place, it was then very little after seven, I knocked at the door and Mason looked out at the window; I told him, I wished to speak to him, and he came to the door in his shirt, without any other dress on; I told him, that I conceived I was robbed of my shoes, and I hoped he would return them, that I surely would not leave him till I had some satisfaction; he said, he would pay me for them; I told him I did not wish payment, I would have my goods again; while we were talking in this way he dress himself; he said, if I would stop till ten, he would pay me; I wrote a direction and went to the door to call to a boy that was at some distance that I might get some assistance, and he pushed the door against me and shut me out; I then looked through the parlour window and saw him making his escape backwards; I ran round to where the back door was, but he had made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house was this, that the merchant lived in, in Goswell-place? - A. A small house, in a must contemptible place.</p>
               <p>Q. What rent was the house, do you think ten pounds a year? - A. I dare say it was full that; it was apparently let in lodgings, for Mason and his wife slept in the parlour; I then immediately went, as I clearly saw I was tricked; I went to seek after Tyler, I found him, and related how I had been served by Mason, and hoped that he would restore me the goods; he made many pretences, at last he consented to go in search of them; he said, that he knew he was an honest man, and that he was sure I should be paid, and begged me to go home. and a great deal to that purpose; after this, he confessed that they were sent to Purse's auction-room, in Cloak-lane; he took me there, and there I saw them; it was twelve o'clock before I could get him to tell me where they were; a friend of mine went with me and Tyler to Purse's, and my friend, in the presence of Tyler, asked whether some goods had not been sent there from Mason; it was Mr. Purse's clerk, Mr. Job, that we saw, he hesitated for some time, at last he consented that I should see them; he then told us, that they were sent in the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day you had sent them? - A. Yes; he said, that they were lodged there, and that he had advanced some money upon them; I saw my goods, and my name in a printed label in every pair of shoes, and the women's shoes had never been unfolded when I saw them in his warehouse; we then took Tyler to Guildhall, and he was committed; about six days after I found Mr. Mason, I had frequently applied at his house, but could not find him there, I found him by accident; I was in a coach, somewhere behind Clerkenwell, I jumped out of the coach and took him; he resisted a little, but I got him into the coach and took him to Guildhall, and then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the shoes that you delivered? - A. Upwards of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Tyler's son was an errand boy of your's? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The representation that Tyler made to you of his having a master in St. Thomas Apostle, you found to be true? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He never represented to you that the goods were to be bought by him, but by his master? - A. Certainly not; but I surely should not have left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not find that all the purposes were answered when he declared that his master was the person to whom you were to sell the goods? - A. I have understood from him, and from the boy, that he was a clerk to Mason.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the goods which were to be sold by you, and for which he had recommended you, were sold to the master, and to the master alone? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found at the accompting-house that there was a person of the description of master, who had an accompting-house there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It had the appearance of being an accompting-house, from the outside at least? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tyler did not bargain with you for the goods, but Mason? - A. Certainly; but Tyler was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that Tyler was to have any concern whatever in the goods? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tyler, at any one part of the transaction, appear any other than as the clerk of Mason? - A. He did not appear as his clerk; I thought he seemed to make too free a great deal; I certainly understood Mason was to be my payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300078"/>Q. You left the goods, and gave implicit credit to Mason till the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Something in your mind misgave you, and you returned at three in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at three in the morning, neither Mason nor Tyler was there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Mason at Goswell-place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tyler was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Tyler afterwards, another day? - A. I know I took him that day, at his own apartments near St. George's-field.</p>
               <p>Q. He afterwards told you where you might find those things, and actually took you to the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore Tyler took you to the place where your property was, and where you recovered your property? - A. I have never recovered it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was the next day after you left the goods, that you took Tyler? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had agreed with Mason, and entered into a consent that he should pay you the day after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that time had not expired? - A. No; but I did not mean to give him credit for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a bill of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no receipt to it? - A. No; I had a receipt, though I did not produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the very next morning that you saw Mason at Goswell-place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time that any negociation had been entered into till you delivered them, what time had elapsed? - A. From the Monday morning.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep a house, No. 11, Great St. Thomas Apostle, and did in June last; there is an accompting-house belonging to it, which the prisoner Mason occupied at that time; the other prisoner, Tyler, I took to be Mr. Mason's clerk; the accompting-house was taken by Mason about three weeks before Miosummer; I asked him what line he was going into, and he said the mercantile line; I asked him for a reference to somebody, he gave me his address, and said that was enough; he wrote his address, No. 8, Goswell-place, Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mason had taken the accompting-house did you see Tyler? - A. Within a very few days afterwards, I saw them together consulting about a desk; there was not a desk there at that time; but after they had consulted together a desk came: there were some books and papers used to lie upon the desk, about two or three books.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some appearance of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever learn what Mr. Mason was? - A. I took him to be a Hamburgh merchant; there was some wine and some casks came in a coach, and some men fetched it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this parcel of shoes come in? - A. I saw the trunk after they were in; I think it was about noon that I saw it; Mason and Tyler were both there then; but I did not see Mr. Grieve till Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see done with the trunk afterwards? - A. About five o'clock the same afternoon that the shoes came in, a porter with a knot came for the trunk, Mason and Tyler were both in the accompting-house when the porter came; the next morning about seven o'clock Mr. Grieve came and took hold of the trunk, which was empty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mason, the merchant, come to his accompting-house the next day? - A. No, I never saw Mason afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mason gave you a reference when he first came? - A. Only his own adress.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had an opportunity of enquiring whether he gave a true account of himself? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry of you? - A. No; I saw a man come out from the back of the houses in Goswell-place; he got over the wall by out gate into our cotton manufactory; the prisoner Mason is the man; I asked him what business he had there; he said he wanted to get out; I told him he could get out till eight o'clock; he said, if he could get out, he would give me a pot of beer, and a shilling; I told him I would see our foreman, and hear what he said; I then fastened the door, and told him he should not go till I knew how he got there; I went to look after our foreman, and when I came back he was gone; he had gone through our foreman's house; I traced the man's feet a considerable way, but could not find him; he must have come over a wall into our yard, of twelve feet high: shortly after that I saw Mr. Grieve.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. You were captain of the revenue cutter the Hind? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell my Lord and the Jury, what was your situation at sea on the 15th or 14th of May. when you had a view of the Lottery cutter? - A. I will; the wind was westerly; I was cruizing on the 13th of last May, between Dartmouth and the Start Point, for the purpose of intercepting smuggling vessels; when I was informed, by the man at the mast-head, that a sail was seen.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it? - A. About three in the afternoon; we could not then perceive exactly what she was; about half past three we made her to be a cutter; at four she came in so fast that we discovered her to be the Lottery; she came in directly for the shore; the wind then veering to the northward of west, I stood in under the land, the smuggler still continuing to steer in north, till at six he was within about two leagues and a half of the land called the Bolt, when finding the wind come to the northward, he tacked; the Hind immediately tacked after him, made fail, and chased him all the night, without ever losing fight of him; on the 14th, at five in the morning, we were becalmed, at about the distance of five miles from the smuggling cutter; when I ordered both the Hind's boats to be manned and armed, with an officer in each, to proceed towards that cutter, and take possession of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as inform my Lord and the Jury your relative situation with the Lottery, at five in the morning? - A. I, at the same time, fired a gun, and hoisted an ensign at the mast-head, in the most conspicuous place; the smuggling cutter then lying becalmed about two leagues and a half south south-east from the Lizard, making use of his sweeps or oars; the boats proceeded according to my order, and I continued rowing in the cutter to give them assistance; when they had proceeded about two-thirds of the five mile, I saw a gun fired from the stern of the smuggling cutter, and with my spying-glass I observed my two boats shew the revenue colours.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before or after the gun was fired? - A. Just after the gun was fired; still continuing to row towards the smuggling cutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you observe the shot fall in the water? - A. No. They then came very close to the smuggling cutter, and laid upon their oars, where they remained some little time; a breeze of with springing up, the smuggler made more fail; the boxes returned and I hoisted them in, and made fail, pursued the cutter, and gained on him; on which he threw overboard a quantity of spirts in ankers, which enabled him to fail faster, still the find gained on him, and in the afternoon, about two, as well as I remember, just a mile and a half off the Longships.</p>
               <p>Q. Where about is the point of the Longships? - A. Near the Land's-end; I brought my chose-guess to carry over him, on which he lowered the part of the crew took to their boat, which boat ordered to be chased by my own two boat, end she was taken and brought alongside the Hind; we then took possession of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300080"/>the Lottery smuggling cutter; we found her laden with spirits, in small casks, for the purpose of smuggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell me whether either of the prisoners were in the boat that was brought alongside you, or on board the vessel? - A. Barrett was on board the vessel, and Marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recognise the persons of any other person who came alongside in the boat? - A. Yes; the shortest of those at the bar, Searle.</p>
               <p>Q. This vessel has since been condemned? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Marryatt. I shall certainly object to the question; that is not the way of proving a condemnation.(Mr. Fielding was about to reply.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marryatt. Q. What course did the cutter steer during the night, while you were chasing her? - A. Sometimes to the southward of west, and sometimes to the northward, the wind veering occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might she run in the course of that time? - A. She ran from the Bolt-tail nearly to the Lizard.</p>

               <p>Q. What distance was she from the Lizard at the time that your boats first went in chase of her? - A. About two leagues and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak with accuracy to that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance of the one cutter from the other? - A. When becalmed, at five in the morning, the cutters were about five miles distant from each other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after five in the morning before your boats got nearly up to the cutter, how many hours? - A. I suppose it could not be more than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Lottery been pulling away with their sweeps all that time? - A. I did not perceive her with her sweeps for some time; I was busy; I saw her with her sweeps while the boats were chasing her.</p>
               <p>Q. When the swivel was fired, did you hear the report, or only see the smoke? - A. I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance were the boats from the cutter at that time? - A. About one-third of the way from the cutter to us; nearly two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. The object of that question is, what I dare say you will answer me fairly; whether, if there had been any shot in that gun, it could have reached the boat? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any shot strike the water? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you overtook the Lottery cutter, and the boar had put off, what means did you use besides chasing, to bring back the Lottery's boat; did you fire at the boat? - A. I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your boats fire? - A. I believe they might, I cannot be positive; they were armed, and might fire; I was too busy in shifting sails and other things, to observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mate's name was Pearce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person of that name on board the Lottery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a seaman? - A. No, only a passenger; he was allowed by all on board to be only a passenger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he any relation to

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I believe you were the mate of the Hind revenue cutter? - A. I was acting mate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a custom-house officer? - A. I am</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it that you got sight of the Lottery smuggling cutter? - A. On Monday, May the 13th, about a quarter, or half past five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one of the persons ordered into the boat of the revenue cutter? - A. Yes, I was; that was on Tuesday morning, the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Lottery cutter before? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you came near her? - A. I suppose about an hour and a quarter after I left the cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came near her, what distance was this smuggling cutter from the shore? - A. About three leagues.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do when you came near to her? - A. The first thing that we did, in the boat, was to hoist-the revenue colours; but previous to that a gun was fired from the Lottery, and hoisted English colours to the beam-end.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after you had hoisted your colours? - A. I was hailed from the Lottery by a speaking-trumper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your colours hoisted in such a manner that the people on board the Lottery could perceive them? - A. Quite so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that they must have seen your colours hoisted? - A. It is impossible they should not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to you by the man with the speaking-trumper? - A. To keep off them boats immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to perceive who that man was, and whether he is any of the persons now at the bar? - A. I believe neither of them is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man with the speaking-trumpet say to you? - A. I thought myself that I was not so near the cutter that I could make myself heard, because I had no speaking-trumpet in the boat with me. I then pulled much nexter to the cutter, within less than a cable's length of her; I was again hailed by the same man on board, and told, that if I did not immediately keep off them boats, they would immediately fire at us, and sink us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Inform us, perhaps the gentlemen of the Jury may not know, any more than myself, what a cable's length is? - A. A hundred and twenty fathoms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That is two hundred and forty yards, is it not? - A. Yes. I then stood up in the boat which I was in, told them that it was the Hind revenue cutter's boats, that my name was Pearce, and that I had orders from Captain Bray to go on board of their vessel, and such orders I must obey; at the same time I told them that I knew the cutter, that her name was the Lottery, and told them that I knew them, meaning the people on board of her; the answer was, that they did not care a d-n who the boats belonged to, or who we were, or what I was; and that I was very much mistaken, it was not the Lottery; and if in case I did not immediately retire, they would fire on us, and kill us all: the vessel had a piece of canvas over the stern, which piece of canvas covered the name, in order to hide it. I lastly asked them positively; whether they would permit me to come along-side, or not; if they would, I would use them well; the answer was, that if in case I attempted to come along side, not one single man of us should live to return again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300081"/>Q. At the time they made this threat to you, how was the cutter and the crew disposed? - A. I saw one gun run out at the larboard-quarter port.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the side you were on? - A. Yes; there were two swivel-guns mounted on the mizen-beam; and one man I perceived distinctly, standing on the mizenbeam, with a musket; the people, who had been rowing the vessel before we got near her, had laid on their oars apparently to me on the quarter where these guns were, and the guns appeared to me to be pointed immediately towards the boat I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have persevered to board her, without the hazard of being destroyed? - A. No; nothing but that could have induced me to return to the Hind cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, did you give up your attempt to board her? - A. I did, in consequence of seeing them so determined, and my people alarmed. I then returned to my own cutter to endeavour to row our own cutter alongside of the smuggler, there being little or no wind.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Lottery, at last; did she escape? - A. No, we took her off the Longships.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she turn out to be the Lottery, or not? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the crew of the Lottery? - A. They hoisted out their boat, and twelve of the crew pushed off; that was about half past one on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you had taken possession of the Lottery was that? - A. About half an hour before we had possession of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue the Lottery's boat with your boat? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her before she could get to shore? - A. I did, about the half distance between the Lottery cutter and the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the men that are now here, in her? - A. Yes;

               <p>Q. Did you yourself see what the smuggling cutter was loaded with? - A. I did, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. Brandy, gin, tea, and tobacco; I do not know that there was any rum.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of casks were they? - A. Ankers, and what we call six-gallon casks; they hold about five gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there, as near as you can guess? - A. Seven hundred and sixteen; chiefly ankers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Best. Q. Your name is Pearce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a person on board the Lottery of that name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that persons any relation of your's? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person on board the Hind cutter of that name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he any relation of his? - A. He was his son.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation on board the Hind does young Pearce hold? - A. Only mariner.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us there were twelve persons in the boat, how many were there on board the cutter? - A. Five.</p>
               <p>Q. There were fifteen indicted? - A. There were sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all but Pearce indicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it, when you went from the Hind in the boat? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it? - A. A very clear morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What course was the Lottery steering? - A. West north west, by the compass.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, you hoisted your colours? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was, perhaps, calm at that time? - A. Nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course the colours could not spread, so as to be seen, but would hang down in folds? - A. In order to prevent that, our colours were fastened to a flag-staff, in the first place, and that staff lashed to a boat-hook staff, about fourteen feet in length, and lashed in this direction athwart (describing it); so that the marks should be clearly distinguished in the boats bows.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You displayed your flag so as to be distinctly seen? - A. Yes, as much as if it had blown a gale of wind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Best. Q. Do you know what was the situation of Ventin on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was cook? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you the least doubt in the world, that the persons on board the smuggling cutter must have seen the colours? - A. It is impossible that they should not, unless they had shut their eyes to avoid seeing them, or knowing me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an officer of the Customs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any appointment from the Customs? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. Q. You were a mariner on board the Hind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer of the Customs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A deputed officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the chase given, on the 13th of May, to the Lottery cutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the morning of the 14th, go out in one of the Hind's boats? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went in the other boat? - A. Mr. Pearce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you row on towards the cutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you approached nearest the cutter, your boat, or Pearce's boat? - A. Pearce's boat.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were nearest the smuggler, about what distance was she from the shore? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. About what distance were you from the shore? - A. I cannot say; I did not see the compass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was she within one hundred leagues of shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. Can you tell within a mile? - A. I suppose, in my own opinion, she might be within three or four leagues of the Lizard; the easternmost part of the Lizard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Lizard the nearest land to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come near enough to the Lottery to hear what was said from the Lottery? - A. Yes; I heard some of the dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear? - A. I heard the people on board the Lottery desire us to keep the boats off.</p>


               <p>Q. Did they say they would do any thing in case you should not keep off? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they at any time say they would do, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300082"/>you did not keep off? - A. They told us if we did come along-side, we should not go back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the expression used? - A. That is as high the expression as I can recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hoisted any colours in the boat you were in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What colours did you hoist? - A. Custom-house colours.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you hoist them; in such a way as they could distinguish it on board the Lottery? - A. Yes; I stood up, and held it athwart the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see what the flag was? - A. If I had been there I could have seen what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You know that at sea, in order to ascertain the distance accurately, two points of land must be taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no land then but the Lizard? - A. Yes; I could see land, I could see Falmouth land.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not take the bearings of Falmouth land and the Lizard? - A. No; I did not take the bearings at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot speak by any means, with the accuracy that you could speak, if you had taken the bearings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear, upon your oath, that when a vessel is about four leagues from the shore, you can tell to half a league without taking the bearings? - A. Oh, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by the first part of your evidence, that she might be within three or four leagues? - A. Between three and four leagues.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your opinion without taking the bearings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Lottery was taken you went on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any guns on board her? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a single gun? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not any shot? - A. Yes; there were a few shot, and there were wooden guns.</p>
               <p>Q. Would those shot be of any use with wooden guns? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was it a wooden gun that was fired at you, when you were chasing? - A. I did not hear the report of any gun; I saw the smoke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. After you had returned to the Hind, and the Hind was in pursuit of the Lottery, did you see any thing thrown overboard? - A. I did not see any thing thrown overboard, but I saw the kegs upon the water floating.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you saw the explosion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any shot fall in the water? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you not have seen it if any shot had struck the water? - A. I do not know that; it could not have reached us.</p>
               <p>Q. You were looking towards the cutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see any shot strike the water? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Bray). Q. Are you able to say, upon your oath, while you were in chase of the Lottery, that a gun, of some description, was fired from the Lottery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positively sure of that? - A. Yes; there was a gun fired from the stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state to the Corrt and Jury, whether that gun was fired from small arms, or any thing of the size of a swivel? - A. It was not a musket or a blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>Q. And of this you are positively certain? - A. I am positively certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Pearce) Q. Are you certain, that while you were in chase of the Lottery, some gun of some description, was fired from the Lottery? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to distinguish whether it was of the description of small arms, or of a larger size? - A. My opinion, upon my oath, is, that it was a swivel gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Not any thing smaller than of that denomination? - A. Not any thing smaller than a swivel could have made that report.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw a man with a musket pointed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marryatt. Q. Can you at all identify who that man was? - A. No.</p>
