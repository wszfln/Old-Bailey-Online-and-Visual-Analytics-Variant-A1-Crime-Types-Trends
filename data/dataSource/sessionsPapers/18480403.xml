                  </hi> I am a tide-waiter in the Customs. On 14th March I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi>, in the London Docks—some wheat was un<lb/>shiped from that vessel into a barge alongside, belonging to Mr. Groves—the work was finished about four o'clock—the batches were put on and a tar<lb/>pauling over—neither of the prisoners assisted in the loading—about fire my attention was called, and I saw the prisoners at the stern end of the barge, with one of the hatches and the tarpauling off—they were filling bags and examining the quality of the corn—I looked at them for a while, and the bags being very large and marked differently, I went and asked what they were doing—Mellish said, "Getting a sample"—I asked for whom—he said, "For the merchant"—I asked who was the merchant—he said, "Mr. Groves"—I knew Mr. Groves to be a lighterman, and not a merchant, and his name was not on the bags—they filled the bags, and placed the hatches and tarpauling on as before—each of them took a bag, and was carrying them forward from the further end of the barge—one of the bags was lowered into a lug-boat that was lying alongside—I then told them that they should not take it without an order—Mellish said, "Very well," he would leave it till to-morrow, and would bring the order—I said to the captain, who was stand<lb/>ing on the deck, "These men are evidently stealing this wheat; what shall we do with them?"—he said, "Do as you like; I shall have nothing at all to do with them"—we then allowed them to <hi rend="italic">start</hi> it back again into the balk—I sent for the police, and they were taken into custody.</p>

On the afternoon of 14th March I was called on board the <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi>, and found the two prisoners there—Howell charged them with the unlawful possession of one and a half bushels of wheat—I asked Mellish whether he had an order for any samples out of the vessel, and who authorised him to go on board the barge and take them—he said, "No one"—I said, "Where is the bag you had the grain in?"—he said, "I have not got it"—I searched him, and found this sample-bag under his jacket—he said, "It is my <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>-bag"—I said, "Where is your bag of samples?"—he said, "I have no bag"—I searched, and found it under the old sheet of the barge, and this other one that Saunders had—I took them to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Smith came to my father's shop, and bought a three-farthing loaf—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him two old shillings—I had no coppers in the till, and while I went to get some, be shuffled the shillings about which I gave him, and said, "I think you have given me a bad shilling"—I told him I had no bad shilling in the till—the one he gave me was new, with reading on it—he made a disturbance about it, and, to get rid of him, I gave him another for it—a person came in, and said something—I marked the shilling, and gave it to Whitlamb.</p>

                  </hi> I am barman at a public-house in Whitechaple. On 13th March the prisoner came for half a pint of porter and a short pipe—he laid down a Victoria shilling—I gave him a sixpence, a fourpenny-piece, and a penny—he drank his beer, and was out of my sight in a moment—I directly found it bad—I marked it and kept it by itself—the prisoner came again for porter and a pipe, and laid down a bed shilling—I gave it to Mrs. Simms, seized the prisoner, and kept him till the officer came—I marked the second shilling, and gave them both to the officer.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 14th March, about half-past seven o'clock, I left home, leaving no one in the house—I left the things quite safe, and the door and window fast—the tea-caddy was on the further side of the front-parlour table, where it always stood—it is my husband's property—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know nothing about the keys that are in it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) stating that he was recommended to me by Mr. Jabez Moore, of New Bond-street—Mr. Moore's name was not then on the note—I told the prisoner I did not know sufficient of him to discount it, but if Mr. Moore would endorse it I would do so—he came again on 6th Aug.—the name of Jabez Moore was than on the note—he stated that Mr. Moore was a particular friend of his, that he had been under obligations to him, and he had got his endorsement—I gave him a check for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. taking about sixpence in the pound discount—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody—on the day the bill became due, a letter was left at my house—I do not know the prisoner's writing—I tried in every way to find him, and advertised in every paper in London—he gave his address, at 43, Davies-street, Berkeley-square, when he came to me—I called there, and he was not known—I afterwards found he was living at a house in the Re<lb/>gent's-park, now occupied by Mr. Bodkin—I went these last Oct., and he had left—I also wrote a letter to him at Wellington-terrace, and received an answer—I apprehended him at a chop-house, in Woodstock-street—I told him I came to him about a bill of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., addressing him as Mr. Anderson—he said his name was not Anderson, but Williams—I said he certainly was Mr. Anderson when I gave him the check for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he must recollect Mr. Moore, of Bond-street—he said, "No, I know nothing of him"—I said, "Then I must bring some person up who can recognise you more clearly"—I called up the policeman who was waiting below, and gave him into custody—I am certain he is the man—I took him out of a room where there were twenty other parties.</p>

                  </hi> I am a messenger in the inland department of the Post<lb/>office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier there—it was part of his duty to assist occasionally in taking letters from the stampers to the sorters—it is a very large room—the stampers' tables are distinguished by letters. On 15th March the prisoner was taking letters from the "H" table to the sorters' table—I was placed so as to have a view of persons so employed—about seven o'clock in the morning the prisoner separated two or three letters from the others, and put them between the fingers of his left hand, then took a handful more up with both hands, carried them to the sorters' table, and put some of them down—he brought some away towards the railway department, put his hand down, and put a few under his waistcoat with his right hand—I told Mr. Barnard, the superintending president's clerk, and lost sight of the prisoner for two or three minutes—I went back, and saw him about to ascend by the machine, which is a frame with ten or twelve floors, which constantly aseends by the action of a steam-engine—I got up too late to go by the same stage as he did, and got on to the next—he could arrive at the floor above a little before me—when I got up he was going towards his seat—I told Mr. Harris, the assistant-inspector of letter-carriers—he went down with the prisoner to the inspector's room, by the machine—I left them there, and fetched Peste—these letters produced bear the inland stamp of 15th March, and were stamped at the "H" table.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor, at 34, Gray's Inn-lane. On 23rd March I left Astely's theatre about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—I went into a public-house in Westminster—I was there about twenty minutes—Cayton and Clare were in Front of the bar—Clare was dressed as he is now—I went outside with the gentleman who had been to Astley's with me, and wished him good night—Cayton called me back, and pulled me by the arm into the public-house—I treated him to some rum, put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and got the change—there were nine or ten men there—I said I knew a man named Dunn in that neighbourhood—Cayton said he knew him well, he lived in the same street with him—we were than at the corner of the street—he said, "Come with me, he lives within a door or two of me"—he took me to the left, towards the Abbey—I had to go to the right—he said he was taking me towards Mr. Dunn's—I think we passed the Abbey—Clare, who was with us, then said, "Good night," and left us—we went on to a curious sort of place; I thought no one connected with me lived there—A policeman stood at the corner, and I said to him, "I don't like this man, protect me"—I do not know whether Cayton said anything on that—I went on with him into the place, he caught hold of my arms, and folded them back quite tight, so that I had no power in them—a slight young man came out of a corner all at once, and stood in front of me—he was about Hall's size, but rather darker—it was quite dark—he pulled the chain out of my waistcoat-pocket—it was round my neck double—I thought I should be choked, and said, "Let me take my hat off"—they got my watch and chain—I put up my hands, to take my hat off, and Cayton said it was beat to be quiet—I had half-a-crown, and I think a shilling—I had two half-crowns, but changed one in the public-house—I had not taken out my watch in the public-house—the men walked away—I turned the reverse way, the way I had come—in about half-an-hour I met Cayton, coming in the same direction as a policeman, and I gave him in charge—between two and three next morning I saw Clare and Hall in custody—Cayton never left me till I lost my watch.</p>

Giltspur-street prison. Dear Sir,—I find myself in a very melancholy situa<lb/>tion, namely, innocently by incautiousness, in a prison, namely—on Monday, I met an acquaintance, who asked me to do him a favour, to go to a certain house and fetch a letter for him; he had some reasons he said for not fetch<lb/>ing it himself; in this letter there was a bank-note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which be<lb/>longed to another party; he requested me to take the same to Messrs. Rothschild's office, and to draw the money for the same; as I had done the same for him once before, I did not hesitate to do it again; he gave me the letter, and said I had only to sign the name of the party to whose order the bill was drawn, and if there was any hesitation, to say I had received the amount of other bills; the brother of this person is Peter Hoffnagel; go to him; he lives at 31, Charlotte-street, Charlotte-terrace, White Conduit-house, and explain the thing to him, and come here with him to-morrow morning early, exactly at ten o'clock; an arrangement between him and me will place me at liberty; do not forget to destroy all my papers which you can find in my room. I am to appear to-morrow at eleven or twelve o'clock; do not fail, everything depends upon it; when you come here ask for Thomas Schuh, and I shall be called; and by all means come, and bring with you Peter Hoffnagel.</p>

               <p>informed me and another friend, named Thomas Schuh, his wishes respecting some property in his father-in-law's hands; of whom he spoke in a manner that led me to suppose that he considered him more as an enemy than a friend, by keeping him from inheriting some property left him by his real father, and proposed a plan, by which he thought he could obtain what he was justly entitled to; and letters were then written, with his knowledge and consent, to his father-in-law in Germany, by Thomas Schuh, before Weber left London; and from his confidence in me, Weber directed that I should receive his letters, and sign any bill or document where his signature might be required, and, from our total ignorance of law, was not aware that any written authority was required; I, accordingly, having met afterwards with Schuh, he informed me that he held a letter from Weber, just received by him, and which he read to me, in which Weber described his voyage and other particulars; also directing Schuh, or myself, to receive the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prosecutor, and to take care of it; some time afterwards Schuh called again on me with another letter from Weber, as he said, and also read it, in which he was requested to forward the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him, also to take the second bill; I accordingly paid the 100<hi rend="smallCaps">l.</hi> over to Schuh, who I always be<lb/>lieved send it to Weber: after we had received the second bill, Schuh said, as I signed the first bill I ought to sign the second; I accordingly took it to the prosecutor, and was given into custody, and Schuh absconded, and I have not heard that he can now be met with, as Lorentz Weber, I am informed, is dead, all hope from him is ceased. I can only assert my innocence, and that, if the money is not forwarded to Weber, that I was made a victim of by Schuh.</p>

On Thursday night, 27 the Jan., about half-past seven o'clock I was at the Cross-keys, Fore-street, Lambeth—I saw Oakley, May, and Deacon there—about twenty minutes to nine, I saw all the prisoners against Mash's barges, at Millbank—they had three boats, and were in a barge getting coals, and putting them into their boats—I was in a boat alongside, getting two or three coals—I had no right to them—the Thames-police boat came up—the prisoners made heir escape up a plank, on to the timber, alongside the coal<lb/>wharf, and out into the road—there was no mud between the barges and where they had to land—I had known them all before—they had baskets to get the coals out with—I was left there—Edward White had been in the boat with me—he escaped, I was taken—as soon as I got to the police-ship I made a statement to the inspector—I did not tell him about White—White was using one of May's baskets—it was a white one, and had a blue mark on it—the boats they had were May's, Vernon's, and Beadle's.</p>

On 17th Feb., about twelve o'clock at night, I was with Mary Ann Ward, going through King's Arms-court, Whitechapel—it is a vary narrow court, and we were obliged to walk separately—I went first—when I got about the middle of the court I saw the prisoner standing on the right—I never saw her before—she looked under my bonnet and said, "Is that you?" or, "That is you"—she gave me a severe blow in the right eye, which made me nearly senseless—I have deprive of my sight ever since—I do not think it bled—I did not see anything in her hand.</p>

Mr. Layton brought the prisoner Brown to my apartment—Brown said he had come to see my work that Mr. Layton had been recommending me, and he wished to see some specimens of my engraving—I asked him what style he wanted, as there were so many—he seemed to hesitate, and at last produced this Gal<lb/>verston share note, marked "A," and said he merely wanted some specimens of that sort to show his friend in the country, that it was sent him to get the work done—he took three specimens of my work, and came again, I think, on the next Tuesday, with the specimen, and produced this note of the Reading bank, No. 57581—I then had a signature—he wished to know what the estimate would be for engraving two plates, necessary to produce a similar note—I had not doubt explained to him that two plates would be necessary, one for the note, and another for the word "Five"—I told him the expense, and what the printing of the notes would be—I had, two days before that, communicated with Messrs. Simonds', the bankers—I saw Mr. Mullens, and acted under his direction—I made these memorandums(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) of all that took place between me and Brown—I next saw him on 29th, and received from him a verbal order for the plates, with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—he left the note with me—the signature was cut off as it is now—he was to have brought me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he only brought 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said his friend was in the neighbourhood, and he would get the other shilling directly—he returned is less than half an hour with the shilling—he asked the price of half a quire of paper for printing the notes, and whether I could get it for him—next day, 1st March, he called again, I inquired how the numbers were to be affixed—an appointment was made for the following Saturday, the 4th—he came about eleven o'clock, brought 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and promised more in the course of the day—he appeared anxious about getting the paper for the notes—I told him I had not got it, there was time enough for that—he called again be<lb/>tween four and five, and brought another 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and an arrangement was made for the plate to be ready by four o'clock on the Monday—he called,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184804030065"/>
               <p>and I put him off the next day—he came next day, about seven in the evening—I showed him the plate—it was not quite done—I put him off till twelve or one o'clock the next day—he came about half-past one, and I gave him an impression of the plate I had shown him, with the word "Five," and also a specimen of the paper—he took them away, and promised to cell in half an hour, or three-quarters, with 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was going to show them to his friend—when he came back, he asked when I would get the two plates ready for making a finished note—he wished to have it on the Statur<lb/>day—he called again that day and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had promised me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he promised me the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at twelve or one next day—he called the next day, and brought me the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I promised to have the writing of the other plates done by five the following Saturday, and the ornament and ruling on the Monday, by eleven or twelve—he spoke about the numbering—I ad<lb/>vised that they should be put on separately—he said the paper was highly approved of, it could not match better—he came again on Saturday, 11th March—he gave me a half-sovereign—I spoke about the signatures and the blanks, and he gave me a must see the parties, and would let me know in a quarter of an hour, whether I was to engrave the signatures—he did not say where he was going to, but in the neighbourhood—he came back within half an hour, and said the parties would decide about the numbering and the signatures on the Monday—he said they wanted the plates on the Monday, and would make a fresh agreement for the signatures—he asked me the price of the signatures—I said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was to make <hi rend="italic">fac similes</hi> of the sig<lb/>natures, Fulbrook and Simmonds—he had told me that they were being lithographed—he did not show me the other signature then—I have not seen it since the first day—he was to bring me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday, 13th March—he came, and I gave him this plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) without the ornament—he said he had it to shaw to the party—he returned about four o'clock, and brought me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with the plate—he said he could not see his friend—he called again between seven and eight in the evening of the 14th—he asked if I. would let him have the pattern note, the genuine note which I had—I had it was at the printer's, to have the blue ink matched—I promised to give him some impressions about two o'clock next day—he said he wanted them to make money of—he returned in about half an hour with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 15th, I saw him about half-past two—I had arranged with him that everything should then be ready—my wife was gone to the printers—he waited till she came back, and I showed him the six impressions she brought—he said the imita<lb/>tion was quite near enough, nothing if fact could be better, and he was per<lb/>fectly satisfied, and if I would give him them, they, the parties, would turn them instantly into cash, and should have my money in half an hour—I refused to let him have them, as I did not know him, even his name, or where he lived—he said he lived in the City—I then gave him the six im<lb/>pressions and the original note—the next time I saw him at the Mansion-house, in custody, and I there saw these six impressions, which I had given him—there are marks on the plates which I see on the engravings—I put them there purposely.</p>

                  </hi> I was called on to assist in the observation of what was going on at Mr. Sprake's, and noticed Brown's visits there—I saw him between one and two o'clock on the 11th, come up the court towards Dean-street, in a direction from Mr. Sprake's house—he motioned with his hand as he came up the court, and I observed the prisoner Dewey standing in Dean-street, opposite the court, so as to be able to see the motion—Brown jointed him in Dean-street, and they went down Dean-street, into Compton-street, and turned up Frith-street—when I came into Queen-street, in Frith-street, I only saw Dewey—I stayed there five or ten minutes—Dewey was waiting about from Queen-street to Dean-street—I then observed them both walking along Queen-street into Greek-street, across Greek-street, up Rose-street, and there I missed them—I saw no more of them till the Monday, when I saw them both in Wardour-street, near Meard's-court—I saw Dewey afterwards, standing by himself, at the corner of Peter-street and Wardoor-street—Peter-street is nearly opposite Meard's-court, at the Wardour-street end—some time afterwards I saw Brown go from Meard's-court up Wardour street, into Broad-street, and turn into Poland-street, where I missed him—I did not see Dewey again that day—I only saw him for a short time—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct representation of the streets and courts of which I have been speaking—the black mark indicates Sprake's house—on the 15th, in consequence of something that was told me, I went about half-past three o'clock to a public-house in Poland-street, about 150 or 200 yards from Sprakes's, and met Brown coming out of the parlour-door, which is only a step or two from the house door—when he saw me, he immediately turned back into the parlour—I followed him, and observed him immedi<lb/>ately pass something to Dewey, who was sitting in a chair by the fire—I made towards the fire-place—Brown caught hold of me—at the same time I saw Dewey throw something on the fire—I extricated myself immediately from Brown, and got this parcel of five notes, which have been produced, from the fire—they were folded up very tight, in paper, and thrown on the fire, in the paper—I marked them at the time—Dewey threw the parcel on the fire immediately it was passed to him—he did not open it—while I had the parcel in my hand, I asked Brown whether he could give any explans<lb/>tion respecting it—I had opened it sufficiently to know what it contained—he said he knew nothing about it—I then asked the same question of Dewey, and he said he knew nothing about it—I searched them, and found this card on Brown, with the name, "S. Fulbrook, Aug., 1847," scratched on it—I also found some papers of no consequence—I took them both into custody, and searched them at the Mansion-house, and found in Dewey's coat-pocket part of a cigar-case, which contained this other impression, and the genuine pattern 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, "No. 57581," with one of the signatures cut off—I asked if he could give any explanation respecting them—he stated that a person in the public-house gave him the cigar-case, as it was, to hold—I asked him the person's name, and he made no answer—I also found some certificates of shares in Dewey's pocket-book.</p>

               <p>occasioned—they were not sufficient of themselves to cause death—the heart, lungs, and liver were diseased—the stomach was comparatively healthy, and quite empty, except about two able spoonsful of gruel—the membrane cover<lb/>ing the bowels was extensively ulcerated—the bowels were diseased, and the liver denoted that he had been a drunkard—finding what I considered suff<lb/>cient to cause death, I went no further—it appeared to have arisen from inanition, probably from want of food; and it might be from drink as well—I cannot say, from the liver, how long he had been a drunkard—person in charge of the house was present.</p>

I had a cow and three heifers, which I last saw two or three days previously to their being stolen—Harris was in my service three or four months ago, by the name of George Bishop—I entrusted some milking cows to his care—they were in a field—he left my service a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas—on missing the cows, I made inquiry at Smithfield on the</p>

                  </hi> I am a cattle salesman, and live at South Weale, Essex, On 23rd Feb., the prisoner Harris came to me at Romford-market, and said he had got some cattle to sell—he should send them on the Wednesday fol<lb/>lowing—he should be obliged to go into Wales himself, but the person who would come with them might take the account back—on the following Wed<lb/>nesday, Larby brought the three heifers and the cow to my residence—he said he had brought the beasts that Mr. Harris spoke to me about last week, and I believe he said his master had gone into Wales, and his mistress said I was to do the best I could with them, and he would take the account back—I asked his where the cattle came from—he said, "From Chingford"— —they appeared to have been driven fast, not as a lawful owner would treat his cattle—I told Larby that he must go to Mr. Harris, and he had better call on me on Friday, and I would settle with him—I gave him the account of what they were sold for—on the Friday I was at Smithfield—the account Larby came there and produced a note—I made some excuse, and said I did not know the writing, I was going to Islington, and would call on Mr. Harris, if he would give me his direction—he said he was a cow-keeper, was about join<lb/>ing, I think he said, the Alderney dairy, along with some other persons—he gave me Harris's address—as I was going along Harris came up to me, and called me by name, and said, "I suppose my man did not satisfy you," or something' to that effect, "when he brought the note; you did not like to pay him"—I said, "No, as I was going to Islington, I thought I would call on you"—he said, "I will save you the trouble, and will take the money of you"—I went with him to the banker's, where I saw Mr. Lynch, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Knill, of Fresh wharf. On Saturday night, 25th Mar., I left my watch in the desk in the counting--house at his warehouse, near Fish-street-hill—the counting-house is at one corner of the warehouse—I left the warehouse, with everything safe, at twenty minutes after eight o'clock—my foreman locked the door, with two padlocks, and I examined it with the watchman—the back warehouse was also locked—the prisoner was fore<lb/>man of the porters—about half-past seven that evening he went into the counting-house and signed off—there are places there where a person may conceal himself—my attention was called to the warehouse again on Sunday morning at six—the window blinds had been put up, and drawn down to the bottom—they are not fixed; we put them up—they had not been drawn down for some time—a desk in one corner of the counting-house was brokes open—the iron safe, in which the money was, had been attempted to be broken open—the ironwork in front was turned on one side, and forced very much—one of the drawers of the desk was lying on the desk—the other drawer was open—I missed my silver watch from my desk, and some silver money, I do not know how much—the prisoner did not come to work on Monday morning—we examined the back warehouse, to see if any party was concealed, but found no one—a person could have been concealed there made parts—there were a vast number of goods—an attempt had been made to break out of the place—the carpenter's shop was broken open, and an attempt made to break out—the ironwork had been taken off, but there was woodwork to be cut away after that—that had been done from within, not from without—I saw a dog there, belonging to the prisoner's father, on the Saturday evening—I drove it out of the front warehouse a few minutes before I left.</p>

I employed the prisoner as charwoman for some weeks—on 13th March I missed from the sideboard in my parlour a silver watch and guard, which I left there in the morning when the prisoner was there—she was gone when I missed them—she came to work next day—I missed some sheets, shirts, and handkerchiefs from my drawers—I have seen them since, in the pownbroker's possession—the prisoner gave the policeman some duplicates in my presence—I never employed her to pawn anything for me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-segeant, F</hi> 14.) On Friday evening, 10th March, I was sent for to Mr. Rees, 18, Great Russell-street—James Hastings was given into my charge—I received this pareel, and between nine and ten in the evening I went to Rabecca Hastings, I, Wellington-place, Albany-road, Camberwell—I saw her, and asked her if she had a son living in service in Russell-street, Covent Garden—she said yes—I asked if he had a bedroom it that house—she said yes, and his brother was sleeping there—I said I wanted to see his boxes—she said he had no boxes, but some drawers, and she would rather I would come next morning—she took me to a back room at the top of house, and showed me some drawers—they were lacked—I asked her for the keys—she fetched them from another room, gave me them, and said, "What is it all about?"—I said I was a police-officer, and her son was in custody for robbing his master—I opened the drawers with the keys, and found 9 scarfs, 19 handkerchiefs, and 5 lengths of cloth, some folded up, and some as if they had been used—this toilet-cover was on the table, this length of carpet was standing in a corner, and this piece of baize was near the window—there was a cupboard in the room, which was Jocked—I asked Rebecca Hastings what was in it—she said, some old things—I broke it open and found a paper parcel containing these 6 lengths of new cloth, about 52 yards, and a basket containing pieces of linen and dirty things—I found in a box on the drawers a gold watch and chain, a duplicate of a silver watch, and a piece of cloth, pawned in the Borough—on a landing on the same floor I found several boxes; the first was locked—this is it, her daughter brought me the key—I found in it 9 lengths of cloth, 2 of velvet, and I of silk serge, all new—I saw a second box—Rebecca Hastings said, "That is my lines chest"—I asked for the key; she gave is me—I found in it a piece of merino, 2 pieces of cotton print, 40 yards of cotton in pieces, and some sheets and table linen that had been in use—I proceeded to the front room on the same floor, which I believe was her bedroom—I found a chest of drawers there—I asked for the keys; she gave them to me—some of them were locked—while I was opening, them I looked across the room and saw her coming from another chest of drawers with a small box in her hand—I went round the bed towards her—she put her hand behind her and dropped the box on the floor—I took it up—it contained these 10 pairs of new gloves—I found in the drawers 4 lengths of cloth, 2 toilet covers, 2 pieces of window muslin, 1 length of cotton print, 6 yards of serge, and a length of velvet, and in another set of drawers, 2 pairs of women's shoes—some kid gloves which have been worn were about the room; while I was searching the room she said, "My son brought them home, and I always understood he paid for them"—they were all tied up then—Mr. Rees was waiting.</p>

On Tuesday, 14th March, I was at breakfast in my parlour, about eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner take some thing off the soap-box, under a bottle of blacking, lift up his apron, and put it into his pocket—I was sitting in my parlour that evening, the prisoner was on one side the counter, and Tweed on the other—I had told the pri<lb/>soner not to go behind the counter, Tweed had no right to go to the till—I saw him beckoning with his hand and head to Tweed—I went in and found Tweed's hand in the till—I spoke to him, and then said to the prisoner, "You are a bad fellow, you are at bottom of all this; rake your wages and go about your buisiness"—he came afterwards for a character—I said it would require consideration, and afterwards gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> I am a share-jobber, and live at 18, Walcot-square, Kennington—this bill for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was drawn by me on 7th March, and handed to a Mr. Poulton, to get the acceptance of Messrs, Livermore and Trainer—he introduced the prisoner to me that same day—I said to him, "Are you acquainted with Messrs. Livermore and Trainer?"—he said, "I am acquainted with the foreman, and I can get the acceptance done through him; the business is done through him"—he made an appointment to bring it back again about four o'clock that day—the bill was then merely drawn, not accepted or endorsed—the prisoner said I was to give him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as a commission to the foreman, and I gave it him—he took the bill away with him—I saw him again in the after-part of the day, and he said the foreman was no in the way—he came again the next day, and said the parties were not in town—he said, at that time, the foreman was waiting close by—he made an appoint<lb/>ment for the Thursday—he came about twelve, and said that the foreman was waiting in the City, that he was going to obtain the acceptance, and would be back as soon as he could—he came back, and said he had handed the bill to Poulton, and I received it from Poulton—it then had this acceptance on it—I was not present when Poulton received the bill from the prisoner—I handed it over to Captain Yardley, to whom I had given a copy of it a week before—the prisoner was present at the time I received the bill from Poulton, at least he was afterwards—it was in this way: he came and told me he had handed the bill to Poulton, and that Poulton was outside, waiting for me—I went out and Poulton handed me the bill, and then the prisoner came up—I said, "Is this the acceptance of Messrs. Livermore and Trainer?"—he said it was—he told me they carried on business in Tottenham-court-road—(I should explain, that before the bill was drawn Poulton gave me their names and address)—to the best of my recollection, Poulton asked the prisoner if that was their correct address—that was on the first day—I never saw the foreman.</p>

Livermore and Trainer—he said he could satisfy me and Mr. Livermore of whom he received the bill—at the station he said a person named Marcus, living in Eden-street, Hampstead-road, had given him the bill, and told him it was the genuine acceptance of Messrs.

I went in the direction of the cries, and met the prisoner—I asked him if he heard the cry of "Police!"—he said he had in Angel-alley—I then passed him, left him standing, and went towards the place—I met Haines and two other constables coming towards me—Haines' nose was bleeding—he said he had been hurt—I went with him to Lower Gedge-street, and there saw the prisoner, another man, and two females, standing on the opposite side of the street—when the prisoner saw us, he and the other man crossed the street, went into a house, and shut the door—I immediately ran to the door and heard them scrambling up stairs—I burst the door open and found the prisoner in a first floor room, just taking off his coat—I asked Haines if he was the man—he said he was not sure—there was no light in the room—I turned my light on his face, and Haines said immediately, "He is the man"—the prisoner said nothing—I gave him in charge to another constable—I told the prisoner he was charged with being concerned with two others in knocking Haines down and robbing him—he said he had not, as he had just turned out of bed, (pointing to another man who was in bed with his waistcoat, trowsers, and boots on)—I found on the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a handkerchief; not the prosecutor's.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Farnham Royal, near Slough Bucks. I know the prisoner—I first employed him to negociate bills for me, I think, in 1843—after having employed him for some time my affairs were put in the bands of Messrs. Gray and Berry, my father's solicitors—that is rather better than two years ago—I have employed the prisoner on one occasion since that—I never gave him authority to sign my name to paper—(<hi rend="italic">three bills were here produced by Mr. Martin</hi>)—this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, dated Oct.26, 1847, purports to be drawn by me—the signature is not mine—I was not employing the prisoner at that time—I did not give him any authority to sign my name to it—I have not derived any benefit whatever from it—I did not endorse this bill for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 1st Oct., 1847—I was not em<lb/>ploying the prisoner then—I did not authorise him or any one else to endorse it—I know nothing whatever about it—the acceptance to this bill for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated Oct. 13, is not mine—I gave the prisoner no authority to accept that bill—I believed I had not been in communication with him, on the subject of bills, about that time—from having been sued on one or more of these bills I obtained the means of examining them—On 16th Feb, last I was at the Rainbow tavern; that was on the day I inspected the bills, after consulting my solicitors on the subject—I think I examined the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on that day—I had seen it before—Mr. Butler, the holder, had come down to my house with them, and showed them to me, on 7th Jan., I think—that was first knowledge I had that these bills were out against me—the prisoner came into the Rainbow after I was there—I called him over, and said I had a very serious charge against him for forgery—Mr. Gray was with me—the prisoner said, "I confess to it all"—Mr. Gray said to him that he did not wish to take an undue advantage of him, as he had no professional adviser—the pri<lb/>soner knew Mr. Gray—he said he confessed to it all; that the two bills for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were forgeries; that the bill for 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was my genuine acceptance, but he had altered the date of the year from 1845 to 1847—the 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not produced at that time.</p>

Gray, who are also my father's solicitors—that settlement related to the bills that the prisoner had got discounted for me at various times—there are memorandums of the bills produced in Court—I did not keep what is termed a bill-book; I kept a memorandum book—I cannot tell how many bills the prisoner got discounted for me from 1843 to 1846—there were not as many as a thousand or fifteen hundred—I have no idea how many—sometimes I did not get a bill discounted once in a month—the amount my father paid for me in 1846 and 1847 was, I suppose between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that does not include all the prisoner's transactions—there is only one of his unsettled now—there was an annuity paid off, which was included in that—I have not accepted as many as twenty bills at a time, and sent them up to the prisoner—there may have been as many as three or four, but I think not more—perhaps that has not happened once in a month, and it may have been once a week—I cannot tell whether the prisoner had means of his own for discounting bills—I know that he got the bills discounted elsewhere—I paid him for the discount whenever there was an account—he never kept a correct account, and I cannot say that I did, there was so much put down, perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I presume he used to have that for his trouble—I dare say you have an account—there were no stated payments to him—I did not order wine through him—I did on one occasion; it was an acceptance of a party who became bankrupt, and he agreed to pay half in wine and half on an acceptance—I never got the accept<lb/>ance, and the wine was very bad—I do not know that I employed the pri<lb/>soner to transact any other business for me in London—I never saw Mr. Carruthers—the wine came from him—I know Mr. Wells, a wine-merchant—I believe I had two dozen of wine from him, through the prisoner, not twelve dozen—I do not think the prisoner ever hired a servant for me—I am not fond of the sports of the field—the prisoner purchased a fowling-piece out of the monies he had in hand—I did not order him to buy it for me—I never had it—I was never in the habit of using a gun for sports—I have not frequently sent blank acceptances to the prisoner—the month and year were always included, and my signature and the amount—the actual day was not always put in—I was not generally in the habit of leaving it to the prisoner—there may have been one or two such instances, never five or six at one time—I was not in the habit of sending the prisoner post-dated checks to cash for me, that I am aware of—I do not think I ever did that—I will not aware it, but to the beat of my recollection I did not—the check-book will show, it is here—I do not know that the prisoner obtained money from Mr. Wells on my account on checks—I have paid the prisoner checks to take up bills—I believe those checks were not dated—I will not positively swear it—I think I have not frequently drawn checks on my bankers, and sent them up to the prisoner, when I was not in funds at the bankers, to meet them—my bankers' book is in Court—I do not remember without that—I do not know that I have done so—my father did not have the bills that were given up—they were given into the hands of Messrs.

By "a list for May," I meant a list of bills due in May—I do not know what has become of that 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it may be in the prisoner's possession, for he did not return me the bills regularly, I have produced all his papers that I have—from 1843 to 1846, while these bill transactions were going on—I was very anxious to keep the matter from my father—he has expressed displea<lb/>sure at my conduct, and I was afraid of his anger—he now known that I have since been attempting to discount bills with the prisoner—I was once a candidate for the auditorship of a union—I was not successful—I had arranged with the prisoner, that if I succeeded, he was to transact all the accounts for me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a number of letters</hi>)—these are my writing, except one—I did not enclose that to the prisoner—I never saw it before—(<hi rend="italic">These letters, twenty-eight in number, at dates from Jan</hi>, 1844 <hi rend="italic">to March</hi> 1846, <hi rend="italic">were here read; they disclosed, on the part of Mr. Hall, a great variety of bill transac<lb/>tions with different parties, requesting the prisoner to transmit him bills for acceptance, pressing him to settle with the holders of some over due, and to remit him money, of the want of which he frequently complains.</hi>)—The pri<lb/>soner was to satisfy the demands made upon him, by getting the bills dis<lb/>counted—I used sometimes, perhaps, to send him a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had always a balance in hand—he has the accounts—I did not keep accounts in two or three instances—I sent them to him, and was to have had them back, but never could get them; and that threw me all behind—these letters are mine—(<hi rend="italic">These were dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st June</hi>, 1847; 20<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">rd and</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th Sept.</hi>, 16<hi rend="italic">th Nov., and</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th Oct.; in the first, the witness requests the prisoner to get money from their old friends the usurers, &amp;c.; and in the last, presses him to render the ac<lb/>count so long promised.</hi>)—This letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">dated July</hi> 9, 1845, <hi rend="italic">return<lb/>ing three bills of</hi> 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 115<hi rend="italic">l. and</hi>, 120<hi rend="italic">l., accepted, and requesting an account of the same</hi>)—my father has expressed to me the strongest disapprobation of my again discounting bills after the settlement of 1846—I bank at the Union Bank—I do not know that it is their custom to balance their customers ac<lb/>counts daily—mine was balanced twice a year—the prisoner has mentioned to me that he obtained the use of other persons' names to my bills—I have seen those names on the bills when they have been returned—several of them were perfect strangers to me—I believe he told me that my bills were so <hi rend="italic">stale</hi> in the market, that it was necessary to freshen them up a bit with new names; and I believe that was the fact—I occasionally came to town to see the prisoner—I was not in the habit of meeting him in out-of-the-way places for fear of my creditors—I think only in one instance—I generally met him at Mr. Flint's, where he was employed—he left there somewhere about Aug., 1846.</p>

                  </hi> I am a member of the firm of Gray and Berry, soli<lb/>citors. I was employed by Mr. Hall and his son to settle some bills due by the son—I paid several bills for him—a very few were paid personally by me, they were paid by our firm—on 16th Feb. I went to Mr. Abrahams' office to inspect the bills, and afterwards went to the Rainbow tavern to lunch—the prisoner came in, Mr. Hall beckoned him to come across to the box were we were, and said, "Mayhew, I have a serious charge against you"—Mayhew said he would confess all—Mr. Hall said, "Do you know I have had two actions brought against me," or "I have been sued in two actions, one by Fisher, and another by Smith"—the prisoner then said, "I confess your names were forges to Fisher's bills, but your signature to Mr. Smith's bill is a genuine signature, but I altered the date from 1845 to 1847"—Mr. Hall then produced a paper which I had given him, being an account extracted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184804030105"/>
               <p>from the declarations in the action commenced against him by Miss Fisher, on two bills of exchange, and Mr. Hall said, "Tringham's and Lacom's accep<lb/>tances"—the prisoner said, "I forged them"—Mr. Hall asked if there were any other forgeries—Mayhew said there were not—Hall then said, "But Gingell holds some bills of mine which are forgeries"—he said he had seen Gingell, and Mr. Hall would not be troubled on bills that Gingell had—Mr. Hall asked if be would give an account in writing of the bills he had forged, and took out his pocket-book—the priosner seened disposed to give an ac<lb/>count, and I said, "Mr. Mayhew, you know I am Mr. Hall's solicitor, and I do not wish to take an undue advantage of anything you may do," that was as the pencil and paper were produced—Mayhew said he had done Mr. Hall a great injury, and he supposed a policeman would be sent for, or that he would be given in charge, and requested that his wife might be informed—they went into a private room, and I went to consult the Counsel for the prosecutor—on my return he was given into custody by Mr. Hall.</p>

                  </hi> About half-past eight o'clock at night on 20th March, I was sitting with Mr. Wood—Conway came in with a bundle, in a check bag—I believe Perry was at the door, I did not see him—Wood desired Conway to take the bundle out immediately—I listened, and heard him offer a boy at the door a shilling to carry it for him, I could not hear in what direction—they went away—Perry came in about ten o'clock by himself—he said he wished to speak to me, he produced two handkerchiefs, and asked if I knew where he could dispose of them—I said no—he remained some time, and went a away—a little after ten, Conway came in, and said there was something up, and they must not sleep there that night—I asked Perry what he had done with the bundle—he said Conway sold the things for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had half the money—he said they were a lot of shirts and collars, beautiful things, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there were pink stripe shirts.</p>

On 21st March I was on duty at Holloway, about a quarter-past one o'clock in the night—a number of people were assembled outside the Cock public-house, singing, hallooing, swearing, and making a great disturbance—I said, "I hope you will go quietly to your homes"—they said, "You b----r, what do you mean?"—they got round me and knocked me down—both the prisoners were there on the kerb, but it was not by them—I was knocked down again, and then a third time by Empy—there was no other constable there—my face was cut with a fist, I belive, and nearly covered with blood—the third time some one said, "Kick the b----r"—they kicked me, and ran away—a good many kicked me—there were twenty or thirty assembled—after they ran off I sprung my rattle, and they all turned round on me, up a lane leading from Holloway-road to Horn<lb/>sey-road—I went after them—they said, "You b----r, go back, or else I will murder you"—the prisoners were there then—they all turned back, came into Holloway-road again, and went towards London—I followed, met two con<lb/>stables, and gave two or three in charge who had assaulted me first—the pri<lb/>soners cried out, "A rescue!" and began throwing stones—one struck me on the left temple, and I fell, bleeding—they rescued the men, and they began throwing stones as bad as the others—I got up and saw one of the N division on his back, and men jumping on him, kicking him, and crying, "Murder the b----r, slaughter the b----r, and we will soon do for the other"—I went up as quick as I could—one of them, who had got his truncheon from him, struck me on the left temple, knocked me down, kicked me, and said, "Murder the b----r"—I was insensible some time—I after<lb/>wards followed the [arty into Brand-street—the prisoners went into two different houses there—we broke in, and took Pickett behind the street-door—I saw the prisoners in the mob the whole time till we got to Brand-street.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at Highgate. On 21st March, between two and three o'clock in the morning, the officer Pickett was brought to me—he had two wounds on the head and a cut on the eyelid, about an inch and a half long, nearly through the lid, which I think was from a stone—the would in the temple was am inch and a half long, it was through the skin to the bone--there is nothing beneath the skin there—I should say it was caused by the blow of a stick—it was very much contused and cut—he was confined to his bed two days—it was a Fortnight before he could do duty, as he could not wear his hat—the wounds were not dangerous—the stone need not have been thrown with force—a slight blow would split the integument there.</p>

                  </hi> I am an attorney's clerk, and live at 4, Primroac-street, Bishopsgate—I was acquainted with Mrs. Rachael Folks, who is since dead—she lived with the prisoner Marks, who occupied a house, No. 16, Barker-street, Houndsditch. On 14th of last Oct. I accompanied Mrs. Folks to Messrs. Currie's, the bankers, in Cornbill, and there saw her receive a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and some cash, for a check for 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have a memorandum of the numbers of the notes, which I took directly after—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were 43649 and 46350, and 18430 to 34—I have no number of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it was changed immediately, at the Bank—at her request I marked, each note at the corner—she went home with me—she sewed the notes up in her pocket with several papers, one of which I remember in particular—it was a paper I had given her back, relating to a matter of business with reference to her son, who had lately died—this is that paper—(<hi rend="italic">produced by Webb</hi>)—it is signed by Marks' late husband, and is an authority to apply for a certain sum of money—I saw Mrs. Folks about nine days before her death—on the morning of 9th Feb. I received information from Marks' servant, in consequence of which I went and found Mrs. Folks perfectly insensible—she remained so till she died—she was about fifty-nine or sixty years old—I asked Mrs. Marks whether she had sent for any medical assistance, and asked how long she had been ill—she said she had been insensible from the middle of the night, and she had not sent for any medical assistance—I sent for Dr. Brown, of St. Mary-Axe, who had attended her before, and also for Louise Jones, who is accustomed to attend persons of the Jewish persuasion—I and Dr. Brown searched the room for property, as much as decency would allow, but found nothing—I did not see Bambard on that ocssion—I expressed my surprise to the female prisoner that no money was found—she said she knew nothing about the old lady's money; she never knew she had any, except when the rent was paid to her; she believed if she had any she must have left it in charge of some person in the Commercial-road; that she came home the other night, having fallen down in the street, and was covered with mud, and she might have been robbed then—I said it was very singular that they should rob her of pocket and all, and every farthing—she said she did not know anything about it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184804030118"/>
               <p>and did not care anything about it; she was engaged to be marred, and she would soon be out of that—I called next day, and found Mrs. Folks still insensible, and on the 11th—she died about eleven o'clock on the night of the 12th—there was no investigation as to the cause of her death—I went to the house again on 26th Feb., found the two prisoners there, and said to Barn<lb/>hard hard it was a very serious thing about the old lady's money; a very unpleasant affair—he said he did not care about it, what was that to him? and many expressions of that kind; and at last he said he wished he could find any one that would say he ever had anything to do with the old lady's money, and if he was worth powder and shot he would bring an action against them.</p>

                  </hi> I was manager at Downe's Wharf. The prisoner accounted to me for sums of money about received—to the best of my recollection he commended bringing to me money about the first week in July—my orders to him were to bring to me every Monday all the money he received—he had a little red memorandum book in which I entered the account whenever he brought it me—this is the book—the first payment he made was on 12th July—he certainly did not at that time pay 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received from Mr. M'Neil—he paid 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but did not say from whom it was received—he paid me money every week, and at the end of the month when he carried his book to Mr. Jennings to settle, he shewed my voucher for all he had paid me, that was his voucher for it—this book contains all the sums he paid me—previous to 12th July Mr. Jennings said something to me, and in consequence of his not paying up all that he owed, I told him he should pay it to me—on 3rd or 4th July Mr. Jennings said something to me, and in consequence of that I received the money myself—I called the prisoner to me and he said the reason he was short was he had lent money to some persons on the wharf—I said, "You have no right to lend money to any body, you shall pay it to me, and say to any one who wants to borrow money that it is my orders that you lend money to nobody"—it was the prisoner's duty to pay to me everything be had received from 1st July—supposing on 6th July he received 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was his duty to pay that to me on 12th—he did not pay it—he paid 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this book (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is the prisoner's writing—on 6th July here is entered as being received the money for seven packages, and some other things of small amounts, but there is no entry of the 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>,—that money was never paid over to me—I left the concern on 31st Aug.</p>

                  </hi> I am pork butcher, at Woolwich. On the afternoon of 8th March, I was in the room adjoining my shop—I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner take up one piece of pork, and lay it down again, and then take up another piece and lay it down again—she then took up a third piece, which was lighter than the others, folded it up, and put it under her cloak—I immediately came out, and asked what she had—she turned round, and said she had nothing of mine—I opened her basket, took the pork from under her cloak, and gave her in charge—she appeared sober—I had seen her several times before—there was no one in the shop at the time—I did not give her time to go out—she had got about two yards from the counter.</p>

                  </hi> I am a beer-seller at Wandsworth.

                  </hi> I am a silversmith and pawnbroker, in southampton-street, in the parish of Camberwell—it is my dwelling-house—I have two houses, which are adjoining—there is an internal communication from one to the other—I re<lb/>side in one with my family—the other is my shop, and some of my servants sleep there. On Monday, 13th March, a little after twelve o'clock, I was in my private house—in consequence of what had taken place in the neighbourhood, I had fastened up the doors and shutters of my shop and private house—the shutters were fastened with iron bars—at about twenty minutes after twelve I heard a noise of a mob coming down the street—I left the shop all secured and bolted, and I went to the window of the dwelling-house—I was standing there with my wife, and the first thing I heard was the breaking of the fan<lb/>light over the shop door—as they went past, I heard several say, "Let us make a smash, we will go in here"—I could not identify one of the mob, I was so excited—the mob left the street, to go up Abbot-street, and I went out at the back of my house, to go to the Peckham police-station—I heard something as I was going along—I did not return till the mob had left—I was absent perhaps an hour—when I came back I found the shutters and iron bars of the door broken—they could not force the lock and bolts, but the centre of the door was cut out—several pannels of the shop shutters had been cut out, and the iron hooping had been cut through—the window was all smashed—I went into the shop, and found the inside frames of the window completely chopped to pieces—the window was in a very disordered state, scarcely anything left in it—there had been a good deal of property in the window, as usual, when I shut up the shutters—I missed nearly the whole of the property from the window—it consisted of pencil-cases, thimbles, wedding<lb/>rings, I should think twenty-three or twenty-five watches, jewellery of all description, brooches, and mathematical instruments—rhe drawers under the counter were full of jewellery, plate, rings, and watches, and other things— —those drawers were not entirely cleared, but mostly so—the top drawer had been full where the watches were kept—from 150 to 200 watches had been taken out of the drawer, besides what were taken from the window—the whole of the cash had been taken from the till, amounting to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> and a quantity of clothes were also gone—I should think the amount of my loss was about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was in Southampton-street on Monday, 13th March—I saw the mob come to Mr. Grey's—I saw George Payne attack the door with a railing, and he cried, "Hurrah for Liberty!"—when he cried that, the rest of the mob came up—I struggled out of the crowd—they began to break the door with hammers, and large rails, and other things—when the door had been broken in, I did not ate any persons gong into the shop, but I saw them coming out—I saw Snead come out—he was getting over the pieces of the door that were left at the bottom part, and holding by the blind that was hanging by she side of the door—while the per<lb/>sons were going in and coming out, I saw watches thrown into the street over the heads of the people, as if they were thrown amongst the mob—there was no one else I could identify besides Payne and Snead—Snead had a small paper parcel in his hand, I cannot say what it contained—I should not have noticed him, but he was so much higher than the others.</p>

"They had better <hi rend="italic">mam</hi> us"—the other three left Smith and Williams by the side of the Surrey Canal—I followed Smith and Williams into the Walworth-road, met a policeman, and gave them in charge—I saw boots and shoes taken from them at the Police-court.</p>

On 13th March, between twelve and one o'clock, we had a good many goods outside our shop, and hearing the mob was coming, we removed the whole of them, except one jacket—we got out shutters all up but the last one—we could not get that up—I could not get the bar up—my hus<lb/>band was still in the act of putting up the shutters, when the mob rushed up, and took two pairs of trowsers that were inside the shop—I called my hus<lb/>band—he came in, and double-locked the door—the mob then took down the shutters, and commenced breaking the windows—one of them had a stave of a barrel, one had a piece of a window frame, and one a kind of broom handle—they broke all the glass, and six pieces of the frame—they instantly burst the door open with a very hard instrument—my husband was endeavouring</p>

R and Co." on it—I asked him how he came by them—he said, at first, he did not know, and afterwards, that a man who did jobs left them from time to time—he produced two pairs of stocks, a screw plate, a wrench, and a tap—the Com<lb/>pany had similar articles—here has been a star on this swedge; it is defaced—it is the mark of one of our porters.</p>
