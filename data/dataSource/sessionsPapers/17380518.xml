In the Evening the Man who keeps the Black-Horse Ale-house in the same Street, came and told me the Prisoner was at his House; that he came thither in a Hackney Coach, and had chang'd a Guinea to treat the Coachman and a Soldier who were drinking with him. When he came Home, I sent for Mr. Morris the Constable, who search'd him, and in my Presence took a Guinea out of his Shoe. He did not confess any Thing at this Time; but when he was before Colonel Deveil, he own'd he took the Money out of my Bureau; that he had bought a Gold Watch, which cost him 13 Guineas and a half; that he had spent some of the Money, and the rest was hid with the Gold Watch in a Vacuity between the Bricks, in the Necessary House at the Black-Horse; and according to his Confession, the Gold Watch and 13 Guineas were found there.</p>

            , the Soldier. I live in St. Anns Westminster. On the 7th of this Month, about 7 o'Clock in the Evening, the Prisoner sent for me to drink with him; while I was in his Company he pull'd out a Gold Watch, I told him he had got a very fine Watch. Yes, says he, I thank God. I am in a good Way of living now. When the Reckoning came to be paid, he pull'd out a Guinea, and chang'd it; and the Landlord seeing he had a Charge of Money about him, perswaded him to go Home. All this Time there was a Hackney Coach waiting for him at the Door, and as he had this Charge about him, I went into the Coach with him, and we rode to Westminster-Abbey, where he treated the Coachman and I with another Pot of Beer. He told me, that neither the Money nor the Watch were his own; and I asked him how he could make bold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180003"/> with what was not his own? I hope, says I, all's well; yes, yes, says he, all's well, I know I must make it good again. From Westminster we rode to the Black-Horse in Bow Street, where he treated us again with Beer, and paid the Coachman half a Guinea for his Days Work. After the Coach was gone, he asked me to smoak a Pipe with him, and while I was filling one, Mr. Lane's Servant came in, and I went out of the Prisoner's Company. He had about 12 or 14 Guineas in his Pocket when he paid the Coachman.</p>

            . I have liv'd with my Mistress Bowers 8 Years. She took the Prisoner to be a poor Man, so she let him lie 2 Nights in the House, and gave him Victuals. The 3d Night he came with the Man that was lately hang'd at Guildford; and the Prisoner said he would treat my Mistress with a Supper for her great Civility to him. After Supper he sent me out to buy him some Tobacco, and I was returning into the House, I heard the Pistol go off; I ran into the House, and saw the Box full of Smoak. Lord! says I, what's the Matter! Lord! says my Mistress, the Rogue has kill'd me. He threw his Arms about her Neck and would not let her come out of the Box, so I call'd him Rogue, and attempted to run up Stairs, but he then left my Mistress, and caught hold of me; he d - mn'd my Eyes, and said, if I spoke a Word he would kill me. However I got from him, and went out to call the Watch; the Flower-box was then standing upon the Table, but when I came back, the Prisoner was gone and that too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I pull out half a Guinea to pay the Reckoning?</p>
               <p>Bowers. Yes.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Symonds. The Prisoner took out half a Guinea at the white Table, and desir'd Mrs. Bowers to change it; immediately I heard the Pistol go off, and saw the Smother, and she cry'd out, he had kill'd her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her whether she saw any Pistol, either upon me or my Comrade?</p>
               <p>Symonds. No, but I saw the Hole in her Gown Sleeve, and the Blood running about. Some Time after, - but not that Night, she said he had stole her Drudging box.</p>

I informed them what I gave for it; Oh! 'tis a sweet pretty Thing they said, - pray which Way are you walking? I told them I was going to look after a Place; they said I should have the Refusal of two or three very good Places, and if I would tell them where I liv'd, they certainly would come and give me Directions about them.

I have but little Money, says I, and I don't Care to bundle up my Cloaths, that can relate nothing to my Fortune, - that's quite silly, and if any body should hear this Business besides our selves, they would laugh at us. Well, they argued with me a great while, and said it must be done, and began to be angry because I would not do it. Why, - says one of them, suppose you were Sick, and a Physician comes and prescribes Physick for you, - if you won't take it, what Good can he do you? 'Tis all the same Thing, we can't pretend to do you any Good, unless you'il do as you are ordered. At last I bundled up all my Cloaths, and they went away, but they returned again, and asked me if I had done as they bad me? I said I had, and that I had put them in my Trunk. Then now, says the Prisoner's Mistress, - with the Blessing of God take them out of your Trunk; I did so: Now, says she, with the Blessing of God, get a Ha'p'orth of Brown Paper. I did not care to go for the Paper, so she went herself, and did up all my Cloaths, telling me they must be done up very close, and not a Breath of Air must come upon them. When this was done they bid me down upon my Knees and say the Lord's Prayer; I refused at first, but by fair Means and foul they made me at last say the Lord s Prayer. Then they bid me turn about and open the Windows, which we had shut, for fear any body should see what we were about. I opened the Windows, and in the mean Time they chang'd the Bundle, and left this in the Room of it, - 'tis full of nothing but Hay and Straw; my Bundle was made up exactly like this Bundle, and they carry'd it quite off. After they had put down this Bundle instead of mine, the Prisoner's Mistress said she must treat with me upon such a Spot of Ground, and bid me, - because it rain'd, - put on my Hat, least I should catch Cold. I went out with them as far as the Royal Bed, the Corner of Holborn, there they told me a young Man was to meet me, and would give me a Gold Ring, charging me not to look at my Bundle 'till Eight o'Clock at Night; at Eight o'Clock I found myself a great Sufferer by them, for all my Cloaths were gone, that I had worked for a great while.</p>
               <p>Some little Time after I got a Place at the Corner of Shoe Lane in Holborn, and about a Fortnight after I had been there, I saw the Prisoner go by the Door; I was so fluster'd, that I had no Power to get off my Chair, but by and by I saw her come past again; then I ran after her and begged a young Man to stop her, for she had robbed me. He call'd after her, Hark ye! Hark ye! - and stopped her. She was brought back to my Master's House, from thence she was carried to Guildhall, and so sent to Newgwate.</p>

From thence I went to Guildhall Coffee-House to meet my Attorney, who told me the Trial was put off, to the Week following; but Mr. Serjeant Hussey going by, Mr. Eustick, my Attorney presented me to the Serjeant, who told me, he hop'd it would be no Inconvenience to me, that the Trial was put off. Mr. Serjeant Hussey, desired Mr. Eustick to go into Court, and inform Mr. Serjeant Eyres that the Cause was put off. He went; and when he came back to us, he told us, the Cause was brought on, and the Jury were sworn. Upon this I went into Court; and before I went up to the Bar, I waited a while, in Expectation that my Servant would come, and I intended to have delivered him my Pocket-Book; but Mr. Eustick pressing me to come within the Bar before my Man came, I took it out of my Waistcoat Pocket, and thrust it down (square) into my Breeches Pocket, and button'd it in. Then I attempted to get thro' the Crowd, but I met with some Interruption. A lusty Man seem'd to jostle me, and something, - that lay upon the Ground, rubb'd against my Shins. I thought it had been a Dog, but I now believe it was a Man, upon his Hands and Knees. I got up to the Bar, and in five or six Minutes Time, the Trial was interrupted for want of Mr. Cantillon; I ran to call him; ('tis hardly a quarter of a Mile from the Hall to his House) and in coming back, I remember'd my Pocket-Book, and intended to have left it, at the Upper-End of Basinghall-Street; I felt for it, but there I found, that one of the Buttons of my Pocket was cut, or twisted off; the other unbutton'd, and the Pocket Book was gone. I immediately ran to the Bank to stop Payment; the Note (in Question at present) was for 500 l mark'd H. No 229. I had taken a Memorandum of the Notes, upon a bit of Paper, and this 500 l Note was payable to Nat. Bracey; who sign'd it, I cannot remember; but the Date was June 2d I walk pretty fast, and I am sure I miss'd it within a quarter of an Hour after I had button'd it up in my Pocket. I went no farther than from the Hall to Bartholomew-Lane End.</p>
               <p> Sampson Solomon. I have known the Prisoner about 7 Weeks, and no longer. About 7 Weeks <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180006"/> ago, he gave me the Wink upon Change to follow him; I went after him into the Passage that goes out of Swithings-Alley into the other Alley. There he told me he had a Bank-Note of 500 l. to dispose off, and said I should speak to some of the Tip-top of our Nation, who had Dealings Abroad, and should tell him if any of them would buy that Note. I said, I don't doubt but I will help you to a Chap to dispose of it Abroad; when shall I see you again? Either To-morrow or next Days says he. He mentioned no Price this first Time of our Meeting.</p>
               <p>The next Day he met me according to Agreement, and we went to the Black-Swan Tavern in Bartholomew- Lane, where he asked me if I had got him a Chap? I told him, I had got him a Chap, (I believed) who would buy his 500 l. Bank Note, but (says I) they are People who are acquainted with the Nature of Advertisements, and they supposed there were more Notes lost with this at the same Time; I told him likewise, that the Gentleman who was to buy this Note, was desirous of knowing the Number of the Note. I had not spoke to any one about buying this Note, but I thought proper to tell him this, that I might get out of him the Mark and Number of it. Why, says he, I have not the Note about me now, but in a Day or two I will shew it you, and you may give your Friend an Account of it. At the Day appointed we met at the Black-Swan Tavern, and there he shewed me the real Note; I took Notice of the Number, No. 229. for 500 l. and asked him what he must have for it? The first Price he set was 300 l. Why, says I, this Note must go Abroad, and there must be prov'd - Value received; and all that meddle with it must get by it. Well, says he, I will take no less than 250 l. for it. And what must I have out of this, says I? You shall have 20 Guineas your self; so he was to have 229 l. for the 500 l. Note. I made no Words with him, because I never designed to get any Money this Way, else I believe I could have made him promise me 30 Pieces, but I did not design to deal with him all; I only intended to make what Discovery I could. When I had got the Number out of him, and had seen the Note, I was willing to take Time, so I told him, my Friend was gone to Bristol, and nothing could be done that Week; this was on the Monday, and I told him he would not be in Town till next Monday, because in that Time I thought I might find out who had advertised the Note; and I immediately told

             of the Affair. (I forgot to tell the Court that I had asked the Prisoner how long the Note had been in his Possession, and he told me ever since June last,) I bid Polock find out the Person that had lost the Note, and let me know who it was. Mr. Polock found the Advertisement, and told me that Mr. Weston the Banker, and Mr. Fitzgerald in Basing-hall street wanted to speak with me. I went to Mr. Weston, and told him all that I have related here. This was on the Monday; Mr. Weston desired me to get the Note, and take the Man; so I went the next Day to Change, and the Prisoner being there, I shew'd Polock that was the Man who had the Note, and I order'd him to walk on the other Side the Change. Then I gave the Prisoner the Wink, and he follow'd me into the Passage that goes into Will's Coffee-House; I told him the Man was come to Town now; he said he was then going down to Gravesend, but he would meet me on Thursday. He did so, and we went again to the Black-Swan, he asked me if I could get him the Money that Afternoon? I told him it was not the Time appointed for the Payment of the Money, and the Gentleman was gone out to take a Ride; but however, his Time (I said) should be my Time. Upon this, he appointed the next Day, (Friday) for me to bring the Money, and he was to come with the Note upon Change about 10 o'Clock, because (he said) there would not be many People there, and he assur'd me he should have the Note in his Pocket. I had no sooner parted with him, but I went to Mr. Weston and told him I was to meet the Prisoner the next Day (Friday) to have the Note from him upon Change; and that Day he was taken. At this last Meeting, (Thursday) I began to be afraid he should suspect me, so I told him, if he car'd to go with me to the Union Coffee-House, he might (I believ'd) have the Money. No, says he, we'll refer it till To-morrow, there is so great a Reward upon it, that the Gentleman perhaps may Napp me. I ask'd him, why he did not go and take this Reward. Ask me no Questions, says he, if you can get me a Chap do; if it won't do for you, 'twill do for some Body else.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was you present when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Solomon. He was taken before I came upon Change. Mr. Polock, to whom I had shewn him, was there, and the Gentleman when they came, being assured by Polock of the Man, they seiz'd him. I was in the Room when he was search'd, and he deny'd that he had ever seen me before. Why, says I, we were together but Yesterday at the Black-Swan, I will not put it upon the Drawer to remember a Thing done many Days ago, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180007"/> he can't have forgot that we had Half a Pint of Sherry, Yesterday. Upon this Mr. Fitzgerald and I went to the Black-Swan, and he asked the Drawer if he should know the Man that came with me Yesterday? Yes, he said, and when he was brought to the Prisoner, he knew him immediately I was at Guildhall when the Note was taken out of his Book, and the Alderman shewed it me, and I said, that was the Note the Prisoner shewed me before, as sure as there was a God in Heaven. 'Twas No. 229. for Five Hundred Pounds.</p>

There was a good deal of Difficulty in finding it, but at last Mr. Robinson found it artfully enclosed in this Paper, in this Manner. I saw it taken out of the Pocket Book, and there were likewise some small Spring Saws taken out of his Comb-Case, which the Constable has now in Court.</p>
               <p>Solomon. This is the same Note which the Prisoner shewed me at the Black Swan.</p>

               <p>Counc. Prof. I think you said you ask'd the Prisoner how long the Note had been in his Possession.</p>
               <p>Solomon. Yes, and he said ever since June last. I told him it was not fairly got. No matter for that, says he. I said, you may open the Case to me, I won't betray you. Why then, says he, it was bit in Guildhall, without mentioning by whom. I declare nothing but the Truth, as God Almighty loves the Truth, and I am upon my Oath.</p>

            . On Friday before the Prisoner was taken Mr. Solomon informed me he was offered a Bank Note of 500 l. No. 299. I went to the Coffee House and searched the Papers, in one of which I found it advertis'd. I informed Mr. Weston of the Discovery the Prisoner had made to Mr. Solomon; and on the Tuesday following Solomon shew'd me the Prisoner upon 'Change. After this he informed me that he had promised to pay him the Money for the Note on Friday Morning. I acquainted Mr. Weston and Frizgerald of this Agreement, who ordered me proper Assistants upon 'Change, where I shewed them the Prisoner, and would have had them have staid for Mr. Solomon's coming before they took him, but when they saw him walking off, they would not stay for Solomon, (as I was positive to the Man) but followed him into the Passage that goes to Will's Coffee-House, where they took him, and carried him to the Crown-Tavern; then they sent for Mr. Weston and Fitzgerald, and the Prisoner was searched, but no Note was found; however, they carried him to Guildhall, where the Pocket-Book was produc'd, and the Note found in it, before Alderman Westley.</p>

            . I had Information from Mr Polock, that this Bank Note had been offered to Mr. Solomon for Sale; I told him it was the Property of a Friend of mine at Falmouth, and desired him to do all he could to get it; he brought Sampson Solomon to me, and I asked him why he did not. seize the Man, when he must needs have apprehended that he had stole it. Lord! says he, what could I do against so great a Man! He is as big as Goliah, and as strong as my Namesake. I asked him if he could procure the Note? No, says he, he is too crafty a Chap. I told him I would assist him, if he would let me have a Sight of the Man, and he promis'd I should; he has come two or three Times a Day to tell me what he had done, and the Day before the Prisoner was taken, he was with me twice, and told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180008"/> he had appointed him to bring the Note the next Morning (the last of April) to him upon 'Change, in order to his paying him the Money for it. The next Morning (Friday) Polock came to me in a great Hurry, and told me (about nine o'Clock) I must come away that Minute, for the Man was then upon the Exchange. I desired him to stay till I put my Shoes on; then I went with him, and having planted some of my Servants, I asked Polock if he was sure the Prisoner was the Man? He said he was sure; upon whidh I was resolv'd to take him if he should attempt to go off, though Sampson was not yet come. We watched the Space of Half an Hour, and then the Prisoner went off the Exchange; we followed him, and in the Passage going to Will's Coffee-House, we took him; I squeez'd him hard by the Wrist, therefore he begged I would not use him roughly, and that he might be carried into a House. We carried him to the Crown Tavern, and gave Charge of him to two Constables; then I ordered my Servants, one on each Side to search the Prisoner's Hands. He behaved civilly, but we were determined to search him, and Mr. Fitzgerald went to enquire whether we could answer so doing. Upon his Return I bid Lawrence search him; he (the Prisoner) put one Hand into his Pocket, and threw out a Comb-Case, my Man took it up and looked at it; I asked him if he had not a Pocket Book? He told me he had; but my Man, eager in searching, pulled it out himself; I opened it, and the first Thing I cast my Eye upon was a Note of 45 l. this, says I, is not what I want; I saw a Piece of Brownish Paper fastened in, but I did not think the Note could have been concealed there, so I laid it down, and the Prisoner took it again and put it into his Pocket. My Man then took up the Comb-Case, and observing something to shine through a small Crack in it, he gave it a knock, and a small Saw came out, upon this we gave him Leave to break it, and found three more. This made us order the Prisoner to deliver his Pocket Book to the Constable, he took it and tied it up, and put it into his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was you by when the Note was found?</p>
               <p>Mr. Weston. Yes. At Guildhall Mr. Fitzgerald took the Book from the Constable, and delivered to Mr. Robinson, who found this very Note concealed in the Brown Paper.</p>

            , Constable. This Pocket-Book was delivered to me at the Crown Tavern by the Prisoner; I tied it up in the Presence of the Company, and delivered it un-opened to Mr. Fitzgerald at Guildhall, he delivered it to Mr. Robinson, who found the Note in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzgerald confirmed the former Witnesses, and proved the Note produced in Court, was the same which was found at Guildhall in the Pocket Book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. When the Prisoner was examined at Guildhall, Mr. Fitzgerald delivered the Pocket Book to me, and some Account being given of the artful Concealment of the Saws, I imagined it might be proper to search the Pocket Book more carefully; I therefore untied it, and the Prisoner said, if there was any Bank Note in it, it was not put there by him. I searched the Book carefully, and found this Note, folded up in this Manner.</p>

               <p>DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Night before I was taken I came from Gravesend, and got to a Friend's House about One o'Clock; about 7 in the Morning I got up, in order to find out a Man that owed me 45 l. I went upon 'Change between 9 and 10 to wait for him, and sat down upon a Bench; after I had sat some Time, I went out into the Passage to make Water, and they came and seiz'd me, they would not tell me what I was seiz'd for; I said, I hop'd it was not for Murder; no, said they, 'twas for something worse, for we have got a Jew to swear against you. As I use the Holland Trade, I might have put this Note off myself. 'Tis very odd that I should wink at a Jew, - a Stranger, - a Fellow that I never saw in my Life, to consult with upon this Affair. As to the Saws, the Man tool the Comb Case and turned himself to the Window, and then said he had taken them out of the Comb Case.</p>
               <p>Councel. To Mr. Pye. Was this Note ever satisfy'd?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pye. No, it has never been paid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. 'Tis a little odd, that I should offer this Note to a Fellow all in Rags; for as I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180009"/> Dealing over Sea, I had no need to undervalue it. Coin sent out of the Kingdom, I know is seizable, but a Bank Note I could easily have sent abroad. That Man (Lawrence) came to see me in Newgate, and brought me two Pieces of Beef, and a Piece of Bread, and told me he believ'd the Jew was the greatest Rogue of the two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence. I did carry him some Bread and roast Beef, and treated him with a Pot of Beer, because he was very poor; but so far from saying, the Jew was the greatest Rogue, I then told him, that I verily believed he was the Man that pick'd Mr. Pye's Pocket, and he cry'd about it most heartily.</p>
               <p>Humphry Ingram gave an Account that the Prisoner used to live at his House, in Bell Alley, Goswell-Street; that the 21st of April he came thither about one o'Clock in the Morning; that he had known him ten Years, and had an honest Character, as far as he knew.</p>

            . I know the Prisoner very well. The first Time I ever saw this Note was on Thursday the 26th of Jan. last. On that Thursday Morning, Car (who was try'd last Night for this Fact) and I, met according to Appointment in Guildhall. As we were walking on one Side of the Hall, we met the Prisoner and one Sands. After we had talked together for some Time, the Prisoner drew this Note out of his Pocket, and said if you'll undertake to receive this Note, I can draw for Thousands upon others. I said it would be hazardous and dang'rous, and that I did not Care to undertake it. We consulted together about it, and at last it was agreed that Car and I should go to the Chevalier's Billiard Table in Moorfields, and we were to Play. While we were at Play the Prisoner was to come in as a Stranger, and was to challenge Car; they two were to play 'till the Prisoner had lost a certain Sum to Car; then he was to offer Car the Note, and to tell him he might go and receive that Note, and he would pay him what he had lost. The Reason of this Proceeding was, that if Car should be detected when he went with the Note, or should be call'd in Question about it, the Woman who keeps the Billiard Table should be a Witness for him. According to our Agreement, Car and I went that Day to the Billiard Table and play'd: In some little Time, the Prisoner and his Friend Sands follow'd us, and he, (the Prisoner)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180011"/> challenged Car to play; in about an Hour Car won 30 l. of the Prisoner, and then Car demanding the Money he had won of the Prisoner, he threw down this Note, telling him he had not Money enough about him to pay him, but he might take that Note upon Mr. Hoare, and he might go and receive it, and might pay himself. Car told the Prisoner it was Dinner Time; however, if he would go to the Three Tuns in New-Street, Fetter-Lane, and take a Dinner, he would go when he had din'd. Upon this, the Prisoner, I, Car, and Sands, went to the Three Tuns, and called for a Room, and (I think) we had Part of a Fillet of Veal for Dinner: Before we had half din'd, the Prisoner seemed uneasy, upon which Car said, - give me the Note, - I'll go, and Fortune be my Guide.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner gave him the Note, and he immediately went out with it; Sands followed him at a Distance, and if he should be stopped, he was to have come back and given us Intelligence that we might have made off. The Prisoner and I waited for Car's Return some little Time, then I began to be uneasy, so I went down to the Door where I met Car; he was come back, and told us the Business was done, the Note would be paid, only it wanted a little Thing, - called an Endorsement, and when that was done it would be paid. With Persuasion I wrote on the Back of the Note, - Abram Irons. Then Car took the Note and went with it again Sands, followed him at a Distance, I followed Sands and the Prisoner followed me; but before we got near Mr. Hoare's, Car was come out with the Money in his Handkerchief; upon this we went back to the Three Tuns, where Cross (the Prisoner) told Car he had made a Blunder, for he had brought but 74 l. instead of 75. Upon dividing the Money, a Dispute arose whether we should all be equal Sharers, and the Prisoner insisted upon it, that as we were all equally concerned, we should all be equal Sharers.</p>
               <p>Councel. When the Prisoner first produced this Note, did he do it as a real or a forged Note?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. He produced it as a forged Note, and told us he had paid Money in at Mr. Hoare's for Mr. Payne some Time before, but he did not mention the particular Time. Out of the Money received, we had each of us Five Three Pound Twelve Pieces, and some small Money, and the Prisoner had his Share.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire he might be asked how long he has known me?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. I have been acquainted with him about ten Months; but the Time we all met at Guildhall, was in the Morning, Thursday the 26th of January last, as near as I can remember; I believe I may be very positive to that Day.</p>
               <p>Councel. Have you had any Conversation with the Prisoner since the Note was found to be forged?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. Yes; I met him at a Place called Eastham Boathouse, over against Liverpoole, and he told me he flew for fear any Accident should happen; he was afraid of Car (he said) more than of me. He did not know at that Time that he was described in the Advertisements, but I told him (at that Meeting) he was put in the Papers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him why he left London with Car under Disguises.</p>
               <p>Ramsey. Because we were afraid of being taken for this Forgery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not abscond on Account of another Note of 125 l. which they sent to Mr. Hoare's, and the Messenger was detected?</p>
               <p>Ramsey. I was concerned in the 125 l. Note, and Car who carried it was stopped, but I did not forge any of them, nor did I fly immediately; I did not abscond till Advertisements were put in the Papers concerning Mr. Hoare's being defrauded of 212 l.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. I keep the Billiard Table (he mentions) I know both the Prisoner and the Evidence Ramsey; I saw them together at my House some Time in January, but I can't remember the particular Day. Mr. Car was there likewise at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mrs. Smith, whether Car's Sister did not come with her to see me in the Counter? And whether Car's Sister did not point to me and tell her, I was the Person that was to save her Brother?</p>
               <p>Smith. Car's Sister was with me there, and she said, - Mr. Cross, this is the Gentlewoman that is to save my Brother's Life; but I knew the Prisoner before she said this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Cloaths had I on when I was at your Billiard Table?</p>
               <p>Smith. A Blue Grey Coat, and a dark short Whig, to the best of my Remembrance, but I can't remember the Day of the Week, nor the Day of the Month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Atkinson has sworn to Mr. Paine's Hand, and that he knows this was not his Writing. I desire he may be ask'd, how he came to be deceiv'd, and to pay this Note?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180012"/>Mr. Atkinson. I was in a Hurry, and had 8 or 10 People about me, and I don't remember that I compar'd the Hand with Mr. Payne's Name in our Book. I had given a Note for 340 l. to be drawn out, and I thought I might safely pay a Draught of 75 l.</p>

They came in about Eleven o'Clock in the Forenoon, and staid some Time, then they went out and came in again; they seem'd (all of them) to be in a Fluster, and I was afraid of losing the Silver Tankard and the Spoons which they had at the Table; I imagined they intended to steal the Plate, therefore I desired my Mistress to take Care of her Plate, for they went backwards and forwards and seem'd so fluster'd, that I did not like them.

That it appear'd the Note under Consideration was payable in Portugal Money, which is not the current Money of this Kingdom. That the Indictment therefore was defective. And that it ought to have charg'd, - that the Defendant intended and design'd to have defrauded Messieurs Hoare and Company of so many Pieces of Portugal Money, value so much: But the Indictment charges the Defendant plainly, with defrauding Messieurs Hoare and Company of 75 l. which must be understood, 75 l. current Coin; whereas, the Sum of 75 l. could not be paid in Portugal Money; no Pieces of that Coin making exactly that Sum.</p>
               <p>The Councel for the Prosecution observ'd, that it was no Wonder a sinking Man caught hold of every Twig. That the Words of the Statute were, - if any Person should forge a Note, or Order, for Payment of MONEY, or Delivery of Goods, with Intent to defraud, &amp;c. That Money is Money, tho' not the current Money of this Kingdom, and that the Word in the Act, was Money, generally. That it was plain, the Act made it a Crime to forge a Warrant, for the Payment of Money, (generally.) That Portugal Coin, was Money, (and the Value was right in the Indictment,) - therefore, the Indictment charged the Defendant, according to the Act, and the Evidence had sufficiently supported the Indictment. The Councel observ'd further, that it was impossible to have laid it, in any other Manner; for it must have been laid for either Money, or Goods; and that Portugal Money could not be consider'd as Goods, was evident; because no one could say, - Pray pay Goods. Therefore, it must be consider'd as Money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkinson. But I did not pay all the Sum in Portugal Money, there were 4 Shillings in Silver.</p>
               <p>It was farther observ'd, that a former Act calls it foreign Coin; that Coin is Money, not Bullion. That the Cheat was the same if in Portugal Money, or British Money, and that when these Pieces were exported, they were consider'd as Money, or Coin, not as Goods. That there was another Act, which restrain'd People from counterfeiting the foreign Coins, which pass in this Kingdom, in these Words, - viz. Be it enacted, &amp;c. that if any Person shall forge or counterfeit any such Coins, as are not the proper Coins of this Kingdom,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180013"/> but permitted to be current, they shall be judged guilty of High-Treason; and They, their Abettors, Assistants, &amp;c. being convict, shall forfeit, &amp;c. as in Case of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shall call Witnesses to prove, that from the 20th of January, to February, I was out of Town.</p>

            . But I can't be positive to the Day. I think it was about the latter End of January. I went into Wooburn, in Bedfordshire, in January, I think 'twas the latter End of the Month, and he was there very ill, and had a Doctor and a Nurse. I am his Taylor, and work for him.</p>
               <p>Councel. Has the Prisoner paid you any Money since January?</p>
               <p>Davis. Let me see, - yes, he paid me for making a Coat and Breeches, since that Time, - 'twas at Chester he paid me, - I can't remember the Time.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Coin did he pay you in?</p>
               <p>Davis. In Silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. The Prisoner calls me to shew, (I suppose) that on the 10th of January last, I had one Thousand Pounds paid to me, as a Trustee, for some particular Uses, by Mr. De la Hay in the City: and that I then had that Confidence in him, that I trusted him with a Bank Note of 500 l. to carry to Mr. Hoare, and exchange for a 400 l. Note, and a 100 l. Bank Bill. I did trust him, and 'twas this induced Mr. Payne to entrust him. The Prisoner liv'd with me about eleven Months, and during that Time I had no Reason to suspect him. He has left me now, and I will not impeach his Character. If I have Suspicions, they are out of the Case.</p>
               <p>Councel. Do you believe him to have been a faithful Servant to you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I have given him Money, while he was with me, to pay for Stamps; and since he left me, I have had a Bill brought in for them. He went away from me the 18th of January, on Account of the many Actions depending against him for Debt; he being disappointed of Money he expected to have received. I don't know where he has been since he left me.</p>

            . About the Middle of January last, the Prisoner had the Misfortune to be arrested for 5.l was carry'd to a Spunging-House in Grocer's Alley. He sent for me thither, and I found Car and Ramsey with him. Among other Discourse, the Prisoner was mentioning what a large Sum he had been entrusted with the Day before, of Mr. Payne's, all in Portugal Money. Ramsey told him he was a Fool he did not run away with it. The Prisoner reply'd, he would not forfeit his Character for ten times that Sum.</p>
               <p>Patridge, Keeper of Chester Goal. About 6 Weeks ago the Prisoner was in my Custody, and behav'd well. Ramsey and Car I saw at Liverpool, they broke Gaol on Friday Night, and were taken again on Saturday Night.</p>

            . A little after 9 at Night, May the 7th, I was going up <placeName id="t17380518-20-crimeloc93">Constitution Hill</placeName>

What then, says I, D - mn your Blood says he, I must have your Money, O! says I, I understand you now; and immediately another Man came up and cry'd, - D - mn him, drag him into the Grass, - stab him, or shoot him. They then dragg'd me into the Grass, and took from me a Silver Watch, a Guinea, and about 22 or 23 s. and some Half-pence. I gave them good Words, and desired they would not use me ill; then they demanded my Watch, and the String being broke, they compell'd me to take it out my self. They took my Money themselves, one of them rifled my Pockets on one Side, and the other those on the other Side. When they had done with me, they ran down the Hill towards St. James's-Park, bidding me Good-night, and I return'd their Complement. It was very dark, so I could not observe their Faces, so as to be able to swear to them, but I have great Reason to believe that Wisdell was the Man who was for stabbing or shooting me, because he confessed it in Newgate, and I remember they were both tall Men in Soldier's Cloaths.</p>
               <p>It being known that I had been robb'd by such Men, the Officers of the Guards sent for me next Morning, and when the Guard was reliev'd, they placed me where I might see the Men, and if I had known the Persons that robb'd me, they would have secur'd them; but I could not swear to any of their Faces. Some Time afterwards, I found the Watch in the Custody of one Burroughs, a Grenadier, and had it restored to me again. This is the Watch, and this is the Seal, but the Key has been mended while it has been out of my Possession.</p>
               <p>I went to Newgate just before the Beginning of last Sessions with Justice Blackerby's Clerk, and saw the Prisoner Wisdell; he confessed that he and one Wheatley robbed me of such and such Things, mentioning every particular Thing that I lost. I know nothing of the other Prisoner, (Temple) only he was the Man that sold my Watch to Burroughs. Wisdell has confessed the Fact to almost twenty People, and upon this Arraignment (as I am informed) he pleaded Guilty, but immediately retracting his Plea, he put himself upon his Trial.</p>
               <p>- Burroughs. The Prisoner Temple told me he had a Watch of a Countryman of his to dispose of, and it would be a cheap Bargain; and in about a Week after he came with Wisdell, and he (Temple) shewed me the Watch, and asked me 50 s. for it; I bid him two Guineas, and after some Consideration between him and Wisdell, Temple delivered me the Watch, and Wisdell took the Money; I paid 1 l. 13 s. in Part of the two Guineas; but some Time afterwards Temple came to me, and told me he would not have me pay any more Money upon it, for he believed it was not honestly come by. I desired they would return the Money and take the Watch again; they promised me they would, but they never did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lewis. I don't know the Prisoner: I was robb'd the 27th of August, 1736, and Wager and Baker were hang'd for it. I was coming from Bedfordshire, and in the watery Lane, near <placeName id="t17380518-28-crimeloc134">Kentish Town</placeName>

I rode on a little Way, and one of them turn'd short on my Horse's Hips. I ask'd him, what he did that for? He immediately whipp'd by me, and demanded my Money. I told him he should have what I had got, but I desired him not to meddle with the Lady that was with me. He said he would not. Then I pull'd out about 13 s. three Copper Pieces, and the Copper Ticket, and gave them; but the Man that was behind said, I must be search'd; and he put his Hand into this Pocket, and took out five Guineas, and two half Guineas. This is the Ticket they took from me at that Time. One of them took hold of my Horse's Bridle, and told me, if I had a Bushel of Arms, they would signify nothing. 'Twas the Man that I gave the Money too, who search'd me, and pull'd out the Gold, a Key, and a Nutmeg. He felt about my Breeches for a Watch, but I assured him I had none, and began to swear at them; but a Man behind, bid me not swear so, for I should not be ill us'd, and he bid the rest of the Gang come away, if they had got what they could. D - mn it, says another of them, he never rides without a Watch; I assur'd them I had none, so they then rode away, to another Man, who belonged to my Company, and stood under a Tree, with some Venison behind him, his Mare would not stand. One of them cry'd, D - mn it, shoot him if he won't stand. I said don't shoot him, let my Horse's Nose come up to the Mare's, and she'll stand. That Gentleman's Name was Walker, but he has been dead about 5 or 6 Weeks. They took about 10 or 12 Shillings from him, and wish'd us a good Night; telling me, they hop'd when it was in my Power, I would use them, as well as they had used me. I can't say I know the Prisoner; 'twould be a vile Thing in me to swear the Man's Life away, when I know nothing of him. I remember the Evidence, for by the Light<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180016"/> which came over the Bank, I saw his Face plainly.</p>

            's, at the White-Lion at Hornsey, with Intent to rob any Body we should meet. About 8 o'Clock we met Mr. Lewis, and a Lady, and a Gentleman following them, in the Lane that goes to Kentish Town. We rid past him, and the rest of his Company, then Baker turn'd back, and said there was our Mark; I came up with Mr. Lewis, and my Horse's Head lay upon his Horse's Buttock I took from him what I could find, but Baker insisted on searching him farther, and had it not been for the unhappy Man at the Bar, and myself, he would have done him a Mischief. I search'd him, and took to the Value of 6 l. from him. The Prisoner was behind Mr. Lewis, and was to give us Notice of any Surprize. One Mr Walker was robb'd at the same Time: Baker and Wager insisted upon robbing the Lady, but Mr. Lewis persuaded us from it, because her Horse was startish.</p>
               <p>After we had committed this Fact, we went to Ralph Guy's in Hornsey-Lane, and shar'd the Money we had got that Night, which came to about 50 s. a Man; the Prisoner was present, and I believe had his Share; but he was tired of such a Way of Life, and soon went quite away from the Company, in about a Week's Time. I was apprehended about the Beginning of October, on Account of a Fact that I was not guilty of; I begun to be weary of such Courses, and therefore made a voluntary Confession. I have heard that the Prisoner has been in an Employment ever since he absconded. I saw him (just before he went down to Bristol) about 10 or 11 Weeks ago, in Wood's Close. We are both sorry for our past Follies, and I know he would be glad to receive Favour, as well as I. Our Conversation was on the Hardships, that the unfortunate Man at the Bar had sustain'd, by his being obliged to wander backward and forward, when he should be glad to settle to any Labour. How he came to be discover'd, I don't know; - I did not betray him. I have nothing more to say, and am sorry that I am able, and am obliged to say so much. (Weeping.)</p>

We should have had another Witness here, - Ralph Guy, - he promised to be here; he was here on Wager and Baker's Trial, but he was an unwilling Witness then, and now he has sent a Boy here, who I suppose is to swear he is sick.

There was about 22 Dozen of Silk Loopes, and 8 Gross of Thread Loopes, a Pound of Thread, a Check Apron, and two Bandboxes. I saw them all in the back Room below Stairs, on Saturday the 25th of March, and on Monday following, we miss'd them. Upon Enquiry, I found that this Witness (Elizabeth Haydon) knew something of the Affair, so I had her before Mr. Justice Polson, and she discover'd the Prisoner and his Wife. Thro' her Means we took him; and we found some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173805180017"/> the Goods at Mr. Compton's ot the White-Hart in Pater-noster-row, 12 or 13 Dozen of them were sold there. When Cockran was taken up, he own'd he had had the Goods, but he told us, he had them from one Bolingbroke and his Wife. Two Gross he said were pawn'd, he could not tell where, and the rest he deliver'd to Eliz. Haydon to dispose of for him. Part of the Goods which were found in Pater noster-row, were carry'd before my Lord-Mayor, and were put into the Hands of Nettlefold the Constable.</p>

            . The Prisoner sent for me on the Thursday before Good-Friday to his Lodging; I went up Stairs, and he shew'd me a great quantity of Silk and thread Loopes. There were 16 dozen of Silk Loopes, and 6 gross and better of thread Loopes. He told me if I would dispose of them for him, he would satisfy me for my Trouble. I saw no Banboxes, nor any check Apron. I ask'd him whose they were? He said they were his own, and he ty'd them up in a Handkerchief, and his Wife and I went to Mr. Crouch's Shop, (he is dead, and Mr. Compton keeps it now) Mr Compton would not have bought them if he had not known me. He knew me, and bought 12 or 13 Dozen of Silk and Thread Loopes together, and the Prisoner had the Money. 'Twas either 14 or 15 s. that we had for them, I can't tell which. I told him I never did sell such Goods for the Money, but having Cockran's Consent, I took the Money and gave it to him, at the Post-Boy in Black-Fryar's. After this, I sold 6 Dozen to one Mr. Plummer in the Borrough for 6 s. Tee Prisoner's Wife and he were both at the Door, the same Time. This Money I likewise deliver'd to the Prisoner, and he gave me 3 s. 6 d. for my Trouble.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire she may be asked, whether one Mrs. Deal, did not deliver her the Goods at 1 s. per Dozen?</p>
               <p>Haydon. I don't know Mrs. Deal, nor did I ever see her in my Life, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not Mr. Deal and his Wife in the Room when she was there, and took the Loopes to dispose of?</p>
               <p>Haydon. No, there was none in the Room but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Turland. I saw about 6 Dozen of the same Goods I had lost in Mr. Compton's Shop in Pater-noster row. We gave him Notice to be here Yesterday; but I have not seen him here to Day. Mr. Compton own'd before my Lord-Mayor, that he bought them of 2 Women, one of whom, he knew to be a Loop-maker upon Clerkenwell-Green, but he said he could not tell where to find her. I saw only Thread Loopes at his Shop, but he said he had bought 2 Dozen of Silk Coat Loopes among them, at 2 s per Dozen, when a Crown a Dozen is my Market Price. My Lord granted me his Warrant to bring Mr. Compton before him, and he order'd him to let the Constable have the Goods. I saw them, and they were part of the Goods I lost. Mr. Compton said he did not know the Value of them. My Lord-Mayor granted me a Warrant for Mr. Plummer in the Borough, but he refused to let me have my Goods, unless I would pay him 12 s. tho' I saw them at his Shop, and he gave but 6 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turland. Mr. Justice Engier told me I must return Mr. Plummer 12 s. then I might take my Goods. Mr. Plummer and his Wife said, they bought them of 2 Women who had a great deal of Work, and that they might have bought much more; and Mrs. Plummer told her Husband she had a Notion that they were 2 loose Creatures, of whom he bought this Work, and she seem'd to be frighted. Mr. Plummer lives at the 3 Kings on the other Side of the Bridge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the Goods of one Deal and his Wife; and Haydon saw me deliver the Money she gave me to Deal and his Wife, at the Post Boy, and they gave her 6 s.</p>
               <p>Haydon. I never changed a Word with any one but the Prisoner upon this Affair; nor had I any Money but what he gave me.</p>
               <p>Cockran. Here's the Prisoner who heard Haydon say, she would swear my Life away for a full Pot of Beer.</p>

               <p>Mr. Claridge. I was going to my Master's Stables, on the 28th of April, about 10 at Night, and under the Duke of Devorshire's Wall, I was attack'd by two Men and a Woman One of the Men put a Knife to my Breast, and said, If I offer'd to disturb them, they would stab me. Then the Woman came up while they held me, and took my Watch, 5 s. and a Handkerchief. When she had robb'd me, one of the Men still held me, while his Companion and Woman got off, I scuffled with him, but he got away from me, and ran away. To the best of my Knowledge, the Prisoners are the Men, but I can't swear positively to them. I advertised the Watch, and it was brought me again by Mr. Seddon, the Man that made it. This is my Watch.</p>

             brought this Watch to me, the 1st of May; it was advertised to be left with me.</p>
               <p>Grubb, Pawnbroker. On Saturday the 29th of April, the two Prisoners came to me with the Watch, and wanted to borrow 40 s. upon it; (I live in St. James's-Market) O Hara is a <rs id="t17380518-31-deflabel154" type="occupation">Chairman</rs>

He told me it was Tobin's, who then appear'd like a Sailor. I asked Tobin where he bought it? He said, he bought it of a Mate of a Ship at Wapping. Then I asked him who it was made by? And O Hara immediately answer'd, - by Seddon, at St. James's, who was his particular Friend. Upon this I lent 40 s. upon it. This was on Saturday the 29th of April, and on Monday Morning, seeing the Watch advertised, I carry'd it to Mr. Seddon, and he said it was the same Watch which had been lost. He offer'd me the three Guineas that was was offer'd as the Reward in the Advertisement; but I took no more than what I had lent upon it, and told him, I could help him to one of the Men that brought it to me. It was pawn'd in Tobin's Name, and O Hara averr'd it was his (Tobin's) Watch.</p>

            . On Friday, the 28th of April, I went to Peter Street, to see Tobin and his Wife; O Hara and one Brooks was there, and we all din'd upon Mutton and Broth. Between 7 and 8 at Night, O Hara, and his Wife, Tobin, and his Wife, and I, went out to take a Walk. When we came near Piccadilly,

             (the Wife) pick'd up a Gentleman and carry'd him into a House; O Hara and Tobin follow'd them in, but I staid at the Door till they came out; and Rose said, she had got half a Crown. Then we all went on, and met this Man (Claridge) in a velvet Cap; Tobin's Wife and I, and the two Prisoners went after him; and when we came up to him, O Hara took hold of him, and held him, while I took the Watch out of his Pocket. I saw no Money; I can't tell who took that.</p>
               <p>Claridge. I had a Cap on that Night I was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Dalton. When I had got the Watch, one of them held him, while Tobin's Wife and I ran away to Clancey's House; and we had no sooner got in, but the Prisoners came in likewise; we sat down, and I gave Tobin the Watch, and Clancey open'd it, that Tobin might look at it. I did not mind it much myself; so I can't be positive whether this is the Watch or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Please to ask her where this Watch was taken?</p>

               <p>Tobin's Wife stood at a little Distance, when I robb'd him.</p>
               <p>Claridge. I was surpriz'd, and so saw but one Woman.</p>
               <p>- Clancey. I keep the two Blue Posts in Compton Street, St. Ann's. On the 28th of April, at Night, Dalton (the Evidence) and the two Prisoners were at my House, with their Wives, pretty late. After they had drank about 1 s. or 14 d. in Liquor, O Hara and his Wife went away, but Tobin and Dalton. About half an Hour after the Prisoner (O Hara) and his Wife were gone, Dalton pull'd out the Watch, and I open'd it. I ask'd her whose it was, and she told me 'twas her Husband's.</p>
               <p>Dalton. I did not produce the Watch till they were gone, because O Hara was not willing his Wife should know what was taken that Night. Tobin felt the Watch in my Hand, immediately after I had taken it; and O Hara knew I had got it when we were all together at Clancey's. The next Morning, Tobin and O Hara went to pawn the Watch; when they return'd, they told me they had got but a Guinea and a half upon it. Please to ask Clancey if Tobin did not deliver him a Knife?</p>
               <p>Clancey. He deliver'd me this Knife, about a Week ago, last Tuesday. (A very long sharp pointed Clasp Knife) This is the Knife.</p>
               <p>Claridge. Twas was just such a Knife as this, one of them held to my Breast.</p>
               <p>Dalton. Some Time after this, we all quarrel'd, and I went before a Justice and made a Discovery.</p>

            . I come for Tobin. He desired me to find out where Dalton lodged, for he said his Life depended upon it. I knew where she lodged, for I met her once in Peter Street, and she was enquiring her Way to her Lodgings in Holborn, I have no more to say, - only as I was going Home with her, I met Tobin and O Hara in the Street, and one Luttwych was with them. 'Tis not every one that is endowed with Sense; if I had, I should have left Dalton with O Hara and Tobin, and not have gone Home with her to her Lodgings. This I think was at Night, the 29th of April, when Dalton met with her Acquaintance, we all went together to an Alehouse, next Door to Justice Marget's, in Castle Street. - I can't tell the Sign, but I know by their own Expressions, that Tobin's Wife was there, and I left them all there, and went Home with Dalton to her Lodging. I am not so ignorant, but I know this was the 29th of April.</p>

               <p>Arthur Ginn. On the 17th of March, between 4 and 5 in the Evening, the Post Man brought me a Letter from the General Post-Office, with the Town Mark upon it, I paid Three pence for it, and then open'd it, and found the Contents of it were to demand 10 l. to be laid at such a Place, by Six o'Clock that same Evening. This was the Letter.</p>

               <p>B. R."</p>
               <p>Mr. Camm. On the 17th of March, Mr. Ginn shewed me this Letter about five o'Clock; at six, out of my own Curiosity, I walked to the Old House, and as I went thither, I met a Friend, who went with me; when I came to the Place, I found the Prisoner leaning against the Wall of the Old House, and reading in a Book; I came back and told Mr. Ginn that I believed the Man was waiting for the Money. Then we sent another Man to see if the Person was still waiting at the same Place; he returned and told he was yet waiting there. Upon this Mr. Ginn and I went to him, and asked him to go and drink with us; he consented, and we went to the Cock in Old-street, where we charged him with Writing the Letter, and he denied it. I have nothing further to say, but only that I found him kicking the Brickbats about, as if he look'd for something. I know the Prisoner, he liv'd a little Time ago (next Door to me) with Mr. Lawrence, a Tobacconist.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ginn. The Prisoner liv'd lately at Chelsea, and his Master and some Gentlemen from thence, were to come to speak in his Behalf. <rs id="t17380518-35-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">
