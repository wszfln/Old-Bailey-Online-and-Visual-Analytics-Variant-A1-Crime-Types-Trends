               <p>Q. You examined the body. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the head particularly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what state you found the head A. I found on examining the head, a very large extensive fracture on the front of the head, with a laceration of the integuments, which appeared to me to have been given by a stick, or some blunt instrument; there was also a very large wound, a laceration of the integuments also on the back part of the head, but I did not perceive any fracture of the bone there on the back part of the head. Also there was much injury done to the neck, which was occasioned by the application of a leather strap, being put round it so tight, that this strap would have produced suffocation of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other observations. - A. Likewise a very large blow on the upper part of the right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that blow appear to have been made by a blunt instrument. - A. A blunt instrument, it was such a blow as a stick would have made. My opinion was, that the blows he received on his head, was the immediate cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the coroner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was there. - A. Yes, and there I examined him; I examined him first on the 10th, and I particularly examined him on the coroner's inquisition.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Mr. Nares. - A. I saw Mr. Nares but whether I saw him there, I do not recollect; I have seen him several times on this occasion.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went from the Black horse had you any liquor. - A. Yes, we had ale or beer, we had liquor, I cannot say what.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away from thence towards Hyde park corner. - A. Yes; and then we proceeded upon the road towards Hounslow till we came to a public house on Turnham green, where we stopped, and had some porter, and from thence we went to Hounslow to the further end of the town, we stopped at the last house, a public house, with some trees before it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you wait upon the heath any time. A. Yes, we struck out of the road upon the heath, to a place that is near a clump of trees (I have since pointed out the same spot); we waited there a considerable time, I suppose it was better than an hour, as near as I can say, not having a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay till after dark. - A. It was dark when we got to the clump of trees, or nearly so, but by the time that we had waited there the moon had arose; we walked out from the clump of trees on the left from here, and walked about half an hour, and then returned to the clump of trees.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the clump of trees. - A. The left from here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go beyond the eleven mile stone. - A. We turned down to the left just before we came to the eleven mile stone; at the time we were going to nigh where he died the moon was obscured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any person coming across the heath; tell us what passed on the business that you went on. - A. We then came out of the clump of trees; Holloway said he thought he heard a foot, upon which we come out, and went along the road, upon which we could descry the figure of a man coming towards us.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he coming. - A. Towards Hounslow.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you observe upon this. - A. I observed and said it was a cruel piece of business, and I was very sorry that I had any hand in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry after his own hat. - A. I did; he said he had left it behind, he had served it, meaning he had disfigured it or buried it</p>
               <p>Q. Serving, means altering some way or other - A. Some way or other sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask any other question at that time. - A. Haggerty interrupted us, and said that it was time to proceed towards home.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you come to in town. - A. There is one thing to observe, crossing a field I asked him whether they had got the book; Holloway replied, as I had not shared in the danger, I should not share in the spoil.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived in town you came to the Black horse in Dyot street, what time was it then. A. It was past twelve o'clock when we arrived there, the house was shut up, but they were not gone to bed, we had half a pint of gin there, drank that, and parted for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see each other the next day. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that when you were going down to Hounslow, Holloway had on an old hat, did Haggerty go down in boots or shoes. - A. He went in shoes, and he made this observation when he went out, that he did not think the shoes would last him there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come back in shoes. - A. I do not know, I cannot say whether he did or not.</p>

             came to me and informed me that John Holloway was at the bottom of the street, I went to him and observed, that he had the same hat on he had the day before; I told him he acted very improper in wearing that hat, it might lead to a discovery, and I said I hoped he would get it done away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the inside of the hat. - A. Yes, upon which he took the hat off and gave it to me, and upon which hat in the inside was the name of Steele, upon which I pointed out the danger he was in by wearing it; he replied, that he would get the lining taken out; I told him there might be some marks about the binding or the buckle that might lead to a discovery, and I desired him that he would get it done away with; he replied that he should meet me again in two or three hours; accordingly he came again in the evening with another hat on, and something tied up in a handkerchief; he asked me if I had any objection of going to Westminster with him and Haggerty; we went into Parliament street together, I said I thought it was advisable to throw the hat over the bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. What hat. - A. Mr. Steele's hat, the hat that he had worn in the day, he had got that hat in an handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You advised him to throw it over the bridge. - A. Yes, upon which he went on the bridge, and wanted to throw it over, I made an objection, I said it might swim; I went opposite to Astley's and filled the hat with stones; tied the lining over it, and we went on to the bridge to the Westminster side, where I throwed the hat over the bridge into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you in what manner were these two men dressed. - A.

               <p>Q. Was that a sort of dress he put on that day, or his usual dress. - A. His usual dress.</p>
               <p>Q.What was he by trade. - A. He is of no trade to my knowledge, he had worked at Mr. Willan's at Marylebone, going with his team as a labourer. Haggerty's dress was a velveteen jacket, swansdown waiscoat, and velveteen breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he by trade. - A. He used to follow the bricklayers labourer's work, or plaisterers, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only day that he was dressed so or his usual dress. - A. His usual dress, sometimes he had the addition of a pair of blue trowsers on.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sentenced to transportation, you were in Langston harbour; did the officer come down to you in November. - A. He came down to me in October or November, he brought me up in the Gosport coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You came across Hounslow heath. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were crossing the heath, did you point out any thing to Vickrey. - A. I pointed out to the officer the spot where we first met him, I was going to speak but he silenced me.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you since been at the spot with Vickrey and Mr. Hughes. - A. Yes, and the beadle of Hounslow was there too.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Andrews. Hanfield, it is a long time ago all this that you have been stating. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was this. - A. In the year 1802.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make any memorandum of any thing that passed in the year 1802, so as to refresh your memory. - A. No, no other remarks than my own conscience.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that you have repeated to day, is from the mere result of your memory without the assistance of any memorandum. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first make this discovery, or when did you first repeat this story. - A. At Worship street.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months ago. - A. In September or October last.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first time you repeated this story was in 1806. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first to tell this story. - A. It was by mere accident.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that accident. - A. I was in this jail, we were talking of different robberies that had been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. You were talking of different robberies. - A. I do not say myself, we were talking of different robberies, and this unfortunate affair came up, when I said that there were only three men in England that knew it, upon which there was a rumour in the jail, that I wanted to turn Nose, (i. e. to betray his associates), upon which I was obliged to vindicate myself in silence; it struck me forcibly that I was in danger from this accident, and I was sorry for having said it on my own account.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it by accident, and was sorry for saying it, and so you were sorry for disclosing the truth. A. I was not sorry for saying the truth, I was only sorry for saying it in that place; I was afraid and thought myself in danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you ever have disclosed it if it had not been for that accident. - A. I do not know that I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you disclose it further. - A. I was in too much fear.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that this murder was committed, you thought it was a cruel thing. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no part in this murder. - A. No I did not, no further then being present.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you did was to hold Mr. Steele's legs. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But none of the blows were given while you held his legs. - A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought it was a cruel and savage thing, why did not you resist it. - A. I knew it was of no utility to resist; I did not go out with any intent to murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the moment you saw this hat in your companion's custody, you advised him to conceal it. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you thought this was a very cruel thing, and at the time you did not chuse to have a share in the murder, you did not go to complain of this murder that had been commited by your comrades. - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How happened it then that in the course of four years you did not go before any magistrate to state it. - A. I was too much to my shame, in the habit of vice to think any thing about it, unless when I was sober in bed, or by myself alone, then I felt it bitterly; I was obliged to fly to company, or to drink to dispel my wretched thoughts.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard there is a reward offered for the conviction of a murderer. - A. No.</p>

When we came to Hounslow-heath, near to a clump of trees, on the right side of the road, between the ten and eleven mile-stone, as we were coming up, he made an observation with his finger, and pointed to the place; we were riding on the outside, at the back part of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons on the outside of the coach. - A. Yes, there were three or four passengers on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing. - A. He was about to speak, I told him not to say any thing then, on account of there being passengers on the outside of the coach.</p>

            , he was a parish officer for Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Holloway was apprehended by him. - A. The first time I saw Holloway was at Clerkenwell Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had you communicated to him what he was in custody for. - A. I took him from Clerkenwell Prison to John-street, Bedford-row; when he was outside of the prison with me and Bishop, I read the warrant to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how long he had been at Clerkenwell Prison. - A. Yes, I do, he had been there the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. You then read the warrant that you hold in your hand. - A. Yes, that was the next day; the warrant charged him on suspicion of the murder of Mr. Steele, to this he said he was innocent, he said, Oh, Dear! I know nothing about it, I will down on my knees to you and the justice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180010"/> if you will let me go; this was in the presence of Bishop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards apprehend Haggerty. - A. I did, I took him on Saturday, the 29th of November, on board the Shannon frigate in the Downs, laying off Deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at the time you apprehended him, communicate to him what you apprehended him for. - A. No, he was so unwell, he was obliged to be let down out of the ship into the boat; I was apprehensive that he would not live to come to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him before the port-admiral. - A. I did, the same morning the admiral asked him how long he had been a marine, he said about two years; he asked him where he was three years ago, you could hardly hear him answer, he was so very unwell, he said he did not know, I believe that was the word; the admiral then said, pray where was you four years ago, upon that he made no reply, I saw his countenance alter, he would have fallen backwards if I had not have caught him; I then begged the admiral would let him have a little water and a seat to sit on, which was granted him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he answer where he was four years ago. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any description of a hat and a stick. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the first examination did Hanfield give you a description of a hat and a stick. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen that hat and stick. - A. I have, he did not mention the stick, only the hat; the hat tallied with the description he gave as near as could be in the way it was mangled, it was cut in pieces when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing Hanfield after you had seen the hat. - A. I think not, he was in the House of Correction, and an order for no one to see him without an order.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since you brought Hanfield to town, been in company with Hanfield to Hounslow. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hughes there also. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hanfield point out to you any particular place. - A. Yes he did, we went to the Bell, where we alighted out of the coach, he went on near to the eleven mile stone; when we went from the Bell, I desired him to go on as fast as he liked, and the way he pleased, he then pointed to the left hand side to the clump of trees; he was on the right going towards the powder mills, he turned round on the left, and said we were concealed in that clump of trees, or this I, cannot say which word he used.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact he pointed out the place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. You say Haggerty was so ill he could hardly come up to town. - A. Yes, we were obliged to leave him behind at Deal hospital.</p>

               <p>Q. In November 1802, what coach did you drive. - A. I was the driver of the Gosport coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What time does that coach leave London. - A. At six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it leave London in November 1802, about six o'clock. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time does it get to Hounslow. - A. I suppose about eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the report of Mr. Steele being murdered on Hounslow heath. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On that evening do you recollect any thing happening. - A. I heard a man groan twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you left Hounslow. - A. At eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got from Hounslow. - A. Betwixt the trees, and the eleven mile stone; I heard a man moan as though he was in distress, the groans and moans I heard twice; I supposed it to be a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the first time louder than the second. - A. The first time was louder than the last; and the last more faint.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the right hand side or the left the sound. - A. On the right hand side, and apparently behind.</p>
               <p>Court The right hand side as you were going along. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Your mistress was a passenger in the coach. - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. You drove on. - A. Yes I did, I remarked to the passengers, that I thought there was something amiss.</p>
               <p>Q. Beside the groans, did you hear any voice. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it with respect to the night. - A. It was a moonlight night, but the moon was shaded at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me to be unnecessary to call any more witnesses to prove the fact; that Mr. Steele was murdered at that place, that is a matter of fact perfectly established. There is no doubt but the witness, Hanfield, had a hand in the murder; the question is whether the prisoners at the bar had, and whether they were the perpetrators of it or not, you need not call any other witness to corroborate what the coachman has proved, it appears to me to be a fact that cannot be denied. If, however, the gentlemen for the prosecution, are of opinion that any further evidence on this head may be necessary, I shall not pevent it.</p>

I want to know Mr. Justice Nares, whether Hanfield gave any account of this transaction, and whether that account was read to the prisoners, or whether Hanfield gave any account of the transaction in the presence of the prisoners. - A. He did, I took it down in writing from him.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what he said, did you call upon the defendants to make any allegations, having previous to that read over what Hanfield said. - A. I examined the prisoners separate, I read the account of what Hanfield said to me, and what Hanfield first said in the presence of the prisoners; I examined them apart and took it down in writing, I told them afterwards they chused to sign a true account, that would be given in evidence against them they did not sign it.</p>

             Esq. I asked Haggerty whether he ever saw Hanfield before, he said I never saw Hanfield to my knowledge before I went into the marines, I was a bricklayer's labourer at the time I enlisted, I had no work, I enlisted with serjeant Holmes in Belton street, I lived at that time in Dyot street, St. Giles'; I was in the habit of going to the Black horse in that street. I was in prison in Tothil fields in May 1802' and remained there till the last day of the session following.</p>
               <p>Court. We ought not to regard that account unless it refers to something of this transaction; the account of a man's life may attend to other transactions. I would have the witness only to direct his attention to such parts as relate to the case. - A. This examination was to give an account where he was. -</p>
               <p>"In November 1802 I was in prison in Tothil fields, and remained there till the last day of the sessions following, which must be July; work, he said, at that time was scarce, and in the winter I went to Mr. Smith's in Castle street, Seven Dials, he now lives in a court near Castle street, Mr. Humphries was the owner of the house, I believe; I worked for him all the winter; I never was in Dyot street, at the Black horse with Hanfield or Holloway in my life. Macdaniel, who keeps the house, knows me, and his daughter." Then he says -</p>

               <p>"That he never was at or near Hounslow in his life. I generally dressed, when out of work, in a velveteen jacket and breeches; then he denies being at the Black dog or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180013"/> Turk's head with Hanfield, or played with him at shove-halfpenny; then I asked him at another time as to Blackman and the other officers' evidence that they had given; he denied knowing any of the Bow street officers, and that he had ever worked at Hounslow, and that he never said to Blackman that he had worked for a plaisterer at Hounslow. That is all that is material, as to what Haggerty said. In consequence of what he said about working for Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith was sent for and examined in the presence of Holloway and Haggerty. Mr. Smith said he never worked for him at the time; and then the prisoner Haggerty said he would not say where he worked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you pursue the same course with respect to Holloway as you had done to Haggerty. A. Yes, Holloway said -</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing respecting Dyot street. A. He said -</p>
               <p>"he knew Haggerty and had done so about two years and upwards, then he denies ever having been in the company of Haggerty and Hanfield; he said he never was in their company together in his life; I never have been at the Black horse above five or six times for sixteen years. I have not been there for the last five years."</p>

               <p>"He denied ever having been at Hounslow in his life; he said I was never near Hounslow, or worked there in my life." Then when I enquired where he worked in November 1802, he said -</p>
               <p>"that he worked for Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Stedman, and for different people." They were all examined in his presence, and they denied that he worked there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. This was Holloway. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This examination was particularly pointed to the month of November 1802. - A. Yes, and he gave different accounts of who he worked with at that time. I was particular to the month of November 1802.</p>
               <p>A. And at each time he stated that during the month of November 1802, he had worked for different persons. - A. Yes, he mentioned several persons, and those persons denied it in all his examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. He mentioned the different persons, in consequence of which you brought forward those different persons, and they denied it.</p>
               <p>Holloway. The mistake that was made was this - I made a mistake in a year; the persons that I said I had worked for in the year 1802, I worked for them in the year 1803 and 1804.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (to Mr. justice Nares) Was that the mistake. - A. They said he had not worked at all for them in 1802, he had worked for them in different years.</p>

               <p>Haggerty. The murder was done four years ago, and he says he was in the House of Correction; how should he know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Holloway. No man can give a better account of himself than I do, can they. This job will not be settled yet.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. Did you work for Stedman this time four years. - Holloway. To be sure I did, I worked for him eighteen months; I dont think they much agree in what he says.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. They never asked me much questions at all.</p>
               <p>Holloway. But they will before they have done with you. It is four years ago when I worked at Watford for Davis and Barker for five months; he is a gallows rogue; if I was at Stedman's at the time, we never shut up shop before twelve or one; for it seems to hang that way a good deal.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. And was not you there.</p>

               <p>Holloway. Yes, I was, and that will clear me. The justice asked him if he knew where I worked at that time, he did not know. He be damned, they can't do nothing I see. I am more satisfied with this hearing than I was with the last, an't you. - Haggerty. Yes I am.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I think he will bring himself in it at last, if he don't mind. Oh Lord; he will be found out in a hundred lies; what a stick he has got, good Lord.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. If they thought his evidence was sufficient, they would have committed us before now. I don't see any of the friends belonging to him come forward.</p>
               <p>Holloway. They won't take his evidence before the magistrate at all, I don't think that any thing that he has said is of any use. - Haggerty. No.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I will see if I can't get a bit of writing paper; he has contradicted to day a good deal.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I was a good mind to tell Hanfield it would all fall on himself.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. No, never mind that. He has deserted from the Tower Hamlets several times.</p>
               <p>Holloway. Why had not you told him that.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. No, I denied him.</p>
               <p>Holloway. His word wont be taken; what is he to hang people? for you know more about these things than I do; they will be at great deal of expence about the business. I suppose they in the office are some of Mr. Steele's friends - I wont nor can't know any thing about it. I would not give an halfpenny for an evidence, for they can't do any thing without people come forward; what a pair of shoes they brought; if one is cleared we shall both get clear, he ought to know what clothes I had if he was with me.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. Where is it you told them you saw me. - Holloway. At the top of Dyot street, you know I must say somewhere thereabouts. There is no proof of any thing yet, nor there won't be none; which way did he say we came over the back fields. - Haggerty. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Holloway. I never saw such a stick in my life as he has brought, I have got a hat at home now I had in 1802.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. What sort of man is Mr. Stedman. Is he a good man, did he like you. - Holloway. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. Was it in the winter you worked for him. - Holloway. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now the conversation on the 15th of December.</p>
               <p>Hag. Any body there but yourself. - Hol. No.</p>
               <p>Hag. What do you think of it now. - Hol. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Hag. Did you hear him swear I knocked him down. - Hol. No; I don't mind it of a halfpenny, they may all kiss my a - e. They wont mind what Old Red-nose said; it is all dickey.</p>
               <p>Hag. Did Hanfield say we took the body and buried it any where. - Hol. He did not say such a word as I heard.</p>
               <p>Hol. It was done in November. - Hol. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hol. (Singing a seasong.) That red-nose old thief said he saw me at Hounslow; they shall never do me in a thousand years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (to Bishop.) The beadle of Hounslow (the gentleman with the red nose) was examined on that day. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Hol. Where is the man you worked for at Hounslow. - Hag. I never worked at Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Hol. I have got a good story to tell them but said but little - all his swearing won't frighten me.</p>
               <p>Hag. Don't you know what master you worked for. - Hol. I worked for Dove - they all know you, the traps.</p>
               <p>Hag. That's being so much about.</p>
               <p>Hol. The old beadle said afterwards he did not know me, for I never work'd where they said, they may laugh and swear as much about Hounslow as they please, but I don't know nothing about Hounslow; we shall have more hearing yet. Who the hell does he suppose to frighten, if they keep me lock-up for a hundred years it is of no use, they say I am honester than you, for you denied him. - Hag. I know him; what clothes did he say I had on, a great coat.</p>
               <p>Hol. Yes; if he don't die for it I will be shot. I know that beadle told them what clothes I wore,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180015"/> they or would never have known it, I was there but once over in Surry.</p>
               <p>Hag. Next Monday it will be either one thing or the other. - Hol. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hag. Oh lord! what do you think of it now? there is none of them can swear they saw us together at the time; if one is done all is done.</p>
               <p>Hol, What all three. - Hag. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hol. It is all nothing; if people come from the Bell, Hounslow, it is the same, they don't know us. I know they could not swear before they come, all is of no use, I don't mind not a halfpenny for being lock'd up so, I carries too good a face to be daunted on this suit, I am not afraid of suffering for it.</p>
               <p>Hag. Nor I, for I have been very ill, but I am better now.</p>
               <p>Hol. It wont be settled next Monday, I think. - Hag. Do you think not - how comeyou to think that.</p>
               <p>Hol. I do not know, how it is to be settled when there is no evidences. - Hag. I do not know.</p>
               <p>CONVERSATION, December 22.</p>
               <p>Hag. What did they say to you.</p>
               <p>Hol. There is strong information come against me from Kentish town. The magistrate told me there is nobody there that knows us at all. You know that old beadle, don't you. - Hag. Yes. I like it very well.</p>
               <p>Hol. So do I better than ever I did, there is nether of us will suffer for it, he has not got his pardon yet; nor won't have it. - Hag. No.</p>
               <p>Hol. They bother'd me so I was a good mind to tell them they might find out where I worked, I told Armstrong I was always singing where I was, it an't as they wish it nor won't be; there is nobody comes forward to say what he does, ten to one if he an't tried for it at last. - Hag. I hope to God he will.</p>
               <p>Hol. I laugh always, I don't know whether you do.</p>
               <p>Hag. How did I look when I was in. - Hol. I don't know. The people will be tired of coming, it is nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Hag. It is all right now.</p>
               <p>Hol. I wonder what they think now. I suppose they consult together while we are out, I wonder why they did not examine private to day, I think it will be knocked off very soon, I am damned if they won't clear all Hounslow, we shall be turned up and I will satisfy you for all.</p>
               <p>Hag. You never had a better pal in your life than I am. - Hol. No. I never was there but that year; that red nosed old ram was quite behind day; as to you, you have acted very well, I told them, I could not answer for you, I don't care who knows me so as they don't bring me in it. I know very well they think we are innocent; it runs in my head, he stands the worst chance, they an't satisfied now about him.</p>
               <p>Hag. No counsel will come for one guinea. - Hol. No, they won't, we shan't be fully committed</p>
               <p>Hag. He knows the law so well he must either commit or acquit us.</p>
               <p>Hol. I can't think were all them things come from, the hat and bludgeon. (Singing a sea song.) Where have you been. - Hag. To the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Hol. What about. B - r them all of a heap, I say, I would sooner be in the middle of hell flames than be here, there is never noboby locked up here but you and I, I wonder where they put them. - Hag. I don't know, it is all right now, I can see that well, what do you think of it now.</p>
               <p>Hol. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Hag. They are getting very cool upon it I can see that. - Hol. An't they</p>
               <p>Hag. Here's luck I wish you as much harm I do myself, why don't you gammon to be ill. - Hol. I would not care a d - for them if I had these irons off.</p>
               <p>Hag. He asked me were I worked, I would not tell him, I worked at Gardner's near Bow street, and he has run away since. I can tell the very day and hour where I worked.</p>
               <p>CONVERSATION, December 26.</p>
               <p>Hol. How do you get on.</p>
               <p>Hag. What do you think of it now. We are not com-mitted yet.</p>
               <p>Hol. I don't care a damn about it.</p>
               <p>Hag. He speaks quite different about it to what he did the first time. - Hol. He does; I wonder what the justice thinks of it.</p>
               <p>Hag. I do not know, his evidence will never do; did not he mention that the shoes was yours at first. - Hol. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hag. What sort of a head is yours, big or little.</p>
               <p>Hol. Big. Mr. Hanfield is a very nice man, ant he.</p>
               <p>Hag. Yes, they put words into his mouth.</p>
               <p>Hol. He could not tell about a good many things, he said he was not sure; we shant be commited yet a while; it is read over to us to see how we looked. - Hag. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hol. He said you and I stopped behind and he went forward. - Hag. Yes.</p>
               <p>Hol. I thought there would be some people here to day, did not you. - Hag. So did I.</p>
               <p>Hol. Justice Nares does not know what to think about it now. - Hag. No.</p>
               <p>Hol. You have been robbing with him he says. - Hag. They cant prove it.</p>
               <p>Hol. He is the man that will answer for it all. What was that bludgeon brought for. That made him a liar, I can produce a hat I wore in 1802 if I like at home. It is very odd he did not know what things he wore, I think. - Hag. Yes</p>
               <p>Hol. He did not know what money he took from the bloody villain; that gentleman's servant behind was with the bricklayer that found him, I suppose he is going to be examined, ten to one if he don't say something contrary.</p>
               <p>Hag. Dont make such a talking.</p>
               <p>Hol. I shall tie my handkerchief round my head and gammon sick.</p>
               <p>Hag. But not before the traps, for they will put them down.</p>
               <p>Hol. If I get commited for this job, I will have a councel; I will have Alley; that is very well in there, but it wont do any where else; it ant very seldom you her of such a job as this from a fellow that is transported; they sent for us to day, to see what they thought of us; his word ant worth one halfpenny, if I was before the lordjudge of England, I should not be asaid of geting clear, lord it is all nonsense. - Hag. He must know the day of the month, and every thing else when he comes there.</p>
               <p>Hol. Yes, I do not see why we should be committed upon his evidence. - Hag. Nor I neither, you mark my word if he has not somebody to back his evidence they won't find a bill. - Hol. No.</p>
               <p>Hag. I know where I worked every day in November. I know the very street and house, but it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180016"/> is no use talking here about it.</p>
               <p>Hol. It is all nothing at all. - Hag. Yes. I dont see why we should be committed upon his evidence.</p>
               <p>Hol. It is a very wrong thing if they let him swear at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Hag. Where is it he said we parted with him. - A. At Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Hol. Where did he say we had the gin. - Hag At the Black horse.</p>
               <p>Hag. We must have had the gin there.</p>

               <p>CONVERSATION, February 5, 1807.</p>
               <p>Hag. What do you think of it now, we must cheer up, never mind. - A. Hol. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Hag. Never mind Holloway, we shall get turned up by and bye.</p>
               <p>Hol. But I don't like it much.</p>
               <p>Hag. Well Holloway, my boy, are you asleep, don't cast yourself down. - Hol. No, he is a d - d rascal.</p>
               <p>Hag. I wonder what is their notion for keeping us here so long before we go before the magistrate. - Hol. They don't know what to do, they can't make head nor tale of his story.</p>
               <p>Hag. The best way for us is to insist upon bedischarged or fully committed this time. - Hol. Yes. - What do you think of that fellow.</p>
               <p>Hag. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Hol. What do you think of it now, they dare not commit us now. - Hag. No.</p>
               <p>Hol. That fellow's confession has done him. - Hag. Yes. (Both singing a song.)</p>
               <p>CONVERSATION, February 9, 1807.</p>
               <p>Hag. We shall go to Newgate now.</p>
               <p>Hol. Hanfield has got his discharge, I must get a counsel; I suppose we shall go together to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Hag. They have caught him out in a good many lies.</p>
               <p>Hol. I should not wonder if they do not find a bill he is a d - d villain. Knapp is a d - d good one, he will bother some of them; Beale's will do more harm than good. I do not know about old Macdaniel, he is a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. (to Bishop) How could you distinguish the voice of one from another. - A. I knew which rooms they were in</p>
               <p>Q. You were four feet distant from them, and the partition you say is strong quartering, with iron plate upon it. - A. In the privy that I sat in there were two panes of glass out of the top.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some conversation that you could not hear. - A. Of course I did not take it down.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Manby there at the time. - A. I did not know Mr. Manby at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it with respect to fitting of him. - A. It went quite down on the man's head at the time Armstrong put it on.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it put on any other man's head at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This was done only to shew that it would fit him.</p>
               <p>Court. And it would fit any other head of the same dimensions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (to Mr. Manby) Did you bring that hat to the police office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one of the late Mr. Steele's hats. - A. Yes, it is one that he had wore a good while, and the lining is out, and it is rather larger by being without the lining, and much worn by some other person; it is a hat of Mr. Steele's.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the size and dimension of Mr. Steele's hat. - A. Perfectly well, I sold him a hat in March 1802.</p>
               <p>Q. We are informed that the prisoner Holloway had this hat put on him; would the hat of Mr. Steele fit the prisoner Holloway. - A. I recollect the size of Mr. Steele's hat, I should have thought it would have fitted him tight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. How many years is it ago since you sold Mr. Steele a hat. - A. In March 1802.</p>
               <p>Q. You never sold him but one. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember from March 1802, what the size of Mr. Steele's hat or head must be. - A. Whenever I enter a gentleman's name in the book, I always put the size in the margin.</p>
               <p>Q. This hat is rather larger than Mr. Steele's, you say it is an old hat. - A. That is the natural consequence of a hat being much worn.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether he could have worn Mr. Steele's boots. - A. I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to look to an old pair of shoes there, do they appear to have been worn by a person that they fitted, or that they had not fitted. - A. They appear to have been worn by a person that they were too long for.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared them with the feet of Haggerty. - A. I have looked at these shoes, and I have looked at Haggerty's feet; they would be too long for Haggerty, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Andrews. There is no doubt, sir, that a shoe of a large man would suit a little foot. - A. They might wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you point out how you know that shoe has been worn by a person for whom it was too long. - A. By the toe not coming to the end, the toe is turned up, and the going in of the heel at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This is the whole of the evidence on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no evidence that Haggerty wore the boots, no boots whatever were found, only a pair of shoes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180017"/> Holloway's Defence. Please you my lord, I am brought here by the word of Hanfield, who is an entire stranger to me, please you my lord; I do not know any thing of the man whatever, I have seen the man in the streets, and that is all I know of him; and I think it very odd when he gave information of me, which was the cause of my being taken up, that he could not give the right name, which certainly he would have done if he knew any thing of me, my lord.</p>
               <p>Haggerty's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I stand here now a prisoner, I stand charged with an offence of which I know no more than a child unborn, although I stand here for it. I hope you will take it into consideration the former character of the witness Hanfield, who merely for the sake of getting his liberty, he has done all this and nothing else. I am perfectly innocent of the crime that I am charged with; it is clear and evident that he has contradicted himself in several places. When he was examined before Mr. Justice Nares, Mr. Justice Nares asked him what sort of a night it was, and what sort of clothes Mr. Steele wore; he replied it was a dark night, and he said he could not inform him of the colour of his clothes. My lord and gentlemen, Mr. Justice Nares is here, and he will inform you of the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Would you have me ask Mr. Nares. - A. If you please my lord.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Justice Nares) I am called upon by the prisoner to ask you whether Hanfield in the different examinations contradicted his account that he has given here, with respect to the night whether it was dark or not. - A. No further than he has said here that there was a cloud over the moon, it was dark at the time.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. Upon the second examination there was a stick brought forth and a pair of shoes, and when the stick was taken up Mr. Justice Nares asked him if he knew any thing of that stick; he said yes, that was the stick; likewise the shoes were held up, he said them were the shoes that Holloway had; Mr. Justice Nares said to him, I thought you told me that Holloway wore high shoes, he replied no, he did not. Holloway said he never knew the stick. Mr. Justice Nares asked him if he knew any thing of the shoes, Oliver told him he knew nothing of the shoes, he never wore such shoes, that was very well. Upon the third examination Mr. Justice Nares examined the witness Hanfield again; he was asked with respect to what clothes he wore, and likewise his shoes, he told them that he supposed the shoes belonged to Haggerty, he said in reply as they will not fit Oliver, I suppose that they belonged to Haggerty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. Hanfield denied knowing any thing of the stick.</p>
               <p>Haggerty. Upon the third examination you asked him again, what sort of a stick it was that Oliver had, he made reply, a black thorn stick; upon his first examination he said that was the stick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. My recollection serves me so well, I deny what he says about the stick.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHUTER. - Mr. Andrews. Do you know Hanfield. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the head turnkeys of the jail, - A. I am one of the head turnkeys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hanfield being in your custody in this goal. - A. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time have any conversation with Hanfield. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make any confession to you. - A.We never had any conversation about this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about his confessing any burglary, or any other crime for any purpose. - A. He never confessed to me.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. You are one of the officers of Hatton garden office. - A. I am. - On the 25th of January I received information of this robbery. In the evening, in company with Chapman, I went to the prosecutor's house, where I understood the prisoner Higgins lodged, and where I saw the last witness, Lyons, he lodged there likewise. I found the prisoner Higgins laying in the bed, apparently intoxicated, he appeared to be so more than he was; we took him in custody on suspicion of the robbery, which he denied; we questioned him after that about the other prisoner Quin; he acknowledged that he had been drinking with him, but that he knew nothing of the robbery whatsoever. He was taken before the magistrate the next morning, and committed for re-examination till we found Quin. On the 31st of January, I received information that Quin was at work in Apollo gardens, in Surrey; we took Quin there. When I went up to him I asked him if his name was not Timothy Quin, he said no, it was not; I told him I was an officer, I had come to take him in custody on suspicion of house breaking. As soon as he saw my brother officer, Chapman, and the prosecutor, (the prosecutor had concealed himself) I said, do you know that man that is coming here, he says yes, he knows my name is Quin. I then searched in his pocket book; I found this duplicate of a watch pledged at T. Melton's, Westminster Bridge road, for eight shillings, in the name of 
               <persName id="t18070218-4-person136">

            . I made enquiry there and found the watch, in consequence of that ticket; this is the watch I now produce. After that we brought him away; coming along he denied any knowledge whatever of the robbery, except of saying that Patrick Higgins gave it him to pledge. Afterwards he acknowledged where the clothes were, they were at his lodgings somewhere near Vauxhall gardens; he was some time hesitating where his lodgings was, at last he recollected, he said it was No. 2, White Lion court, where I went on Sunday morning; when I went in the house I saw nobody below, I walked up stairs very gently, I went into a room where a man and a woman were talking; I found these things sewed up in a bed, they have been in my possession ever since. After the prisoner was put to the bar for final examination, Higgins said the other prisoner had made a piece of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180019"/> hemp for them, if I would go along with him to the back of Hearn's house, (he keeps a public house near to where the prosecutor lives), he would shew me where he had burried the money in a dirt heap.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise. - A. None at all; he said it at the bar, he called me to him and told me I went with him and Chapman the officer, he told me. where to dig with my cane, and there I found twenty one guineas and a half, two seven shillings pieces, and a gold ring.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. You found Higgins in bed at this house. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He denied committing this robbery. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say as Quin had made a piece of hemp for himself, he would tell you where the money was. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN. - Mr. Knapp. We need not go through all that Trott has told us, tell us whether you heard Quin say any thing or what. - A. When I had Quin in the public house after we had taken him; Trott wanted to go somewhere, he left him with me, Quin said it is bad company that has brought me to it, what have I to say, I shall say when I came before the court, I shall not say any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Look at these articles, and look at the ring first. - A. That is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the watch, was that the watch that you had to keep for Higgins. - A. Yes, it belongs to Higgins all these articles, I have seen them; that is a ribbon that is mine, they are all mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the money in a glove. - A. It was in a glove, but this is not the glove; it is all my property, there is a good deal more missing.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

            . I am a baker. The back door of Mr. East's is right opposite of my house, about fifteen feet distance. About a quarter after two I was in my bakehouse alone, I heard a foot coming over the passage, which is boarded over, and then I heard a good deal of whispering, I heard one man say to the other, is there a light, which caused me to be curious to see what was going forward; I could not see well out of my own bakehouse, I had occasion to go up into my flour loft, on purpose to shoot down a sack of flour; I heard a crashing and wrenching, like a bursting something open, I looked through the hole of the door, there I perceived the prisoner at the bar and another man with him, with something of an instrument, forcing the outer door open; presently the outer door opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this door open while you were looking through the hole. - A. Yes, I never took my eyes off; the inner door has a leaden casement on the top; I saw the prisoner's hands go through to the inside when that door opened; I then returned, as the wind was blowing from the hole at the door, to cough; I had a very bad cold, and with that they all run off.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. The moon shone very bright.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the face of the other man. - A. No, the other man stood in the shade, out of the light of the moon, his hat was over his face; the prisoner stood in the light of the moon, halfway, I could see all his head, shoulder, and back; his face was sideways to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that the prisoner is the man. - A. Yes, I have seen him before, he frequented this public house. I came down and called the watchman, he and I called Mr. East up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the prisoner to East or the watchman. - A. I did, the next day, as well as my knowledge would let me. I knew the prisoner by sight, I never knew his name.</p>

On the 6th of this month Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Nowland, two officers of Lambeth street, informed me that they had one of our men in custody; I attended at the office, and saw the prisoner at the bar; there was some soap produced there, I believe it was our soap, there was some yellow marks upon it, that seem to correspond with the soap we had at home; this soap happened to be put in a frame that had palm soap, and that palm soap had adhered to that soap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any soap - A. We did not miss it, through the quantity that we had in the house.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Whitechapel. - A. Yes; I produce some soap that I found in the prisoner's coat pocket. On the 5th of February, at eight o'clock at night; I was in company with Griffiths; we apprehended him close to a receiving house.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him on suspicion. - A. Yes; he resisted a good deal, he would not be searched; we took him into a public house, opposite where we apprehended him; we found these cakes of soap upon him, he confessed that he had stolen it from his master, we apprehended him; we asked him whether he had sold any at that same shop before, he said never but twice; we asked him his master's name, he said he lived in the city, but he did not chuse to tell us his name; he said if we would let him go we might have the soap. He produced two half guineas, he said he would give us all the money he had in his pocket.</p>

               <p>PETER NORRIS. I work for the prosecutor, I manufacture the soap from these bars into squares for sale. To the best of my knowledge it appears to me to be my master's property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. - Being truly sensible of the enormity of my crime, I have nothing to say in extenuation of the punishment I deserve; I only plead for mercy for the sake of my distressed wife and children. Grant that I may be permitted to the benefit of clergy, and be once more restored to my family, and I will endeavour to render myself a useful member to society. Mercy is all I want; it is what God will shew, and man can grant.</p>

               <p>GEORGE RUSH. I live with Mr. Patrick, Feather-stone street, he is a rope-maker and twine spinner, I am his apprentice. On the 21st of January last, about half past seven o'clock in the morning, I was going up to our ground by the Shepherd and Shepherdess, I saw the prisoner; when I came up to him he asked me whether my master would buy any rope yarn of him, I said that I dare say my master would; he said that if I would come down with him to a little court he would shew it me. I went to this little court, there I saw it, wrapped up in a canvas cloth; it was in a wheelbarrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a large quantity of it. - A. Yes, there was one hundred and eleven pounds; he asked me when I could see my master, I said he could see him at nine o'clock. He brought it up to our ground, he left the yarn, I told my master of it, and I told him I thought it was stolen. He came up to the ground at nine o'clock; my master got an officer and had him taken up.</p>
               <p>- PATRICK. I am a ropemaker, I live at No. 36, Featherstone street. About nine o'clock the prisoner came to me with my apprentice; my apprentice first spoke to me, and then the prisoner said he had some old rope ends to sell; afterwards I understood it was rope yarn. I asked him what he wanted for it, he said sixpence a pound. My apprentice said it was up in the ground. I asked the prisoner what quantity there was of it, he said about half a hundred weight. I asked him whether he was sure there was half a hundred weight, he said he was not quite certain, but whether there was or not, I should have it for half a guinea. He said the property belonged to his brother, but his brother was pressed, he had sent him a letter to dispose of his property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said such a word about my brother at all.</p>
               <p>Patrick. He said his brother worked in the King's yard, and he had an opportunity of coming out now and then, and of bringing out with him so and so, you know what, he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deal with him. - A. No, I went out for an officer, I told him I would meet him on the ground. I went to the ground, and while I was weighing the goods the officer was behind; he took him, and I delivered the goods to the officer.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON. Mr. Patrick came to my house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180023"/> I went with him. When we came near the ground, I sent Mr. Patrick there first, to see if the prisoner was there, I followed, I saw the rope yarn hanging on the steel-yard, the prisoner's back was towards me, he did not see me. Mr. Patrick weighed it, and told him it weighed one hundred and eleven pounds, he asked him what he wanted a pound for it, he said sixpence. Mr. Patrick asked him if he would not take less for it, he said no. He asked him where he lived, he said at Deptford, on board an India ship; he said he must have better account before he bought it. I said, may be he will tell me, I took him in custody. He told me he found it at New Cross, at the time that I apprehended him. I produce the yarn.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITH. I am a twine spinner, I live in Well street, Mile End, New Town. I made this yarn for the East India company, I lost it on the 21st of January, it is marked yarn. I missed the yarn and the piece of canvas at seven o'clock in the morning. I am well convinced it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it. - A. Sixty-three shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never stole it at all from him, I got it from Deptford, near New Cross, I found it, and the canvas covered over it.</p>

On Wednesday the 4th of this month, between the hours of six and seven, I was going down Montague street, about half a mile from the prosecutor's, I was in company with Kennedy and two other officers, I met the two prisoners, one had got a tea kettle in his hand, and the other a tea board; the moment they saw me they separated, White went into the middle of the road, he had got the tea board against his breast. I immediately got hold of him, and the other was stopped by Kennedy. I asked White where he got this tea board; he told me he got it from a man in the Commercial road.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the Commercial road. A. We might be three quarters of a mile; he said he was going to take it to his master's in Saffron hill.

               <p>Mr. Pooley. Was the prisoner Allwright employed by you. - A. Yes, as a weekly servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it par of his employment to receive money for you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any customer that dealt with you of the name of Lake. - A. Yes, Mrs. Lake keeps a chandler's shop at Walworth; she had some goods delivered on the 1st of December. Some time after I sent the prisoner at the bar to see if Mrs. Lake was ready to pay a little bill; he returned the same afternoon, saying Mrs. Lake had only paid one guinea, and that she had borrowed; the boy is here that was in the shop, that took the guinea of him, and handed it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his hand writing. - A. I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter, is it his hand writing. - A. I received this letter after the first night he was taken up; this is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made this charge against him before you received this letter. - A. Yes. (The letter read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention it to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This young man had been in business for himself before he came to you; he had unfortunately failed. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an object to you to have a person that had some customers that he might recommend to you. - A. It might be of service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not agree that he should have a certain commission upon all these goods that he should dispose of to his own customers. - A. Before he came to live with me as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever live with you as a servant. - A. Yes, first of all when he came to me, he asked me if I would send some goods to customers that he knew of, and allow him a commission for his own trouble; I said I had no objection if he would send good customers, he said he would send goods to no customers but what would pay the money in consequence of that; as I was going out of Thames street, he said he would help me to move, I then told him he should be a servant at fourteen shillings a week and his victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you whether or not you did agree that you would furnish his own customers with goods provided he did or would guarantee the payments. - A. I never did. I allowed him a little commission money that he might put something into his pocket, but not for him to guarantee the debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a dispute between him and you about that commission. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he claim nineteen shillings as commission due. - A. He never did, he summoned me for nineteen shillings; but I do not know what it was for.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that summons before or after you knew that the money had been received of Mrs. Lake. - A. After the 16th of January the money had been received of Mrs. Lake; we knew it before he claimed the nineteen shillings; he came to me on Monday the 26th of January, I owed him for a week's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. That was fourteen shillings; instead of that you gave him twelve shillings. - A. He was not a person that exactly suited us, he wished to be master.</p>
               <p>Q. He summoned you, and that was the day that you took him in charge of felony. - A. That was the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You never charged him with it before. - A. I did not know where to find him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you meet him in Tottenham Court road, and assaulted him there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He took out a warrant for your knocking him down in Tottenham Court road; when you went to the police office, you knew that Mrs. Lake had paid him the two pound two shillings; did not he attend at Worship street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of that you appeared at at the police office. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that Mrs. Lake had paid him the two pound two shillings. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was bound over for this assault. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not know where to find him, you met with him in Tottenham Court road, and next at the Police office; was it not where you attended to the summons at Fuller's Rents, Holborn, that you met with him there, and took him in custoday. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When he brought you the guinea, did not he claim any part of the money for commission - A. He never mentioned any thing of the sort, he came home and said, Mrs. Lake had paid only one guinea, he entered it in the book, the book is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner went after he quitted your service. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you not know that his friends had taken a situation for him. - A. I knew that they had taken a house somewhere at Islington; he said when he came in the shop, when I was paying him his weeks wages; I have been round and served the customers from another shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know at that time that Mrs. Lake had paid him the two guineas. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that these goods were furnished by you for Mrs. Lake, that she was a customer of his, how much was he to receive out of Mrs. Lake's money. - A. Two shillings, I believe.</p>

I did, a quarter before nine in the morning; he came down the yard, and into the warehouse, no further than where the copper lay; I kept my eye on him, he had not been there five minutes before he went out again; I directly went to the copper and missed three cakes, I called to my fellow servant to come after me, I says he has got it with him; the prisoner was then just got into Thames street to the gates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him. - A. No further than when he shut the wicket. I came up with him about twenty or thirty yards from the gates; I told my fellow servant to get a constable directly; the prisoner said, for God sake, Griffith, do not be too hard with me; I brought him back, and as he came just to the gate the pocket dropped away with the weight of the copper; I saw two cakes drop out; the constable searched him and found another.</p>

On Saturday the 24th of January, I saw the prisoner brought back in the custody of Powell, I saw the prisoner's pocket give way; I saw two cakes of copper fall.

On the 13th of January she was dismissed about eight or nine o'clock; on the 14th, when the time of winding up the watches came, I missed three more. In the evening my man takes the watches down to the safe, and deposits them, and he comes up again with the box; in the morning he takes them up again, he comes up with one box first, the safe is left open while he comes for another parcel; I judge she went to the safe and took them. When I missed them, I supposed it must be her, I went with the officer who is present to apprehend her, he searched her, and found two tickets, and one watch was found upon her. There were produced before the lord mayor, five watches, two by the pawnbrokers, and two by Mr. Aldridge, and one that was found in the water closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the owner of the house. - A. I have the lease of the house. I have two sisters live in the house, they have nothing to do with the rent of the house, they have one third of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her. - A. A very good character with her; I turned her away for being so dirty, I dismissed her before I missed all the watches.</p>
               <p>MR. ALDRIDGE. On Tuesday evening the prisoner at the bar came to my house, about eight o'clock in the evening; she said she wanted a gold key, I shewed her some, she fixed on one, then she asked me if I bought watches, I said no, not on my own judgment, not being acquainted with watches, but that I would shew them to a watchmaker, and get them valued; if she would call again the next day at twelve o'clock she should know the value of them. She came the next morning at ten o'clock, I had not shewn them to the maker then; she said that she wanted to go to Brighton with her mother and a child that was bit by a og, that made her call so soon, it would be near a fortnight before she returned; she wanted some money in order<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180027"/> to defray the expences. With that she said I should have the two watches all the time; she had a guinea first and then I lent her four shillings, I was to keep the watches till she returned. She came no more. The next day the city marshall came from my lord mayor, to let me know that she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the young woman. - A. I should not know her now, I swore to her before the magistrate; she was then in a pelisse, in the same state as when she came to my shop not in that state she is now.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. I have known the prisoner about four months. The first time she came was on the 4th of July, she came till she could get a place; she continued with me about three months, before she could get a place, she had her provision and lodging for nothing, she was a countrywoman's of my wife, she came from Dartmouth; she got a place, and staid about a fortnight, she came back again, and was with us about a fortnight, and then she went away. She said she was going to her aunt's, she left one of her boxes, she came for it on the 15th of December, she went up to her box, and that was the time I suspected she took the forty pounds and the two guineas, as my wife was busy washing. On the 22nd of December I went up stairs to get the note and the money, it was gone; the money was in a tin case in a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Where was this pocket book. - A. In a drawer in a chest in the one pair of stairs room.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 10th of January last I apprehended the prisoner at the bar near Yarmouth in Suffolk. I told her I came to apprehend her upon this charge; she seemed very much alarmed. I told her to pull her pockets out, that I might see what was in them. I found in her pocket a small pocket book, containing a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a bunch of small keys. I then asked her if she had any box there, she said she had only one trunk, she pointed towards the trunk that was there, I said I must go to it. I had to go round a mahogany table, it was a genteel house where I took her, at a relations. While I was trying to undo the trunk, she said she would not be taken to London, she said I will sooner do this first. I was then stooping down to unlock the trunk; she was dressed in a habit shirt, and she pulled it down, I saw her draw something across her throat, I did not see what it was; the guard of the mail coach was there at the time that I went down with. He caught hold of her arm, and then I returned round the table, seeing the blood come from her neck; presently after, I got the knife from her, but not till we had cut her thumb. In pressing her wrist a great deal, I believe I hurt her thumb. Afterwards I unlocked her trunk, I found nothing in it but wearing apparel; she said she had took the forty pound note, but the two guineas she said she had not. She said she took it for some imprudent liberties that I did not think it prudent to ask her about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her at all. - A. No more than asking her if she was guilty of the crime. She was in that agonising state after she had attempted to cut her throat, what she said was so incoherent you could hardly understand her, and indeed from the flurry that she was in, and the blood flowing, she was cut an inch and a half; she bled so much that her clothes were obliged to be taken off. I asked her where she got the the knife, I was certain that she had no knife in her pocket. She said she took it out of a workbag.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIBBONS. I am clerk in the bank. The forty pound note was paid in the bank by Dawson and Co.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Have you any body from Chancery lane. - A. No.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Knight; the prisoner came into the shop this morning, and asked to see some pins. I shewed him some of several sorts, he said they were all too large. I left the drawer on the counter and went up stairs for more; Mr. Knight was behind the counter, and the shopman. I returned and told him we had no smaller, and took the drawer away. On my return, he was looking at the saws, I observed him look round the shop, and shuffling his hand into his pocket. I observed him do it a second time, I then went to him, and he paid me for one saw; he asked me then to let him see some shears; I went up stairs and shewed him some, they did not suit him. He was going out of the shop, I then stopped him, I told him that he had got some saws that he had not paid for. He took one saw out of his left hand coat pocket. I called Mr. Knight, and he took him to the accounting house.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Penton; the prisoner came to work between six and seven o'clock in the morning, he came to about three yards off me, where there was a quantity of metal in a cask; he made a stoop over the cask, I was rather confident that he took something out of it. I communicated the circumstance to Dowton, and while we were talking the prisoner went into the street, we both went after him. Dowton laid hold of him by the collar and asked him where he was going, he said he was going to get a glass of gin. Dowton put his hand in his pocket and felt the metal there. I saw him take it out, it weighs eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>- DOWTON. I took it out of the prisoner's pocket. I can swear it is Mr. Penton's property.</p>

            . Q. Are you an officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being applied to by Hurley - A. He came to my house on the 10th of last month, he informed me that he had been robbed by a man of the name of Baldwyn of fourteen guineas, and as many half guineas as amounted to thirty guineas, chiefly of the old coin, and that the half guineas were almost new ones.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the money that you found upon the prisoner. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take you to where the prisoner Baldwyn was. - A. He did, he took me to a public house in Gibraltar row, St Georges fields; he pointed out the prisoner to me. I took the prisoner into a private room, I asked him how he came to rob this man, he denied having any knowledge of him. I told him I was a police officer, I must search him; he behaved in a very violent manner, I was obliged to throw him down. After that he behaved more quiet, and suffered me to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not asked him many questions. - A. No, I searched him. In one waistcoat pocket I found a watch, in the other waistcoat pocket I found a leather bag, which contained twelve guineas and fifteen half guineas. Hurley then described the pieces of linen rags which the money was wrapped up in. I searched him again; I found them in the inside pocket of the prisoner's jacket. I produce the fifteen half guineas, the twelve guineas, and the two pieces of rag. I asked the prisoner how he counted for having all this money about him, he said it was his own money what he had worked for.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched the prisoner you said the prosecutor described the sort of money, did he say whether it was in a purse or not. - A. He did not tell me before I found it, he told me what the money was before I found it, after I found the money he told me there were two pieces of rag and a piece of black silk, that was before I found the rag, and which he said he should know. These are the two pieces of rag.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You said that your money was wrapped up in a peice of black silk and two pieces of linen rag, you saw it before, when it was found upon the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that rag do you know it. - A. Yes, that rag that was outside of the black silk, and this was the outside of all it has a remarkable mark, I told the officer what kind they were before I saw any of them</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark. - A. It is hem'd just in this part; the outer one had no mark only the length, and it had a rent in the middle. I told the officer the length of this, I am certain of these two piece of linen they are mine, that I can swear to, and that my money was wrapped up in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the money, I take it for granted there is none of them you can speak particularly to, - A. I have been three years working for them; one half guinea is bent like a six-pence, and the other half guinea is bent a little at the edge. If he has not made away with them, I can swear to them. These are the two half guineas (witness showing it).</p>
               <p>Q.(to Lockey.) Before you searched the man, did he describe any particular money having any particular mark. - A. I believe he did, I am not quite positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford (to Prosecutor.) You do not mean to swear to the two half guineas. - A. I will not swear to the two half guineas, I will swear to the linen, I am positive to the linen.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner did not come home that night. - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>MRS. CROWLEY Q. This man and the prisoner lodged in your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is it in. - A. Saint Ann's, Lime-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is Saint Ann, Middlesex, commonly called Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mrs. Crowley) Were you out on the day this man called you up. - A. No, I was at home all the day till between ten and eleven o'clock; I went out, and while I was gone out the prisoner went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go out so late on that day. - A. I do not know, he never staid so late before, when I went out I left the prisoner at home.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to know the prisoner was at home. - A Because the child told me that he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. That I cannot hear, you do not know that he was at home when you went out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had lodged with you how long. - A. About four moths as nigh, as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him have a quantity of money. - A. Never but a very little indeed, I never saw him have any, he always pleaded very poor, I do not know whether he was or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you for your lodgings. - A. He always paid me regular if he did not pay one week he did another.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford How many lodgers had you: - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband. - A. He is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your employment. - A. I do any thing that I can get, and sometimes I go out to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out at the time this happened. - A. I had been out four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the Monday till Thursday you were out at work. - A. Yes, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband goes out to work. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who takes care of the house. - A. Why the door of the house is generally locked, my husband comes backwards and forwards to the house and gets his meals, and then he locks the door. I was at a neighbour's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the key left with. - A. The children.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether the children left the door open you cannot say; then both you and your husband<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180032"/> was absent from Monday to Thursday, and during that time the key was left with the children. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, this is the first time that I have had occasion to stand before a bar. What I am charged with here I am totally innocent of. I was born in Hampshire of honest parents, who inculcated into me honest principles. I was brought by my father to Mr. Cook's in St. George's fields, in whose employment I continued for a considerable length of time, and from whom I generally earned two pounds a week. From there I went to Wapping wall, in whose employ I was when this unfortunate circumstance happened; I only mention this circumstance to satisfy you, my lord, and the gentlemen of the jury, that I had a better opportunity of having money of my own than the prosecutor, who is only a hammerman, and can get only eighteen shillings a week. On the morning this happened, I found myself incapable of going to work, so from there I went to St. George's fields to my old shopmates, they persuaded me to stop the night. On the next day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I was taken in custody. I humbly submit to your consideration, if my prosecutor can swear to money, that is the grand criterion: he in madness of despair, because it was lost, swore that one of the half guineas was crooked. If he had any private mark on the money he would have shewn it. Under the foregoing circumstances, my prosecutor might have sworn to the money of any one in court as well as mine. Therefore I submit my case to you, hoping I shall have an acquittal.</p>

            . I am a Chinaman. On the 15th of February, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and a lad with him, loitering about for half an hour, I kept my eye upon them, from their appearance, to see what they were about to do. I saw them both at Mr. Martyn's door, they were both in the act of lifting off a bundle of shoes from a hook, they were tied in a bundle together; the prisoner at the bar had a sacking apron on him. When they were taken off the hook he held his apron up, and they were thrown into his apron. I judged they were coming towards me, instead of which they went up Marybone lane. I had a door in my warehouse that led there, I went through after them, and in the middle of the road, about ten yards further, I laid hold of the prisoner; the other boy made his escape. I brought him to Mr. Martyn's, he not being at home I took him to the watchhouse. I delivered the shoes to the constable.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>

I ran from the parlour into the shop, I met Mr. Baddely at the door, he said some man had taken a desk. I ran thirteen or fourteen doors off, I met the prisoner with the desk in his hand. Being in a public situation, an hundred people came to my assistance. The man made no resistance, he came back with me, I laid hold of him myself.</p>

               <p>Q. In that stye that you made for them. - A. Yes, I left home to bring some sheep from a field at Mill-hill, for

             up, and while I was waiting for the drover, this man came on the road driving my pigs; it was near half past four then; I asked him where he was going with the pigs, he did not make me any answer; I said they were my pigs; then he said he was taking them to the pound; I asked him what was the reason that he did not leave them as he came past the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. He had come past the pound had he. - A. Yes, he said he was quite a stranger to the place, and he thought the pound had been further on. I asked him what he did with such a nice little whip to drive pigs with; he said that he found it on the road, coming from Baldock on Sunday. Then Mr. Harris and I took him in custody, and we called up Mr. Cooper the constable at Hendon, and gave him charge of him; he secured him in the cage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the pigs were your pigs. - A. Yes, they were at Mr. Cooper's that day, and the next I took them home on the Tuesday evening; I saw them at home when I left home this morning. The prisoner said he was quite a stranger to the place at day light; I found he was very well known, so far as being thereabouts in the summer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor knew me before. - A. I never saw him before to my knowledge, more than that he said he was a stranger to the place.</p>

            . Q. Was you with the last witness on the 26th of January. - A. Yes, he called me up about four o'clock, he brought a few sheep; he asked me if I would let them come along with mine to Smithfield market as I was a coming down there; I got up and struck a light and came down to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person driving pigs. - A. Yes, I went to Bettel, he was out side my gates, waiting for the drover; we saw a man coming in the road, that was a little before five, apparently driving of something; it was a moonlight morning; we had the curiosity to o to meet him in the road, to see what he had got; when we got to him, Bettel said to the prisoner where are you going with them pigs, these are my pigs, I looked at the pigs; I knew them; I directly whipped up to the prisoner at the bar, and took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the pigs. - A. I knew the pigs, they went home with some sheep of mine after he bought them. When I laid hold of the prisoner he seemed to be confused; he did not speak for a minute; then he said he found these pigs in the road, and he was going to take them to the pound; I said you have come by the pound; I said to Bettel you had better go and call

             the constable to come and secure him. While Bettel was calling the constable, the prisoner at the bar says to me, as soon as Bettel was come back, you are two poor men; and I am a poor man, I have half a guinea; I will give you that to let me go; we delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(to prosecutor) Did not you ask me where I was going with the pigs; you said they are my pigs, I said take them, I said they are not mine. - A, You said they were not your own, you were driving them on the road, about a mile and a half from my house.</p>
               <p>COOPER. I am a constable, I was called up about half past four, and the prisoner at the bar was delivered into my charge; I put him into my yard till the next day Monday morning; then I conveyed him to Hatton Garden office; he begged that we would not hurt him; he did not mind what he gave.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been very bad, and I had been down in the country a good bit, for three quarters of a year. I was coming out of the country; I came as far as Barnet, that was Sunday night; I stopped there to refresh myself; I wanted to get to town; I had a few shillings to take of one man there; a poor man came in and had not got money to pay for a pot of beer, he had got a whip, I bought the whip of him; I did not know where he had left it, a man says the whip is in my house; I went and fetched it, I took it with me as a walking stick, I set down in Mill hill, with that I came to that man's house; I met a man and a dog, he wished me good morning; and I wished him good morning; when I came a good distance on the road, I saw four pigs, I went back to this gentleman's house; I was in hopes of getting something to drink; I went to the door, I did not lift up the latch, I did not see any body; I drove the pigs along seeing nobody; I tried to put them in a farm yard, I was very well known in that neighbourhood; I could not get in; the gate was locked. Then I tried another farm yard; I shut them in there, and I set down in the rick yard, being poorly; and when I came out of the rick yard, two of these pigs went out of the yard; then I let the other two out; I knew there were some pens at the watchhouse. I drove them a little way on, I saw two men stand in the road, I was in hopes they were watchmen, the pigs were at a distance from me; I heard the owner say, they are my pigs; when I came up the man said, where are you going with these pigs; says I; I am going to put them in the pound; I called that the same as the pound; he says they are my pigs, I says then if they be your pigs, take them; I knew they are not mine. I told them I always thought there were watchmen here: if I had stolen the pigs, I could have turned down two roads, a mile and a half from there; I had no thought of doing such a thing; I have done my best to take care of the pigs for the owner; I says I am a poor man, and you are a poor man, I do not wish to take any thing from any body; I have one half guinea in my pocket, I will sooner give you the half guinea, than be put in this place, and I will give you my address where I live.</p>

               <p>Q. What shop does she keep. - A.Her husband is a blacksmith, he keeps a shop of ironmongery, and buys old iron; I then lifted the latch of the front door to try to get in; I found it was fast; I went round to the back door, I left Thomas at the front door; when I came to the back door it was fast, when I got back again Thomas had got into the house; I went in to him at the front door, and Thomas had hold of Randall by the collar, and these nails were lying on the floor; and the woman at the bar was standing close by him. I then asked Randall where he got the nails; he says what nails, I know nothing of any nails, I brought none here; I then asked Mrs. Hill where she got the nails, (pointing to the nails on the floor); she told me that she had them of the prisoner Randall; they were both standing together, he said not a word. I then took Randall to the office; I searched him; I found two nails in the inside of each pocket; as I was carrying him to the office, I asked him what yard he worked in; he said he worked in no yard at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You do not know that this woman was in the shop at the time this man went into the shop. - A. I cannot say that she was, she was there when I went in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing after he lifted up the latch. - A. I heard a jingling, as if iron nails had been put in the scale; I went in the shop; Mrs. Hill turned the nails out of the scale into her apron, and went immediately into the back parlour; I asked her what she did with the nails that she took out of the scale; she said, what nails; I said the nails that you had from the carpenter that just come in with them. She then threw the nails out of her apron on the floor; I turned my head then and saw Randall; I took hold of him, he was just by the door; we took Randall to the office; I saw the two nails taken out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house broken open. - A. Yes, I was at home between five and six in the evening; the prisoners were brought into me by the witnesses; they said they had caught them in the fact of breaking my window and robbing me, and they produced the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Between five and six o'clock you could discern the features of a man's face, did the prisoners say any thing upon that charge. - A. They denied it.</p>
               <p>- NASH. I am an optician. On the 26th of January I was going along the Strand, I stopped at Southampton street with a relation of mine. The first I observed of the prisoners they were at Mr. Granger's window, a woollen draper's. I went and fetched my shopmates Owen and Tudor, with intent to take the prisoners. When I returned I saw Wainwright first at a cutler's shop window, and then he went to Mr. Warne's window; we saw it was cut, we walked by there, and we went of the other side of the way; we saw the other prisoner standing by the post at Adam street. My two shop-mates and me went by him, and we crossed the way. and then I took hold of Wainwright by the shoulder, and Mr. Owen took hold of him by the other side; he dropped a pair of stockings and a pair of braces; and Mr. Tudor caught them almost before they fell to the ground; we took him into Mr. Warne's shop; we went and took the other as he was standing at the post with the remainder of the stockings in his apron. We took him to Mr. Warne's with the stockings, and afterwards took him to the watchhouse. They behaved in a desperate manner; they said a knife would be my death within a fortnight.</p>

            . Nash came to inform me he wanted assistance to secure the prisoners; we went with him, and we passed a cutler's shop. Wainwright was at that window when we passed, he says that is one of them; we crossed over the way, and we saw the other prisoner at the post the corner of Adam street; we crossed over the way again. Wainwright was at Mr. Warne's window, they collared him; he unbuttoned his coat and the stockings dropped down. I picked them up almost before they came to the ground; they left me with Wainwright while they went and fetched Matthews.</p>
               <p>Matthew's Defence. I went to work on Monday morning, apparently my master had not much work for me to do, I went into St. James's park, and from there to Blackwall. I was returning along the Strand, when three men laid hold of me, they carried me into the shop of Mr. Warne, they charged me with robbing this shop, and one of these men said I had the gallows in my face, and I should sure to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Wainwright said nothing in his defence.</p>

On the 3d of February last I was on duty in Kingsland road; about eight o'clock in the evening, as I was passing by the King's arms, I saw the prisoner with a sack hanging over his shoulder, part of the oats were behind in the sack and part before. I asked him what he had got there; his answer was, what was that to me, I asked him where he was going, he said to the Lamb. We took him into the King's arms, there he said he had them from where he was at work at Hornsey; I looked at the sack; I told Bacon, a brother officer all was right; Bacon said you work for Mr. Willan do not you; he then said yes; and these are Mr. Willan's oats, he said yes.

Miss Stears asked me to come and take care of her lodgings, she was going in the country for a week; in consequence of my being there to take care of the lodging; I had some clothes there; and Jenkins locked them up in a box of hers. I asked her several times to let me have the clothes out of the box, and she always said that she forgot to bring the key of the box from Miss Stears. Friday after Christmas day Jenkins came in the morning; she asked me to take a letter to her brother; the while I was gone she went away with my clothes in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that. - A. Because she went away; on my return I missed the prisoner and the box containing my clothes, I saw no more of her till I saw her at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that afterwards. - A. I think it might be about five weeks afterwards.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Portsoken ward, Aldgate. On the 6th of February, between the hours of seven and eight, I met the prisoner in Aldgate High street, with a parcel, which I had suspicion that he had not honestly come by; after he had past by me, I turned round and followed him as far as Black horse yard, in Aldgate; he turned into the yard, and there I stopped him. I asked him what parcel he had got under his arm, he made reply, what did I think; I made reply that I might think a great many things before I thought right. I asked him where he brought it from, he told me he should not tell me; by his not giving a satisfactory account, I took him into custody. Then he informed me that a man gave him the parcel, at the corner of Hounsditch. I asked him if he could find that man, he said no; he informed me that he meant to sell them at the first iron shop that he came to. I took him to the watchhouse, there I searched him. I found four parcels of rings, and fourteen guineas upon his person. The bundle he was carrying was two dozen of locks and I do not know how many thousand nails.</p>
               <p>- MIDDLETON. Q. You were in company with Forrester. - A. Yes, we stopped him at Black horse yard, I took the parcel from under his arm; Forrester searched him, and took out these parcels from his pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was guilty, I got them of a man at Hounsditch; he told me to bring them as far as Petticoat lane, he said he would pay me so much to carry them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse the prisoner of taking it. - A. He came at half past nine o'clock and rang the bell; he said there was a chaise ordered for Mr. Warren at ten o'clock on Sunday morning, and he came to know where they were to go to, as Mr. Shephard forgot to ask him. I said I do not think there was one ordered, he said he was sure there was. I went to the pantry to ask the butler whether there was one ordered; in the mean time he went off with the great coat; the butler pursued him. I have seen the coat again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear that I went and took the coat from the hall. - A. I can.</p>

            . I am a butler. On Saturday the 11th, at half past nine in the evening, from information, when I went into the hall, I missed the coat that used to lay upon the table; I saw the prisoner going out of the front door, I hallooed to him, stop thief; he went out of the door, he threw the coat in the channel, I hallooed stop thief; the watchman stopped him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take the coat. - A.I saw you throw it in the channel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did not see me with the coat.</p>
               <p>Witness. We brought him back to the house; he acknowledged that he took the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will swear any man's life away, I can bring forward people that will prove it.</p>
               <p>- KEARN. Q. You are the watchman. - A. Yes, I heard this man call out stop thief; I stopped the prisoner a few doors from Mr. Warren's house; I brought him down to Mr. Warren's hall; he acknowledged that he was guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not the person that did it, the great coat laid on the curb stone. It was not in the channel, there was some men in the street before me running away.</p>

When I came back again he was still standing there in the same manner, and much about the same place; I am certain it is him, I pointed him out immediately I saw him. I afterwards observed that the two persons that came to administer joined together with him after they had been sworn; this took place on the 3d of April. On the 5th, the same persons who had been to my office on the 3d, came to the office, and received letters of administration of me.</p>

I saw them come back again and Monk went into Mr. Ward's house, and, I believe, Gibbons, I am not sure of that. When they came but, we all joined company and went away together; they were to call in two days for the administration. On the day they were to call for the administration it was coming off guard; I was to meet them at the public house in the street were Mr. Ward lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet them there. - A. Yes, I met Monk and Gibbons. We went down to Greenwich hospital. Monk went into the office there, and I was to wait outside of the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which office it is. - A. He went into one of the further side of the yard first, and then he went into another. I waited at the outside about twenty minutes; he returned to me after he came out of the office and he (Monk) gave Gibbons twenty four pounds one shilling and sixpence; Gibbons took it and gave him what he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your share. - A. Two pounds fifteen. I believe Monk had about four or five pounds, and Gibbons had the remainder for paying for the administration and the coach hire.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Monk. - A. I have known Monk these two years or more.</p>

No, I never knew him by the name of Nugent only as going to Doctor's-commons; Gibbons said it was no harm to nobody going in the name of Nugent; he chose that name, he said it was a sure one. Monk and Knight said they knew he was dead. Knight said he had no relations at all; that he was to go as his brother.</p>

I asked the prisoner if he did not mean two horses, he said he did I then shewed the draft to some of the clerks that were standing by, to submit it to their judgment whether it was the signature of Mr. Dyson; and then I told the prisoner that the signature was different to the signature of Mr. H. Dyson, and before I paid it, I must submit it to our partners for their approbation. Mr. Prescott was up stairs; I went and shewed the draft to him; then I come down stairs and told the prisoner that the signature was so different from Mr. Dyson's, we could not pay the draft without going to Mr. Dyson to ascertain it. The prisoner said it would be a very great inconvenience if he had not the money. I accordingly agreed with the prisoner that he should sustain no inconvenience, and that if the signature was Mr. Dyson's, I should take the money with me; the prisoner was to accompany me to Mr. Dyson's house. The prisoner made no objection to go with me; I immediately sent our porter for a coach. I had occasion to go to another part of our office to another person; the prisoner took the opportunity of going out of the door. Of course the coach came, and I went up to Mr. Dyson to apprize him of what had happened, and that the prisoner was gone away.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen him write. - A. I have seen him write occasionally, and paid him a great many checks.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the draft. - A. Yes; I believed it not to be his hand writing. I should not venture to pay upon it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How soon did you see the prisoner afterwards. - A. In about a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him next. - A. I saw him at the mansion house. I think, on the Tuesday week following; he was brought up there upon another charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that you saw at the mansion house, before the lord mayor, the same person that you saw in the shop, and the same person that tendered the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180043"/> draft. - A. Exactly the same. I have no doubt at all in my mind about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore when you had a doubt, you would not venture to say it is the hand writing of Mr. Dyson. - A. No, I would not venture to pay upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner at the bar went away when you called for a coach - you are confident it is the same person. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him after this was about ten days afterwards, and then you saw him at the mansion house. - A. Yes, he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him at the mansion house, did you charge him that he was the person that presented the draft. - A. I merely went when I heard that he was to be brought up; I was desired by our partners to go and see if it was the same man or not.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer to my question - did you or not when you saw him before the lord mayor, state to the lord mayor that the prisoner at the bar was the person that attempted to defraud your house. - A. No, no charge was made then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before a charge was made. - A. The lord mayor ordered him for re-examination on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for aught you knew, the prisoner might have been discharged. - A. No, he could not, because our charge had not been gone into.</p>
               <p>Q. Your complaint was not on the first examination, but the second; therefore he might have been discharged before the second. - A. No, I attended on the first day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no charge against the prisoner at the bar. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no charge on the first examination; three days afterwards he was examined again, and then you made the charge. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are confident it is the same man. - A. I am confident it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not that confidence arise from something subsequent, and not from the impression that arose when you first attended before the lord mayor. - A. It arose from the recollection I had in my mind; it is still strong in my mind. I should be sorry to say he is not the man that tendered me the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not that positiveness that you now entertain, arise from something that has taken place subsequent to your attending at the mansion house. - A. It does not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me that at the time when you first attended at the mansion house you were positively certain that the prisoner at the bar was the man that tendered you the note. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you charge him then. - A. Mr. Prescott said our charge was not to be preferred that day; I might go to the mansion house to see whether it was the man or not; he understood he was to be remanded for another examination, when our charge was to be made.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Dyson kept money at your house. - A. Ever since I have been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps were not very well acquainted with his hand writing. - A. Yes; I have paid several of his checks, and I have occasionally seen him write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you first saw the prisoner at the mansion house he was there under examination, and he was going to be remanded for another examination. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then your charge was to be made. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt of the prisoner at the bar, from the first time that you saw him at the mansion house, down to the present time you are now speaking about it. - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>

               <p>Q. That person presented the draft to you from Mr. Lowndes for payment. - A. He did; the moment he put the draft into my hands, it struck me that it was not the hand writing of Mr. Lowndes. I then asked him who he came from, he referred me to Mr. Bray's, No. 3, Water lane. I shewed the draft to Mr: Clark, a gentleman in the office, who went into one of the partners.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Lowndes. - A. Yes, and Mr. Lowndes denied its being his hand writing. Mr. Lowndes said I must be taken in custody, unless I could give a good account who I had it from. I told him I did not know the man's name; I had heard his name several times, but I could not recollect it at that moment. I described the person, and that he was waiting near the banking house, or the palace gates. We went to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you. - A. Mr. Steel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come up to the prisoner there. - A. Yes, the prisoner said he did not know it was a bad note; he found it in a letter in Grovesnor square. Then the prisoner was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. Can you read or write. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had put no mark on this check before you went to the bankers. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say whether it is the same check or no. - A. I have not the least doubt but what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180045"/> it is, I had read it before I delivered it.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. Miss Barr, I believe you received a letter from the country, forwarded by the last witness. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter (a letter handed to the witness). - A. That is the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you received it of course you opened it, did you find any thing in it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any draft or check from the bankers in the letter. - A. No, as I received it so I lost it. On the Sunday afternoon I took it up to Argyle street; going home on Sunday evening I folded it up and put it in my muff; I lost it out of my muff going home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. To be sure you put nothing in it; you cannot tell what any body else might; it was open when you lost it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was nothing in it when you received it, nor did you expect it. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been in the habit of receiving any draft from this gentleman. - A. No. (The check read in court).</p>

I was; and about one o'clock in the morning, three men forced me from the party of gentlemen that I was conversing with into the crowd; I was before out of the crowd, and they pushed me one against the other; I turned round to ask what they meant by it, and they made off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the period had you perceived that you had lost any thing. - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their making off what did you do. - A. I put my hand to my fob, I found my watch was gone; I immediately went to Townshend the officer, and told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon afterwards did you see your watch or the prisoner. - A. I saw my watch the next morning; I was not by when the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. We all know it is a crowded place, and a great deal of confusion. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They huslted you about, you could not perceive your watch was gone from you. - A. No, I did not indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. You were at this masquerade. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. About three o'clock did you see any person pursued for picking a pocket. - A. About three o'clock, as I was returning from the supper room at the masquerade, I was returning down stairs, I heard the cry of stop thief; I perceived the prisoner pursued by several persons. I took hold of the prisoner as he was endeavouring to pass me: on which he threw or dropped from his hand a watch. I picked it up, still continuing holding of the prisoner, until we were against the partition of the bottom of the stairs, where I held him a short time, till Petherick took hold of him. The prisoner wanted us to let him go, he said we had no business with him. Previous to my delivering him to the officer, some other gentleman came up and assisted, when he dropped another watch. The first watch I kept possession of; and I took it to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it there shewn to Mr. Hembry. - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any lambs on the 28th of January. - A. Yes, I had seventeen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last. - A. On the 29th of January last, I saw them about ten o'clock in the day. I missed them on Friday the 30th of January, about ten or eleven o'clock; one was six weeks old, and this, I think, was about five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put any ochre marks on them. - A. I had; the ram lambs were red upon the head, and the ewe lambs upon the head and loins. They were both ewe lambs that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any suspicion that you had, go to Groves's house. - A. I went to Groves's house on Monday morning about ten o'clock; Groves lives at Mill Hill, it is within two miles of my house. I only saw the woman when I went into the house. I saw two lambs dash out of the cupboard, one of my two lambs were behind them; as soon as I saw it, I knew them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What lamb was that. - A. An ewe lamb, that I took to Hatton Garden. I put it to its mother, and the mother took it, they both maa'd together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark to it. - A. The same as this, it was marked on the head and loins.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was one of your lambs. - A. I know it is; because I put it to suckle to a blind sheep, its mother. The mother knew it directly, they both bleated together as soon as I put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else at Groves's house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Groves there. - A. No, he was not there. I went and fetched Mr. Stratton; the gardener shewed us where he was loading of hay. That was the Monday following after he stole the lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same Monday that you found the lambs. A. Yes, the same Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you took him for. - A. Yes. He wanted to know what we wanted him for; we told him it was for stealing of lambs. He said he had no lambs but what he had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any information take Groves into custody. - A. Yes, we took Groves into custody; Groves told us where this black-legged lamb was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any thing was said by Groves, did not you say you did not want to hurt him. - A. Not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of information search Groves's house again. - A. Yes. I found a young lamb that belonged to Mr. Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other lamb there. - A. No, this was in the cupboard that we had missed when we looked there. We went to Holmes's at Highgate hill, and there we met the father-in-law and his wife; Holmes was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told Holmes it would be better for him to confess. - A. No, not then. His wife came and said, if you can settle it, Mr. Mallard, I will tell you where the black-legged ram is, she says, if you will let Holmes go and make it up, and not hurt him. I said, very likely I may.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what she said, did you find the lamb. - A. I went home with the woman; she pulled it from underneath the bed, the flesh was warm, it was black in the fore legs, and it had the ochre mark on the back and loins. I am sure it is my lamb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Should you have been sure of it, if you had not been told by the woman. - A. As for the blind ewe's lamb, I should have known it if I had been turned into it blindfold.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the day that you searched Holmes's house. - A. On Monday, about nine o'clock on the same day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. These lambs were not of an age to sell in the market. - A. No, they were not of age to take away from the mother; they were not old enough to sell in the market.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did the prisoners live to one another. A. They lived close together, both houses joined.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the lamb that was produced from one of these sheep. - A. Yes; it was nearly a week old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time miss that lamb. - A. Yes, I missed it on the 30th; I saw it again on the Tuesday following at Hatton Garden.

On Wednesday the 11th of February, the prisoner was brought to the office by Harper, who is at this time unwell; he had been searched by Harper; Harper delivered to me a pound note in the presence of the prisoner. I searched the prisoner after that in the office, and on him I found two seven shilling pieces; he told me he got them from the Three Tuns in Ironmonger row, in change of a one pound note. I told the prisoner there was no such sign there whatever; before Mr. Moser he said he was drunk, and he was sorry for what he had done.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not pay rent nor taxes; does your brother ever lie there. - A. No; the lease is in his name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose these goods. - A. On the 17th of this month I was sitting at breakfast in the parlour behind the shop, about half after eight o'clock; on turning my head towards the shop, I saw a man crossing the side of the shop towards the door; I immediately ran into the shop and caught him by the skirt of his coat, before he had got out of the door, and at the moment of seizing him by the coat, one pair of boots dropped either from under his arm, or from under his coat. I took him by the collar and forced him across the shop into a chair, and on looking on the floor I saw a large bag. I desired my wife, and them that were in the shop, to take the contents out of the bag; they did; it proved to be three pair and an odd boot that was in the bag. I am sure they are my property; the name is marked in full length on the inside of the tops; there are the boots; they are all new, and were hanging on the inside of the shop on brass hooks on a rail.</p>

I had suspicion; I sent for her grand daughter to come and see if her grandmother's property was safe I went up to Mrs. Powell's apartment, the prisoner was sitting on her bed; I asked how she could be so cruel after Mrs. Powell had been so kind to take her in, for to take her property from her. I then told her if she had any of it to produce it; I would have a constable and search her if she did not. She then produced nineteen shillings and sixpence farthing, I said to her this is not all you have left out of the seven guineas. She said she did not take seven guineas, she only took four. I heard her confess that the clothes that she had bought was with the money that she took from Mrs. Powell.</p>
               <p>- MILES. I am a constable. I was sent for to take her in custody; when I went there she pointed out the things that she had bought with the old woman's money; I have brought them here; she said she took four guineas from the old woman.</p>

The prisoner's mother lived in the same house with me; the prisoner was out of place, she lived with her grandmother. On the third of January she was cleaning my apartment; I left her in my apartment with my little boy while I went out, and while I was gone she opened a trunk of mine and took these things out. As soon as I came home she was gone; and my little boy told me she had taken the clothes out of the trunk. I went to the trunk. I found all the things gone. She never came nigh her mother for six weeks after she had done it; and then she came home and she was taken in custody. I asked her if she was not ashamed to serve me so; she said it was all come home to her, for she had parted with all the things, she had not a rag to her back; she had pawned and sold the things.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a leather dresser; I worked for Mr. Briant. About a year ago Mr. Fraile came from Birmingham, and was put into Gilspur street Compter. I hearing that he was there went to see him; nothing particular passed at that moment. One time when I was going to his father with the cart for Mr. Briant, he asked me whether I could get any skins; I said I would try; he said he would give me a pair of braces the first opportunity, if I could get him a black skin, a red, and a blue skin. It went on with that, and he gave me a pair of braces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was never in Mr. Briant's house to take any of these things; what I received came through the hands of Partridge that stands before you.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Partridge) Did he ever go in the house with you. - A. He went up and down by the side of the house, and took these things from me. I was in the house, I slept in the house, and he was waiting to receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember these doe skins. - A. I remember there were some doe skins, and some yellow morocco skins delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never went into the house, nor near the house, he brought the skins to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These things I know to be mine; the bulk had not been broke of these; I can identify them, there is a mark upon the neck. I cannot swear to the whole. I believe the prisoner was a very honest lad while he lived with me; Since that there have been eight men living upon me; I have been robbed of above a thousand pounds. I do not look upon the prisoner Fraile equal in guilt with Partridge, whom I supported; we found the property was sold by Fraile; the magistrate admitted Partridge an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the owner of the house. - A. Yes, I did not lodge in the house at the time the skins were taken out; it was made use of principally as a warehouse then. This Partridge was my porter, he laid there; I had about six or seven thousand pounds worth of property in it. I lived within fifteen doors of it; it is a very respectable house; I had recently bought the lease; I went into it myself as soon as it was repaired. I inhabit it now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I must leave myself to your mercy, and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner, do you know her. - A. I have known her seven or eight years. On the 12th of January she came into my house about half past two o'clock in the afternoon; I was very much alarmed to see her; I heard that she was in prison. I asked her if she would eat any thing, she thanked me; I put out a bit of cold mutton to her. After that I asked her to stop to tea; she told me she was much obliged to me. I pulled off my pelisse, and hung in on the screen. I had been out all day; I made the fire, and asked her if she would go out for some butter; I gave her the butter pan in her hand, and I laid the butter pan down on the table. I went into the yard for a tea kettle of water, and when I came in she was gone out as I thought for the butter; I did not see her any more for that evening. I waited for tea till dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you absent for the water. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180050"/> About five minutes. At dark I got my tea; I wanted to go out, I looked for my pelisse, I could not find it; I went up to my one pair of stairs room, I saw my bed routed; upon examining the bed, I found my quilt and my bottom sheet gone, and two bed gowns that were on the bed, and my shift was gone out of the drawer; I looked round and saw the butter pan which I had given her to fetch the butter, standing upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your things. - A. No, not one. The next evening I heard where she was; I sent for an officer. When he went into the room she fell a crying, and told me if I would not send her to prison, she would get me the things the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where the things were. - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth street office. On the 13th of January, Mrs. Guy came to me and said she had been robbed the day before, and she wished an officer to go with her and take this woman in custody. I found the prisoner in Rosemary lane, she was treating five or six people with gin; she went into a private house; then I took her into custody. I searched her; I found a seven shilling piece, two shillings in silver, and eight pence in halfpence; she said if I would let her go on the next day at twelve o'clock, she would bring Mrs. Guy her property back again; she said she had sold them in Ratcliff Highway.</p>

                        targets="t18070218-65-victim695 t18070218-65-viclabel345"/>. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of January last did you come to Billingsgate. - A. Yes; I came from Gravesend, and I landed there in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had landed you saw the prisoner Waples - did you know the prisoner Waples. - A. I had never seen him before in my life. After I had landed I got a pot of beer at a public house; I was speaking to a woman that I had got prize money due to me in the town; Waples said to me you can go along with me if you please, and I will take care of you, and pay your expences till you receive your prize-money. I went with him, he lived in Sun yard, Nightingale lane; he procured me a lodging in some other house. I told him I should go to the agents the next day and draw my money; I told him I had got a hundred pounds to take. I went on Thursday to the agent's, they told me to come on the next day for my money, and they would give me an order on the bankers; I went the next day, and they gave me a draft, and I went to the banking house the next day for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the banking house. - A. I cannot say the name nor the number, it was in the Strand; I cannot read; Waples was with me when I went. There I received a fifty pound bank note, a forty pound, a five pound, and four one pound bank notes, and five shillings in cash.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know there was a fifty, a forty, a five, and four ones. - A. I told them. I did not understand the figures of the notes; he said he knew the number of the notes better than what they did. I know a one pound note; there was four of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How do you know that one of the other notes was a fifty pound note. - A. I trusted to the gentleman that paid me. I put them all in my pocket book, in the same pocket I have now; we went and bad something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. Yes; we drank about sixpennyworth of rum and water, it began to rain; we went home in a hackney coach; going home in the coach, he said he should like to look at the number of the notes I had in my pocket; I said stop till I get home and you shall be welcome to look at them; I did not shew him the notes in the coach. When I got home there was a dinner dressed; I sat down and had my dinner, and then I asked him what I had got to pay; he told me it was four pounds for my lodging and for a pair of boots that I had of him, and for his trouble of going along with me. I took my pocket book out and gave him the four one pound notes; he said I am able to take better care of your notes than you are yourself, you may go out and spend them, and I may be brought to account for it; I told him I was able to take care of my own money, I was the person that went out and fought for it; I let him have them, I was not willing to breed a disturbance in the place; he put them in his pocket, he said he would take care of them; he took them out of the pocket book and returned me the pocket book again. He told me that if I would come to him the next day in the morning he would return them to me. I did not sleep in his house all night, I believe I went into the Star; I had only the change with me that I took from the banker's; I thought he was an honest man, I was glad that he had them to take care of them for me. I went to his house the next morning, I told him I would be glad to have some money to pay for my breakfast; he gave me some money to pay for my breakfast, he gave the money for my breakfast. I asked him for some more of the money that he had taken from me the night before; he told me that he had not got any money of mine, and that he did not know any thing about it; he supposed I had been out and I had lost it.</p>

               <p>Q. You have stated that when you went to the banker's, you went home with him and went to dinner there, you asked him what you had to pay - had you any thing to drink. - A. Not much; a pot of porter, and a glass of rum; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him for some money to pay for your breakfast, how much did that amount to. - A. About nine pence; and when he charged four pounds, he took the book out of my hand, and took the whole of the notes that were in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say that you supposed the prisoner to be an honest man, and therefore you consented he should have the notes till the next morning. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180051"/> Q. On the next morning you looked to him to pay for your breakfast. - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before at dinner time you drank a pot of porter and a glass of rum. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not all that you drank. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank more than that. - A. Not before I had paid what his demand was; after dinner I drank some rum that was in a bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. You were groggy. - A. I was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. So are all drunken men - do you mean to say that you was perfectly sober. - A. Persons if they be not sober may know what they are about; I was so sober as to know that was the man that had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor did you drink after dinner. Q. I am not able to say every spoonful.</p>
               <p>Q. You was pretty fresh. - A. I was certainly on board a ship a long time; I drank freely. I thought the money was safe; I found to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to a dance afterwards. - A. I went to the Star, to a dance, along with a woman that I paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me that sailors when they go to a dance generally give some money. - A. What they give they are welcome to, but not so welcome what they take away.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed some notes there did not you. - Q. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it when you said the man took the notes away. - A. It was Friday in last month; I forget the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he got the notes from you did you apply to have him taken up. - A. I applied on the Wednesday following. On the Sunday the prisoner took me to Gravesend to get me on board a ship, thinking that I was a poor foolish lad, I would not not think no more about it. I took him up last Friday was a week. On Saturday, the next day after I received my money, the prisoner said he would get me a good ship on the Sunday; he went with me to Gravesend on board the ship. I told him I was not going to be impressed that way, I thought he was going to pay me the money down on board a ship; I asked him for my money, he told me he had none of my money and none he should return me. I went to his house on the Tuesday night following; he told me to go out of his house, he would have no more to do with me.</p>

On the 22d and 23d of January the prosecutor and the prisoner both came to me. In November Farrow was entitled to prize money for the Lively; I paid him twenty-six pounds. In November he left one hundred pounds with me, to buy stock in the funds. On the 22nd of January he came in the afternoon for us to sell it out; we told Farrow it was too late that day to sell it; the prisoner was with Farrow; he sent him in again; he said he had better sell it out that day; we said it was impossible; we sold it out on the 23d of January, I paid him ninety nine pounds nine shillings; that is a check that I gave him on Hodsoll and Co. I have likewise brought the receipt which was witnessed by me, and I got it witnessed by the prisoner at the bar, who said he was a friend of Farrow's, and Farrow said he was a friend of his.</p>

            . Q. You are a Thames police officer. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any warrant for Waples. - A. I had on the 6th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where Waples lived. - A. Yes; I went to his house, I could not find him; I looked for him four successive days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he after that time come and surrender himself. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the prosecutor and I came home together to my house, I asked him to leave his money with me, he answered no; he had fought for it, and he was capable of taking of it. I said if you are afraid of trusting me with it, I am afraid of trusting you. I says how much do you owe me, he says here is four pound notes; and he says if there is any coming to me out of the four pound, give it me to-morrow; and if there is any thing coming to you, I will pay you. He directly fastened up the pocket book, and went out of the house to a woman. He was brought home the next morning by a pork butcher; he says to me, pay for my breakfast; I says pay for it yourself, you left no money with me but four pound notes; he then says I left all my money in your care; I says you have not, he says you do not mean to say so; if you have not got it, I have lost it I have none, he says to me, pay the fifteen pence for my breakfast; I put my hand into my pocket and gave him one shilling and three pence. He says if you have not got it, I lost it last night with the three girls I was with. I says, Abraham, it is a bad job, you had better have left your money with me. I says, Abraham, there is some difference between you and me, I will make out the bill. I was going over to the London docks; there was a jew called him by name; I says, Abraham, do you know this man; he denied it at first, till the man came up to him; he asked him how long he had been out of the Cumberland Indiaman; he said that he was discharged from that ship, and he would go forward and declare it; this man said, I do not think that such a stout able man as you was discharged. I said I will be accountable for him; he had been misfortunate enough. He had been out last night, and had lost ninety nine pound. I then went home and called over my bill, which is eight pound nine shillings; I asked him which way I was to be paid, as I had only four pound; he said I can pay you out of my absent bond. I called Bradley to write out the bill for eight pound nine shillings; saying on the bill, received the above, and saying I am in debt to

             four pound nine. He was satisfied, and he went down to Gravesend with me, and the man brought him to the captain, he said he was impressed. He then came on shore; he said he would not go on board. I said if that is the case, you owe me money enough, you shall not run any further in debt; he came to my house one day afterwards. I saw no more of him for fourteen days; I heard a warrant was out against me. I surrendered myself up, knowing myself to be an innocent man.</p>
               <p>- SHEALE. - Mr. Knapp. You are a sailor I observe. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Farrow the prosecutor. - A. I have seen him twice. I have seen him with Mr. Waples.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them together. - A. At Mr. Waples's house last Friday four weeks, they both came in together at half after six o'clock in the afternoon; and the prosecutor asked Mrs. Waples if she had the tea ready, she replied the kettle was boiling, she would soon get it ready; she said you had better stop to tea, you appear pretty fresh, the tea will do you good; he said he would go out, he wanted a little drop; Waples said you had better let me have the money; no, he said, he had worked for it, and was as capable of taking care of it as any one else. Waples said as you are afraid of trusting me, I am afraid of trusting you. So accordingly he asked him what was coming to him, he said about four pounds, he said if you will stop a little I will let you know, I will make out the account; he said he would not stop; he opened his pocket book and laid the pocket book along the table; he took out four pound notes, and put the pocket book in his pocket with the other notes; he catched hold of the notes, here says he is four pound notes, if there is any thing coming to me, return it to-morrow. All very fair said Waples, I will; he said he would go out and have a dance where the fidler was, and have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pocket book and the other notes. - A. He put the other notes in his pocket book, and he put the pocket book into his trowsers pocket, and he laid the four pound notes down on the table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. Where do live. - A. In Rosemary lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Waples. - A. Five years.</p>

I am particular in any day that I take notice of; I called on Waples that day, for Waples to get me a birth in the London Packet. I got the birth the Monday after that happened. I used to call at his house two or three times a day. I am sure it was Friday about four weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not he there. - A. No, he did not come in for an hour and a half after me; I went there about half after four o'clock; Mrs. Waples waiting for them coming to tea. Farrow and the prisoner came in about half after six.</p>

               <p>Q. If he has made mention of several things, why did you say it was for liquor and something or other, when you was asked what the four pound was for. you said it was for liquor and lodging. - A. Yes, and he made mention of the boots and several things else that I did not notice.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give any account to the magistrate. - A. No I was not called.</p>

               <p>Q. On any time previous to Christmas day did you see your pocket book. - A. Yes, I saw it on that day mentioned in the indictment - I was in my warehouse when I counted my notes - I had notes in Bank paper to the amount of one hundred and twenty-three pounds; I put the notes into my pocket book, and I put the pocket book in the inside pocket of my coat; I wore the coat till I went to bed, then I pulled it off.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Fox at that time. - A. Yes, I lived with him once. He asked me to live with him again. I said I would, as I had not constant employ, that was on Friday. I went on Saturday to his stables.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his stables. - A. In Elder street, Norton Falgate. On Saturday morning he took from Smithfield two horses to the stable. I did not see any more of him that day nor on the Sunday; and when I found he did not come home, I took the key home with me in my pocket; I did not see him till Monday; when I came on Monday morning at nine o'clock, I found two strange horses in the stable, both belonged to Mr. Plum. I enquired of Mr. Sergeant how he got them in.</p>

               <p>Q. How. - A. I do not know any farther than seeing them together. He told me that he told Mr. Beesy, the cooper, that belonged to the premises, he had lost the key, and he let him in the back way; when I come I unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. They were Sargeant's horses then. - A. Yes; by what I could understand.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Fox let him the stables. - A. I do not know that Fox let him the stable, Fox had the stables in his own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must let him put them there. - A. Yes; the horses were very much fatigued and splashed all over; I took one out of door to clean it, and Sargeant told me I ought not to do that, he would catch cold if I cleaned them out of door; so I took him in; I asked Sargeant whose horses they were, he said they were his own. Then Fox came in the morning, I was saying what two fine horses they were; he replied, pho! d - n<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180056"/> you, I ought to know what horses they are, I sent Thomas down to Chatham after them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horses afterwards. - A. On Wednesday night Sargeant said get on the mare and ride behind me, and he got upon the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Longman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold it to Longman, did not you. - A. Yes, we saw Longman's man. Sargeant told him they were his horses, that was at first.</p>
               <p>Q. After all, whose horses did you understand them to be. - A. I understood them to be Sargeant's only by what I heard from Sargeant.</p>
               <p>Q. Fox told you that he sent Thomas for them, how could you understand they were Sargeant's horses. - A. I do not know whether that was true or not.</p>

I went to the Elder-Tree to know whether they knew any thing of the key or the boy.

               <p>Q. You keep the whole house. - A. Yes. The two prisoners came to lodge with me the Friday before Christmas day, they had the back one pair of stairs room at five shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. They rented it jointly, did they. - A. Yes, and they had all the articles mentioned in the indictment in the room for their use; Miss Stears never went out of the room but once, till they left the lodgings, after staying five weeks. I think it was the 26th of January, when they went way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they paid you any rent while they were there. - A. No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jenkins use to go out frequently. - A. Yes, half a dozen times of a day. They went away in the morning before I was up, they never gave me any warning.</p>
               <p>Q. After they left the lodgings, did you go into the lodgings. - A. No, not till the Thursday following, when the week was up, then I sent for a smith, and had the door opened, then I observed all the things in the indictment gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found these things since. - A. No, nor never heard of them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's niece. I was there two or three days before they left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. The account that your aunt has given is true. - A. Yes. I was at a house in Tottenham Court road, I saw Jenkins go by, that was a week afterwards, I followed her, she asked me what I followed her for; I told her for stealing the things, she told me if I would go back and not follow her, she would return them in a few days, I followed her as far as Covent Garden church yard, there she sat down for about an hour, and then she got into a coach.</p>
               <p>Jenkins's Defence. I can only say that Miss Stears through ill health knew nothing of the transaction between me and Mrs. Tod. I wrote a note to Mrs. Tod, that she should hear from us in a day or two. I believe it is for owing her the money that she has done this; could we take all these things away, as she opened the door for us; there are other lodgers in the house, there is other keys that opens the door, and there is a large yard that any body could easily get in.</p>

               <p>Stears's Defence. It is a very unjust thing laid to our charge. I acknowledge that I do owe rent.</p>

On the next morning I went into his room to make the bed, I found the sheets, blankets, and the counterpane was gone, and a large quantity of horse-dung left, which had been emptied out of an handkerchief; when he came he had a large bundle in a handkerchief; which I supposed to be his clothes, and a great basket, that I supposed to be his tools; he said he was a carpenter. When I met him in Carnaby street, I spoke to him, I said you are the man that robbed me, he said he had not, I said I would take my oath he was the man, he said if I would let him go he would fetch me the bed clothes; I laid hold of him, he drew me into the middle of the street. I called Mr. Marshall, whom I knew in the market, he came and secured him.</p>

Yes, from Mr. Brown's shop door; it hung partly in and partly out, I had seen it hang there about five minutes before it was taken away. About five o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the end of the counter, and having an idea that something was pulled from the door, I went out, I saw it was missing; I saw some men at the corner of an alley, I ran to the alley, I saw the prisoner running up the alley with the pelisse under his arm, which he was endeavouring to put under his coat; I ran directly after him, he looked back and immediately dropped the pelisse; I called out stop thief, he ran to Grey Eagle street, Spital fields; he went in at a back door of that street. I attempted to go after him, I could not, the door was fastened; I went to the other door of the house, I was informed that he went into the house opposite. I went for the officer; he came and searched the house, he could not find him. In half an hour after that he was brought to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the same man that you saw running away with the pelisse; I am positive of it. It is a cotton velvet pelisse, it is worth fifty shillings.</p>

On the 21st of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I stopped the prisoner about two hundred yards from Mr. Bruce's house, he had a brass kettle and copper stew pan upon his head, I asked him whose property it was, he told me his own; he refused to give me any account where he got them from. I took him in custody, I enquired about the neighbourhood, Mr. Bruce claimed them.</p>

On the 4th of February, between six and seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180059"/> o'clock in the evening, I found the prisoner close to where the fowls were, he was peeping behind a stack of wood. I struck him, I said I suppose you are the man that stole the other fowls; he had killed a hen, it was in a bag, and the bag was close to his feet. I called to Davis, and he laid hold of him by the collar and took him to the magistrate.</p>

            , I desired him to follow me. I heard the prisoner Smith say to Richards let us cross over the road, they crossed over, I said to Richards, you seem very heavy loaded (it was about half after six in the morning just getting light); I asked him what he had got, he said he had got nothing, I insisted upon seeing, he said he would see me b - r first. Richards said if I wanted the stuff I might have it, and down he threw it. Smith rather refused putting his down, I insisted upon it, he put the blue apron down and then the lead was uppermost, the apron was not big enough to cover it completely. I told them they had got what I thought they had, for our neighbourhood had been infested with such sort of people; Smith said I might have it if I would, I replied I must have you as well as the lead; he run away as hard as he could, I ran after him and knocked him down, I secured him, Richards made his escape. I stopped with the lead and Smith till he was brought back to me; we delivered the lead to the constables.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see from what place the four tea pots were taken by Ellworthy, and put in a bag by Ellworthy. - A. He told me to take them to 6 Great Cumberland street, and he gave orders that they were not to be shewn to any one till he came himself; this was about twenty minutes after nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time does your shop generally shut up. - A. The windows are shut up after dark; the shop continues open till ten o'clock. I took the tea pots in a bag, agreeable to Ellworthy's directions, and delivered them to captain Morrison's servant,

             I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. What instructions did you receive from Ellworthy at that time. - A. Ellworthy brought three tea pots and papered them up, and put them in a bag; this was in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these three tea pots that were brought, three out of the four that were taken. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did Ellworthy give you. - A. I was to take them to Mr. Gaddenne, Crown and Scepter court, St. James' street, about two hundred yards from my master's house.</p>

               <p>Q. And Ellworthy has lived there all the time you have lived there. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. He was the principal manager for Mr. Wirgman to carry on his business, and you was the person that had them delivered to you by Ellworthy in the presence of the shopman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing extraordinary in these goods being delivered to you by Ellworthy to be shewn to customers, any more than had been done before. - A. They were to be taken unknown to Mr. Wirgman.</p>
               <p>Q. So it might be in many other goods. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was done in the usual way in which other goods are delivered to you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were taken to this house in Cumberland street, you say there were four tea pots, and these four tea pots were taken from the shew glass where all the other tea pots were, and in the presence of the shopman, and when they were taken to Mrs. Mc Veigh, they were put in the parlour. - A. I put them in the parlour myself, they were to remain there till Ellworthy came back. Ellworthy told me that the other was to be returned with the three that I brought back, but Mrs. Mc Veigh was indisposed and gone to bed; that the tea pot which is in this bag had received the approbation of the company in the drawing room, but it was to remain there till the next morning, they having approved of it; if was to remain to see whether Mrs. Mc Veigh approved of it in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. It was remaining then for the approbation of the lady of the house till the next morning. - A. Yes, Ellworthy told me the tea pot was to be brought back the next day after Mrs Mc Veigh's approbation.</p>
               <p>Q. When goods are taken to be shown before an actual sale has taken place, do you know enough of the business of the shop to say whether, any entry is taken when they are left for approbation. - A. They are left for approbation; they are booked on choice, and there would be an entery made if the whole was not brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us these goods remained till the next morning for the approbation of Mrs. Mc. Veigh; would that be entered on that night, or remain till Mrs. Mc Veigh had made approbation of it. - It should be booked that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course when you got back, Ellworthy would have left the shop, it being late, and he would not return till the morning. - A. No, had he ordered it to be booked, Mr. Wirgman, or the shopman, would have entered it.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to say you took the three tea pots to Mr. Gaddenne. - A. Yes; the shop being shut up Ellworthy was scarfull of Mr. Wirgman's anger, he did not want him to know it; that was the reason I was to leave them at Gaddenne's I returned them the next morning to Mr. Wirgman's shop by Ellworthy's directions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did Ellworthy live in your masters house. - A. Yes, he did not sleep in my master's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master in the shop on the next morning when you returned the three tea pots. - A. He was not.</p>

            . Mr. Gurney. You are a jeweller in St. James's Street. The prisoner Ellworthy has been five years in your service as clerk. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been entrusted to sell articles and to go out to your customers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner Morrison first introduced to you. - A. About the 14th of November<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180061"/> last, by captain Wallace of the Duke of Cumberland's regiment; they came together.</p>
               <p>Q. By what description was he introduced to you by captain Wallace. - A. As a captain of the Navy.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that introduction, did you credit the prisoner Morrison with articles of jewelry. - A. Yes; in the course of a few days to the amount of seventy pound: they were purchased at divers times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner Ellworthy waited upon him in the course of serving him. - A. Chiefly so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the date of the last article that you sold to him. - A. It could not be more than seven or eight days from his first introduction. At that time captain Wallace called upon me, he told me in the presence, and in the hearing of Ellworthy, that captain Morrison of the royal navy was a swindler, and he feared that the property I had sold to him was lost, but as a man of honour he found himself bound to make good any loss I sustained by him.</p>
               <p>Q. This you say Ellworthy heard. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that give Ellworthy any orders. - A. No. He absented himself three days; upon his return he brought back the gold watch and chain I had sold to Morrison, and there might be a little ring, that reduced the seventy pound to about ten pound and sixpence; he stated that he got them from captain Morrison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did captain Morrison ever come to your shop after that. - A. Never. I told Ellworthy and all my people not to trust him.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that you received, did you in this month go to the prisoner Morrison, and where did you find him. - A. In the lock up house, Shire lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you respecting the tea pot. - A. Yes. He told me if I would go to his house, No. 63 Great Marybone street, and ask his servant to deliver the silver tea pot to me that he had purchased of Ellworthy, he would do so, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that go to the house that he described to you. - A. I did. I received a silver tea pot from his servant Frost; this is the tea pot, there was tea leaves in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it. - A. About ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Ellworthy ever apprised you of his selling that tea pot to Morrison, or to any other person. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Mc Veigh a customer of yours. - A. No, never. I have my book here, there is no entry of it being sold to Morrison or to Mrs. Mc Veigh. It was his duty to have entered it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. - I understand you to have stated that captain Morrison was first of all introduced to you by captain Wallace. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not been trusted with any property till that period. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the goods that was afterwards delivered to him on credit, was in consequence of the introduction of captain Wallace. - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you said that captain Wallace returned, and said that captain Morrison was not that person as he expected; to what amount did you trust him. - A. To the amount of seventy pound.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that after captain Wallace had given you the information, Ellworthy was absent three days, and at the end of three days he brought back so many articles as reduced the seventy pound to ten pound; he was then absent on your business. - A. He was absent without my leave.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you have said these goods were sold to Morrison by your leave. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as it was found out, your servant went and brought back all the goods, which he returned as soon as he could get them. - A. So, he said; it did not require three days to recover them, as they were brought back from Great Cumberland street.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought back the goods and found out the man. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was your chief clerk. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it he was authorised to take out goods to all your customers. - A. To my customers.</p>
               <p>Q. He was authorised to sell goods to persons that came into your shop. - A. If the persons were not known, it was necessary to inform me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was your managing servant to sell for you, and to dispose of your goods, in your house, in your absence - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked about the loss of these things did not he tell you where they were. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that Mrs. Mc Veigh had them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he would go to Mrs. Mc Veigh. - A. No. He might have said that he would go to Cumberland street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had captain Wallace told you where he lived. - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Ellworthy told you that the goods were at Great Cumberland street. - A. On the evening of the 10th of February, and I went that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the number in Great Cumberland street. - A. No. I was directed there by the Swedish ambassador, on the next morning; there I saw Mrs. Mc Veigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask for the articles that came there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not to be paid for them by Mrs. Mc Veigh. - A. No. She would not give them up without much difficulty. I told her I had a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at that time tell her that you hoped after the marriage had taken place that you should have an order to a large amount. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you positively swear that. - A. I will sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you deny that positively. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. After Ellworthy was charged with this, did not he bring back some of the things from Great Cumberland street. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He went from your shop by himself. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And returned with them. - A. Yes. So he told me; it was in my absence.</p>
               <p>Q.When was he taken into custody. - A. Between five and six the morning after he had brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180062"/> them back I went twice to the house in Great Cumberland street; the first time I saw Miss

I saw her in her bed room, I desired her to give me the diamond ring which I was informed by the Swedish ambassador that she had, she told me that if I left the room I should have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present in the room with you - A. Mr. Mayhew.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. When captain Morrison was first introduced to you, was Ellworthy present. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards, when captain Wallace called and gave you that account, was Morrison present. - A. No, Morrison was not present.</p>

He has been there and drank tea there, and I have seen him at the General

               <p>Q. Is not one of your brothers on a visit at Morrison's mothers. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. It was before you knew of any contract of marriage had taken place. - A. No, not before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Your grandmother is a woman of property. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. These were articles that he would have had it in his power to have paid for if the marriage had taken place. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The knocker was taken off for four days to prevent your grandmother coming forward as a witness. - A. Not to prevent that, to prevent any of his party coming to our house, because she did not wish it.</p>

             went to Mr. Pratt's house at Kingsdown on the afternoon of the 12th. I found eighteen bags of tobacco in an outhouse adjoining Pratt's house; these eighteen bags of tobacco were covered over with some faggots. In the house I found eight tubs, containing twenty gallons of Hollands geneva; I made a seizure of them, I got a cart and conveyed them to the Cock public house at Kingsdown; Mrs. Hackney keeps the house, I put them in Mrs. Hackney's parlour. Between one and two o'clock in the morning a number of smugglers came; the constable went out of the room, and just as he went out of the room four smugglers came in; two came to me, and two to the other officer, Pyat; they threw me and Pyat on the floor, the candle was knocked off the table; when the constable came in he took one of the smugglers from me; I got free of the other; I went to the assistance of the other officer. I took a pistol from Mr. Pyat, we called for a light, and found part of the goods we had seized were gone. One of the smugglers swore that he would have the remainder of the goods; I then presented a pistol and said, that I would shoot the first man that attempted to carry off any more of the goods. He says, fire away and be d - d, and takes out a pistol, which he had taken from the officer, and presented it to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180064"/> and said, he would shoot me if I attempted to fire at any of the others. There was a party in the house of smugglers, some with pitchforks and some with club sticks; the man that had a club stick they called Old Bob.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known previous to this time the man who went by the name of Old Bob. - A.No, I knew none of them.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not know none of the parties. - A. None. The other officer, Mr. Pyat, locked the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. What locked you and the smugglers in. - A. No; we left the room: the smugglers were in the passage, Mr. Pyat locked the room up, and put the key in his pocket; there were three or four of them in the house till four of five o'clock in the morning; they swore that would have the remainder of the goods, but they did not make the attempt; afterwards they went away with the goods they had rescued.</p>
               <p>Q. What injury did you receive. - A. I received no injury at all; they threw me on the floor, and kept me on the floor, while the remainder of them took the goods away.</p>
               <p>Court. All this obstruction was on shore. - A. Yes.</p>
