                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, Somerset House—I produce the memorandum and articles of association of the Lombard Deposit Bank Company, Limited; it was registered on 30th December, 1874; there were seven subscribers for five shares of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the capital to be 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 20,000 shares <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I produce the agreement of 21st December, 1874, signed by the defendant; it is an agreement between James Pryor, of 43, Lombard Street, and Richard Sleeman, as a director on behalf of the company then in course of formation, by which Pryor sold his business to the company in considera<lb/>tion of 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fully paid-up shares of the company—the first registered return of the list of shareholders was 14th July, 1875; it is signed by <hi rend="italic">Pryor</hi>; <hi rend="italic">that purports</hi> to give the shareholders' names up to the 5th of May preceding; the total number of shares then taken up was 35; the next return of the list of registered shareholders was on 27th January, 1876; that is signed by the prisoner, and purports to be made up to the 20th January preceding; the number of shares then registered is 5,477; the calls made are 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a share, but there is a note that 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is considered as received on some of the shares; those are entered as against the prisoner's name, not as fully paid up—on all other shares the balance of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid—the total amount entered is 3,904<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., made up in this way: 1,705<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is taken as having been received in cash, and 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. considered as received—I find in the register 10 shares in the name of H. Clinton Cooper, and 5 in the name of Bastaple—the next return of shareholders registered is on 16th November, 1876; that is signed by the prisoner, and purports to be made up to 31st October, 1876—in that register the prisoner appears for 2,225 shares, Mr. Cooper for 100, and Mr. Bastable for 100; 7,640 shares are entered as taken up, and the</p>

Tyler, secretary;" that purports to be a list of snares up to 21st November, 1877—the prisoner there appears for 2,225 shares, and Cooper and Bastaple 100 each—on 9th April, 1877, I find a resolution registered with regard to an alteration of title, that the word "deposit" be left out.</p>

                  </hi>.

I hold 500 shares in the company, trans<lb/>ferred from my father—I became a director oh 19th February—the first board meeting I attended was a week after the 27th—I proposed the com<lb/>mittee of inspection that day—I don't know whether you were a consenting party to that committee—that investigation was carried on day by day—the business did not go on in the usual way; it decreased day by day from the first sitting of the committee—I believe you were the cause of it—the board met every Tuesday—I do not see any report in the minute-book why the business of the bank was on the decrease—I have the index ledger—the number referring to the Lombard Building Society is 1034—the balance there is 925<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to August, 1876, it is not balanced up beyond—I have heard that 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out by the Lombard Build<lb/>ing Society during the committee of investigation—I don't know by whom it was drawn out—I have never inquired into the books of the Building Society—Mr. Lewis produced the cheques before the Lord Mayor, supplied by Messrs. Waddell, the accountants, who went through the accounts—the majority of the cheques were signed by you—I believe that all you were charged with is in the indictment—I believe the charge of embezzling 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not gone on with—I heard that the money was subsequently traced from the deposit account into the Hampshire Bank, and placed there by you—I have not heard what the balance is—Messrs. Waddell can furnish the information—the business decreased because you would not make any advances—I think the directors had to call your attention to the decrease of the business, not you to the directors—I did not become a direc<lb/>tor at your solicitation, it was at Captain Teevan's and my father's; he put me forward, you kept me back—I was at first unsuccessful—I was afterwards elected, and requested by Captain Teevan to take a seat at the board—at that time my father and I had 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares—my</p>

               <p>father made a proposition to you to lend 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon them—there was certain correspondence with reference to your giving 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—it was not in consequence of not being able to get the advance that I proposed the committee of investigation—the amount of interest you were going to charge on the advance was so exorbitant that it was not possible for us to accept your terms—we did not take the loan—the interest charged was something over 20 per cent., independent of the 12 1/2; I was receiving—it is an impossibility to find who were the first directors, and that you well know—there was a person in the name of Allen who has never been seen or heard of by any one at the bank—we have made every inquiry, and no such person has been found—I have heard of the name of General Louis as one of the original directors—I find it on the minute-book—according to the articles of association the original directors should be holders of 300 fully paid-up shares—the only name I have been able to find is that of the Hon. Mr. Turnour; a certain number of shares were allotted to him, for which he never paid a farthing—dividends have been made on those shares, but he has never received any money—he has acted on the board, and received director's fees—I believe he was not an original shareholder—General Louis never had any shares; if he had, his name would be in the general registered list—the company went to allotment on 3rd February, 1875, when it was proposed that 2,100 shares be allotted to Pryor—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the transfer script of General Louis's 100 shares; it is a script that nobody can understand; it is not tilled up—General Louis never had a share; that is your certifi<lb/>cate in your name, not General Louis—it is signed by Mr. Crowe and Mr. Sleeman; it should be signed by three directors; it is countersigned by R. Tyler, secretary—your salary was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 5 per cent. on the profits, when they exceeded 10 per cent.—since the application to the Lord Mayor for a warrant I have not acted as the principal director of the bank; I have acted in conjunction with the other directors, Mr. Abrahams and Captain Teevan, who has now resigned—you were charged with stealing 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in March with stealing a further sum of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe some of the charges fell through—you were charged with stealing shares—I did not charge the other directors with the same crime—there is a suit pending in Chancery—I am acting under the advice of legal gentlemen, and was so then.</p>

On 16th March, 1875, Pryor is debited with 1,971<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is a miscast in his favour of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that error is carried on; it was discovered and traced back—there is no trace in the books of General Louis ever possessing a single share, or of having paid a sixpence on them—the Hon. Mr. Tumour is put down as an original director; he never had a share, and never paid a farthing—dividends were paid on 100 shares supposed to be his—Mr. Pryor received those dividends from the commencement—I never heard of the name of Mr. Barnard Allen—he appears as a director; as far as I am able to trace there is no such person in existence; he never was seen by anybody at the board, either by the officials or the other directors—he appears as a shareholder; he has not paid a farthing—his dividends have been paid regularly, the prisoner received them—I know nothing about the Lombard Building Society—certain false cheques were found with regard to the Deposit Loan Company—I handed them to Mr. Lewis—the business decreased the very next day alter the committee of investigation entered on their</p>

               <p>labours—the prisoner said it was in consequence of the committee sitting that he would not make any advances—I had ascertained that the former business was real and genuine—some of the loans were fictitious, Roberts's loan was afterwards—while the committee was sitting we proposed that a person should go round and investigate the securities, but a block was put in the way, that the expense would be so enormous, and it fell through—it was carried on for about a day, but at the prisoner's suggestion it fell through.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner</hi>. I attended the general meeting on 8th September—I heard it proposed that Mr. Crowe and Mr. Allen be re-elected as directors—there was nobody to fill their places—Allen was named, but he was not there, only Mr. Crowe and Captain Sleeman (<hi rend="italic">Allen was here called in</hi>)—I have never seen that gentleman till I saw him outside—that is not Mr. Allen—that is a Mr. Barnard, of Bishopsgate Street, a money-lending gentleman—we have just seized the furniture of the bank from his place—it was given to that person by you, and we seized it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I remained there for several months afterwards—when the office was closed I went to the chief office and I have remained there ever since—the balance was cast every week, and I handed over the money to the prisoner, and he initialled every sum—all the moneys I received from selling shares and from deposits were paid over to the cashier of the bank, all the large amounts—it was money for the petty cash and fees that I handed over to the prisoner, and he pat it in his pocket—what became of it I don't know.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clerk in the Lombard Bank four days before the entry of 28th Feb.—this is my entry in the cash-book under that date, "Roberts, F., 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." as a receipt by me; it is entered on the receive side of the cash, and I see another subsidiary book where in I believe I receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a Bank of England note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have not recorded from whom, I presume I had it from the prisoner—I can't say in what shape I got the remainder to make up the 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I see on the opposite side a contra entry, "Paid the Lombard Building Society 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which appears to me a part of that entry—it appears to be made up by that cross entry; I can't charge my memory, I believe so—the effect of it is this, that by a cross entry of 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note Roberts's account is credited with 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no receipt was given for the 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no cheque was drawn for the 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I have no doubt that arrangement was carried out—I don't quite recollect what those figures refer to—I don't know whose figures these are in the body of this transfer of General Louis's shares—I have no recollection of putting in those figures in pencil—it is witnessed by a clerk who is still in my employ—the figures are not mine—this other document purports to be a transfer from yourself to Richard Slee<lb/>man of 100 shares—I don't know what this is for—I see it speaks of a transfer of 400 shares, but I don't recollect what they were, it is two years and a half ago—no doubt I gave 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consequence of that—I don't recollect whether these shares were assigned to you as security for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as far as I recollect I was about making an advance to some person to get them out of some little difficulty, I had not sufficient money at the time, and some arrangement was entered into with you on behalf of the bank—none of the money went into my pocket—I became respon<lb/>sible for a person—no doubt the advance was made upon certain trans<lb/>fers, the scrip not being printed.</p>

                  </hi>. General Louis's name appears in this transfer—it says 400 shares altogether—I don't know whether there was 100, but there were shares of General Louis—I lent him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each on</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I never saw any scrip for those shares to my know<lb/>ledge—the money was paid by me for General Louis—I knew him personally—he lodged the transfer of the shares with me, and it was taken out of my hands by Pryor—I was not aware that no shares had been allotted to General Louis—I believe that shares had been allotted—I don't know who General Louis got the transfer from; he merely handed it to me—the shares never stood in my name—I think I know the writing—I will not swear this is the document that was handed to me, I suppose it is—it is a blank transfer; it is signed and witnessed—all I should have had to have done would have been to put in the con<lb/>sideration and the particulars of the shares, and I could nave lodged it in the office—it is done every day—I could have completed the transfer m the ordinary way—it might have been a fraudulent one—I did not see the scrip—I see it now; it is scrip of Pryor's—the intermediate transfer never came into my possession—if Louis had nothing to transfer it was fraudulent on his part, he had no right to borrow the money—I paid the money for his benefit—he borrowed the money of me on the security of that transfer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the directors of the bank, and have been so since its formation—General Louis was one of the original directors, and was sometimes chairman in the absence of Colonel Mahon—under the articles of association 100 qualification shares fully paid-up were allotted to General Louis in consideration of his becoming a director—he attended regularly for some months, and performed his duty like any other director—he sent in his resignation in consequence of leaving the country—I believe this is his signature to this transfer, and this is my signature to the certificate—I think it is the custom of the office on buying other persons' shares to have a fresh certificate, and to cancel the old one on payment of a shilling—I believe I was one of the contracting parties to your appointment as manager—the salary was to be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, payable monthly, and 5 per cent. on the profits after the share<lb/>holders received 10 per cent.—to my knowledge no moneys were paid to you beyond your salary—it has never appeared in the minute-book as far as I recollect—the signature to this certificate of Bastaple's shares is my writing, and issued by the directors in regular form—it is the practice of the directors to have a regular weekly balance sheet before them—I have one here, showing the different business done for the week, the money advance 1, and the money received—one of the items is for shares alone, and every week the directors compare the amount received on the share capital before issuing their certificates—we see that the money is paid before we sign the certificates—there is a list brought down from the clerk in the office to show that the money is paid, before we sign the certificates—I have no means of fixing the date upon which the first</p>

               <p>certificate was signed—they purport to be dated 1st January, 1875—I cannot recollect when they were printed—I considered that we were doing everything as regularly as we could, and consistently with our duties—I am a member and director of the Lombard Building Society, and have been so from the commencement—in 1868 or 1869 large sums of money would be passing through your hands continually—you were the manager—no complaints were ever made of any irregularities in the way of deficiency of cash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. General Louis was an original director, he was elected by the board of directors—I was present when he was appointed—he was proposed by Colonel Mahon—the prisoner got up the company—he asked me to become a director—I cannot tell you who valued the business; it was represented to be worth 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by others besides himself—I cannot recollect at this moment who they were—General Louis had 100 shares—I did not say he had an allotment; they were assigned to him—I have 100 shares, they were paid for for me, I saw the money paid—I did not pay for them; the money was lent to me to pay for them—I believe Mr. Pryor paid for them—at first I refused to become a director on shares being given to me, unless they were paid for, and of course I would not be satisfied to sit on the board till I saw they were paid for—I cannot show you any entry of the payment—I took all the dividends upon them, and I took director's fees for my attendance—I am not a major, I am a captain retired from the Royal Limerick Militia—I became acquainted with the prisoner some years ago, and he asked me to join the Building Society, and I did so—I can't recollect who introduced me to him, it is 10 or 15 years ago—I did not borrow and lend money, never—I joined this money-lending business, as I had nothing else to do—I did my duty, and I defy anybody to say I did not—I have always done my duty in every situation of life—I remember the Short Lengths Timber Company, Limited, I have reason to recollect it—I was summoned before the Lord Mayor, Mr. Alderman Lusk, about it, for fraud—I had not taken money from a number of poor men, never a shilling, nor a sixpence—I was summoned because our manager took the liberty of putting advertisements in the papers that we knew nothing about—I was a director—I forget whether I paid for my shares in that company, I know I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd afterwards, for which I did not receive a single shilling—Mr. Lewis knows all about it—I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound before I was let go—I have never been a director of any other company, and never will again—I used to attend the board at the Lom<lb/>bard Bank—we left a great part to the prisoner, not everything—I did what the other directors did—General Louis remained a director two or three years—the O'Gormon Mahon was a director when I joined—the other directors were Captain Crowe, Mr. Turnour, Captain Teevan, and Mr. Gaskin—we did the usual routine—I did my duty, whatever it was—I signed different things—we inquired as far as we could whether things were right and proper, we could not do more—we inquired of the clerks, not of the prisoner—he was appointed managing director by the general meeting; the directors had nothing to do with his appointment—I inquired from the clerks, Mr. Jones and Mr. Liddington, if the returns were correct according to the books—I inquired about the proposed borrowers as far as I could; I asked the secretary and the manager whether they were good or not, and Mr. Gaskin always made the same inquiry—I have no recollection of the advance to F. Roberts, I never</p>

               <p>heard a word about it till in this Court—I never heard Mr. Lee complain about the false entry of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till at the Mansion House; I recollect that there seemed to be some misunderstanding between Mr. Lee and the prisoner with respect to some entries in the books—they had a discussion among them<lb/>selves in the board room, and the prisoner tried to explain to Mr. Lee that such was not the case—I considered it was all explained away at the time—I sometimes signed the cheques, and so did the manager and the other directors—the drafts on the till were signed by the directors present—I think the manager had authority to do so—the money was lodged in the till—the board only met once a week, and of course people came for their money, and they could not wait for it—I did not examine the till, I did not think that was my duty; the clerks had given security for that—I was not aware that in 1877 the manager had drawn out 409<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on I O Us of his own, he did not report it to me—I never heard it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. When the weekly balance-sheet was signed it was put in a drawer or box in the board room with the minute<lb/>book—you had no access to that box to my knowledge, I never knew you to have a key of it—I have not since your arrest seen a bundle of the weekly balance-sheets in the hands of the directors—I saw some in Captain Teevan's hands—each of the balance-sheets was copied into the minute<lb/>book, and the supplemental balance-sheet would be pinned to the balance<lb/>sheet and put away by the directors—the secretary was obliged to keep the balance-sheets—each director had a list of the borrower's names—previous to leaving Ireland I was a County Magistrate 35 or 36 years—I have a family of eight children, all brought up respectably, and all doing well.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined by the Prisoner</hi>). Dixon's address was West Lodge, Clapham—he appears to have had considerable transactions with the bank, extending over a period of eight or nine months—the bills of sale were renewed every 21 days—every advance made to him was a fresh advance, and every one opened in a different folio—Dixon had nothing to do with the 409<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he had absconded at that time—the last <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> account of Dixon was on April 9th, and in January you told me to open a fresh account altogether, of which Dixon knew nothing—he had perhaps from twelve to fifteen advances during the eight or nine months, but all relating to the one transaction; they were renewals—on 9th September an advance was made to Dixon of 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 18th October 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be additional interest; of course the interest would be increased as it went on—in June he owed 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the balance of these accounts—there was no cheque drawn for 921<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have hunted every one, and there is no such counterfoil in Dixon's name; the advance was to Barnard—Dixon had nothing to do with it—on 23rd June there is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on same date 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. handed to you on your I O U, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 25th—it is the custom when a clerk goes out with money to leave an I O U for the amount, but only for small amounts under 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., except as to yourself; your I O Us occasionally amounted to 1, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know what you did with the money—the 409<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the presumed ad<lb/>vance to Barnard—I made no advance to Barnard; I never saw any security for it—I received the 409<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by contra entry, as I explained yester<lb/>day—the presumed disbursements to Barnard amount to 921<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is an imaginary profit shown to the bank of 332<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the bank has never had the money or the property.</p>

               <p>else but money taken on behalf of the Building Society was accounted for to the bank or the Building Society, only fines, not the fees—the fees were received on account of the Building Society and the bank, but they were not accounted for to the bank because the furniture in the office belonged to you; you paid the clerks out of the money; the offices were yours and the furniture was yours—it was never the bank's furniture to my knowledge—I have resided at West Lodge since Dixon absconded, and I am in possession there now—the furniture is the same as was bought on behalf of the bank; the bank has taken possession of it and retained it—there is ample security there to repay them for all the money advanced; there is more furniture there, because I took my own there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, keeping the Horse Shoe, in the Goswell Road—in May, 1876, Field offered himself as barman in my service—I asked him who was his last employer—he said Mr. Hart<lb/>land, of 182, St. George's Road, Peckham—I told him to make an appointment for me to meet Hartland the next day at 11 o'clock—I went the next day to 182, St. George's Road—I was shown into a front room in a house on the ground floor—Hartland was there—I said I had come respect<lb/>ing Field's character, and asked, "Is Field honest, sober, and industrious, and a good barman?"—he said "Yes"—I said I wanted such a person, because I was very much out of the business driving, and I wanted some one I could depend upon—Hartland said Field was a very good young man, and well up to his business, that he (Hartland) had been in busi<lb/>ness in Rotherhithe, I think, and if he went into business again, he should be pleased to take Field back—Field afterwards came to me, and asked if his reference was satisfactory—I said "Yes," and engaged him—he remained four or five mouths—I noticed some one frequently coming to the bar—Field said he was a detective—I never noticed him before Field came nor after—Field was discharged for bad language and assault—some one came for his character—I declined to give one—Hartland came twice—the first time he asked me why Field had left—I told him—he said, "You must look over these things in young men; you ought to give him a character"—I said I would not—he said, "It is very hard for a young man, you know; perhaps you have got sons of your own"—I said I should not think of giving Field a character—Hartland then went away—he came a second time about the character within a month or six weeks—I said "No," and he left—a Mr. Hornby had applied for Field's character.</p>

I am partner with Mr. Peckham's son, who is now solicitor to the Licensed Victuallers' Protection Society—Mr. Peck<lb/>ham, sen., was my partner—he died early this month—in December, 1876, a Mr. Wood, who kept the White Hart, Long Acre. and a barman were under remand at Bow Street for conspiracy—on 18th December, 1876, I was with Mr. Whitnall at my offices in Doctors' Commons—I saw Mr. Peckham write this memorandum of an interview with Hartland—there was then no charge against Hartland—Witney was present to get in<lb/>formation—Matthews's name was mentioned—I have frequently looked at this paper—Hartland was told by Mr. Peckham that Matthews had obtained a situation with Mr. Simpkins by a character given from the White Horse, Long Acre, and he was asked whether he knew Matthews—he said he did not—he was asked to give a personal description of him—I only recollect two points in the description, that he was a tall man, and dark, or that he had dark hair—Hartland was then asked where he himself was residing, and he said at 64, Carlisle Street, Lambeth—Mr. Peckham then asked him as to his connection with William Wood, of the White Horse, Long Acre, who was then under remand from Bow Street—he said Wood had been in his employment at the Duke of York as barman for a short time—he was asked what Wood did after he left the Duke of York, and he gave some particulars which I do not recollect—all the questions were put by Mr. Peckham—nothing further passed with regard to Matthews—I have my call-book—there is a pencil tick made by me which enables me to say positively—the interview took place on Monday, 18th December, 1876—Mr. Peckham had nothing to do with this prosecution—he was ill—he may have called on Hartland in January, 1877, but not since.</p>

I know from Mr. Nevett that Hartland kept the Queen Katherine at Brook Street, Ratcliflf—I do not remember the year—I do not know that Field was his barman there—I know from the same source that Hartland kept the Duke of York in Adam Street, Rotherhithe, in 1873—I have not heard that Field was again in his employment there—I have not made inquiries about that, nor as to what situations Field has been in within the last seven years—I do not know that Field had a situation at Stockton-on-Tees—the result of inquiries was that Field was not in Hartland's service at the Duke of York—Hartland was there from December, 1873, to August, 1874, not on his own behalf, but merely as manager—as a result of my inquiries no barman was employed at the Duke of York, and Field was not under Hartland—no one has told me that he was—I had a conversation with Mr. Biscoe as to his evidence—I never heard that Field left his situation to go into the country because he was ill with smallpox.</p>

The horse was sweating, and a man said, "You had better not take that horse home now, because you might get locked up for cruelty; you had better give somebody a shilling to drive him home." I had had too much drink. When they brought the gentleman from the club to identify me, I was the only one who looked like a cabdriver. I know no more about the robbery than you do.</p>

My last job on this night was to Waterloo Road with a lady and gentleman, I then came across to Catherine Street, stopped till the Market opened, and then went home. When I was taken a detective said, "I think <hi rend="italic">Buggy</hi> is innocent, we must work it up for him." The Inspector said, "St and behind me." I said, "It doesn't matter where I stand, for I am innocent." My witness who could prove that was not out with the cab is not here; he is in the Militia. I had no seen Murphy for five weeks before I went into the House of Detention.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Bartley, a solicitor, of Maryle<lb/>bone Road—on 12th September the four prisoners called there—Pedrolli, who had been a client before, introduced the others, and said that he had bought some property of them and wanted it transferred—Mr. Bartley was out of town—an assignment was produced of a house 173, High Street, Newington, and the transfer of the goodwill, lease, and stock-in-trade from Giovanni Moriggla to Pedrolli, of 173, High Street, Newing<lb/>ton, for the consideration of 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an assignment of 25, Albion Terrace, Newington, from the two Moriggias for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to O'Connor, who was described in the instructions as of the City Road Basin, and of 1A, Kempsford Road, Surrey—they wanted it next day as one of the Moriggias could not say on which day he was going to Italy—I told them they could not have the assignment till 4 o'clock next Friday, the 14th, but they pressed me to get it ready by 10 o'clock—they gave me the title deeds and I took them down to Folkestone to be examined by my prin<lb/>cipal, as I could not send them by post—I got the assignments made on the 14th at 4 o'clock—in consequence of this letter which I wrote them Giovanni and Pedrolli and O'Connor came to the office and executed them—the deeds were left with me to be stamped, and that Carlo might execute them, as he could not attend that day—he called on the 15th and executed the assignments and the deeds were left with me till the 17th, when Carlo called and removed them and the assignments—the costs had been paid on the 14th—I read the deeds to the defendants in English, and they appeared to understand them—O'Connor paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in our office on the 14th; part of the consideration money, and he told me that the balance would be paid.</p>

I have an account at the Westminster Bank—early in 1877 the Moriggias were indebted to me over 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told them they might take as long credit as they liked, provided they gave me security at four per cent interest—it was arranged that I should take four promissory notes for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each to be given by the two Moriggias, and they deposited as collateral security the leases of 26, Edward Street, Penton Place, and 173, Newington Butts—I gave them a fortnight's notice when the accept<lb/>ances became due—on 12th September, 1877, all the acceptances had been paid—on that day Carlo and Giovanni called and paid 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in satisfaction of the last promissory note, and I handed them back their leases—he gave me these notes, Nos. 59416 and 42228, stamped Forbes, Stuart, and Co., on the front—Mr. Shead is captain of one of my ships—I made him a present of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about this time, because he had been detained, I believe in part of the notes I received from the Moriggias—I also paid Mrs. Haynes some money in notes, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Moriggias.</p>

I had expected 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or at least 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."Subsequently to that an offer was made by the owner of the ice to sell the cargo, because they could not find any more money—these two letters refer to that transaction—I find that Goodchild was paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 15th, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 20th, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 24th—there is about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Goodchild's credit in the ledger—he still owed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is another letter of Cantor and Bell referring to 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from W.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I ascertained the deficiencies in the ice account from the ledger and cash-book, and the daily ice-sales book—I got the purchases of ice from the ledger and the invoices—it is not the practice of the firm to paste the invoices into their books—the ledger is a copy of the totals of the invoices, but I took the original invoices, and compared them with the ledger—I find 3,139 tons of ice invoiced to them from 3rd May to 22nd September—I have before me the actual invoices for these amounts—they show 4,639 tons of ice to account for by sales or otherwise including the 1,500 tons—the average price at which the 3,189 tons are invoiced to them is about a pound a ton, except what they purchased of Mr. George Stevenson—I find that they bought ice to the amount of 3,100 tons after the stocktaking in May, of which they sold 2,595 tons—I traced that from the different documents—I have no means of telling whether the ice which is invoiced to them was delivered into their possession, except in two cases, and there are 10 invoices representing 676 tons—I went on 3rd May on Mr. Ward's behalf to look into the posi<lb/>tion of Moriggia Brothers—Mr. Ward is the endorsee of several bills of exchange drawn by J. Sadler—I don't know that they were accepted by Giovanni and C. Moriggia, or that they were given before the ice arrived in this country—I inquired of them in respect of what transactions they had given those bills to Mr. Sadler—they said that they had given accept<lb/>ances to Sadler for ice, and he had overdrawn on them—Giovanni was asked whether they were accommodation bills—he did not tell me he had accepted them for ice which had not arrived—he said they had accepted the bills, and received no value for them—Sadler is an ice broker—3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of ice was purchased at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, which brings the account up to 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they appear to have sold 2,595 tons—that leaves a deficiency of 2,044 tons to account for—I have not taken the selling value—they sold 2,595 tons, and I gave them credit for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. tons in the wells—that leaves a total net deficiency of 1,744 tons, taking the price which they</p>

               <p>assume to have sold at, namely, 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton—I can show you by the books that they sold ice at 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot tell whether it is block ice—I valued the ice in the well as rough ice at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I am speaking of ice, not ice cream, but ice delivered from the ships—there were about 20 carmen—there is not the slightest indication in the books as to where the ice has gone—each carman has a great number of establishments to deliver ice at—the loads would go through the streets during the day—if a carman leaves the ice to stand in the sun he would have to make it up—I am not a skilled witness as far as ice is concerned—I am not pre<lb/>pared to take my oath that there was a deficiency of 3,704<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I go by the figures in the book—I don't know whether any of the 20 carmen have embezzled ice daily—I do not say that in four and a half months they have embezzled 3,704<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of their creditors' money, but that is the deficiency—the only data upon which I have to go is that there is the book in which the ice delivered out to the 20 carmen is entered every day—I cannot go a step beyond that, but I can give you an explana<lb/>tion—the book was kept by Mr. Cetta's clerk at the time I took out the statement—I base my figures on these books—I have not the slightest idea where Cetta is—I have seen him enter the amounts in the books—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the lowest price mentioned in the books for a sale of ice—they are in a great muddle, but I formed my opinion from them—I knew that Giovanni was the manager of the business, and I assume that the books are correct—this is the mere essence of the books—I saw that a large portion of the ice was sold, and the money was received—if their servants robbed them, that would account for the deficiency—I allow 300 tons for the stock in the well at the time of their failure—I make no allowance whatever except for stock in trade—I inspected the ice in May, and from what I have learnt since I say that that quantity was there—he seems to have taken every precaution to prevent waste—I find from 3rd May up to the filing of the petition that there were regular payments into the bank almost every day—there is no blank of a week or a month with<lb/>out payments in—I find no other banking account besides this—I don't think there is a single entry in any of the books to show that they put any money on deposit or in the Post Office Savings Bank, or paid out any more from their own bank, except that there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn out by Giovanni just as they stopped—there is not the slightest secrecy about the leases of Edward Street and Newington Butts—I know perfectly well that they had the leases of those two houses—I asked them as to the value of those two houses—Giovanni said that he would not take 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the house at Newington Butts, and I could go and judge for myself—I put the two houses down at between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Cutter's valuation at 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was simply for the lease—I valued them independently of the goodwill—I valued the lease of Newington Butts at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and it was certainly worth it—I put down the total value of the leases at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the goodwill 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put down the lease of 173, Newington Butts at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., independently of the goodwill, and Edward Street 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one had a much longer period to run than the other—the 20 horses I valued are only put down here at 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. apiece—they were cart horses—he said that was the average price, and offered to show me the cheques—the busy time of the season is from May to September, and the horses were in bad condition when I went into possession—they had done all the work of the season—he told me that he had given 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>apiece for the carts, and offered to show me the cheques, but I was quite satisfied—I don't know that it was the same harness that I had valued at 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is put down at 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or whether it fitted the horses that were in the stable—I don't say they have exchanged old harness for new—I valued the ice at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton on 3rd May, and now at 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. simply to see whether they were in a position to pay—I have actually realised from the assets on behalf of the estate 1,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after deducting the costs—there is not 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound left now, and there never was—the total liabilities are 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have handed over to the trustees 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after deducting all preferential property—the preferential payments have to come out of the actual liabilities, and they are very considerable—I have not got 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the estate—there were 300 tons of ice when the Receiver went in—I don't know whether it was measured—the carts remained on the premises until the end of November or the beginning of December, and the Receiver kept on a portion of the servants, but others were discharged—the ice was sold by auction—the trustee was appointed on 15th October, and when the certificate is filed he becomes the responsible person and ousts the Receiver—on 14th October Mr. Andrews and the other trustee put a man in possession—the 300 tons of ice have not been in the well all the time—it was sold on October 3rd and realised about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was not 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The first Receiver was appointed on Giovanni's applica<lb/>tion—I had nothing to do with it—he sold the ice and the horses before I went in—the Receiver had 427<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the assets being 1,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. leaves rather less than 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is hardly 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—I have taken the figures of the ice accounts from their own books—the invoice and the ledger are the same—they charge them<lb/>selves in the ledger with having received the amount of ice which I have put down—when things are carried into the ledger it is a charge against the firm of having received them—the book from which I took the sales has "<hi rend="italic">Vendita</hi>" outside—(<hi rend="italic">The Interpreter explained this to mean cash-book sales</hi>)—that is the book in which they charge themselves with the money they have received—this other book is also marked "<hi rend="italic">Vendita</hi>"—the first column is supposed to be for the waste—in another column the carman charges himself with so much ice taken out which is to bring back so much money—the price of the ice varies at different places according to the customer to whom it is sold—a tradesman would be charged wholesale price and a gentleman would pay more—when I was making inquiries with regard to the estate in May Giovanni produced these books as being the correct books of his business—he also showed me a letter—when I went into the wells I said "There must be a waste; how do you get rid of the water?"—the clerk said "We have a floor at the bottom of the wells and a steam pump is at work night and day to prevent the accumulation of water, which dissolves the ice"—the engine is connected with the mineral water business—I want to explain that in taking the ice account considerable allowance must be made for waste—I have spoken to some most eminent men in the ice trade and they tell me that it would be a very fair thing to allow 10 per cent, deficiency, and if I do that it would amount to a deficiency of 1,250 tons instead of 1,744—that would still leave a deficiency of 2,790<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I looked at the horses at the time I made the valuation for Mr. Ward, but being no judge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187806240089"/>
               <p>I took Giovanni's valuation—the horses and vans were the two important items at the sale—the Receiver sold the horses, carts, and machinery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer of Great Marlborough Street—some property called the Tenter-ground estate was entrusted to me for sale; it comprised 122 houses, a public-house, and a chapel—the sale occupied two days, the 10th and 11th April—Mr. William Hale Willatts was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187806240091"/>
               <p>owner of the property—a vast number of advertisements of the sale were inserted, and bills of particulars posted, at an expense of more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid out of pocket—I saw the accused in the auction-room—I think he bid for the first lot—he was sitting where the vendor's solicitors usually sit, on the left of the rostrum—the property was put up in 100 lots—the defendant went on bidding for about three quarters of an hour, until 21 lots were knocked down to him, amounting to 11,145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then inquired whether the contracts were signed and the deposits paid—my clerk, Mr. Bozley, informed me that the gentleman would do it pre<lb/>sently—I insisted on its being done then, and Bozley came back with this cheque for 1,114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him not to allow it to be crossed—I endorsed it and sent it to Messrs. Hedges and Richards by a gentleman in the office of the solicitors to the vendor to cash it—in the meantime the defendant continued to bid, and ultimately bid for 23 lots more, amounting to 10,945<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a total of 22,090<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon that my clerk brought me this second order for the 10 per cent, deposit—before the gentleman returned who had gone to Messrs. Hedges and Richards the sale had concluded for that day, and the buyer had gone—the defendant had signed the contracts at the time he gave the cheques. (<hi rend="italic">These were signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Caher</hi>," <hi rend="italic">witnessed by R. Bozley</hi>.) The gentleman returned that same afternoon from Hedges and Richards's with a message that they were surprised at the defendant's audacity, or something of that kind; that they had no money of his—the second cheque was sent the next morning, and that was dishonoured also—I afterwards received this letter from the defendant, written on Messrs. Hedges and Richards's office paper, enclosing two stamps and stating that he would be at Barclay's on the 24th, and that the money would be paid there—I went there and presented the orders, and they said they had not heard of the man or had any money of his or any orders to pay any such cheques—these are the contracts, there are 44 of them—matters remained quiet until 6th May, when I received this letter from the defendant, stating that he had been ill ever since the sale—after making inquiries, the vendor's solicitor took out a summons—the defendant did not appear to it—I then received this post-card of 14th May—a second summons was taken out, and the defendant did not appear—an intimation was then given that if he did not appear a warrant would be issued—this second post-card, addressed to Mr. Alderman Hadley, is in the defendant's writing—I have never been able to obtain a shilling on these receipts or contracts, or to recover the expenses incurred by the auction, which, in<lb/>cluding my commission, is nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant bid repeatedly for the public-house—a brewer's agent bought it.</p>

Lord Caher, 3, Catherine Court, Tower Hill, E. C., and bears the postmark of Feb. 4,1878—he signed the contracts—I asked him for a cheque—he said he had not his cheque-book with him, would an I O U do—I said certainly not, it must be a cheque—he then took a piece of plain paper and wrote this cheque for 1,114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., addressed to Hedges and Richards, signed "Caher,"on demand, pay Robert Reid—he tried to cross it, I stopped him and told him it must be an open cheque—I took it to Mr. Reid, and he endorsed it—I provided the defendant with a stamp—I afterwards saw him about signing the cheque for the deposit on the remaining lots that he had purchased, and also saw him sign the remaining contracts—he signed the other cheque in the same way—this is it—I also furnished him with a stamp for that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Hedges and Richards, cornfactors—our counting-house is at 3, Catherine Court; the granaries are at Eagle Wharf, Wapping—the defendant was formerly in our service; I forget when, I think in 1876—we usually called him Butler; I knew that he claimed the title of Caher—his salary was, I think, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he acted as an ordinary clerk; he was only with us some few months; he left at the end of 1876—since he left we have lent him money; the largest amount, I think, was 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it Was an advance on goods that he had bought at a sale, pictures and tables—besides that I have lent him different small sums, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a pound, and I believe as much as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has said that he had bought goods at an auction and he wanted this to pay for them; and when he has been short of money I have given him a few shillings or half a sovereign out of kindness—I never had any money of his on deposit; I never authorised him to draw on my firm for money—he had no authority to draw on us for any such amounts as those two cheques; the first I knew of it was when they were presented—these letters and post-cards appear to be in his writing—he came in a few minutes after the clerk had gone who pre<lb/>sented the first cheque—I said "A clerk has been here with a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something like that; how came you to give one of that amount on us?"—he said "Oh, I intended to have seen Mr. Hedges, who, no doubt, would have advanced me the money," and he asked me if Mr. Hedges was in town—I said "No, he is away in the country"—he had been away for a day or two—I think he asked me when he was coming back—I think the defendant's private address was 11, Eaton Street.</p>

I heard screams, ran to the spot, and saw a child in the water—Shepherd jumped in, rescued it, and gave it to me—I took it to a doctor, but he was out, and I ran to the station with it as quick as I could go and gave it to Inspector "White—I then went to the prisoner's house and found her there with a lot more women, one of whom said to her "Here is the man who took the child to the station"—the prisoner asked me whether the child was drowned or not—I said "No, the child is alive"—some of the women told me to say that the child was dead,</p>

               <p>May I heard cries and Went to Totteridge Road—I saw the prisoners and the last witness struggling—McBrine held Edwin by the collar—he was trying to get him away—I took him on the other side—he drew this knife from his pocket and became very violent—he said he would rip the b—s up—Alfred rushed up and we all closed together—I left McBrine struggling with Alfred and the two women—he got on the ground—I afterwards drew my truncheon—it was taken from me; I was struggling with Edwin—when Alfred rushed up I fell on my stomach; I felt some<lb/>thing up my back—I afterwards examined this coat and found this hole—it would be caused by a knife—Edwin got away—when I was on my stomach I received a stab in my right thumb—Dr. Kempster afterwards saw it—I afterwards went with Gordon and Beard to 38, Totteridge Road—Gordon and Beard went in and brought the prisoners out—I and Beard took Alfred, and another constable took Edwin.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have been in the force between three and four years, and McBrine a shorter period—I never had an assault committed on me before—Alfred had a cap similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not hear Edwin say we were throttling him—we were struggling together—he might have said so—I did not use my truncheon—I took it out when I was lying on my stomach to defend myself; I could not do it and my staff was taken from me at once—I saw the prisoners' bruises—I heard the cut across one prisoner's head described at the police-court—I have no notion how it was done—they were in the same state when we first saw them—I did not see any people looking on before the prisoners went in the house—some were walking about, not many—I did not hear them call us cowards, nor say "Do not kill the man," nor say nor hear the words "Go and f—yourself"—I did not see the knife in Alfred's hand—a knife was taken from him—I do not know how the wound on my thumb was produced—Alfred was not trying to loosen Edwin's collar—I did not see this cap at the station—we did not strike Alfred on the head—I did not see the police use a truncheon—the knife must have gone underneath this coat—the coat was buttoned—I had a belt. (<hi rend="italic">The witness put on the coat</hi>.) This belt is not the same—I never saw the prisoners kicked by the police—I could not say how many people were about—I did not hear a policeman say "Now for your b—game, if that is your b—game," nor see one strike Alfred with some instrument—I never heard the words "Now, <hi rend="italic">Mac</hi>, for your stick, let him have it," nor see either of the prisoners hit by a policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. This cap has been in the prisoners' possession since they were in charge—it was not produced to the inspector—when I drew my truncheon I could not use it, because I was lying on my side—I drew it out and put it back—the truncheon was then drawn from me by Alfred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical officer attached to the police at Battersea—I saw McBrine and Harding and the two prisoners at the police-station—Harding had a punctured wound on the right thumb going into the last joint; his hands and face were covered with blood, and he was in a state of great exhaustion, evidently the result of exertion—Mc Brine had contusions on the head, as if he had been struck by a blunt weapon repeatedly, and a very severe contusion on the joint of the right thumb—he also was covered with blood—both constables had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187806240120"/>
               <p>several minor contusions—Mc Brine had the most severe, and Harding had the stab which might be caused by a knife—the prisoner Edwin had some contusions on the head; blood was flowing down his forehead; over the right eyebrow he had an abrasion three or four inches in length and about half an inch in width; his nose was bleeding, and his hands and face were covered with blood—the prisoner Alfred had contusions on the head, his nose was bleeding, and his hands and face were covered with blood—all their noses were bleeding—the abrasion was from a fall, and the bleeding of the noses from blows—Edwin had been drinking very much; the other prisoner had been drinking to a certain extent—it depends upon what they fought with as to whether all the injuries were consistent with the fight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, of 40, Totteridge Road—I remember hearing a noise on this night and going to my window, and afterwards outside—I saw two policemen standing at the back of the house—I heard one say "We shall have them presently, and as soon as we get hold ofthem we will kill the b—s"—they were about 7 yards off and in uniform—the prisoners were then in the house—a policeman then went in the house and brought out the prisoners—they started very quietly—I soon after saw a policeman kick Edwin on the thick part of the back of the leg—I saw no provocation by the prisoners—I went back into the house—I went to the police-court.</p>

I live at 40, Totteridge Road, and am the father of Oliver Had away—my daughter drew my attention to the noise, and went to the window—I saw two women crying "Let them go" four or five times—the prisoners said "Why don't you let us go"—they were going towards the York Road—that would be away from the station—I heard a cry "Cut my scarf"—I went back to bed—I afterwards went out—I saw two policemen walking to and fro in the street—I went back to my back room to rest—I heard a slam at a neighbour's door—I saw some policemen come—one was 6 yards from my window—I saw a police<lb/>man tightly holding Edwin's left arm, another the right arm, another standing by his right shoulder, and another come up and give him a sharp kick on the thigh—I said "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves, you have no right to kick him, you have no right to knock him about; Mr. Hogg is quiet"—I heard no answer—Mr. Hogg said something, but I did not hear a word—they went towards the station—about 26 yards off I saw the policemen punching Edwin—Mrs. Hogg said "I can see you knocking of them about"—I have lived next door to Mr. Hogg about 15 months—he has borne the best character, and is both sober and civil.</p>
