I saw a man put his hand into Mr. Lewis's pocket; we apprized him of it, and followed the man down a court: there Mr. Lewis found the prisoner, and by his appearance when in the public-house. I believe him to be the man that put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket. Soon after we were in the house, Drawwater went out, and brought in the handkerchief, which Mr. Lewis said was his property.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that court to the place you saw the hand in the prosecutor's pocket?</p>
               <p>Gordon. The court was on the opposite side of the way, about half a dozen doors distant; the man immediately made cross the way, and ran down the hill, and got out of my sight before he got to the court: when I got to the court, a person told me a man was just gone down there; there was no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any account how he came there?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say whether that man that you saw run down the alley was the same man you saw the prosecutor had by the collar?</p>
               <p>Drawwater. No, I cannot. I saw no other man run down that court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Drawwater. He said he knew nothing of the handkerchief, and desired to be searched, and pulled off his coat: the prosecutor went out, and returned again, and said he could not see his handkerchief; then I took a candle, and went to the place, and saw the handkerchief lying in a spout; it seemed to be tucked in: this spout is within about a yard of the bottom of the court. I brought it in, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 27th of May, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, going to Cecil-street Coffee-house, in the Strand, I felt a jirk at my pocket; I looked, and saw my handkerchief in the hand of a little boy, and he delivered it to the prisoner: I seized him, and he delivered it to a third person; having nobody to assist me, I could catch none but the prisoner and one of the others. I carried them into the coffee-house, and desired the waiter to search them, but he did not chuse to do it, and I did not care to do it myself, I did not find my handkerchief, but let them both go. The prisoner was taken up afterwards, for picking another gentleman's pocket; then I appeared before Mr. Alderman Nelson, and gave the same account as I have here; upon which, he bound me over to appear: this is the fourteenth handkerchief that I have lost this winter; I have transported three persons, and intend never to forgive any that I can catch.</p>

While I was measuring it, Mr. Gagnon came in, and asked May whether he had not got more ribbons than he had paid for? May said, no. Then my mistress came in, and other people, and the ribbons were found in May's pockets, which were in the box when I set it before them.</p>

            , my apprentice, Jack, look sharp after them fellows, they look more like thieves than horses; it is my opinion they are going to steal something: I was talking to a customer, and my apprentice said they were looking at some ribbons; presently he said, There! they have put some in their pockets now: presently he said, There, there! they have taken some more: then I said to him, come over with me: we went into the prosecutrix's shop, and a carpenter followed us: I said to May, what is that you put in your pocket, friend? he said, Sir, I have nothing in my pocket. I took him by the collar, and he shuffled his hand into his right hand pocket, and took out two rolls of ribbon, and slipped them into the box: I immediately laid hold of them: (He takes up two rolls, one purple, the other blue and white): these are they: said I, you villain, you have stole them. I put my hand into his left-hand pocket, and pulled out the other roll of green ribbon; then he said, he did not mean to steal them: I found nothing upon Stanley. Then I sent the carpenter for Mr. Clay, the high-constable: they both begged for mercy, pulling their hats off, and said, you are a young man as well as we: you don't know what you may come to: they said it was the very first time they had been guilty of any such thing, and begged to be let go.</p>

               <p>Wilson. There is one more. I cannot tell who took them, nor the time when, exactly, but I missed them after they were gone; I had a strong suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, she is a poor creature, lying about the place, asking charity, and we could hardly keep her out of the place. I taxed her with taking them, about a fortnight or three weeks after, she acknowledged she took them, and said, if I would give her two shillings, she would fetch them back again, but did not tell where they were. I told her if she would go with me, I would go and pay for them and gave her something for herself; so she went with me to a broker's shop, by London-wall, where I found them; she had eight-pence on one and nine-pence  on the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am a person that has gone on a long while, and have lost all my friends, and am fatherless; I have followed these people 20 years, and have been brought to utter destruction for them: I was in destruction 12 months, and that made me pawn my cloths. I went to Mr. Wesley, to see if he would recover my cloths; then he promised to let me have my cloths: then he carried me on for about 12 months. I went to his wife, and told her I could not get my living, being let to perish without mercy. I was one day walking very solitary in the Foundery; I met a man who took me down these lanthorns, and I went and pawned one for 8 d. and the other for 9 d. but who that man was, I do not know. I went to my Lord Mayor, and the Justices, to try if I could recover my cloths: I told them what I was drove to; they sent me to Mr. Wesley, to go and require of him to let me have my cloths: they took me up. and put me in Clerkenwell, where I lived upon a poor bit of bread and a little water.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wilson. Is this account she has given, true or false?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It is all a false story. I do believed the poor creature to be a little out of her mind.</p>

               <p>Vaugh. I have empty ones in the same cellar. At night, I happened to go into a public-house, where were some neighbours: there was a pipe-maker said to me, I believe I had two gallons of your brandy; I asked him where he got it? he said, in a court by Nightingale-lane, in a common necessary. The prisoner was taken up, and he owned to me he had stole the brandy from me; then he was carried before the Bench of Justices, where he confessed the same; this was last monday or Tuesday: he there said he had a confederate with him: we had a warrant, and took him up; his name is

            . On Friday morning, about half an hour after 4 o'clock, I got up to go to the work: (I am a pipe-maker.) I opened a little back yard door, where I live, in Nightingale-lane, and went into a common necessary; and I saw a kagg behind the door; it was about ten gallons. I carried the kagg into my house, and the prisoner, whom I had not then seen, followed me through the yard, and said, what have you got there? I said I could not tell, but I'll soon see. I took a gimlet, and bored down the bung, and took the bung up, and by what I could find, it was French brandy: he said it was his, and asked me to give it him: I asked him how he came by it? he said his master was mate of ship, at the Hermitage, to whom he belonged: I bid him go and fetch his master, and if he would give me any thing for finding it, he should have it again. He went down the lane, and came up again, and said he had been to his master; and his master said I might take the value of two gallons of the liquor, and give him the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the place where the kagg was found, and Wapping-stairs, where the protecutor's cellar is?</p>
               <p>Hulme. It is about 400 yards. I heard the prisoner own before the justices that he stole it.</p>
               <p>Bridge Maryot. I live in Greenwood-court, Nightingale-lane. I saw the prisoner standing at the gate; he asked me if I would buy any brandy? he said he was afraid he should lose it, and his master would be angry with him: he asked 4 s. 6 d. a gallon for it; I bid him 4 s. and if his master did not like that, he should have it again, for I did not want it. I paid him 20 s. and took the brandy: this was about 7 o'clock.</p>

On the 29th of February, between ten and eleven in the forenoon, the prisoner came to my house; the witness and another sailor were with him. I not being at home, was sent for, and told to go to the Red-lion alehouse to them. I went to them; the prisoner said, Do you not know me? I said yes; you are come to pay me 4 s. the difference between a gun and a pistol, which we agreed for last night: he had came to me; I was in bed; he came up stairs without With-your-leave, or By-your-leave, and asked me what I would give for an old gun? and he brings a pistol of mine in his hand, which he had in the shop: he asked what he must give me in exchange? we agreed for him to give me 4 s. he carried the pistol away, and left the gun, and was to come again to pay me. When at the Red Lyon, he said he wanted to speak with me: I went into the yard with him; he said an officer belonging to an Indiaman wanted a pair of pistols, and wanted me to let him carry them to him; I told him he could not expect that, as I did not know him: then he shewed me a note, which he said he had, which was an order of the captains, to bring some things. I let him have the pistols, and agreed to have a guinea for them. Dinner was getting ready; he and the sailor staid and dined: at going away, the prisoner and sailor went through the shop; Harding whom they hired for a porter, did not. As they were got cross the way, Harding said, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070009"/> man has got a gun; I had seen it in the shop about ten minutes before: Harding went after him, and I thought would have brought him back, but I saw no more of them at that time. On the first of March, I had orders from the Justices at Greenwich, to come there; I went, and found the prisoner in the cage: he was taken before the justice; there I saw my gun lying on the justice's table; so it was flung upon poor Will to prosecute. ( The gun produced in court.) This gun was delivered to me to be cleaned.</p>

            . I live in Spittal-fields. The prisoner came to a public-house that day, and told me he had some goods at Deptford, and he would give me half a guinea if I would go and bring them safe, but I must be careful how I carried them: he said he had been to the Indies, and the things came from thence: he bid me put on my regi mentals. The note mentioned so many dozen of handkerchiefs, and so many dozen of china cups and saucers, and the like; and at the bottom of the note, was put, That the waterman had a bottle of slip: this was to be for a token that I came from the right person. I was to go for the things to the lower water-gate, at Deptford, and he went up Whitechapel, saying, he wanted to speak with a man, to whom he sold a gun: the prosecutor not being at home, we went to the Red Lyon, and he came there to us; he desired me to shew the prosecutor the note, which I did. After we had been at the prosecutor's house, I saw him going away with a gun in his hand; I said to the prosecutor, he has taken a gun; he had got a brace of pistols in his bosom: I went after him, and said, What do you do with that gun? he said he was going to make a present of it to a captain that was going to the Indies: we went all three of us to Deptford; there he went into a public-house, and called for a pint of beer; then he said, do you make all the speed you can to Mr. Butler's, and give him that note, and give it to none but him. I set out with a basket, and went to Mr. Butler's, at the Baptist-Head, at the Lower Water-gate, and delivered the note to him, expecting he would have delivered the things mentioned in it; he looked at it, and said it was a fraud, and I was the third porter that he had sent with such notes. I had lent the prisoner my silk handkerchief coming along, and made all the haste back I could to see for him; Mr. Butler said, if I could bring him to him, he would give me a crown. I had two or three men went with me: he was gone from the alehouse, but a gentleman's servant told us he had seen a man with a gun coming with two men on the back of Greenland-dock; we went, and met with him: I demanded my handkerchief from his neck, and we brought him and the gun to Mr. Butler's: he had sold the pair of pistols to one of the persons with him, but had not received the money: they are now at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I owned the prosecutor 4 s. we agreed for a gun for 18 s. but I know nothing of this gun.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harding. Was there any agreement between the prosecutor and prisoner about a gun?</p>
               <p>Harding. While the prosecutor was doing something to a flint, the prisoner then stood with this gun in his hand, and they talked together in the back yard, but what they said I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>When the prisoners were going into the cart at Newgate, I went in at the Magpye; and as they were coming out, I ran out of the house; I was going to buy some nuts, and leaned on the prosecutor's shoulder; he said, you have got my watch: I said, I have not: he said, you have it in your hand; I held up both my hands directly. I never saw the watch.</p>

On Saturday the 6th of May, the prisoner and I were attending in the shop, while the others were at breakfast: I left the counter, to go to another part of the shop, to a canister of tea, and in the mean time, there came a child in to be served: I saw the prisoner weigh her tea out of a canister, and some sugar out of a tray; I saw it was a small parcel; I imagine he gave her change out of a six-pence; I saw him put his hand into the till to give her change: as she was going out at the door, I observed his hand, and went up to him, and was determined to see what he had in his hand; I laid hold of his hand, and he opened it: I took out three shillings from it, and said I was surprized he should go to do so. I took the money into the counting house, to the young man that was at breakfast, and left it there: it was made known to my master; but I attended in the shop, and did not hear him examined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Charlton. I am a constable, and was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; he was in the counting house, and three shillings lying before the prosecutor, on the tea table.

            . I live at Ridgment, in Bedfordshire, near the Duke of Bedford's. Being at work, at Stanmore, I came to London last Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070012"/> was a week, to see my son, who is an apprentice to a blacksmith, in Moor-fields: I had had two pints of beer at a public-house, in North-Audley-street; I left that house about twelve at night, and went to another in Tottenham court-road; going from thence to see my son, it was near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Warren. I was as sober as I am now. I had not been out of the house four or five minutes, before I was attacked: I was easing myself, and the prisoner came behind me, and threw me down on the stones, and began to rifle my pockets; I got away from him, and ran up Oxford road; there I saw him again, and he down with me again, by kicking up my heels, as I ran along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapon he had?</p>

               <p>Warren. No, I saw none. He then fell upon me, and I hollowed out for the watch; but he got hold of the handkerchief I had about my neck. So that I could not make much noise; he had like to have throtled me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Warren. I cannot remember that he said any thing to me, either of the times; he got his hand to my coat and breeches pocket, but the watch came so sharp upon him, that he had not time to take my purse: I had fast hold of his hand when in my pocket: two watchmen came when he was upon me, and took him to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from you?</p>
               <p>Warren. I lost a six-pence and some halfpence out of my coat pocket, and my handkerchief from my neck: my handkerchief was found upon him at the watch-house; (produced and deposed to): there were a shilling and some half-pence found upon him in the watch-house. I do suppose I should have lost my life, if help had not come.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of May, at night, as I had just called the hour two, I heard a man crying out in Soho-square, in great distress, seemingly; I darkened my lanthorn, and ran towards the noise; I found the prisoner upon his knees on the prosecutor, as he lay on his left side; the prisoner jumped up, and said; watchman, I charge you with this man, meaning the prosecutor. I said, friend, I shall charge you, for I believe you to be the aggressor; I took him by the collar, and

            , another watchman, came to my assistance: the prisoner said, are you taking me to the round-house? and attempted to slip off his frock, to get away from me; then I knocked up his heels, and we were forced to knock him down two or three times, before we could master him. We took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to Mr. Green, the constable of the night: when in the watch-house, Mr. Warren said he had lost his handkerchief; then the prisoner delivered it out of his hand to the constable; we secured his hands as we brought him along, so that I know he had it not in his hands then; but the first of my seeing it in the watch-house, was in his hand; he must have taken it from his pocket; he was searched, and a shilling and some halfpence were found upon him. The prosecutor said that was not his money; his was a six-pence: the prisoner said he got the handkerchief from him at the first attack, as it came off the prosecutor's neck, and he kept it.</p>

            . Between the 5th and 6th of May, I saw two men running along, the prisoner at the bar was the last of them; he cried Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Bettoe. This was some distance from Soho-square: I made a blow at the prosecutor, expecting he was the thief, but I missed him; my staff flew out of my hand: when I came up to my box again, I saw the other watchman running, and I followed into the square; when I came there, I found the prisoner in his custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you first saw them running?</p>
               <p>Bettoe. It was very near a quarter of an hour after: the prosecutor said he had lost his handkerchief, and sixpence and some half-pence. Kelly seemed to talk as if there had been a quarrel betwixt them: as we were going to the watch house, the prisoner endeavoured to make his escape; we had much ado to get him there. I heard him acknowledge the handkerchief was the prosecutor's handkerchief, and that he got it in the struggling, as it slipped off his neck.</p>
               <p>Matthew Green, the constable, gave the same account as the watchmen did, as to what passed in the watch-house. *</p>

He told me he would give me a spell; so in St. Paul's Church-yard I let him carry it: he turned into Pater-noster-row, and gave me the slip, and got off with it.</p>

            . On the 21st of April in the morning, the prisoner came into my house, in Plough-street, Goodman's-fields; he asked for a coat that lay in his name: I brought it down; he had brought it several times before. He pulled off his coat and waistcoat; he left them with me for ten shillings, and put on what he had pledged before. This being a Saturday, I said, Jacob, I thought you Jews would not touch money on your sabbath. He answered, As to money and a pretty girl, they may be touched at any time.</p>

I felt him take it out, and charged him directly with it; he said he had it not: then some people came about, and said they would carry him to a Justice of the Peace. Going along, there came a chair and knocked me down: I lost hold of the prisoner, and he ran away: a young man, named Harrington, ran and took him again: we carried him to St. Martin's round-house: he was searched, but no watch found.</p>

            . On Friday evening, the 18th of May, I saw the prosecutor standing at the corner of Pall-mall, and a great many people round him. I heard him say several times, the prisoner had robbed him of his watch: this was as the watch were going ten. The people were advising him to take the prisoner before a magistrate; he seemed to be a little in liquor, but seemed to speak very reasonably and sensibly. He said he had fell down, and two men helped him up, and that the prisoner had picked his pocket of a watch. The prisoner took the wall of a chair, which knocked the prosecutor down; the prisoner ran away, and I ran after him. In running about 20 yards towards the Golden Cross, he fell down, and I laid hold of him, and brought him to the prosecutor: he was taken to St. Martin's round-house, and the next morning before a magistrate. The prosecutor was at all times in the same story.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Brentford fair, and going to Joyner's-street, to my lodging, at my father-in-law's. Just at the corner of Pall-mall I saw the gentleman fall down upon the paving stones: another man was on his right side, and I on his left; he charged me with picking his pocket; the other man ran away; I know no more of it than the child unborn.</p>

He said, he saw three men take it out, and were gone that way, (pointing towards Newgate-street); there were several people gathered together: a person said, I saw a man run up the court just within Newgate-street, where is no thoroughfare. We went, and there found the prisoner: he told me he was an apprentice to a tea-board cutter in Water-lane. I charged him with stealing my handkerchief: he denied it: I never saw my handkerchief since.</p>

I am in the 15th year of my age; going thro' Newgate with my papa, the prisoner followed us: he was about a yard from us when I first saw him; there were two fellows with him; he hustled me away from the side of my papa: one of them got up to my papa, and snatched the handkerchief out of his pocket: it was a red and white linen one. The prisoner was by his side, and he gave the handkerchief to him, and the prisoner gave it to the other person; and they went away towards St. Paul's back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. I live in Fetter-lane, and was going to Cow-Cross; the man laid hold on my right arm, and asked me for my money: I said it was very trifling: he said, You have some. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out 9 s. in silver; he took it, and a blue silk handkerchief from my neck; and the woman took five-pence halfpenny out of my left-hand pocket; that was what I had in change out of a six-pence for a dram, as I came along. He took a Portugal piece of copper out, and looked at it, and gave it me again. The prisoner is much like that woman; then the man put me in an alley on the right hand side, and bid me stay there till he came to me. I turned round to make water, and there came a lusty fat woman; she asked me what I did there? I said I had been robbed; then she turned herself away, and I went away to my brother's; and what became of them I do not know; I never saw the man since.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. I was speaking of this at two or three houses in Cow-Cross, describing the woman; the people said they knew her, and the watchman told me where she was, at a house in Long-lane, West-Smithfield. I went to that house that day week, and there the prisoner was: there were two or three men: I challenged her about so and so, and she fell a crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say she is the woman upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. I believe it to be the woman; I will not swear she is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge her with?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. With having a hand in robbing me in Black-boy-alley; and she desired Edwards might be apprehended; and said, he threatened to beat her and use her ill, in case she did not assist in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where Edwards lived?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. No, she did not; there was a man brought to me of that name, but I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know her name?</p>
               <p>Pentycross. The watchman told me she went by the name of

            . I am servant to the prosecutor: we first missed two shirts, about six weeks ago; after that a pair of stockings. We knowing nobody came into the place but him, we mistrusted him; so I laid a shirt to trap him, and we left him in the room by himself. After he was gone, we went into the room, and the shirt was gone; then my master went and took him up, and I was by when the shirt was taken out of his pocket. (Two shirts, two neckcloths, and three pair of stockings produced.) These are my master's property; one of these shirts was taken out of his pocket, the other things were found upon him; this was on the 15th of May.</p>

Upon the door being opened, the woman of the house told me the same, and that I had been robbed of most of the things in the house. I went up stairs, and found the lock of my escrutore broke open; upon which I examined, and found a key that ought to be in it was taken out, and other drawers were broke open.

            . On the 20th of May, about ten in the evening, I thought I heard somebody in Capt. Cox's bed-chamber, which is over the room where I generally am. I took up the candle, and bid the maid follow me: on opening the Captain's room-door, I saw a clean shirt lie on the bed, and two white handkerchiefs lying on the ground. I went to the foot of the bed, and there I saw the prisoner; I asked him how he came there; he made me no answer; he had a bundle of linnen tied up in a napkin in his hand, which he let fall to the ground. I took hold of him, and took him into the dining-room, and bid the maid call my brother. The prisoner asked me to let him go, and said he had not got any thing: my brother came, and I desired him to take care of him till I got a proper officer. When the officer came, he searched him, and took from him a black shagreen case with the silver buckles in it; the things were carried to the watch-house, and delivered to the lanthorn-bearer. (Six shirts, part of the things, produced in court, and deposed to) These shirts were in the bundle which he had in his hand there was a parcel of keys taken out of his pocket, and another shagreen case with spoons in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>A. Ellistone. He used to come to see the Captain's servant; I have seen him before.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the things; I was in liquor, and might stroll in in order to see the Captain's servant.</p>

There were five or six of them in company in the common tap room: they drank porter in a silver tankard: I was not very well, and went to bed about 9 or 10. The tankard was not missed till the next morning; then we recollected the two women who had been drinking out of it last: they went for sisters: Pomfret was taken that very night, and carried to the watch-house; and the next morning, before the bench of Justices, she confessed that she was the very person that stole my tankard: she had confessed it before me and two or three others before we went there. On the Friday morning Lambert was taken, and they were both at the Justice's together. Lambert owned she had part of the money the tankard was sold for: they both said, they employed

Pomfret said the tankard was in his possession all that night, and the next morning he brought the money. Lambert said, she knew her sister, whom she called Pomfret, stole the tankard, and they went directly to the Jew, and he sold it.

I said, Certainly you must know how that was come by, as there was my father's name on the bottom of it. He said, he could neither read nor write. I took him to my father's house also; then the constable had brought Pomfret out ready to go before the justice. There Pomfret confessed she stole the tankard, and that Lambert went along with her to the jew to sell it, and the Jew gave her a guinea, a 6 s. 9 d. and 3 s. 3 d. halfpenny; and after that he asked for something for his trouble, and she gave him 2 s.

On the 8th of May, about 12 at night, I was standing at an ale-house door, next door to where I live; I saw Chambers coming up the street; I stopped to talk to him about our trade, about a quarter of an hour; the prisoner was standing by us. I shook hands with the deceased, and bid him a good night: he bid me a good night: I went up stairs to go to bed, and left Chambers talking with the prisoner in the street. I do not know what they talked about: the prisoner's wife was sitting on the stairs between his apartment and mine: I pulled off my jacket and coat, and before I could get my breeches off,

I immediately came down, and saw Chambers standing on the right hand of the door, and the prisoner on the lest; Chambers unbuttoned his jacket, and pulled his shirt out of his breeches: I saw his guts coming out on the left side of his belly: he said, that was the man that did it, pointing to the prisoner.</p>

            ; I saw Chambers talking with my husband at the door, and the prisoner was standing by them. Turtle said to Chambers, you are one of those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070019"/> that have been lying with Peg, (my husband is a little hard of hearing, and it is possible he might not hear it). Chambers said, Who is Peg? Turtle said, That is my wife, every body's whore; and you shall give me a pot of beer. Chambers said, he had no reason to give him a pot of beer, as he knew of. Turtle insisted mightily on a pot of beer. I took the candle, and went to bed with my husband, and left Turtle and Chambers talking together about the pot of beer. When we left Turtle, he wanted a bit of candle; we would give him none, because he was a little in liquor, and we were afraid he would set fire to the place. I had been up stairs but a very little while, it may be about seven or eight minutes, before I heard Chambers call out, Mother Roaper, I am stuck.</p>
               <p>Q. Betwixt your coming up stairs, and hearing Chambers call, do you know whether Turtle came up to his room?</p>
               <p>E. Roaper. Their room is the room below our's, and I cannot be positive of that. I thought Chambers was making game; I called out of the window, and said I could not come: I shut the window; then I heard other people and him call; he said, Mother Roaper, come down, for my guts are out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else were in the street when you left them?</p>
               <p>E. Roaper. I left them two together: I saw nobody else: then I took the candle, and ran down as fast as I could, and my husband after me. When I came to the door,

             crossed over the way to me, and said, I am stuck: then Turtle was looking in the kennel for his wig, opposite the door; said Chambers, My bowels are out. I looked, and saw them out about the length of my finger; I saw no blood there: he said, That villain has stuck me (pointing to Turtle); I am a dead man. I led Chambers to the watch-house, and my husband took hold of Turtle: I never saw any thing of a knife. As we were going along, Turtle said he had no knife: he was searched in the watch-house, but no knife was found. When Chambers was in the watch-house, he said Turtle was the man that killed him; he said the prisoner followed him a little way from the door; he did not think he had been stabbing him, but hitting him with his fist; and that it was about the pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Turtle by at the time the deceased made this declaration?</p>
               <p>E. Roaper. He was, but I never heard him say any thing. I went with Chambers to Dr. Basdell; he said it was a dangerous thing, and desired I would lead him to the watch-house, that they might send him to the infirmary, which I did. He was so weak and saint. I thought I should never get him back again. I went that same day to the Infitmary; he had a wound in his right side, just under his breast, and a wound on each thigh; the wound where his guts came out was on his left side: he bled very much from the wound near his breast on his right side. When I saw him there, he held up his head, and said, Ah, Mother Roaper, I shall die. He died that day about 2 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Israel. I live next door to the prisoner and Mr. Roaper, at the sign of the George, a public house; the prisoner came into our house that afternoon, between 4 and 5 o'clock, very much in liquor, and his wife the same: he called for liquor; my husband would not let him have any; then he said he would go and fetch some from another house, and drink it here; he went and got some beer, and came and drank it at his own bench. My husband and I went out about business to Whitechapel, and came home between 7 and 8; then the street was in an uproar with him and his wife; he kept making a noise; we went to supper at 10; Mr. Roaper and his wife came in, and had two pints of beer: I believe it was about 12 when they went away. After I lighted them out, I went to bed: I had been in bed but a small time; I heard a noise; I thought they were going to take Turtle to the watch-house. I got up and opened the window; the prisoner kept on making a noise in the street; what he said, I cannot tell: I saw Chambers a trifle of way from him; I saw nobody in the street but them two: Chambers stood still, and said never a word; I was surprized at it, that such a great man should stand still, and take a blow from the prisoner: I looked to see if he would strike the prisoner; I stood some time, and heard him cry, O, my guts: in a little time after, he cried, Mother Roaper, Mother Roaper, my guts are out: one of them was on one side of the kennel, and the other on the other side, about three or four yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>E. Israel. It was very moonlight: I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand: I did not see the prisoner do any thing to the deceased, nor the deceased to him: I had heard a fighting or wrestling before I got to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you wide awake?</p>
               <p>E. Israel. I believe I had just forgot myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it, after you got to the window, before he cried his guts were out?</p>
               <p>E. Israel. I believe it was about ten minutes: I did not see that they came near one another before Chambers said his guts were out: Turtle was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070020"/> so much under my window, that I could but just see him.</p>

            . I am the constable: Roaper and his wife, and some more neighbours, brought the deceased and prisoner to the watch-house: Chambers knowing me, said, Mr. Martin, I am stabbed, and killed, and shewed me the wound, and accused Turtle with it, saying, he had stabbed him: he said, You rogue, you villain, you have stabbed me; I am a dead man. We sent Chambers to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how he was wounded?</p>
               <p>Martin. He listed up his shirt; on the left side there were his bowels out; he had another wound on his right side near his breast, and, I think, another on his left thigh. Turtle said, Mr. Martin, I have no knife at all; if you'll believe me, I never did it. Chambers made answer, you rogue, you villain, you have stabbed me, I am a dead man. Turtle still said he did not do it; Chambers was sent back again, and we sent him to the Infirmary. The deceased's brother hearing he was stabbed, came at 7, and desired me to take the prisoner to the Infirmary, that the deceased might see him before he died, to see if he would swear to him. I took Turtle there, and as soon as Chambers saw him, he said, You rogue, you villain, you have stabbed me; I am a dead man. Turtle then said, Mr. Martin, I had no knife at all, and still denied it. I was ordered to take him before the justice; I went to Justice Pell; he said, he should be at the Infirmary by 11 o'clock, and ordered me to bring Turtle there. I put him into the Tower. gaol, and carried him there at the time. The doctor had just dressed the deceased, and sewed up his wound; and before the Justice Chambers mentioned the same words again, You rogue, you villain, you have stabbed me; I am a dead man: the prisoner again said he had no knife, de did not do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Martin. We did, but found no knife; neither was any found in the street. Justice Pell said to Chambers, take care what you are about, here is a life depending: he took down what the deceased said, and read it over to him, and swore him, and Chambers made his mark: (He takes a paper in his hand): this is it; here is Chambers's mark, and Justice Pell's hand to it. It was read over to Chambers, while he was upon his oath, by the Justice; and Chambers declared it to be true, and said the prisoner was a vile man, and a villain, and that he was a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Chambers then sensible?</p>
               <p>Martin. I believe he was as much in his senses as I am now: the justice examined him very closely: I asked Mr. Pell, whether I must carry him to gaol? he said no, carry him to the bench of justices at Whitechapel, saying he should be there by and by. Going along. Turtle said, I am very sorry for it; if the man should die, I shall not care how soon I am hanged out of the world; this he said several times, but in general he denied it. I said to him, it is a hard thing to die with this in your breast; you had better make an open confession, that you might find favour with God. He said, I'll do all I can: just as I was going to take him away from the justices, Mr. Shakespeare said, Stop, they say the man is dead. The justices sent a man, and said, if he is dead, be sure you see him yourself: the man came back, and said he had been dead about a quarter of an hour; then the prisoner said, I do not care if I was hanged immediately. I took him away to goal, and talked to him as we were going along, and while his irons were putting on, and said, it is impossible for you to make your peace with God, without you make an open confession; he said, I'll do all I can, to make my peace with God.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London infirmary. The deceased was taken in between two and three on Tuesday morning, the 8th of May; I was by at the time, and examined him as soon as he was in bed; there were five wounds about him, two on his right side; but the principal one was on the left side of his belly, where his bowels were coming out: the gut was not cut quite a-cross, but half an inch in length; there was a wound on each thigh; I apprehend the wound on his right side and thighs to be of no great consequence; he might lose some blood from them, but they were very small; I believe they might be about half an inch deep, done by some sharp instrument: they were about the same size as that on his left side.</p>

He lived about twelve hours; the wound on his left side was the occasion of his death it gut being cut, there was no possibility of saving him: there has been instances of a person living after the gut has been cut, but those instances are very few: a mortification would have come on, had he lived longer; for the excrement coming into his belly, would have occasioned his death.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was at my own door: this Roaper and Chambers, a man unknown to me, a man about six feet high, came up the street together; I could not get in; I generally go to bed about 9, never after 10 o'clock: they stood talking together at the door: presently Mr. Roaper goes up stairs; the big man turned away, and in about three or four minutes he returned, and went towards the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070023"/> door; I thought he was going up to his acquaintance; but instead of that, he came to me, and said, can I have a lodging here to night? I said no, my friend, I am very poor, and cannot get a lodging for myself: he said, I must lie here to night: indeed, said I, you shall not: with that, he up with his fist, and struck me on this side my head; he being a heavy lusty man, he struck me quite into the street, and broke my shin; it is now to be seen: I laid down there some time; then I got up, and clapped my hand to my head, because I found myself to be dizzy; I sat and rested myself, and feeling it cold, I put my hand up to my head, and missed my hat and wig; I found my leg fore, and my hand sore; I sat down very easily and quietly. I went to pull my handkerchief off my neck, to wipe my face, and I missed that. As I sat there, a woman right facing us came and said she heard me call out; she said to the big man, why do you serve him so? and said, somebody is abusing the old man. This great man, Chambers, came right up to her; I take it by his bigness, to be the same man that struck me. The young woman called Mrs. Roaper down stairs; he came too, and he laid hold of me: I cried, search me now; I had time to run away, if I had done any mischief. I gave them all room to search me: they hauled me to the watch-house, and in the morning they carried me to the hospital: I went up to the side of the bed; they cried, look at the man: the surgeon asked him if I was the man that did it? he answered, he looks much like the man, but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. Did the deceased speak with certainty, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Martin. As soon as ever he saw him, he said, You villain, you stabb'd me; and I am a dead man: this he said several times. The deceased owned he struck the prisoner once, for accusing him about his wife; being innocent of what he charged him with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The deceased declared he never knew me, nor never saw me, nor drank with me.</p>
               <p>Bechenoe. Chambers declared that he had seen the prisoner, but never knew him but by sight; he owned he struck the prisoner with his open hand, upon demanding a pot of beer of him, for having to do with his wife; that immediately he found the prisoner strike him, but did not know it was with a knife, till the effusion of blood.</p>

I went to a ditch hard by, to wash myself, and did not see what passed, till I saw Smith lying dead on the grass, and could not speak a word. I said to Riley, why don't you take up the man? he took hold of him, and pulled his neck; then he could speak a little; they got him into a coach, and brought him home. I went to see him the next day, about 11 o'clock, and asked him how he did? said he, I am well enough, if you be well; and he died that afternoon.</p>

When Sherriden gave up, the prisoner and deceased had high words; they fought, and had a good many blows; they fought a considerable time; and when they were grasping one another, Smith gave a cross-buttock to the prisoner, with intent to throw the prisoner over him: the prisoner was very loath to come down; and Smith, in attempting to do it, threw himself backwards upon his own head: as soon as he was down, I catched hold of the back of his head and his chin, and pulled the joint, and his neck gave a nick; I thought it came an inch and a half when I pulled it; the joint was out; he could not speak till I pulled it, and in a few minutes after he spoke. About a quarter of an hour before he died, I went to his bed-side, and said, How do you find yourself now? he said, I think I am a great deal better, since I lost some blood.

About the beginning of last April, I lost two saddles from out of my stables: the prisoner was stopped with another saddle, not mine, and taken before the justice and committed; I went to him in the Gatehouse; there he confessed to me he had sold one of mine, to Mr. Perkin, a saddler, in Piccadilly. I had an account by my saddler, that the other saddle was sold to Mr. Mussen, in Piccadilly, near the White-Bear; (two saddles produced in court): these are the two saddles; they are marked with my own name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mussen. I cannot positively swear to the prisoner, but I believe by his tongue he is the man that came to me, and said his master had given him a good second-hand saddle, because it was too small for his horse, and hurt him; and he gave him orders to bespeak a new one, and desired me to meet him on Friday morning, at the George, to take measure of his horse, and said, then I should have farther directions about makeing the saddle. I asked him his name? he said his name was Hodge; I gave him 13 s. for this, and I was to go very early, he said, or his master would be gone out. On the Monday morning, I sent my apprentice, but there was no such man to be found. In about a week after, I was sent for, being a constable, to take charge of a man that was stopped on suspicion of stealing a saddle: I went and took charge of the prisoner at the bar: the prisoner confessed before Justice Wright to the stealing some saddles, but he denied that he stole this.</p>

On the 30th of May, my money was in a leather purse, in my pocket, when I went to bed; there was eight shillings and half a guinea: I laid my breeches under my head, and when I awaked about four o'clock, I missed him out of bed, and found the door was locked. I went to see for my money, and it was gone: I made a noise, and somebody came and opened the door: I took the prisoner up in Middle-row, Holborn; and before Justice Fielding he confessed he took my money: he was searched, and but 12 d. 1/2 was found upon him. I asked him what he had done with it? he said he had given 5 s. 3 d. in gold, and 5 s. in silver, to another man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rock. The prosecutor and prisoner lodged together in my house. Between four and five in the morning, the prosecutor cried out Murder, murder; he was robbed. I got out of bed, and ran out of doors, into the street, thinking somebody wanted to get in; I found it to be in the house: I then went up stairs, and found it to be him; he was locked in: whether he had money to lose, or not, I cannot say.</p>

I remember the prisoner being at our house: my mistress and I came into the house together; she at one door, and I at another; I saw the prisoner with these cloaths; she was sitting in a box in the tap-room, (this was about four o'clock) tucking the things up, under her petticoats, and one of my young mistresses hanging sleeves hung down below her cloaths: I took the things from near the ground, under the bottom of her petticoats, (mentioning the things by name); one of the gowns belongs to me, the other things are the property of my master; they were taken from a table in the little parlour; I had seen them there about half an hour before. I asked her how she came to do such a thing? she put her hands together, and cry'd very much, and said, indeed I have not got any thing. I said, for what reason did you take them? she said, she took them for want.</p>

I sent her up to make the bed, and bid her be careful that she did not throw it down, nor tread upon it; it had been pulled off in the evening, with another, and left there: she came down, and said she had made the bed, and found the other, but could not find the ring with the diamonds in it. After we had some disputes, and warning given having thought in my own mind, that she was not so honest as I could with, I chose at her going away, to examine her box; I saw her take something out of a small trunk, and her countenance changed. I said, what have you in your hand? she said, nothing. I clasped hold of her hand, and in it she had my ring, and a stock-buckle, wrapped up in a bit of cotton; (the ring produced in court, and deposed to): then she said she found it.</p>

My mistress and I had a few words, and I gave her warning: miss being very ill, she got a gentleman to ask me to stay till she was better, I said I would; then my mistress came to me, and said, Hannah, will you go today? I said, yes I would. She desired to look over my things, and I said, you are very welcome. I let her see every thing: it was far from my knowledge to think this was my mistress's ring: she told me it was a diamond ring, and this is a red stone ring.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pottoo. I told her it had four small diamonds, and a red stone in the middle: I said, it was a ring she had seen my daughter wear; she had seen my daughter wear it several times.</p>

Mrs. Parry came as a visitor: the prisoner at the bar was a servant of mine: Mrs. Parry came the 23d of May, and the prisoner came the same day: she came from the intelligence office: my wife hired her, and ordered her to come the same evening: she came about 10 o'clock: she said she had lived at one Mr. Hummond's, at Low-Layton: my wife took the direction, and sent to know her character, but she went away before we had an answer; she went away between ten and eleven at night; she brought no cloaths with her, but what she brought on her back. After supper, we were going to bed, and enquired where she was, and found there was a candle left upon the cutting-bench, and the shop door was left upon the single lock. Mrs. Parry walked up stairs, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment: I took an account from her what things she had lost, and went to Justice Fielding that night; it wanted a quarter of 12 o'clock when I got there: I sent a boy of mine where the prisoner said she lived, but could get no intelligence of her there: the next day she was taken up on another affair, on Ludgate-hill, between five and six o'clock, and was taken before a magistrate. I asked her how she came to take the things, and whether she had any body to assist her? she said, there was nobody to assist her: there were several things found upon her back, a cap and bonnet, a cloak, a laced cap and handkerchief, a shift, stockings, and other things: she owned she had taken these things from my house.</p>

I said, I could not. She said she came from Kensington, where she, had lived two years, and had never been in London before; I took compassion on her, and took her to my lodgings; she lay with me that night, but what she had, I know no more than the child unborn.</p>

I went to the brewhouse, and found she was gone, and a bridle and saddle also. I had seen her in the stable about ten over night: this mare is my own property, which I had before I entered into partnership: there was a sorrel horse, the property of my partner and me, missing at the same time, from the same stable, which is in the dray-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was your mare?</p>
               <p>Chase. She was a brown saddle mare: we used our best endeavours to find them again; we had them advertised, and printed hand-bills. On the Friday morning I was informed by Mr. Blackwell, that my mare was at Walthamstow, and the man that took her in custody. I went, and found the horse and mare at Lea-bridge, standing at the foot of the bridge, and the prisoner in custody at a public house there. I was told the prisoner had sold the saddle to a barge-man; I asked the prisoner if it was true; he said, he had; I asked him, how he came by the horse and mare? he said, he found them in the marshes tied together, with the bridle and saddle on one of them. When we came before the Justices at the Angel and Crown, he said he found them in a close. I said, You first said you found them in the marshes; he said then, he found them in a close by the marshes. After that, he said he found them in a close near the Bell at Laytonstone, where he had left my mare: he never acknowledged taking them from the stable; he owned he went to the Bell at Laytonstone, and had three pints of beer; and having no money, he left the mare with

            . I was told the mare and gelding were lost out of the stable; I sent to the turnpikes, and could get no information of them; we advertised them, and had hand-bills delivered about.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them last?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I saw them both in the stable about ten o'clock the evening before. Mr. Hillier's son came to me on Thursday evening, about eleven o'clock, and called me out of bed, and said his father had got the man that had the horse and mare. I went, and found the horse at the King's head at Walthamstow: there was the prisoner drinking in a room; I asked him, how he came by the horse and mare? He said, he found them tied together. I asked him, what was become of the mare? he said, she was at the Bell at Laytonstone. He equivocated about them: first he said he found them in the marsh; then, in a close; then, in a close by the side of the marsh: then he said, he found one at one place, and the other at another. I went over again on the Friday morning, and sent for the mare; she was brought to us where the horse was, and we brought them and the prisoner home.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the stable locked up?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No, it was not, because we are fetching the horses out almost all hours of the night.</p>
               <p>Sacheverel Hillier. I live at the ferry-house at Walthamstow; the prisoner came to my house, and had three pints of liquor on Thursday the 10th in the morning: I had been out, but found him there about 11 o'clock; he slept, I believe, five hours; he had the sorrel horse with him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070030"/> observed two sacks upon his horse; I asked him whose they were? he said, I knew better than he did; they were mine; I took them; he brought the saddle into the house, and offered it me for a shilling; I said I would have nothing to do with it; he said he would sell it; then John Phips bought it of him for four shillings; then he offered to sell the horse to Phips; I desired he would have nothing to do with him, for I suspected he stole him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose horse did he say he was?</p>
               <p>Hillier. He said it was his horse; after that he said it was Mr. Trueman's servant's horse. After that, he wanted a pint of brandy-hot; I would not let him have any thing; then he wanted a pint of beer; I said, You shall have nothing; and bid him go out of the house. I watched him, and after he was got a pretty way, he was returning; I went and met him, and saw he had got a sack under his arm; then I searched him, to see he had no fire-arms, and took him before Mr. Barties, a Justice of the Peace, and had him examined about the horse: he gave a very lame account; I took him to the King's Head, and offered him a pot of beer. A young man there was looking in the news-paper, and saw the horse and mare advertised: the horse was described properly. I went and told the Justice of it; then the prisoner owned the horse was Mr. Mitchell's property, and said he had left the mare at Mr. Taylor's, at the Bell. I sent for Mr. Mitchell, and was present when the horse and mare were delivered to Messrs. Mitchell and Chase.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man has one of the bridles; I do not know what business he has with it; he would have had the horse, if I would have let him; he would have had the whole tote; he is no better than he should be, for all he has got a curled wig on.</p>

On the 10th of May the prisoner came to my house, and a beggar-woman along with her; she called for a pint of beer for the woman, and had a groat's worth of salmon to herself, and gave what she did not eat to the woman. She came to me, and asked me to give her change for a 5 s. 3 d. I kept my gold in a tin box; I had at that time 12 guineas in it: after I had put the 5 s. 3 d. in among the rest, I put it in my pocket: this is all that passed that day. She came again on the 16th; then she had a corded striped sack and petticoat, a flounced hat, and black satten cardinal on; she had two pints of beer; I was at dinner; she paid for the two pints of beer; there was nobody in the tap-room but she, and the maid, and I: she went out, and stood on the threshold of the door about a minute: there came a man in, and she followed him; he had a glass of shrub, and gave me a guinea to change; I changed it, and put the guinea in my tin box, and put my box in my pocket. Then she said, Pray, Madam, let me have a little of your good brandy. I said, How much? said she, A quartern; come and bring the bottle and glass, I want to speak to you. She was sitting at the corner of the table, in a corner; she pulled me to her, and got so close to me, close to the side where my pocket hung: she said, she wanted to have a little of my advice; I said, I did not know how to give advice: she got so close, I could not move my hand. I poured her out a glass of brandy; she took it; then she began to talk to me: she told me, one Captain Young, belonging to the Marquis of Granby, that was quartered in the north of Scotland,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070033"/> had decoyed a niece of her's, under pretence of marrying her, and had got her with child, and had now married a milliner in Cornhill. She wanted to know if she could sue the captain for half the fortune; she said, she had sent an attorney's letter to him. I told her, as her kinswoman had been so weak as to let him get her with child, I thought she could not avail herself in the affair. She went out, and left me sitting there; she turned round a little table, and went out. I put my hand in my pocket, to put a sixpence in, and missed my box. I asked my girl which way she went, and said she had picked my pocket of my tin box; I was informed, that she turned round upon the quay, and went like lightening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. This was a quarter after f our in the afternoon: she had said to me, the time she was at my house before, that she lived in East-Smithfield. I went in pursuit of her; I enquired about; I was told there was such a woman went along in a black bombazeen sack and petticoat: I offered a guinea reward for taking her: my son-in-law took her in Tooley-street, and brought her into an ale-house there, the sign of the Two Brewers. I was sent for; I asked her, how she could be such a Judas to serve me so? I was there told, she was going into a pawnbroker's with a sack and petticoat, and a white fustian riding-habit, to pawn: I said, These things you bought with my money; She said, I did; and when you come to the Old Bailey, I'll make a fool of you; for I have law at my fingers ends. I said, I could swear to your cloaths you had on when you robbed me, which were a narrow striped sack and petticoat: I have the sack and petticoat here to be produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that she was taken?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. She robbed me on the Thursday, and she was not taken till Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. I lost five guineas and a half, and a pair of Mocha buttons, all in the tin box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your box or buttons again?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not this woman been several times at your house?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. She has.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at your house at this last time, besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. There was nobody but she, my maid, and myself; my maid was washing the pots; after she was going out of the house, a man came up to the bar, and had half a quartern of rum-shrub, and she followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was she taken up on?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. On the 19th day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not go publicly by your door after this?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What magistrate did you go before?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. Before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to her, when at the Mansion-house, You b - h, if it costs me all I am worth, I'll have you hanged, or I'll hang you myself?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. No, I never said such a word in my life.</p>

            . When the prisoner was taken up in Tooley-street, and was carried into the alehouse, Mrs. Kelso, who is my mother, came; the things were lying on her knee: my mother said, You bought these with my money: the prisoner said, I did. She was in a black bombazeen sack and petticoat; I saw her go by our door; I live in Tooley-street; I said I had seen her at my mother's, and believed that was the woman that had robbed her. My husband watched her into a pawnbroker's shop; she was just going to untie the riding-dress, and he took her to an alehouse, and charged a constable with her, and went for my mother.</p>

            . I live servant with Mrs. Kelso; the prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer, and paid for it; she sat a little while over it, then called for another; I believe she might stay an hour, or an hour and a half; she arose up to go from the table, and went and stood upon the sill of the door: a gentleman came in, and called for half a gill of rum-shrub; he asked my mistress to change a guinea; my mistress served him, and gave him change, and took her tin box out of her pocket, and put the guinea into it, and put it into her pocket again. The gentleman never spoke to her, nor she to him; she came then to the bar, and said she could drink a little of my mistress's good brandy, and desired my mistress to bring the bottle and glass; she said she had something to say to her; she begged her to sit down. As she was pulling my mistress to her, I saw her hand down at my mistress's pocket: when she came out, she came round the table, not by my mistress: I saw her left hand down by the right side of my mistress's pocket, and she went and flew out at the door, and ran along the Quay like lightening. After that, my mistress went to put a sixpence in her pocket, and cried, O Lord, Mary, that woman has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070034"/> robbed me of my box, and gold in it: I went round the Quay, but could not see her.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop on the 16th of May, about half an hour after four o'clock, or a quarter more, in the afternoon; she asked me if I had parted with a riding-habit that she had sold me about six months ago? I said no, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>M. Holford. I live at the Cross-keys on Little Tower-hill; she desired to have it again.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she drest?</p>
               <p>M. Holford. She was drest in a corded sack and coat; here they are; I bought them of her, (Produced in court).</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. This sack and petticoat the prisoner had on when she picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner go out of your house?</p>
               <p>M. Kelso. She went out about a quarter after four from my house, in these very things.</p>
               <p>M. Holford. She bought the riding-habit of me again, and gave me a guinea and a half for it; then she asked me if I had parted with her bombazeen sack and coat? I said, No. She bought that again; she gave me 28 s. for it. She then bought a riding-shirt for 7 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did she pay you in?</p>
               <p>Holford. She paid me in guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what she took them from, whether a purse, or what?</p>
               <p>Holford. She pulled them loose out of her pocket; I saw neither purse nor box: in the evening the prosecutrix came running to our house, and asked me if I saw such a person? I said, Yes; and I sold her such things, which I had bought of her before.</p>
               <p>Q. How had she used to appear?</p>
               <p>Holford. She always appeared like a gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what way of life she was in?</p>
               <p>Holford. No, I do not; she put the bombazeen sack and coat on in my house; and I gave her 2 s. for her old ones, the same as are here produced, which Mrs. Kelso says she had on at her house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the matter of picking her pocket of her money: I went into her house, and eat a lobster there: there was a master of a brig there; he sat on one side the table, and I on the other; and in the mean time I was there, a sailor came in, and drank a pint of beer at the end of the table; the master of the brig's name is George, by that woman calling him Mr. George. I paid for what I had, and went out; I was seized in Tooley-street, going into a pawnbroker's shop; two men came, and said, This is the lady: I asked what they wanted with me? they said, they would let me know by and by. They carried me into a house, till they sent for this woman; when she came, she said, You b - h, I'll have your life, if the judge does not have it: there were two men kept her from beating me at that time; I have a witness in court, that she told she would have my life, and I have witnesses that will prove they never saw me destitute of money or cloaths.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Verner Cappin. I know the prisoner at the bar; I am a habit-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her?</p>
               <p>Cappin. About eight or nine months; I made her a habit.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>
               <p>Cappin. I never heard but a very good character of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give her a character upon any other foundation than that of buying a habit of you?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Openshaw. I had been drinking, but was not drunk; the other man stepped back, and gave a bit of a beckon, and said they wanted to speak with me; they both laughed: they got me about six yards up the stable-yard; the soldier had hold of my arm all the way; then he knocked me down with his stick, and after that gave me a punch in my mouth with his fist, when I was upon my back on the ground, and said, if I did not lie still till such time he had searched my pockets, he would murder me. I desired he would not use me ill, and said I had no money of any signification about me: said the other man, See for his watch: that man was dressed in a blue coat. Then the soldier, (which was the prisoner) demanded my watch; I said I had none; he took a cheque handkerchief from my coat pocket, and about six-pennyworth of halfpence. When they could find no more money, he said, D - n you, I'll take your hat and wig. He took the hat from my head, and threw it to the other man, and said, Take that, and I'll take his wig; then they made out of the stable-yard as fast as possible: I got up, and ran, and cried Stop thief. They both of them did the same, as they ran up the street before me: the watchman saw them coming; he struck the prisoner, and put a stop to his running, and I came up. and laid hold of him; he dropped the wig, and the other man threw away the hat, and got away.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you take him?</p>

The prisoner said he took nothing from him, but he owned he did afterwards.

I said; home. Said he, I am locked out, if you will go with me to some night-house, I will give you a pint of beer: I said, I had no money about me. Going along, I saw a man lying down, in liquor; I took no particular notice of him; I walked on, and this young fellow had hold of my arm: in about five minutes, I heard the cry of Stop thief; I saw a man running by me in soldiers cloaths, and I called Stop thief: I kept walking on, and they catched hold of me. I asked the watchman what he wanted with me? he said, you rascal, you are the thief; there they took me to St. Anne's round-house, where I saw the gentleman; he was very much in liquor; he said, I think you are the man: the man at the round-house said, I don't know what to make of it: he was very much in liquor when he first came in.</p>

Somebody trod the heel of my shoe down, and I stooped to pluck it up before her. When I had put my shoe heel up, I looked round for the prisoner, and she made a motion for me to follow her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070038"/> I did, and we went into the first public-house we came to, and to the necessary; the prisoner sat down, and turned out a gold necklace, two rings, a guinea, a 5 s. 3 d. about 4 s. in silver, a pair of gold bobs, two sleeve buttons, and three groats: she gave me one of the rings with stones in it; I had the 5 s. 3 d. piece, and 4 s. and the 2 s. which she took out of another gentlewoman's pocket: then we made the best of our way for London, to her lodgings.</p>

As I tried to go on one side, she was before me, and stopped me; when I tried on the other side, she was still before me: there was a man on my right side that hindered me, which I believe to be the prisoner, Holliday. I said to the woman, what need you crowd so, here is room enough; she said, it is true, there is; this whole was but about half a minute. I was going to put the chain of my watch in the inside, and missed it. I never saw my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. What fort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Ogier. It was a metal watch, with two seals; the outside case tortoise-shell, and a steel chain. I am certain I had it about half an hour before: I had looked at it when it was about half an hour after eleven: I recollected the woman's face very well, and I think I recollect her voice: it appeared as if she had some design in stopping me. As soon as I felt for my watch, the place was so clear that any body might pass without the least crowd.</p>

               <p>A. Brinklow. We were picking pockets, and please you, my Lord. Mrs. Elger went up to him, and took his watch out of his pocket, but which way she got it out, I cannot tell; they hindered him from coming either on one side or the other. As soon as she had got it, she delivered it into my hand; it was a figured tortoise-shell spotted case; I never examined it, to look full at it, but I directly gave it to Holliday, under the Piazza's. I don't know what he did with it; we all left the place directly; and made the best of our way to St. Bride's church; Holliday went from us, and said he had put the watch safe: I never saw it after. Then we all went to an eating-house, in Flower-de-luce court, in Fleet-street, and dined: after that, we met at the two Blue Posts, facing Brook-street, Holborn, a place where we generally met at: there we divided a guinea and a crown piece, which we had out of a gentlewoman's pocket. Holliday left us after we came out of the two Blue Posts, intending to fetch this watch, from where he left it in the city; Martin was to have it; we met at Sadler's Wells: Holliday came to us there: we got a watch at the Wells, which Martin had.

She was a person of such a bad character, that nobody would take her in: my husband went with her to pawn a watch; he once fetched her ring out of pawn; and I heard her say, she would swear forty lives away, before she would go herself. She is a very wicked person: I used to talk to her to go to service; but she said, she would whore, thieve, or do any thing, rather than go to service; and if that would not do, her husband, that lives in good Cow-cross, must maintain her; he lives in good credit: she never was married to

I said, that man has picked my pocket, and I was determined to search him. I being alone, was something fearful: I searched the prisoner, and from behind him, under his coat, I brushed my handkerchief down; (produced and deposed to). I immediately seized him by the collar; he struggled with me, and tore his coat, and got away; I followed him into Crane-court, another man followed me; the prisoner slipped by me in the court (I saw him all the time); the other man laid hold of him: I believe they had some more desperate design upon my person.</p>

There were some odd things, which Mrs. Smith gave me; I went constantly with these handkerchiefs about my head and neck; I should have thought, if they had been hers, she would have owned them.
