            . I am an extra watchman in the Excise. On the evening of the 9th of November, I went on duty at the Basin of the West India Docks, at six o'clock. At about ten o'clock, I observed a man walking along side of the Basin, towards whom I went, suspecting, I said, is it you Kelly; the prisoner Kelly, said yes, and I turned back with him. He told me he had a charge of coffee and complained to me very much of the constables interrupting him in having a fire. I told him I thought he might do very well without fire. When we parted, he went on board a lighter, and then I went round the basin. I saw a light on board the barge that the prisoner went to. I met Pugh, and we got two constables, and went on board the barge. When we got on board we hallooed, and

             opened the hatch-way; I took the lanthorn from Pugh, and went down the hatch-way into the cabin; I found the two prisoners, Pritchard and Simpson, both laying down on the floor opposite the door. Kelly went and sat himself down at one end of the the cabin. There was a large fire, which is a thing not allowed. I bid the constable, Thomas Tatham, to search, and I saw him find a tin pot, about half full of warm grog, and by Kelly's side was a bladder, with three parts of a pint of rum in it, together with a gimblet, and a spoil. The barge in which we found Kelly, was a sugar lighter, that Simpson had the care of; Pritchard had the charge of the next barge, which was a rum lighter, and he is an extra Excise watchman. I examined the twenty-two casks of rum in Kelly's barge, and we found the side of cask No. 9, with a spoil in it, and leaking. The prisoners refused to surrender themselves to the constables, and we went to the guard-house, and got a file of men.</p>

I went to bed at about two o'clock, on the morning of the 22nd of December,leaving my house perfectly secure in all respects; more particularly that night, as I had been robbed the night previous. At about four o'clock in the morning, we were awakened by a strange noise; it was very dark; my wife got up; she is not here; the sweeps were to come at about five o'clock; she got up and let them in at that hour. In consequence of what she came and told me, I went down, and found the cellar door out side the house broken, and the grated one outside in the street also broken. I called the watchman, and found the prisoner in the back cellar.</p>

On Friday fortnight, I went to Mr. Kerslake's, as usual; Mr. Kerslake desired me to go into the cellar to remove some pig's dung, and unfortunately I was led to drink some brandy at the cock, which took such an effect upon me, that I layed down on the coals, and I fell asleep. When I awakened in the morning, I found myself in the dark, and could not remember where I was, and I tried to get out, and that piece of wood came off by pulling the door. When they came in, I was not concealed by any means, I stood up. When I was searched, there was no instruments of house-breaking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100004"/>found upon me, nor any thing that could shew a guilty design.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the evening of the 4th, I was going through St. Giles's, in company with Woodroffe, towards a place called the Seven Dials, and I observed the two prisoners; I followed them, suspecting they were going to commit some crime. They went to Crown-street, by the prosecutor's window; they walked to and fro, beside the shop in the court. The old prisoner tried the door several times, kept trying the Jatch, and watching the window. I desired Woodroffe to go to the other end of the court, to prevent the boy from going away. The man attempted the latch several times; then he took both hands and lifted it up, and went into the shop. In about a quarter of a minute, he came out, with something under his coat; Woodroffe apprehended him, and I took the boy; we shoved them both into the shop, and searched them; under the old man's coat we found the brushes, and we handcuffed them both together.</p>

They said they would return in an hour and a half, when these shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100005"/>were to be bound for them. When they were in the shop, I missed some shops; but did not take any particular notice until they were gone out; then I made a search, and missed eighteen pairs, they were tied up in three separate parcels, and when I had last seen them, I put them down towards the right hand coming into the shop. I missed some before they went out; they went past where they were. There were three men and two women in the shop besides them; this was Saturday, and a busy evening; the value was between three and four pounds.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 23rd of last month, the Saturday, I saw the three prisoners at the bar, in company with a lame man, coming out of a public-house, in New-street, Covent Garden. I suspected that there was something wrong going on, and I turned in Bedfordbury, and watched them. They had a lame man in company; the prisoners Cole and Page went on first, and the lame man and the boy, Scott, followed;they went down into Chandos-street, and thence into Maiden-lane, and through the different streets, until they came into Drury-lane; they went as direct a line as they could to this man's shop; before they stopped, they looked through the window for a minute or so, and then went about twenty yards below the shop, and had some conversation together. I placed myself on the opposite side of the way, and continued watching them. The boy, Scott, followed the lame man in; as soon as he got in, he took a bundle of shoes, and was coming out, and Page made room for him; he came out of the shop with the shoes under his arm; the prisoner, Page, was covering him while he stole the shoes in the shop. I let him go until I thought he had got out of the hearing of the other prisoners, I then took him into custody; he began hallooing, but I told him if he hallooed, I would choake him. Cole only stood and looked through the window. I left my brother officer to watch the other men. I took the shoes to the office, and locked the boy up.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I was with the former witness the whole of the time on the night in question. I saw the three prisoners come out with the lame man at the public-house; Cole was the man who went to different corners of the street, looking for the boy, not knowing that he was in custody; Page and the lame man were still in the shop at the time I returned; on their coming out, they all three joined company together. I went so near them that I could hear their conversation; I got close to their heels; I heard them in conversation in the dark, saying, they supposed the boy must have returned to the house whence they first came out of. Cole knocked the lame man down, saying, "he was going to bilk him out of his whack, he said, he would not let one out of his swagg." I took Page in custody, and took him up to the office. I could not get the other two. In about half an hour afterwards, Cole came up to the office, to know if any thing very particular happened within two hours, and I took him into custody. I searched Page, and found a bad dollar in one pocket, and a bad dollar in another pocket.</p>

               <p>Page's Defence. This lame man owed Mr. Cole and me some money. When we met him, we asked him for it; he said, he had only got a one-pound note; but he was going to buy a pair of shoes, and if we would go with him, when he got change, he would pay us the money. We waiked with him to this shoe-maker's shop, Cole waited on the outside; the lame man could only find one pair to fit him, and that was not bound; we agreed to call again in an hour for them. We then went to have something to drink, and on coming out, the lame man said he should not know the shop again. Then Cole said he wanted to bilk him; that was an excuse not to get change. Then they fell quarrelling, and Cole made a bit at the lame man: I took the lame man's part, and was quitting the quarrel when Mr. Godfrey took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Cole's Defence. What this young man says, is true.</p>

            . I am a shepherd to the Rev. Mr. Heale. I missed these sheep on the 8th, and had seen them safe on the 2nd; I missed six sheep that were marked with S H on their right side, and a heart on the hip. They were taken out of the flock, which consisted of two hundred and seventyfour. I have seen one at Hasefield, at Mr. Ivers's, in Middlesex, it was one of the six I am sure; the marks were remaining on it, and I knew it besides, by the nature of the sheep.</p>
               <p>MR. IVERS. I am a farmer, at Hasefield. In the early part of October, the prisoner came to me, it was either on a Monday, or a Tuesday; I don't specify which; he brought six sheep, and he requested me to let him put them into my fields until the Thursday, when he was going to take them to market. Four were taken on the Wednesday; but I don't know by whom, one is dead, and the other is in my possession now. Mr. Heale saw the sheep that is living yesterday; he came with his steward, and my man shewed it to him. I had no sheep marked like them; mine were all marked with a single P.</p>

I went again on Tuesday afternoon, and there were two missing; they were two red sided ones with white backs; one was rather heavier than the other; the heaviest was rather the darkest red; the horns of the lightest stood straight from her head, and the other's stood rather wider; there had been a mark of C.M. but I am not sure whether that was not worn out; we had had them the greatest part of the summer; one came in the summer, and we had had the other the greatest part of the year. I had frequent opportunities of seeing them; they were both heiffers; they were missing in the afternoon; I went directly after dinner, and got there at about two or three o'clock, as near as I can guess, and then I missed them. I have seen the hydes doubled up, but have not seen them opened. Mr. Burrell has no partner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREGORY. I am a labourer, at Chigwell; I am now in the employ of Mr. Hatton, of Barking.

            . The prisoner said,he had a conple of beasts to drive to Town; he said that to me and Wright, and asked us if we could help him to drive them to Town. I and Wright told him we had nothing to do, and we would. He said,he must go and see the man, to know which two to take, and get a note from the man. It was agreed between us, that we were to meet again; we did so, both I and Wright. The prisoner said he had been, and had seen the man, and had got a note, and knew which two to take. We were to go the next morning early with him, and drive them to London; this was about five or six o'clock in the evening. We went into the field where they were,into Mr. Hawley's field, a Monkton; it was near one or two o'clock in the morning; he shewed us which two we were to take, and we took them; we took two heiffers; I don't know rightly what colour they were; there was one rather bigger than the other; they were of a brownish colour, with a white mark down the back. We selected these two, and we drove them along the road to London; we came the Lee-bridge-road. When we got to London, we took them down to the slaughter-house. The prisoner came very near to the place, which was near Smithfield; I can't say what direction he gave us, but he shewed us the street we were to go down, and he stopped until we came back; he gave us the note too; he told us we were to receive six shillings from the man; I don't know the name of the street. I and Wright went together. We got to London at about six o'clock. We delivered the note to a man in the yard; we did not receive any thing from him. The money was thrown out of the window, two three-shilling pieces. We left the brasts there. We met the prisoner in the street again, very near the place where we left him. Wright and I had the six shillings. The prisoner returned with us as far as the Spread Eagle, at Sharebrook. He was in company with me and the beasts the whole way from Lee-bridge to London; he was with us at Hackney.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bacon. I had known the prisoner before; I had seen him once; I had killed a heiffer for him before, on the 27th of September; when I paid him for the other heiffer, he promissed me a hair. I saw no marks on these two heiffers; they were red sided and white backed ones, and one was considerably heavier than the other. I can't tell about the difference of the horns. When I received that note, I chuched six shillings out of the window. I sent a a message to Mr. Lloyd. by Mr. Poole. I killed one of these heiffers on Tuesday, and not receiving any orders, I killed the other on the Wednesday; the hydes went with my own bydes to Leadenhall-market, on the Tuesday, to Mr. Warmington, who is a hyde-salesman, in Leadenhall-market. All commission beasts that I kill, I put a mark on the nose of the letters of the owner's name, and the hydes of my own beasts, I mark with three cuts. I was directed to stop the sale of the hydes, until the Friday following, which would be about the 2nd of December, and then if there was no word sent up, to sell them. I saw Mr. Barrell on Friday, the 1st of December; he came to my house, and enquired of me about two heiffers. In consequence of the conversation that passed between us, he and I went to Mr. Warmington's at Leadenhall-market; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100007"/>was a lot of hydes produced, consisting of two or three and twenty. Mr. Burrell and I turned the hydes over one at a time, and I asked him if he could tell his hydes if he saw them, and he said, he could. In the course of the turning over, he selected one, and Mr. Warmington's foreman picked the other out. On Friday, the 24th of November, I saw the prisoner at the bar; it was the very next day after I received the heiffers; I saw him at my own house; he came to know about the heiffers; he asked how I got on with them? I told him very badly. I said there hangs one, and the other is at market, not sold; the one I pointed out to him, was one of those brought by the young men to whom I threw six shillings out of the window. He said there was a considerable deal of fat; I told him, I did not think so. Then I asked him if he had seen

            . I am a beast-salesman, and live at 10, Chappel-place, Pentonville. I attend Smithfield-market. I know the prisoner at the bar very well, and have known him many years. I saw the prisoner in November last, about the 24th; I saw him about some beasts. He said to me, where have you been. I have not seen you; I said your beef is not sold; he said, I know that; I have seen one in the slaughter-house; but you can let me have a little money on them, though they are not sold. I told him I had got another person to be answerable; where was that person I had received a note on the Thursday night or Friday morning; I won't be certain which. I told him I would not give him the money until got an order from the person. He said, I can't get an order, for the man is gone into Yorkshire. He said you will let me have a pound note. I told him that Charles Bacon had got the beef, and I did not mind letting him have a pound on Charles Bacon's account I was to receive the money for the beasts, for the same party as before. The prisoner can't write himself, and the former note is different. Bacon was to slaughter the beasts, and I was to sell them. I had transactions with the prisoner before, one bullock. Bacon slaughtered the bullock, and accounted to me for the produce of it, and I settled with the prisoner for the amount of that bullock. The conversation I had with the prisoner at the bar when he asked for a pound note, was relating to the two heiffers at Bacon'.</p>

            . I offered a reward for the apprehension of the thief, and I described them to the best of my knowledge. One of them, the biggest, was the darkest colour; her horns stood rather up, and wide. The smallest of the two was lighter, and her horns stood rather straight from her head. I had had the large one the greater part of the summer, and the other near two years; they were heiffers, and I was well acquainted with the marks of both. I went to Mr. Bacon's on the 1st of December; I described to Mr. Bacon the heiffers I had lost; it was the same description I have now given. In consequence of that description, he and I went to Leadenhall-market, to Warmington's; there was a lot of hydes produced there, in which these two skins were. I selected one. Mr. Bacon turned the skins over, one by one, and he made a stop at some of the skins which appeared something like, saying, is that yours; I told him to keep on, and when I saw it, I would tell him the skin. He turned over one or two more, and then I said pull out that, I can swear to that; the one I fixed upon was pulled out, and I knew it belonged to the smallest of the two heiffers of which I have been speaking. One of the horns of that had been broken, and I knew it by that circumstance. When I came to the largest, I did not exactly know it at the first moment, it was very dirty, and I was not positive at the moment; I have since known it to the hyde of the biggest beast; I knew it from the colour, and part of the old pitch mark, C.M. and from the horn which stood in; the pitch mark was quite visible The two heiffers had the mark of C.M. on the off side; it was rather worn out on the larger heiffer, but quite plain on the first. From all these marks, I had not the least doubt of their being my hydes, and the hydes of the two heiffers which I lost.</p>

In the latter end of November last, I received a parcel of hydes from Mr. Bacon; it was on a Tuesday, I took away a dozen; I took them to Leadenhall-market.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Mr. Kendon, and he asked me to go with him to take two heiffers to drive to Town. I went with him to the field where they were, and he tied his horse to the gate, and he went in with me, and told me to drive up two, which he pointed out; but they were so wild, I could not. He asked me if I would know them again; I told him I should, and he asked me if I would drive them to Cow Cross, Smithfield; he told me to get somebody to help me, and I got the two young men. I have lived with Admiral Harvey as land bailiff, and my prosecutor has known me upwards of twenty years.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise - A. Yes, by the breaking of the window; I was behind the counter, just by it, when I heard the window break; it was the shop window; I was within a yard and a half of the place; I heard the noise, and then turned round to see what it was, and I discovered the prisoner attempting to take out two counterpanes; they were within the shop, on the inside of the window that was broken; he could not get at them without breaking the window; he had hold of them when I saw him; I had something on the counter, and ran round, and at the time I came round, he thought he had secured the two counterpanes, and he was pulling the other articles off the lines; I laid hold of these articles that he was forcing out of the shop; there was a piece of corded muslin; his strength was superior to mine, and he forced me against the broken glass; I called stop thief two or three times through the broken hole; he had these articles which he got from the lines; he forced them out of my hands, and he then ran away; he had-tied the door; but I opened it, so that I forced my way through, and pursued him; I cried stop thief! and I think he got the distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, when a person came up, and laid hold of him; this person came up, and attempted to stop him, and he dropped the goods, and then ran off, and I picked up the articles.</p>

               <p>Q. From the time you saw him in struggling with you, until he was stopped, was he out of your sight - A.

            . On the 28th, between five and half past, I caught the prisoner at the bar, with two pieces of toilenet, my property, in his hands; he was just putting them into a sack, with another person. On the morning of the 26th, I missed some particular goods, and I suspected that they must have been taken out of the warehouse while they were shutting it up, for one part of our warehouse goes into the Blossom-innyard, and on this evening, I said, I would wait, and the prisoner came in at the street door, into the warehouse door, which was a little open, and there was another person holding a sack for him to put these pieces of toilenet into. I could not see him in the warehouse, because it was so dark; but I saw him in the passage leading to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUGHES. I am warehouse-man; I live next door to Mr. Hodgson. On the evening of the 28th, at about a quarter or half past five, I was sitting in my counting-house, when I heard an alarm of stop thief! I rushed out as quickley as I could; I found Mr. Hedgson with the prisoner at the bar by the collar, and he was coming out after some other man, then out of sight, and the two pieces of toilenet were laying on the threshold of the door, in the passage of Mr. Berkley, leading to Mr. Hodgson's warehouse.</p>

I fell in with a shipmate that night; he was going into Cheapside, and he said, he had got to go into a gentleman's house, and he went up and brought these things out, and asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100009"/>to put them into the bag for him, while he held it open, and then that gentleman seized me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor, I could not see him come out of the ware-house, because it was so dark, but I saw him in the passage with the goods, and I saw the other person who is not here, come from the other side of the way, and open the bag for him to put them in; and I took him in the altitude of putting them in.</p>

I am sure it was the prisoner. I ran after him; I saw him with the bundle, as he ran away, and as I was running after him. I saw him drop it; he was stopped very soon. I had lost sight of him just before he was stopped; he was taken directly.

I was sitting down for some time, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I got up, and went to the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar run; I pursued him; he turned round a corner, and I caught him there; I lost sight of him just whilst he got round the corner; I caught him immediately; not two hundred yards from where I was sitting down; I brought him back to the house I came out of; he had no hat when I caught him; he had a light coloured coat on. I ordered a light to be brought to the door, that the boy might be sure; the light was brought, and I asked the boy if that was the man, and he said he was. I asked the prisoner where he lived; he said in Whitechapel. I asked him, had he come from Whitechapel without a hat, but he made no reply. He said, he had been seeing a friend of his named Long, home. He stood behind a shutter when I caught him.</p>

            . I am a Manchester warehouseman. At about half past twelve o'clock, on Tuesday, the 2nd of January, I was standing at our warehouse door, in Size-lane, talking with a person of the warehouse, and the two prisoners at the bar passed by; I looked at them, and saw that they were the same I had seen in Lawrence-lane the day before. I followed them down Size-lane, into Budgerow, along Watling-street, and I met with an officer in Red Lion-court, and pointed them out to him. I turned down Bread-street, and went into Little Friday-street, where I saw the prisoner Thompson with a truss on his shoulder; I walked on gently after him, on the contrary side of the way, and Haines, who was behind, observed me noticing Thompson, and called out "old one" I passed, and stopped him with the truss; I asked him where he got it from; he said, if I would go with him, he would shew me; Haines also stopped. I gave the truss in charge of Shipton, the ticket-porter, who took it into a house, with me, and the two prisoners. I sent for the officer, Jackson, and had them immediately conveyed before the sitting Alderman. I never lost sight of this man with the parcel.</p>

I followed him into the street about a hundred yards, and caught him; I brought him back into the warehouse; a constable was sent for. The apple-man ran off, while I was following the prisoner.

On the 6th of December, I was sent for to Mr. Phene's, and on account of the loss of a roll of corpetting, he wished me to search Box's lodgings; in a bottom drawer in his lodging, in Old-street, I found part of a coachtop bed furniture; on searching further, I found some duplicates; one for a piece of print, for nine shillings; we went to the pawnbroker's to look at it, and it was eleven yards of new cotton. Under the bed, I found some mats, such as upholsterer's pack their goods in. I then locked the prisoner up in the Compter. I asked him how he became possessed of this property, and he said, that a woman who was lately dead, gave it to him. I then asked his wife, and she had no knowledge of it.</p>

            . I am an officer, belonging to Queen-square. On Monday, the 11th, the prisoner Ferguson was delivered into my custody. I asked him then where he was to meet Hawkins; Hawkins had at that time absconded; he said, he was to meet him at the Swan with Two Necks, in Tothill-street,at ten that morning; but was prevented from fulfilling his engagement, by being detained in the workhouse. In consequence of that. I went to the Swan with Two Necks, and gave the landlord some directions. I was afterwards sent for by the landlord; I took these articles from the prisoner Hawkins; he was laying asleep, with his head on this bundle,(producing a bundle,) round his neck he had this handkerchief, (producing it,) which appears to be torn by getting of the Chevaux de frise. I asked him where the remainder of the things was? he admitted he had committed the robbery, but said, he got drunk, and lost the things.</p>
               <p>"A confession of the prisoner Ferguson was here put in and read, stating, that after the rest of the paupers had retired to bed, the two prisoners broke into a certain room, termed the oakham room, where was a number of the paupers boxes, which they plundered of the various articles named in the indictment; that this spoil was to be equally divided between the prisoners. That Hawkins was discharged the next morning, and that the deponent (Ferguson,) threw the wearing apparel over the gate to him, and part caught on the chevaux-de-frise, which they could not ge off, and which led to a discovery, and to deponent (Ferguson's) detection."</p>

The two prisoners at the bar came and knocked at the door, on Sunday morning, when I was cleaning my shoes. When I opened the door, I stood in the way; they shoved me back and came in; they had not asked to come in, nor anything before that. They then took up a book which was on a board, and began to read; then Wiltshire put his hand behind him, at the same time he shewed me a coat, and said was it to sell; he put the cloth in question under the coat, and said, there my boy, here is the coat. The cloth was about two yards, and was lying on the counter behind him, and I saw him put it under the coat. Then he wrapped the coat up in a bundle, and said they could not stop any longer. They then went out together; and I called my brother; I saw them go to the next door, my brother went after them. I never saw the cloth again.</p>

The next shop, is of the same description as mine. When I came to the top of Church-row, I saw a young man running, and I followed him into a wine vaults, to which there were two doors, and he went out at the other as I came in. In consequence of informatio I received I went to Bedford Bury; my brother had described Sherlock, as blind of an eye; I knew them both before by sight. Coming from Vine-street, I met both the prisoners together, I seized them both by the neck-handkerchiefs; Sherlock said I hurt his neck I brought them to the constable's door, but he was not at home. They said if I would let them loose, they would stay until the constable came; I did so, and then Wiltshire ran off immediately, and Sherlock struck me several times; I called for assistance, and a gentleman came who and helped me to take him to St. Martin's watch-house.

I was ordered out at five o'clock upon business, to wait upon a gentleman; it was not then quite dark. The front door opens into a passage, and I secured it upon the latch when I went out. I came back at about twenty minutes past six; I had left different pieces of cloth on the counter, and those pieces which I have lost, were on a shelf by the door. When I came back, I missed three pieces of cloth. I have never seen any of the three pieces, but the one I saw at Bow-street. I met the prisoner Rawley; he passed close on the flags, and I called out stop thief,and took him in Great Guilford-street. When I came back to my shop, I found three pieces of cloth missing.</p>
               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I belong to Bow-street. I was on duty on the 15th of December, I saw the prisoners on the 14th, at about five o'clock in the evening. I was in company with Barrett, and saw Batts and Rawlay in Gray's-inn-lane. I saw them on the 15th; I watched them until they came to Mr. Poole's house; I saw the three prisoners in company with a forth person; I was in a house opposite the prosecutor's house; I was in that house on suspicion, because we had reason for it; my attention was awakened the night before; Barrett was with me. I went to the house of Mr. Poole,and communicated something to him. I observed the three prisoners, in company with a fourth person, come up the street; they passed by Mr. Poole's door. The one that is not here, remained about five doors from Mr. Poole's; the other three came down again towards Poole's house. Farthing went to the railing, and looked over, as it he were looking into Poole's shop; as soon as he had done that; he went towards the other two prisoners, and then Batts. went into the passage of Mr. Poole's house; then he came out. Rawley then immediately went into Mr. Poole's passage, as Batts had done just before.Batts then went in twice after that. Rawley first came out. and joined in company with Farthing at the door; then they went away from the door. Then Farthing took his situation, as before, and continued to do so as if he was looking into the shop. Then Batts went in a third time. I then moved myself from the situation in which I was, and saw him lay hold of the handle of the door, which door he opened; he came out, and spoke to Rawley, who was standing at the step of the door. Batts spoke to Rawley; Rawley went into the passage; I saw him go into the shop of Mr. Poole. In about three minutes he came out, with some cloth undes his arm. He turned towards the left, towards Brutfswick-square, in company with Farthing and Batts. I saw Rawley thrown down the cloth, which I picked up. When I came across the way, I found the prosecutor had got hold of Rawley; I am sure he dropped the cloth, for he was never out of my sight. I had seen somebody running, but I did not know it was Mr. Poole. Farthing was just by Rawley at the time he was stopped. Batts and Rawley had crossed to that side of the way.</p>

I told my brother-in-law to give me the candle, and I undid the window, and I jumped in; when I was in the apartment, I looked round, and on the right hand, I saw something looking very dark by the bed side; I made a blow at it with a stick I had in my hand; up jumped the prisoner at the bar, to beg I would not murder him; I held him until I got assistance. He told me that Mary Lebean had brought him in at the front door; that is the daughter of the landlady.

I asked him what he did there? his answer was, that he had been spreading some teas. Mr. Stockwell desired me to bring him out of the alley, and search him; I did so, and found twenty ounces of tea on him. In his left hand coat pocket, was a bag containing twelve ounces, and in each breeches pocket were four ounces; the bag has a string and two rings; so that it may hang down in the small-cloths, and not be perceived.</p>

I was going up Tower-hill, close by the Trinity House, and there was a person in the habit of a sailor, in company with another man, who was a Jew; it was between eleven and twelve, on Tower-hill that I met the prisoner, there was another person with him, like a Jew. The prisoner was dressed in a blue jacket, and canvass trowsers,and was dressed like a sailor. The sailor appeared as if he was selling a watch to the Jew; he tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I wanted to buy a good watch; I told him I had a very good one, and by no means wanted his. I told him I had no money to purchase his watch. He told me he was forced to sell her for want of money, and he said, sooner than he would let the b-y Jew have the watch, he would let me have a bargain of it. I told him I wanted no bargain of him, nor did I wish to have any thing to do with the watch; but I told him if he was in want of money to stop a little;accordingly I went away, and did my own business. When I came back, I found the sailor in the same place; the Jew said, if I would buy the watch, he would give me ten or eleven guineas for it; that was while I was away. When I came back the prisoner still wanted to sell me the watch. Then we went into a public-house. I told him I had no means of buying it, nor was I a judge. He told me he was forced to sell her, as he had no money, and she cost him fourteen guineas; he said he bought her in Liverpool, or some other sea port. I told him I would not buy the watch; but if he was so much in want of money, I should give him my watch, and a little money for his watch; I gave him five pounds and my watch, and he was to return it in three days after, and I was to have his watch the while. I parted with the money merely to help him, as he made believe to be distressed. When I went out of the public-house, the Jew asked me if I had bought the watch; I told him no; but I had relieved the sailor. I never saw the man afterwards until the day after, nor did I ever see my watch again, or money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I told the prisoner to come to Mr. Lacey's, at the end of three days, and he was committed and put into prison before the three days had expired; so that he could not return at the end of three days. I went to Mr. Morris, in the Minories, and he told me it was a comple take in.</p>

            . My wife and I were going up Dorset-street, Spital Fields; as I turned round, I saw a young fellow run by me in velveteen breeches and jacket; and I saw the prisoner run down with the truss under his arm. I lost sight of him in the corner. I crossed, and the prisoner threw the truss down, and ran as fast as his legs could carry him. I was informed he was taken, and brought back. The prisoner is the man I saw with the truss.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JEFFERIES. I was in Red Lion-street. I saw the bundle in the kennel, and took the prisones after running after him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I am acting as a Bow-street officer. On the 19th of last month, I was in company with Johnson, and Woodroffe, in the Strand; I saw the two prisoners at the opposite side of the way. knowing their characters, I took notice of them. I saw something underneath Butt's coat; we watched their motions for about an hundred yards; seeing them speak to each other; this was a little after six. I caught hold of Butts, and Johnson caught hold of Cassimere. I asked Butts what he had got, and he said nothing. I unbuttoned his coat, and took that bundle of silk, (producing it.) I asked him where he got it, and where he meant to take it to. He hesitated some time, and could not satisfy us, only that he had picked it up in Scotland yard. When I took it from him, this handkerchief was over it;he said he picked it up; I told him that could not be, for it was a very dirty night, and the bundle was quite clean. We then took them to Bow-street. By the letters C. H. we guessed it belonged either to somebody at Charing Cross, Cheapside, or Chelsea; at last we found it belonged to the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office,Marlborough-street. On the 14th of December last, I was in company with Mr. Glover, who is an inspector of the Bank. In consequence of information which I received, I went to Ward's-row, Bethnell Green. I had watched the prisoner there a day or two before; I saw her coming from No. 9, Ward's-row. Upon seeing her, I took her into custody, I told her she was in custody, and I must search her; she said very well. I found on her a purse, in which was upwards of thirty pounds in good notes, some gold, and a key of a box; we were at this time at a public-house. I told her to sit down, whilst I examined the notes; she did so, and on finding the notes were good, I asked her if she had any other notes good or bad in her possession? she said not any. I proceeded to search her I was about to unbutton her pelisse, when she 
               <persName id="t18160110-36-person313">drew</persName>
             a small paper parcel from her bosom, and gave it to me saying, there sir, here they are, take them. Before I opened the parcel, I asked her what it contained? and she said forged notes, I have not had them in my possession above three minutes. I asked her if she had got any more, and she said not any. I told her I must proceed in searching her, and I did so. Underneath the underpart of her stays I found another small parcel, which contained twelve one-pound notes; they were all bad notes. I then sent her to the office, and I went to No. 9, Ward's-row, and saw Mr. Nightingale; I asked him where the prisoner's room was, describing her to him; he pointed out the room, and unlocked the door, he did in point of fact open the door. In that room I found a box, which I unlocked with the key I found on the prisoner; and in it I found two hundred and fifty four one-pound bad notes; and ninety nine two pound notes all bad. I took them and the box and Mr. Nightingale to the office in Marlborough-street. On Nightingales going into the room where she was, he taxed her with having brought him into trouble, by placing forged notes in his house. She said you have nothing to do with it, the room, the box, and the notes are mine, and I will take all consequences on myself. She requested I would let him out of custody; she said she had hired the room of him, under a pretence of putting contraband goods there. I marked the notes I took from her person. (Notes put into the hand of witness.) These are the ten one-pound notes I took from her bosom, I marked them, and delivered them to Mr. Glover. (Other notes put into the hand of the witness.) These are the twelve, I took from under her stays; they are also marked. (Other notes put into the hands of the witness.) These are the notes I found in her room, in her box; they are also marked. I asked her where she procured them, and she said that she would never tell.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am inspector of the Banknotes, of the Bank of England. I accompained the last witness Foy; I saw the notes taken from her person, but did not see those found that were in the box.(Three notes taken from the parcel found in the prisoner's bosom, and put into the hands of the witness.) These are all forged; the remaining seven of this parcel are also forged; also the twelve in the other parcel are forged. All the notes are of the same kind of filling up. All the signatures are the same hand writing; all the two-pound notes are from the same plate, and all filled up alike; they are all forged.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to take a room about three weeks before she was taken; she had a three pair back room in my house. In two or three days she brought a box. She told me she was a widow woman, and dealt in shawls and handkerchiefs, as a pedlar, and was very seldom in London.</p>

I advertized them, and when nobody answered, I kept them as my own. When I went out in the day in question, I put the two parcels in my bosom, which Mr. Foy found,</p>

            . My husband's name is John. At the time this affair happened, we lived in Mary-le-bone-lane; we sold clothes of all descriptions. On the 20th of December, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, and asked the price of a watch; I told him it was twenty five shillings. He looked at the watch, and went away without bidding any money for it. In a minute or two afterwards,he came in, and offered twenty three shillings for the watch; I told him, I could not take it. He turned his back to go out of the shop, and I went into the parlour. The pelisse in question was hanging inside the door, inside the door-way leading to the street; the door is open all day; there were two articles hung at the door before it; it was within the prisoner's reach at the door. A man came and told me that a man had ran away with the pelisse. I asked him to run after him, and he went together with another young man, named

This is the same house in which the prisoner and the deceased lived; he himself lodged in the gatrret, and she lodged in the same room; she was the woman he cohabit with. This was on the Saturday night, and Christmas Day was on the Monday following; I don't know what time I went out; but when I was returning, it was nearer eight then seven; when I came up to the house, I saw a great mob round the door; when I went up to see what it was, I saw the deceised laying on the steps of the door. When I went up to her, she could hardly speak. It is impossible for me to know whether she was in danger of death, nor do I know that she was sensible, as she was in a dying way; I don't think she had her perfect senses about her; she was carried to the watchhouse, and I went with her to the watchhouse; there she was in a sensible state. Afterwards she went to the Hospital; but I don't know whether she died going to the Hospital, or at the Hospital. I saw the prisoner that evening at the King and Queen, in Norton Falgate; I asked him how the woman came out of the window? He swore, and said how did he know. I told him he ought to know, because the woman had lodged with him upwards of two months? He said he had set by his own fire side, while she broke the windows with her kunckles; he did not say what window. I said, as he had lodged with the woman, he ought to have come down stairs, and seen what was the matter with her. He said if she had a mind to break her neck out of the window, that was nothing to him, and he swore again. I don't know whether they-had been quarrelling that day; I had not seen her or him either; I very seldom saw them.</p>

They were always quarrelling and wrangling; I knew the prisoner's voice, and I could distinguish the deceased's from it. At about eight o'clock in the evening of the 23rd, I heard the prisoner and the deceased wrangling; I heard him get up in a very great passion, and she came against the partition. He pushed her down two or three steps, by reason of which, she fell against my wainscott. I could see nothing; I could hear him go into the room again, and her follow him: I heard him get up and force her towards the door again; she said "you won't" three times. I understood that he was endeavouring to push her down stairs, and she said "you won't."Then I heard her fall down the whole pair of stairs. She said, "don't murder me," three times. The prisoner said, he did not want to murder her; but he would have his money. He shut his door, and went towards the fire, as I could hear. The woman was then down one pair of stairs; then I heard her groan very low. Then I heard the stair case window break; I heard it break four or five times; in about six or seven minutes, I heard her fall out; that was the two pair of stairs stair case. The prisoner at that time was in his room. Hearing this, I ran down stairs; she was laying just at the foot of the steps, on the flagstone, just under the window. I never saw either of them to my knowledge before. The neighbours came round, and I went to my own house.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Moore's-alley; that is almost facing the house the prisoner lived in; I knew the prisoner; but not the deceased. I heard the prisoner and her making a great noise, wrangling and quarrelling; I could not tell what it was about. I heard the deceased cry "murder," several times, and I heard her say, "for God's sake some good Christian come and help me" I heard the window break several times, It was ten minutes after this that I heard the window break; I could not tell what window; I did not see it at the time. I heard nothing else. Afterwards I went down after she fell out, and saw her laying on her back on the stones; she looked sensible in her eyes; she did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100018"/>speak. She was taken out of the alley to the watchhouse, and I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>ANN KELSEY. I live in this alley; my house is on the opposite side of the way to the prisoner's; it was up one pair of stairs. Between seven and eight, I heard the woman cry out "murder," I knew her voice; I went and opened my window,but saw nothing of her. I never held any conversation with the woman. I thought I could see a head hang out of the window, between seven and eight o'clock. I asked her what was the matter? and she said, she wanted to get out, and she said, if she could not get out, she would throw herself out of the window; I said, don't do that, until some body comes to you. I directly shut up the window, and came to my own fire place. My husband came down, and sat by the fire. I heard some thing fall out ef the window, very heavy; that was in a very few minutes after she said "she would throw herself out of window." Upon hearing this fall, I ran down with a candle, and went to the woman; she was laying with her foot in the kinnel; I went to her, and said, poor woman, have you hurt yourself, and she opened her eyes, and could not speak.</p>

            . I attended at the London Hospital. I remember the evening of Saturday, the 23rd; the deceased was brought to the Hospital soon after eight o'clock; she was dead. On my examining her, there was a bruize at the hinder part of her head; on removing the bone of the head, there was a quantity of fused blood between the duramater and the brain; the pressure of the fused blood was the cause of her death; there was neither fracture nor depression. She died of concussion. This exhavasated blood would occasion stupefection, and death, and might be produced from the blow we understand she received. I have no doubt that a fall would occasion it.</p>

They then returned again, and then the prisoner went in, and brought the glass out in his apron; then they went away. When they had got from the door a few yards, I went from behind my door, and followed them. The prisoners then seeing me following them, ran, and I cried stop thief; they separated, and ran different ways. I continued following the prisoner, who had the glass in his possession; he threw down the glass, in turning to make his escape, and the glass was broken. I got up to the prisoner when he was stopped in the Curtain-road; I brought him back to Mr. Mower's shop.</p>

I took those articles off, and put on a dry shirt; I took my pocket-book containing the notes out of the pocket of the jacket that I took off, and put it into the jacket I put on; there were twelve single notes in my pocket-book. I staid at home an hour and a half, which is longer than I ought to have done, and finding that the jacket I had taken off was dry, I put it on again; in my hurry, I forgot to take my pocket-book out. I then went to work, and returned between four and five o'clock; I cannot tell whether the jacket was there then. I did not miss it until the Thursday morning, when I got up: I should not have missed it then, only that my daughter told me something; I missed all the things between eight and nine. The next time I saw the jacket was on the prisoner's back, at Shadwell, between twelve and one, on Monday last; it was very promiscuously that I happened to hear of it, because he had had two hearings. I then went to look at the prisoner and the jacket, and knew it to be mine.</p>

The things were hung up to dry, all over the kitchen. I went to bed at about eleven o'clock, but I can't say exactly; my daughter went to bed at the same time, and my husband; the doors of the house were all fast; the door and the windows fast. There was wood work at the side of the windows, bars of wood. The window was fastened slightly on the inside by a small slight nail. This was on the Wednesday evening. I got up between seven and eight on the Thursday morning; my daughter was up first in the house; I sent her down. The things were not there that were put there the preceeding evening: I had seen my husband's jacket the night before; I had seen it an hour before I went to bed. When I went down on the Thursday morning, all was gone, and all was open; the bars were lifted slightly off, and put on again; the nails were forced out, and the window was right open. I saw this property at Shadwell office on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a patrole of Ratchiffe. I know the prisoner at the bar. I stopped him at half past five on Thursday morning; I mean the Thursday morning on which these things were missed. I had suspicion he had something in his bag, I stopped him with the bag, and took him to the watchhouse. This was about half a mile from the prosecutor's house; he had on this jacket. (producing it.) I took him to the watchhouse, and made him open the bag there. At first when I met him in the street, he said he had only a little flour. After he said that I opened the bag to look in it. The first thing he pulled out, was two white stockings wet. I told him to put them into the bag, and I should convey him to the watch-house; I delivered him to the officer of the night, he is here. I then went to my duty again. I left the bag also in the custody of the officer of the night. I left it and its contents, as I found it on the prisoner.</p>

On Monday the 1st of this month, I was in Fleet-street I had occasion to follow five men, and I followed them until they came to Pie-street, Westminster. In coming into Pie-street, at about twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners pass the five men, and speak to them; they were not two of the five. I observed the prisoner Curle with something under his coat; and knowing them, I suspected that they had something that did not belong to them. Curle turned round and saw me, and I knew be knew me. When I approached him, he gave the parcel to the prisoner Richards; I stopped them, and asked them what they had got; that was after he had delivered the parcel to Richards; Richards hesitated some time, and then said he had been of an errand for his mother. I asked him what was in the bundle? he said silk gowns. I asked him where he was going with them? and he said he was going to his mother's. I then asked him where his mother lived? and he said in Titchfield-street. I could not get anything out of him but that he was coming from his mother's and he was going to his mother's. On the Wednesday or Thursday I discovered Mr. Fielding had been robbed. This happened on the Monday.</p>

               <p>JOHN PERRY. I attend in the shop of Mr. Pulbrook, he keeps a shop at 48, Goswell-street; the shop lies backwards, it is about four feet from the dwelling house. There is a court runs down by the side of the house, it is called Willow-row, which goes into a skittle-ground. There are houses on one side of the way, and the other is a rope yard. We found a ladder in the yard. I was in this house on the 4th of December; we went to bed at about ten o'clock, and the next morning we missed the property in question. I found the shelves stripped, and the window taken down in the skittle ground.</p>

            . I am a patrole. At a little after five o'clock on the morning of the 5th of December, I saw the prisoner Smith running along George-street; she was running as fast as she could run with a large bundle, which I had some suspicion was stolen property. I directly followed after her, and heard a very loud knocking at a door. The woman was at first twenty or thirty yards before me; I saw a man and a woman standing at the door; they entered, and we followed them so quick, that they had not time to shut the door. We went up stairs, and there were five or six people drinking, and appeared as if they had been up all night. At the time we went up stairs, we heard the door shut, and then the property was gone. As we were going out, Jane Smith came in again; she was in and out several times; I knew her again, and took her with the property at a little before seven.</p>

I owed Mrs. Lewis about fifteen pounds for board and lodging. My husband wrote to me, if I received the ten pounds in James's-street, Adeiphi, to give her half; I had got five pounds in the Adelphi, and I offered her the whole five pounds in the morning, and she would not take it; I told her I would not give her my money, when she said, she would have my money or my heart's blood, because she said in the evening that I should not eat any more victuals in the house.

I saw him at the latter end of 1812, or beginning of 1813. In the latter part of June last, I met him in the Strand; about the middle of July, he called at my office. He asked me what I was doing; I told him, and where my place of business was. This passed when I saw him in the Strand. I told him I had a good connexion, but wanted capital. He said, a friend of his had promised to assist him with a sum of money, and that if he did, he would embark 500l. in my concern for prize purchases. On the 22nd of July, he called at my office, and he produced two bills; he said that his friend Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person381">Halladay</persName>
             had sent him those two bills. Upon looking at the bills, I observed they were the prisoner's acceptances. I remarked to him, that it would appear singular that I should negociate these two bills, one for 1100l. and the other for 800l. they being his acceptances. He said, he had received them from Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person382">Halladay</persName>
            , to whom he had formerly rendered essential services in the West Indies; and that if I negociated them I might invest 1000l. in joint purchases, 500l. on his account, as his proportion, and 500l. as mine, for which I was to pay interest. I asked him, how he was to provide for these bills when they became due. He replied, that Mr. Forbes, the drawer of the bills, would ship home colonial produce to cover the amount. He gave as a reference to the validity of the bills Messrs. Manning and Anderton, of Princes-street, near the Bank, and also Messrs. Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, on whom I waited; they vouched generally for the validity of the bills; both bills were indorsed with the name of "
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person383">
                  John 
                  Dougan

            ." I told him the money would not be of any use in my concern, if it was to be drawn out at the expiration of the two months, to provide for these bills; his reply to that was, that Mr. Forbes would ship home colonial produce to provide for these bills. After having made inquiries respecting the bills, and having received satisfactory answers I waited on the prisoner at his lodging, at 53, Tower-street. I then asked him, what reply I should make to a question which might be proposed to me-How I came possessed of the bills? he said, I might make use of Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person384">Halladay</persName>
            's name, with his sanction. The bills had been delivered to me at my office, and remained in my possession. On Sunday the 23rd of July, (the next day), after I had waited on the prisoner, I went to Portsmouth by the coach, taking the bills with me. I arrived there in the evening, and went to Mr. Huish's, at 28, High-street, Portsmouth; Mr. Huish is a navy agent; I had some connexions with him as such; I gave the bills to him to get them discounted; I myself indorsed them, either that evening or the next morning. I staid at Portsmouth about three days; I did not then received any discount. On my arrival in London I saw the prisoner. Before I received the proceeds of the bills, I told him what had transpired. I told him I had left the bills with Huish to get them discounted, and that I expected to hear the result every day. I saw him almost every day until I received the proceeds of the bills. I told him the purport of a letter that I had received from Huish, stating that he was surprised that Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person385">Halladay</persName>
             had not indorsed the bills. The prisoner said, he did not conceive Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person386">Halladay</persName>
            's indorsement would add any weight to the bills, but if it was still wished, Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person387">Halladay</persName>
             was then at Liverpool, and he could procure his indorsement. I afterwards received the proceeds of the bills. On the 4th of August, I received a bill from Portsmouth for 800l. drawn by Messrs. Godwin and Co. on Messrs. Masterman, at one month, and transmitted to me by Huish, on account of the bills; and at various other times I received to the amount of 1500l. on account from Huish; we had a running account between us. At various times I received the full amount of the bills. I paid to the amount altogether of 880l. to the prisoner on account of these bills, which would become due on the 22nd of September. As the time approached for these bills coming to maturity, I saw the prisoner several times. I asked him whether the bills would be paid or not? his reply was, "that he had been disappointed in the shipment of colonial produce from Mr. Forbes, but Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person388">Halladay</persName>
             would take them up." I think about the 21st of September, the day before the bills became due, the prisoner left directions at my office that the bills should be presented at Messrs. Manning and Anderton's, and that instructions should be sent to Messrs. Masterman for that purpose. I understood that they were to be presented at Manning and Anderton's, for them to take them up on behalf of Mr.

             SIR, - I have the satisfaction to inform you that I am authorized by Messrs. Smyth, Payne, and Smyth to say, that 1500l. will be paid by them as soon as the bills are presented.</p>
               <p>Signed, A. M'KINROTT."</p>
               <p>I received this on the Monday after the 22d, when the bills were due. I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday or Wednesday afterwards. I should inform you, that I had first waited upon Messrs. Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, upon the subject of this letter. I applied to them to take up these bills; they positively refused to do it. I communicated that to the prisoner; I told him that Messrs, Smyth, Payne, and Smyth told us, that they never authorized him (the prisoner) to say, that they would take up the bills; and furthermore, that they were in doubt whether there was such a person as Mr. M'Kinrott, the acceptor; and that it appeared to me, from the tenour of their conversation, that they either doubted the existence of M'Kenrott, or that they thought the signature "

On his return, he said he had been there, and related a conversation that had passed between them. This conversation passed in Baker's coffeehouse, in Pope's-head-alley, which is not very far off Smyth, Payne, and Smyth's. Then we went together to Mr. Briggs, the solicitor, in Essex-street; we went together, Mr. Huish, the prisoner M'Kenrott, and I. Mr. Briggs then held the bills for Messrs Godwin and Co. We informed Mr. Briggs of the conversation that passed between the prisoner and Haynes; we told him what I related before, that Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, positively refused to pay the bills; we related generally what passed in company of the prisoner. Mr. Briggs said he had instructions to proceed against all parties; Mr. M'Kenrott requested time, which Mr. Briggs granted; there that conversation ended. The prisoner, a few days prior to his apprehension, which was on the 28th or 29th of November, said, if I would find the balance that was in my hand of about 600l. he would find the remainder to take the bills up. I replied, it was impossible then, as the money was vested in my business; but I would not have the smallest objection to relieve the balance when I received it. The day before the prisoner's apprehension, he called at my office in the Adelphi; at that time I had received intelligence respecting the bills; in about three minutes after that the prisoner's clerk called; I endeavoured to make an appointment with the prisoner's clerk, to meet the prisoner that evening; I however made an appointment to meet him the next morning at 10 o'clock, at the New England coffeehouse. In consequence of that I attended there the next morning at 10 o'clock, accompanied by my solicitor, Mr. Price, and Limbrick the officer. The prisoner was sitting in the coffee-room; I told Mr. Price that he was there; he and Limbrick went up and brought him down. The prisoner said, he conceived I used him excessively ill; I told him he could not accuse me of that, as placed in the situation in which I was, and hearing that the signature "

            " was a forgery; I was compelled in my own defence to have him forthcoming. He replied, "If they are forgeries, I uttered them in the same state as I received them from Captain 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person394">Halladay</persName>

The prisoner then said, he had securities with himself to settle the bills with him, and wished to know whether it could be effected. I referred him to my solicitor, Mr. Price, and there the conversation ended. He was not taken into custody then; I was not present when he was given in charge. We walked on; I and Limbrick walked on, and the prisoner and Mr. Price followed us. We then went to Temple-bar, to the George coffee-house, where I left him in company with Limbrick, and never saw him afterwards until at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was in 1806 I first knew the prisoner in the West Indies; I considered him as deeply concerned in mercantile affairs; I know he was counected with Mr. Dougan; I took it for granted all was right; he give me these bills; he imposed no restraint on me in the manner I should dispose of them, either as to the manner or persons to whom. He did not hurry me to give him the money, but told me if I got the money I might invest 1000l. in my business. When I asked for a reference as to the validity of the bills, he referred me to Messrs. Manning and Anderton; Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, was the other house he referred me to; in these places they considered the bills as good and genuine. I told him that I told Huish to satisfy himself about the bills; he was aware that every possible inquiry was making, to ascertain whether the bills were valid; he wrote down the names of Manning and Anderton, and Smyth, Payne, and Smyth. I afterwards gave him 800l.; he got the whole of it in about a month after the bills were delivered to me; the bills had about two months to go. He did not go away; he continued about; he went down to Plymouth about some idle mission to Buonaparte. He was at a sea-port town, and I remitted him money whilst he was there; that was about the 5th or 6th of August, and the bills were payable on the 22d of September. Afterwards, when I discovered that the bills were dishonoured, and that Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, had some conception that the bills were not valid, I told the prisoner of it, so that I possessed him of what had passed at Smyth's. I watched his countenance, on purpose to see if he betrayed any symptoms of guilt, and he betrayed none. I told Mr. Huish of it. Even after this he went to Briggs's, and there I repeated the conversation in his presence; and at last he said, if I could accommodate the remaining 600l. he would make up the rest.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Richards. It was six or seven weeks before the bill became due that he went to Plymouth.</p>

Godwin and Co. at Portsmouth, to apply to the parties for payment, and if they were not paid, I was to proceed against the parties at law. In pursuance of those my instructions, I applied to the prisoner, Mr. M'Kinrctt. Before he would have received my letter, he called upon me, in company with Mr. Clarence. The prisoner then stated, that Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, would take up the bills, for the honour of the indorser

I was induced to go to Messrs. Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, by a letter which Mr. Huish brought to me (Letter put into the hand of witness.) That is the letter. I informed the prisoner that Smyth, Payne, and Co. were excessively indignant at their name being made use of. In that letter the prisoner stated that Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, had authorised him to say that they would pay the bills on their being presented. The prisoner said there must be some mistake, for that Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, had plenty of money in their hands of

            's, and he was sure if they were again presented, and a proper representation made, they would be paid. At his particular request I consented again to present the bills, which I did, and met with a similar answer they refused to pay them. When I next saw the prisoner, I told him of the second refusal, and told him I should arrest him for the money; I would write into the country for the necessary affidavit to hold him to bail, and I desired him to refer me to his solicitor. He promised to take up the bills, and called almost every day with excuses of some kind or other. In the course of these interviews, I inquired why he expected Mr. Dougan to take up the bills, of which he himself was the acceptor? His reply was, "that great commercial transactions had passed between him and Mr. Dougan, and the matter could easily be settled between them; he said that great transactions had passed, and that consignments of colonial produce were to have been made to take up these bills; I cannot positively say whether he stated that the consignments were to be made to Mr. Dougan or Mr. Forbes, but to the best of my recollection I think he said Mr. Dougan. He also said that Mr. Dougan and he were then jointly concerned in a schooner or sloop of war; and he said, he would bring the documents or the register of this ship, as security for these bills. He called at my office on the 4th of October, and stated that he was ready to pay the bills, but urged me not to issue the writ against him. Looking over one of the clerk's desks, he observed his own name in the writ, which was a special original. As a proof of his disposition to pay, he took out of his pocket-book a 100l. note, and begged that I would take that; after some entreaty (it being so small a portion of the amount of the bills), I consented that he should leave it; he said, that great expences had been incurred in preparing the writ, and it would go towards the costs, in all events. I told him it might affect the liability of the other indorses, and therefore I would not take it in part payment of the bills. He said, he would come the next morning with the remainder of the money, if I would not issue the writ; I consented not to issue it before eleven the next morning, but on no payment being made, I thereupon issued it; and on the 5th October he was arrested. I believe he went to prison, and then justified bail in Court; I recollect opposing that bail; notice was given to me on the 7th, and I should think, by two days' notice, he would have got out about the 9th. The last sitting in term they were under terms to plead. Just before that last sitting, on the 23d November, he called upon me, and requested me not to proceed to trial until the last sitting, and promised faithfully to take up the bills. He stated, he was sure Mr. Dougan, upon his arrival, which he expected daily, would immediately direct Smyth, Payne, and Smyth, to take up the bills. I informed him that I had heard Mr. Dougan had arrived. He said, he presumed that he would not come to London directly, but go to Teignmouth, where he had a country residence; and he said that he himself would pay the money on the following Wednesday; he pledged himself most faithfully. I had been making a great many inquiries for witnesses to prove the handwritings of the drawer and indorser, and I readily granted a postponement of the trial, seemingly as a favour. He told me that Mr. Forbes was attorney-general of Tortala.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. I first went to Smith and Co. by the direction of Clarance and Huish, upon their bringing me the letter. The prisoner was with me as early as the 26th, after the bills became due; I saw him continually until the 4th or 5th of October; I told him my purpose was to arrest him, and he even came to me. Conceiving he was a gentleman, I asked him who his solicitor was? and he said he would come any day I chose. I told him, the last time he came to me, that Mr. Dougan had arrived; and he told me where Mr. Dougan lived, and gave me the means of com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100024"/>municating with him. I think I heard it before, about an hour but however, the prisoner told me.</p>

            , called and examined by Mr. Richardson. I am a navy agent. In the year 1813 I was going to the West Indies, in pursuance of that my business. I had occasion for an interpreter; I advertised for that purpose, and the prisoner applied in consequence of that advertisement. He represented himself as having been in business at Liverpool, in partnership with a person named Routart, or Rouretart; that he had failed, and that he was an Austrian or Prussian by birth. A newspaper happened to be present, and he immediately, without hesitation, translated a passage, first into German, then French, then English, and proved to me that he was well skilled in languages. He referred me for his character to a gentleman named Mr. Slade, near Finsbury-square; in consequence I engaged him with a written engagement for two years, at 300l. a year. He continued in my employ to the period of that engagement, to the August of 1805, when I left the West Indies for England. I left England in May 1806 for the West Indies again, and went to Tortola, where I found the prisoner; I staid there till May 1808, when I returned to England; the prisoner was resident at Tortola while I was there. The next I heard of him was in 1809, by letter from another person. In consequence of what I heard, I wrote to my friends there, and desired my correspondent to pay 800 dollars towards paying his expenses home, and that he would pay a bill of 100l. down. The prisoner arrived in England in December 1809; I endeavoured to settle his affairs; his creditors said they had judgment against him. The last time I saw him was in 1812, just previous to my leaving England, in a lock-up-house. I proposed that the debt he owed me should be made over to his wife and children, and that I should apply to his creditors to give him 500l. and that in return he should give up his property to his creditors. This he refused to do; and I never saw him nor heard of him afterwards until my arrival here; I arrived in England on the 16th of November last, 1815. During the three years of my absence, I have never been either in Tortola or Nevis; I have never been at either of those places since 1808. I never authorised any person to make use of my name in bills of exchange. I know Mr.

            , Esq. Teignmouth, and is signed by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>After congratulating him on his safe arrival in England, he writes, "formerly I was honoured with your friendship, so much so as to enable me, without counter security, to lay the foundation of a fortune, which a series of misfortunes has reduced. Under these circumstances, might I without too great presumption, on considerations consisting of of mortgages and deposits, ask your assistance to the amount of 1000l. for six months. Large as this request seems, it is but small comparatively with your wealth, and would relieve me from the grinding and ruinous calamities which oppress me."</p>
               <p>I certainly had reason to reprove the prisoner once very severely for imitating my hand writing, and I told him the danger of it: that was when he was in my service. I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. - When I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100025"/>in the West Indies the prisoner rendered me very considerable services, for which I remunerated him beyond his salary. I employed him in matters of privacy. He continued as Interpreter to the Court of Admiralty, after I left. There was no other person who understood the languages. I know afterwards that he went into business for himself. I afterwards heard of his distress, and the effect of that distress on his understanding; it went to the extent of an attempt on his life; that was the occasion of my writing to relieve him. When he arrived in England, I was convinced that the report I had heard was true; not only from seeing his throat, but from other appearances. That was when I saw him, and endeavoured to induce him to compound with his creditors. I believe he was put in custody and was superintended; and I thought, at my own expence, of putting him under restraint. He had trusted some Frenchmen in the West Indies, which was the occasion of his ruin.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Richardson. My intercourse continued with him a month or two before I left this country in 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the impression of your mind during the latter part of your intercourse with him, as to his family? - A. I wish you would not put that question; I am in a particular situation.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sworn to speak the truth, and the whole truth. - A. I thought his reason had returned; it is merely a matter of opinion. He appeared to be in possession of his senses; yet there was a wildness about him, and inconsistencies in his conduct. His not accepting the proposal I made to him of compounding with his creditors, looks like an act of insanity.</p>

               <p>Q. by Mr. Gurney. Were you present when the prisoner opened his account, and gave in his signature - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord, I am aware that the forgery of a bill of exchange without a stamp, at places within the jurisdiction of the laws of England is cognizable by those laws, in the same manner as any other forgery; but here is a bill, purporting to be drawn at Nevis, which now appears was made and forged in this country. Your Lordship recollects the case of Mr. 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person428">
                  Richard

            ; and I apprehend that that case is similar to the present. There a bill of exchange was drawn upon an Irish stamp, and purported, on the face of it, to be drawn in Ireland; but it subsequently appeared that it was drawn in this country upon an Irish stamp, and that invalidated the bill. I humbly conceive that this bill is under similar circumstances.</p>

               <p>DEFENCE. The prisoner made a defence of some length, imputing this prosecution to a foul conspiracy, because he had some charges of felony and high treason to alledge against Mr. John Dougan.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR COOMBE. I am a physician. The prisoner called upon me soon after his arrival in this country from Tortola; I can't say at that time whether he was really mad or not, but I found in conversation with him, that kind of oddness and quickness in his manner, that if I had previously known of his having been deranged, I should have thought that that derangement still continued. Soon after this, the family that I was acquainted with in Tortola arrived in England; from them I learned that he had been twice deranged. About two years after that, or not quite so much, I was sent for to the Cambridge coffee-house in Newman-street, where I found him in a perfect state of derangement. I then called on the late Doctor 
               <persName id="t18160110-45-person430">Simmons</persName>
            ; I think the prisoner was then perfectly mad. From that time down to the present, a period of five years, I have seen him off and on. His wife lay-in about three months ago, and then I visited her, and used to see him. I really should think that his madness has continued up to the present time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. I have no recollection whether I saw him in July last; from the different times that I saw him, I am of opinion that he was never a perfectly same man, down to the present time; I did not think it necessary to put him under any confinement; I have seen him in a lockup-house.</p>

            . I am a merchant's clerk. I have known the prisoner for the last six years; indeed when I was but a boy. I saw him in 1809, after his return from Tortola. I first saw him at Plymouth, where I resided; I formed a sort of engagement with him to follow him up to London,where he intended to establish himself. I came to him, to the Cambridge coffee-house, in about ten days afterwards; I then conceived him decidedly deranged, from the incoherent questions he put to me on my arrival into the room; he would have a great number of candles lighted in his room; he talked of parties with the Austrian Ambassador and Mr. Percival; he was always talking of very great enterprises, where he had not even the means of paying the rent of the house. One day I offered him a snuff-box, on the cover of which was painted a Jew; on producing it, he accused me of having called him a Jew, and threatened to turn me out of the room. He remained there seven or eight days, and I removed him to the house of Mr. Scheffer, 178, Upper Thames-street; I continued there several months; I considered him as always labouring under mental derangement. He used to talk constantly of his being on trial, and he fancied himself under continement under some charge; under that impression he wrote a variety of letters. He used to walk about the house almost in a state of nakedness. His spirits varied considerably; to extreme dejection, but never to violence that I remember. He conceived a peculiar prejudice to Mrs. Scheffer, which he manifested by threatening her violently, and by the general crossness of his conduct towards her; she always treated him as he ought to be treated. At one time he accused me of owing him, some money, and when I made appear to him the incorrectness of what he stated, he challenged me to fight him. Four or five months he was quite calm to appearance, and we did not think it necessary to keep him locked up, and we let him out, not apprehending that he would do any mischief; but in the evening we ascertained that he had placed himself in the door-way of a shop, which he would not quit, and he was sent to the Poultry Compter; he threatened some violence to the officers. After that, he went from Mr. Scheffer's to the Horns Tavern, Doctors' Commons; I don't know how long he staid there. Thence he went to several private houses, but under arrest, I believe, from the Lords of Appeal. He after that went to Burder's, the sherifi's officer, at Grocer's-hall, in the Poultry; I believe he continued there twelve months. I had frequent opportunities of observing him whilst there; he was sometimes extremely agitated, and at other times appeared composed. My opinion with respect to his insanity always continued the same, and I have received letters from him which have strengthened that opinion. He told me in October last, that he had been agent for Buonaparte, and had superintended his general business in Europe. I knew of his going to Plymouth to subpocna Buonaparte, only by the newspapers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Richardson. He has been under no restraint on account of the state of his mind since he left Scheffer's, whom he left towards the close of 1810.</p>

            ; we live now in Leman-street, Good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100027"/>man's-fields. I know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. M'Kinrott. He came to live at our house on New-Years's day, 1809. He came from the Cambridge Coffee-house to us. Mr. Kock visited him at our house. He was not suffered to go out of the house, and was always locked up when I was at home by myself. He appeared to be very much deranged when he came to our house. I attended upon him myself. I discovered the state of his mind from the first evening. He was very indelicate in his conduct. He used to go about the house with nothing on but his shirt, and sometimes quite naked. He was constantly writing letters, and wanting me to go with them, to the Lord Mayor, and Sheriff's of London, and to the turnkey of Newgate; sometimes they were only directed. He used me very ill. He beat me very much, and got his hands round my neck to throttle me, because I desired him not to look over some private business of my husband's in the counting-house; he beat me with a book, which I got from him. I believe he used to be more so to me in particular, because I used to lock him up; unless I locked him up he would be always about the house, with two candles in his hands. He continued in this state, more or less, during the whole time that he was with us. I never changed my opinion; I always considered him deranged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Minchin. I cannot say I have seen him above twice since he left our house. Mr. Dougan took him away from our house.</p>

            . I am a sheriff's officer. The prisoner at the bar was brought to my custody about two years ago; he was in my custody about eleven months; he was brought to me by a Mr. Baker, who I believe is an officer of the Lords of the Appeal. He was not brought to me by process, out of any of the Courts at Westminster. Whilst he was with me, his conduct was very incoherent. He applied to me to lend him some money; I lent him 5l. upon bills of his own; when they became due they were not honoured, but he paid me that money afterwards. I was going to observe the conduct of the prisoner towards my servants; in one instance his throwing one of my servants on the fire. He thought himself highly offended because I refused to lend him a farther loan of 50l. In consequence of my refusing this, he came down from his room into my office, and expressed how much he disliked me above all other men that he had ever seen before. He received 3040l. before he left my house; he disposed of this money by paying the debts of the prisoners that were in my house, who were total strangers to him. I think that he was an insane man. He came to me in 1812. His paying the debts of the other prisoners was just before he left me. He sent me a letter one night, in the middle of the night, by the watchman. I don't mean to conclude that he was mad; I have handed that letter to the person who brought the prisoner to me. His breaking open the doors, and running up and down stairs with four lighted wax candles in his hands, for four or five nights running, I look upon as acts of insanity.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAKER. I apprehended the prisoner under an attachment of the Lords of Appeal, and handed him over to the last witness. I saw him several times whilst in custody; his conduct always appeared strange, from my first having him in custody. When I first had him in custody, I had him in a private lodging. From the observations I made of his conduct, I should really think he was not in his proper state of mind.</p>

            . I lived servant with the prisoner in Judd-street, Somer's-town, in November 1812; he had his wife and family living with him: I continued to live with him eighteen or nineteen months. During the time I lived with him, from his conduct I think him perfectly deranged; I have seen him lie almost naked for hours together, in the room on the floor before the fire, and I have heard him say that he wished he had been a pig in the West Indies. He swore at the cat, and swore he would throw her on the fire. He used constantly to walk about in his shirt, and he would eat beef almost raw. I left him about June, 1814. After that I went to live at Hockton, a good way off.</p>

            . In the course of the last year I lived servant with the prisoner Mr. M'Kinrott. I went into his service on the 11th of September last, at 37, Gower-street, Bedford-square; I was living with him when he was apprehended on this charge. The first week I went there I was going to give notice to quit, on account of his strange behaviour, - by storming and raving, in a manner that I never saw any one do before. I was cooking for the family, and at times when I took any thing up to table, he would rave and storm, and one day he put his hand and his mouth to my ear, and holloa'd in such a way as almost to stun me; he did that more than once, and would likewise take a chair and beat the ground-dash it on the ground. He would go about the house with nothing on but his shirt and morning gown. He would come down in that state into the kitchen very often: sometimes for his tobacco. He had his regular supper at ten o'clock, and about one or two he would come down and eat rump steak almost raw; put it upon a bit of bread, and then go up stairs again. In my opinion, I don't think he was a man of sound mind at all.</p>

            , called and examined by Mr. Reynolds. I was formerly a West India planter at Tortola; I was acquainted with the prisoner there; I knew him in 1803, when he was clerk to Mr. Dougan. He was always a steady, active, stirring man. I came from the West Indies in 1807. I used frequently to meet him on my return loitering about Doctors' Commons. At these different times he used always to address me. His manner of addressing me always betrayed a great degree of incoherency, with a great appearance of wildness in his looks. He always appeared to have a despondency on his mind. I used to meet him after I returned to this country several years afterwards. I have always observed on these occasions, when he has stopped me, some inconsistency in his conduct. From that time I used frequently to meet him on Ludgate Hill, with books under his arm, apparently in the same mood, and I used then to avoid him. From these different opportunities I have had of observing his conduct, I am perfectly convinced of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100028"/>his derangement. I returned again from the West Indies about fifteen or sixteen months ago. I saw him two or three weeks previous to his apprehension. I had previously heard of his having obtained a subpoena for Buonaparte. Upon hearing so, I observed this poor man is in the same situation still. Seeing him on Ludgate Hill two or three weeks before his apprehension, I spoke to him from motives of curiosity. I discovered that his mind was in the same state that I had formerly believed it to be in.</p>

            , re-examined by Mr. Gurney. I have before given an account of the interviews I had with the prisoner; to me he appeared to have the perfect possession of his understanding. Respecting these bills, he always appeared in his right mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. The only part I thought rather strange in Mr. M'Kinrott's conduct, was his conversation about serving a subpoena on Buonaparte. From having belonged to the Northumberland myself, I knew that Buonaparte's evidence would be of no use to him. I know of his actually going to Plymouth for the purpose. I sent him down 50l. whilst he was there, the first time, and 200l. the next.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Gurney. I do not know whether his serving a subpoena on Buonaparte was a mere pretext to get him on shore.</p>
               <p>Mr. HUISH, recalled by Mr. Richardson. I had only one accidental interview with the prisoner after the bills were dishonoured. I heard a conversation between Clarance and the prisoner, which might last for a quarter of an hour; in that conversation I did not perceive any derangement about the prisoner whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRIGGS, recalled by Mr. Minchin. I had about six interviews with the prisoner. He did not appear at all deranged to me. I have a letter (producing it) which he sent me, about his being arrested.</p>

               <p>Mr. SIRR, recalled by Mr. Richardson. The prisoner came to me to give his signature; I did not discover any derangement in his conduct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. He produced his money, and signed his name like any other man.</p>
               <p>THE COURT now summed up the whole of the evidence to the Jury, telling them that the first question would be whether the bill in question was a forgery, and whether the prisoner forged it, and uttered it knowing it to be so forged, and if they were satisfied that he did, then they would consider the defence that had been set up, and whether the prisoner, at the time of his forging and uttering the bill, was in such a state of mind as to be answerable for his conduct.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of December last, I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's-le-Grand, at about three o'clock in the afternoon; he had a basket, which he was carrying in his right hand. In consequence of information which I had received, I followed the prisoner, and caught hold of him. I took hold of the basket, and asked him where he had got that? he told me, it was given me by a woman. I asked him, who that woman was? and he said, she was a shipmate's wife. I asked him, where she was? he said, he could not tell. I took him to a public-house, and searched him; I found nothing about him but two farthings.

             was with me; he and I searched the basket, and we found it to contain thirty-three bad sixpences, five shillings and nine pence three farthings in copper money, consisting of halfpence and farthings, three shillings and five pence in penny pieces, one red herring, one slice of cheese, two biscuits, a yard of ribbon, two papers of tobacco, each containing about half an ounce, and one ball of cotton. I then took him to the Compter. I asked him where he lived; he told me, at No. 3, Kent-street, on the left hand side of the Borough. I asked him, in what part of the house he lived? and he said, in the front part.</p>

On the 1st of January, the prisoner came to my master's house, between nine and ten at night; he asked for a glass of gin; I served him; he tendered me a three-shilling token in payment; it was not a good one. I suspected him, and detained him, and sent for an officer, Mr. M'Combie; who came, and took him into custody. He said that he could not have the gin, for he had no money. I saw Mr. M'Combie search him, and he had three eighteen-penny pieces, which were good, on him, three good shillings, and tenpence in halfpence. The glass of gin was to have come to two-pence.</p>

About six o'clock in the evening of the 12th of December, I was in the shop when the prisoner at the bar came in, and asked for a pair of second hand shoes, that would come to about three or four shillings. I gave him one of a pair at four shillings, which he tried on, and said it fitted him exceeding well. He asked to look at the other one, and pretended he could not get it on. I told him they were fellows. I saw some more men waiting at the window for him. I turned round to call my husband down; immediately the prisoner ran across the shop to the door, to get out; but I caught him by the coat, pulled him back, and locked the door. He left his own shoes, which were very tidy ones, under the chair.</p>

The prisoner was in my service; having several times missed money, I was induced to mark what I left in the till on the night of the 21st of December. At about twenty minutes after eight the next morning, I told one of my daughters to bring me up the till, and then I missed the money in question; at about eleven o'clock in the morning, I went to Bow-street, and got an officer, and stated to him the circumstances. He came down to my house, and ordered her into the dining-room. He told her to produce her money, which she did, to the amount of thirteen or fourteen shillings, and among it was the identical money I had missed from the till. She said, that a gentleman had given it to her in Figtree-court, in the Temple. The officer took her to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD RUTHWIN. I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. The account the last witness has given is true. The prisoner told me that an old man who used the house, had told her to do it, and to give him part, for that the servant who had the place before her had done it, and she could not be found out. She had given the old man sixpence that morning, and sixpence the morning before.</p>

I left my house at about seven o'clock in the evening of the 9th of December, perfectly secure in all respects; the window shutters were fastened on the inside. I returned at about a quarter or twenty minutes before eight; when I unlocked the door, the windows were strongly thrown open, and a man jumped out. I found the window<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100030"/>open. He ran the extent of about fifty yards; I was never three yards from him; I cried stop thief, and a young man named Hunt caught him in his arms. Hunt and myself brought him back to my house, and sent for a police officer. We searched him; but found nothing on him, nor did I miss any thing out of the house. There was some dirt on the chair, under the window. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I am positive I put my shutters to, and fastened them; I can't say what makes me recollect that I did that night; but I am certain I did. The officer and I have had no conversation about what the reward is upon the conviction for burglary; I have heard that there is a reward. The prisoner jumped out of the window with his face towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no place in any part of your room where the prisoner might have been concealed before you went out, without your knowledge - A. There might be, as under the bed, or such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a person had been in your house, he might then have bolted out of the window in the manner you have stated - A. He might so, certainly.</p>

I put my breeches under my pillow when I went to bed; I am sure the money was safe. When I awoke, at about seven o'clock in the morning, I found my breeches nearly on the outside of the bed; I searched for my property, but when I took up my breeches, I missed the silver directly, by the weight. I felt after the bank notes when I missed the silver, and missed them also. When I missed my property, I went and called the girl, and awakened the landlord, and alarmed the house. The landlord went and fetched the officers.</p>
               <p>JAMES JOHN SMITH. I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for to the Northumberland Arms, on the 5th of this month. A brother officer named Ruthwin, went with me. I went up into the prosecutor's room first; I did not disturb any of the lodgers until I had searched his room; I found nothing in it, and then searched the room of the prisoner, which was immediately opposite; I knocked two or three times. The prisoner opened it, but had nothing on, but his shirt; he was very agreeable to my searching his room, saying he had been robbed himself. The first thing I saw on the table was a yellow canvass bag, and a shilling, and a sixpence by it. I asked him was it his; he said, yes, and that he received that one shilling and sixpence from the landlord in change the night before. I found a shilling and two sixpences in his waistcoat pocket; I then looked over his bed and about the room. The prisoner then said, as he had been robbed, he hoped the thief might be found out, and he followed me into the different rooms, and seemed desirious to find the thief. We went down stairs,and searched another room; he was not quite dressed, and I told him I did not want him to follow me about. I went up stairs again, and not being satisfied with the search I had made in his room; when I entered the room he was dressed; I missed the bag that had been laying on the table. I asked him where it was, and he denied all knowledge of it, and denied its having been there. I looked round the room, and then took off the bed clothes one by one. On the bed being pulled down from the mattrass, in the middle of the mattrass I saw four eighteen-penny pieces, a shilling, and a sixpence. I then told Ruthwin to go into the different rooms into which the prisoner had followed us, in hopes that he might find the bag, suspecting that the prisoner might have thrown it away, and I saw Ruthwin go over to the fire place in which the prosecutor slept, and pick it up from the fire place, saying, here it lies. I then ordered the prisoner to strip; he stripped to his shirt; I found nothing in his clothes. He sat down on the chair, and I unbuttoned his shirt collar; under his shirt collar there was another collar; I was about to unbutton that, when he was very busy with his hands behind this collar; I then bid him stand up, and underneath him, at his heels, where he sat, I picked up five one-pound notes. I then took him to the watch-house. I have kept one note, to which the prosecutor swears.</p>

There was one and sixpence and a gold brooch, lying by the side of it. I took up the bag, and said to Smith, here is a bag; he said, pooh, that is nothing. We then proceeded to search the other rooms; the prosecutor was not with us at first. The prisoner followed us down stairs: going down stairs, I was not satisfied about the bag, and asked the prosecutor, and he said his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100031"/>purse was a yellow canvass bag. Smith told the prisoner to return to his room as he did not want him; and he returned to his room for five or six minutes before we went back. Then we went back to the prisoners room again, and on going into the room, both Smith and I asked him what had become of the bag which had been on the table? he denied seeing, or knowing anything of the kind. We then told him we were certain it had been there, and we proceeded to pull the bed clothes off the bed; the landlord's brother laid hold of the bed, and hoisted it off the mattrass, and then we saw some silver lying in the middle. The prisoner denied knowing anything of the money that was under the bed. He did not object to our searching him. Smith said to me, we must have the bag, and I opened the window of the room, to see if it had been thrown out. Smith told me to look in the prosecutor's room, and I looked towards the fire place, and saw it rolled up. I saw Smith pick up the notes from the prisoner's heels. There were no notes on the floor before, for I looked and saw the notes quivering, but whether that was from the wind, or from their having fallen just before, I can't take upon myself to say; I am certain it was impossible for any other person than the prisoner to have put the notes in the place where I saw them. Bruton was up the second time, but not the first. Upon this we took the prisoner to the watchhouse. Bruton told us that the notes he had lost smelled very strongly of musk. These notes did so, enough to knock a person down. I knew the purse to be the same, on account of the shortness of the strings. We examined the prosecutor's room at first, and I am sure it was not there then.</p>

            . I was so frightened that I did not go up the first time. This bag is very like mine but as for swearing downright to it, I can't, This note I can swear to, it is one of the five I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was fast asleep when he knocked at the door. I jumped out of the bed and opened it. He said he wished to search the room. and I told him he was welcome. On the table there was nothing but a pair of gloves, and one shilling and sixpence. I went down stairs with them; Mr. Smith said he did not want me, and I went up stairs again and dressed myself; then they came up again, and Mr. Smith made me strip myself. I was untying my neck cloth behind, and Mr. Smith picked these notes from right under me. There were other people in the room, and I knew nothing at all of the notes. There were nothing else found. There were four pounds six shillings in silver, and it is not very likely I should throw that out of the window, He said nobody else could put the notes under the chair. and the room is only five feet long.</p>

The boy let me in, and on my coming in, I shut the door to, and double locked it. I had then some conversation with the boy, and then went to bed. I was awakened between four and five o'clock in the morning, by the patrole and my apprentice who came into my room. The patrole told me he had found the door open, and he believed the house had been robbed. I got up and came down stairs, and in the front room I found the drawers had been opened, and the things had been taken out; I can't say how they had been opened, but the front of the secretary had been wrenched open. In different parts of the room, bundles of linen, books and things, had been moved out of the place where they had been left. I missed some halfpence, and in consequence of something that I heard from my apprentice I suspected the female prisoner; I desired the boy to stay in the house with his mistress, and I told the patrole to go to the end of the court where the prisoners lived, and to stop any suspicious characters that might pass by, I went to Lambeth-street office, and asked where I could find the nearest officer,and I was refered to

            . I called him, and he answered me, and I told him to come immediately for that my house had been broken open. He came with me to my house, and saw the state of place in the same manner I have described. Thence we went to the house where the prisoner lodged; I did not miss anything but halfpence at first. In the hurry we could not tell what we had missed. We knocked at the door, and we were near twenty minutes or half an hour before we could obtain admittance up stairs in the room where the prisoners lodged. The female prisoner was up and dressed; the prisoners were only lodgers. The patrole hallooed out from below, that a bundle had been thrown out at the window. The prisoner occupied a front and a back room. They are father and daughter. The patrole brought the bundle up, and two miniature pictures. I identified them immediately, they were the miniatures for myself and my wife. In the bundle there was one scarf which I could swear to. We took the two prisoners and the bundle up to Lambeth-street, and on searching them, we found nothing on them, but took the two keys of the rooms, and went back to the house. In the window of the front room, I found a viel, a lace cap, and two pairs of silk stockings, one pair white, and the other pair black; they were my property. Outside the window of the back room, we found the halfpence tied up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100032"/>a shawl, and a piece of silk was under the halfpence; the halfpence had been in a tray outside the door in my house. The old man was undressed and in bed. We produced a chissel to him, and he said he said he believed it to be his; I have dogs, but they did not bark that night. All my family were gone to bed when I came home, except the boy, who let me in. I left the key on the inside of the lock, when I double locked it.</p>

            . I remember the night of the 12th or the morning of the 13th. In the discharge of my duty I tried every door as I passed along. At about a quarter before two, the Tower clock had just gone the three quarters of an hour. I shoved my elbow against Mr. Baxter's door, and almost fell in. I knocked twice at the door with the handle of my cutlass, and said, house a boy; and a female voice answered, thank you sir; and somebody shut the door. I went past the door three times, and tried it and found it fast until about twenty minutes before five, when I found it open again. I knocked at the door, and a young man came out in his shirt, and said thank you patrole; I believe he is the apprentice. He asked me to get a light, and he said all was not right. I went to the watchman's box, and got a light, and took it to the house. As soon as he had shut the street door, he said, the back door is open, all is not right; the back door was about half open. We proceeded up stairs, and called his master; at that time we passed through the dining room, and saw the things all in confusion. Mr. Baxter got up, and he told me to go to the court where the prisoner lived, and not to suffer any body to pass either in or out, and I went and watched. He afterwards went away. I waited until Mr. Dalton, and he came back. We all went to the house together, we were some time before we could gain admitance. A bundle come out of the front window, I immediately took possession of it, and carried it up stairs, and gave it to Mr. Dalton.</p>

With that he went up stairs, and I went to bed again, and fell asleep.

            . I remember the night of the 12th of December, or rather the morning of the 13th, I went up stairs, and found the things all in confusion, and the things tied up ready to be carried away. I saw a chissel there; I have it in my possession; it exactly corresponds with the marks on the drawers. After this, I went with Mr. Baxter to the prisoner's house; after knocking at the door twenty minutes or half an hour, we got admittance; in going up stairs, we heard the casement open; I desired the patrole to go outside the door in case any thing should be thrown out of the window. I went into the room. and found the window open, as I expected; this was the second floor front room. I had not beed in the room more than half a minute before the female prisoner came in nearly dressed; the man was in bed. I searched the room, and then the patrole brought the bundle of clothes up to me, and afterwards the pictures. I searched the window, but was not very particular, because I supposed the bundle contained the whole of the stolen property. I took the prisoners to Lambeth-street office, and locked them up. We then came back again; I unlocked the front room, and there I found two pairs of silk stockings, a lace veil, and a cap. I then went into the back room, and out of the back window, into the gutter; I found one pound sixteen shillings in halfpence, and a piece sarsenet; they were tied up in a shawl. I locked the room up, and took the rest of the property to the office. I shewed the chissel to the man prisoner, I asked him if he had lost any tools, and he said, not that he knew of. I pulled the chissel out of my pocket, and said, is not this yours; he said, he had one like it. There was a lanthorn on the table, which I took in my hand; I opened it, and found in it a match; I felt to the candle, and it did not appear to have been long put out.</p>

            's Defence. In the unfortunate situation in which am I placed, it is difficult for me to convince a jury of my innocence. On the night in question, at a little before ten, I retired to rest, fatigued with a hard day's labour, leaving my daughter sitting up at work. Having lived a sober life, ever marked by honesty and integrity, let my horror be imagined, when I was awakened from my sleep, charged with being an accessory with my own daughter in a burglary. Painful as the task is to me, it is my duty, when I am put upon my trial, for an offence of which I am totally innocent, though unfortunately labour under strong circumstances of suspicion, to declare my innocence, and plead my bitherto unblemished character. The articles must have been brought into my premises between the time of my going to bed, and my being awakened. I refer to the prosecutor for a character. I am at a loss to describe my feelings; yet I know my innocence. I have been ten years a house-keeper in the neighbourhood in which I lately resided. I throw my unfortunate case on the Court and Jury, and shall rest satisfied with their decision.</p>

            . I am an officer of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100034"/>City of London. I know Mr. Hart's house. On the evening of Wednesday, the 13th of December, about eight o'clock, I received information of a cart going up Bishopagate-street. I took Gildersleave and Bengough with me. When I came, the cart was coming out of Sweet Apple-court, which is about ten minutes walk from the prosecutor's house; I searched the cart, but found nothing in it. I then left Gildersleave and Bengough in the court with the cart; I then went into Pollock's room; I knew his person; he lived in that neighbourhood; I found Pollock in a room in that neighbourhood; when I opened the door, Pollock was behind the door; Neale was in the same room, standing up opposite to the door, and Harris was sitting by the fire place, and there was no fire in the grate. I then called to Gildersleave to assist me in taking them; as soon as he came in, Bengough came in, and told me that the man in the cart had made his escape. This room is in a house nearly opposite to where the cart stood. I then asked Pollock if the things on the ground were his things; (those were the things which are the subject of the present indictment;) I asked him was that his room, and he said it was, and he gave me the key of it, and he said that the man who had made his escape, had brought the goods there. I then asked Neal how he came there, and whether he knew any thing of the goods, and he said he knew nothing about them, he came to see Pollock. I asked Harris, and he told me the same. I secured them, and searched them; but found nothing at all upon them. On searching the room, I found all the things named in the indictment. I then secured the prisoners, and we took them to the watchhouse, and returned back to Pollock's room. In the room Gildersleave found four pick-lock keys, in my presence, in the dresser, and a bunch of keys besides, which were not picklock keys; keys of different sizes; but no one of them would open Hart's house. In the chimney I found an iron crow; it was not visible until I got up the chimney; there was a cupboard by the side of the chimney, and the crow was shoved through; I found part in the cupboard and part in the chimney; it could not be visible in the cupboard; I found nothing else at all. I went to Mr. Hart's house on the Friday following; there is a mark of something on the door; I found an impression on the door, which appeared to me to be matched by the end of the crow; Mr. Hart was present at the time. I tried some of the pick-lock keys. I am not able to tell you how the persons obtained entrance.</p>

I went up Sweet Apple-court and saw the cart standing empty facing of Pollock's house. I looked about it, and could perceive no number on it. I immediately went to Mr. Sapwell, and informed him, and then he came along, and brought me and Bengough. Then the cart was coming out of the court, upon which Mr. Sapwell stopped it; and searched it, but found nothing in it. I staid below to mind it, with Bengough, and soon after Sapwell called out for me to come and assist him to secure the prisoners. I know nothing more than what Sapwell has related.</p>

               <p>Harris's Defence. I left my work at four o'clock, and had got some eggs to take to a gentleman. I went down to his house, but he was not there. I heard of a Free and Easy; I was in company with this young man Neale, and asked him to come and spend the evening with me at the Free and Easy; he said he had got no money, but however, he went along with me, and going through Sweet Applecourt, and seeing a light in Pollock's room, I said we will go and see the wooden legged man, as he is at home, and have a bit of fun with him. We went in, and had not been in five minutes, when Sapwell came in. That is all I wish to say.</p>

             LUBBOCK, Esq. now called again, and cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. I have no other partner than my father, Sir John Lubbock, in our mercantile concern.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that this contract comprehends a much larger quantity of hides than the commerce. It is 773. The price of the first parcel of hides was a little more than 2200l. - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Taylor paid you that 2200l. for them - A. They were paid for at the time they came due. Mr. Taylor had been long employed by our house as broker.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you, if you had great confidence in his integrity - A. He did all the business in our line.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at the very time of this transaction, he had many thousand pounds worth of your goods in his possession - A. He made a sale of goods to the amount of 9000l. and they were in his warehouse. The other goods of the Commerce were delivered in October. They were kept back for the small sum of duty; but the same delivery which was had upon the order in question in February, might have been obtained six months sooner, upon payment of the duty.</p>
               <p>Q. If these had been delivered in the month of October, have you the least doubt that they would have been paid for also - A. I think that there is every reason to suppose that they would.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I would ask you from all this, do you think he intended to commit any fraud - A. I do not think that at the time he gave me the contract, he ever intended to defraud me of the amount, but to fulfil it by paying the amount.</p>
               <p>Q. And but for his subsequent failure, do you mean to say he would not have done it - A. I attributed it to his failure, and I founded that opinion from the hides being in his warehouse at the time of the failure.</p>
               <p>Q. And before the failure, he sent word to you that he wished the contract to be cancelled, and that you might have the hides again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100039"/>Q. And the hides were still in his warehouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he had any intention to defraud - A. It is impossible to say that. I do not think he got them under any premeditated scheme to get the money for them; but if it had not been for his bankruptcy, I believe he would have paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. We know a broker can't buy in his own name. If he had said that these hides were for himself, you would have objected to it - A. Unquestionably.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Pooley. It is not usual for a broker to use the name of a fictitious person.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. My Lord, that is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>

            , on being called upon for his defence, read it to the Court as he had committed it to paper. He lamented the degrading situation in which he was placed. He commented with warmth upon the various circumstances which appeared in evidence to prove that he might, by paying the trifting sum of 30l. duty, have obtained the hides in question, long before the time that he got them into his warehouses. He declared that his intention was to pay for these as he had paid for the former; and he hoped that unless the transaction appeared to be meditated, and carried into execution for the purpose of fraud, a Jury of his countrymen would not find him guilty. He hoped that the door of mercy would not be shut against him, and that his intention would be seen throughout the whole transaction. He declared that if any criminality could be attached to the transaction, his brother was most ignorant of it; and he concluded by throwing himself on the humane consideration of the Jury, and by hoping deliverance at their hands.</p>
               <p>THE COURT did not think it necessary to call on

               <p>The next question would be, did both or either of them dispose, fit, and put it away, upon the other Counts of the Indictment, with a similar intent.

I asked him if he had any thing to say to me about any body else? He said, no; before he would say any thing about any body else he would be hanged. We took him to the watchhouse, and we then proceeded to Phillips's. It was near twelve before we could get in. The daughter was within, as I supposed. We were some time trying to break open the door. I told her I would break it in, and gave her my name. Some person came and opened it; and when we got into the passage, we saw the key on the inside in the door of the room which was locked, and we concluded somebody must be inside. We forced the door, and found the servant sitting by the fire. We found in that room two bags of wearing apparel, and a looking-glass, which I have here. I desired one of my fellow officers to go and bring the other prisoner. He brought him in about a minute. I said how is this, Mr. Nathan? and he said he knew nothing about it. We took him into custody, and locked the property up, and it was sworn to the next day by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. We first saw Phillips a few minutes after we got in at nearly 12 o'clock. Cohen was found at the Prince of Wales in Wentworth-street.</p>
               <p>Examined by THE COURT. Somebody shewed me the room in which Cohen was lying on the bed. When I first went to Phillips's house, I found that there was somebody inside, from the circumstance of the key being inside and the door being locked. When Phillips came in, he said he had just come from the Royalty theatre. The robbery was in Whitechapel. Phillips's house is about 150 yards from Harris's, the prosecutor.</p>

            . I went with Griffiths to search. I began at between ten and eleven o'clock. We first went to Cohen's room, in the Princess of Wales public-house. I went up to the room and we found Cohen asleep on the bed, with his clothes on. We found the things which are before me. I went to look for

             I found him about sixty yards from his own house, walking towards home in Wentworth-street. I told him he was the man I was looking for; and he said, "What is the matter?" and I told him. We also told him we had a deal of trouble in getting into the house; and he said, that he had desired the people not to open the door at all. The Royalty Theatre is not more than a quarter of a mile from his house. Cohen's room door was unlocked, and he was lying on the bed.</p>

               <p>Phillips's Defence. I had an order, and went to the Royalty Theatre, at about ten minutes after six; I went into the boxes, and never came out until after the first act, when I came out to make water. I met Mr. Freeman, the officer, and I believe we had a glass of liquor together, and then I went in again, and never stirred until almost twelve o'clock. When I wet Mr. Dalton, I told him I knew nothing about this business. When they took me into custody, they would not let me speak to my servant.

A man brought the things which were found in my master's room, at about a quarter before nine; I opened the door to him, because I thought it was one of the lodgers knocking to get in; he forced himself in, and put the things into my master's room; it was before the lodgers came in that this man came with the bundle. It was about half past ten o'clock that I heard a knocking at the door; I found it was Mr. Griffiths, who stands by me. I did not open the door; but sat in the room. They forced my master's door open. I did not tell Mr. Griffiths how the bundles came there. My master came home at about twelve o'clock; he told me he was going to the Royalty Theatre; it was a little before six o'clock that he went; he was having his tea at five o'clock; that took up some time; he dressed himself before tea; he was at home at five o'clock, his usual tea time.

He looked round for his partner; but the other man was gone.

I then put my hand inside his breeches,and between his thighs in the fore part of his shirt,I found a paper; I took it out, and laid it on the table, and opened it; there were six counterfeit three-shilling pieces, with pieces of paper between them.

            . I am an assistant elder in the East India Company's warehouses. The prisoner was a labourer there. On the 9th of this month; it is the course for all the persons employed to go to breakfast at a certain hour; my attention that morning was called to something which occured in the place where the prisoner was employed; I went to examine some Cassia, upon the second floor, and while I was doing that, I heard something fall like pease. After I heard this, I proceeded up stairs towards the place where I heard the noise, in the third floor, which contains only coffee; I did not discover any thing upon entering the room; but on going to the farther end, where the bags were piled so as to form alleys, I found the prisoner at the farther end of the alley; suspecting he was after no good, I had him searched, and found on him about eighteen ounces of Bourbon coffee in his pocket; there was a quantity of that sort of coffee in the warehouse: I have examined some of the bags, and I found they were cut, one bag in particular; I examined the bags that were cut to find what deficiency; I had them weighed, and this bag was nine pounds deficient; I found some coffee on the floor, near a handful, against the place where the bag was; I have had this coffee, which I found on the prisoner, ever since; it is the same description of coffee with that which was in the plundered bag. I sent for Rice, the constable, to take the prisoner into custody. I said nothing to the prisoner at the time about the coffee. He said he was very sorry for it, and hoped I would over-look it, that it was the first he had ever taken, and he would never be guilty of the like again; but I said, I could not tell at that time what I would do.</p>

I was attending on that day at the India House; I went with the last witness to search the prisoner; he had about half a handful of coffee in his breeches pocket; it was taken out before I got up to him, and when I got up there was about half a handful more not taken out. I examined a bag which had been cut, and it contained coffee of the same description as that found at his lodgings; he acknowledged his guilt, and hoped we would have mercy on him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to the warehouse to take the prisoner up; he said he lived at No.53, Lambeth-street. I asked him first if he had any coffee at home? he said, no. I found on enquiry, there was no No. 53, in that house; but I found he lived at 71, and I found there a quantity of mixed coffee in a bag, weighing twenty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, in which he said the coffee found at his lodgings he had bought from a sailor, and it was his own real property.</p>

            . I am a patrole. I was present in St. John-street, when this occured, and saw Mr. Small there. I saw the prisoner in company with another or two that evening, lurking about St. John-street; he was dressed in a jacket, white corderoy breeches, and topped boots. I saw Small leave his cart once or twice; I watched him up to the Leaping Bar. The prisoner was following the cart, with his companions. Small stopped at the Leaping Bar, and went in, and I saw almost immediately the prisoner lay hold of the cask, an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100043"/>shoved it off the side where it stood; the other two were near the cart; they were dressed in long coats, and the prisoner had a long coat over his jacket. I saw him jump on the shafts of the cart;he had got a parcel; but I could not see what it was. He jumped off the shafts of the cart, and smashed the bottle with the gin in a thousand pieces. I laid hold of him, and picked up half a pound of tea from the middle of the road. The other two came up at first; but found I was too strong for them, and I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

I came to market on Tuesday, the 9th of January, with my master's cart, and went into Paddington-street, and I went down a mews to seek after some dung; I left my coat on the shaft of the cart, when I went down the mews, and I was not gone a minute when I was told some body had stolen my coat. I saw the person running, and I ran after him; I lost sight of him; I saw him drop the coat while I was in sight; I did not see his face until he was stopped; but I knew he was the same man that was running, by his dress.</p>

I saw him take the coat from the shafts of the cart, and run away; I pursued him into East-street, and saw him with the coat under his arm; I cried stop thief, and so did he; he ran out of Dorset-street into Blanchard mews, back into Earl-street; I still pursued him; it was about two o'clock in the day; one man attempted to stop him, but the prisoner struck at him with his fist; the man then turned round, and followed him, and he was stopped; and as we were taking him down to Marlborough-street; he told me he would mark me.</p>

               <p>Sampson Spurett. There was a number of neighbours who saw this transaction. The prisoner never denied his guilt; as soon as he was stopped, he felt down on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

            . Fitzmaurice called on me about eleven o'clock that morning; I am a green grocer and dealer in fowls; much of my business is among shipping. He followed me from my house to the Docks, and asked me if I would buy some fowls and ducks; I said you don't deal in them, you are a tradesman; no said he, but a countryman at my house brought them from the country, and has them to dispose of. I said if they were good and fresh, I would give him two shillings a piece for them all round. Fitzmaurice I have known some years as a painter and glazier; he keeps a house. He went home to find the fowls, and in the afternoon he called two or three times for the money I had agreed to give for them; I paid him all the money I agreed for, except one shilling; the countryman was standing by at the same time, and said nothing; it was eleven shillings out of twelve. I did not see Fitzmaurice give the countryman any money. I went with them to a public house, and had a pot of beer; I never saw Finlay before. I bought the fowls on Thursday, Next morning when they were to be fed, I put them in a basket at my door to be sold, and this gentleman's friend coming by saw them there.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. On the 6th of January, the prosecutor came to the police office for a search warrant. The magistrate told him it was not necessary, as the things were exposed to sale. I went down with him, and saw the fowls in King's shop, and he said he bought them of a man named Fitzmaurice, and I desired King to bring him to me, to East Smithfield; he did, and took him to the office. Fitzmaurice said he bought them of this man, who said he bought them of a waggoner.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I am clerk to Mr. Hatchett, at the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly. On Tuesday,the 9th of January, the prisoner came in the passenger's room, at about half past one, and walked up to one of the tables, where the silver spoon lay. He walked away again, came back; looked at the spoon and turned it over; went away again; returned the fourth time, and was walking away with it, concealed in his hand when I stopped him with it, and took it from him. I did not know him before, but he was perfectly well known at Marlborough-street.</p>

            , 33, Gerrard-street, Soho. On Tuesday, the 9th of this month, on my return home, I missed my umbrella. I know nothing further of this transaction than that the umbrella to be produced here, is mine.</p>
               <p>ANDREW ROBINSON. On Tuesday, the 9th of this month, this paper was sent up to me by my servant, from a person at the hall door, to solicit charity. I said, I knew nothing about the person. I did not see the person. The servant brought up this paper three times, and said the woman would not go away. I went down stairs to turn her out,and it appeared she was a person who had come frequently to the house before to ask for charity, and I had given her a shilling; she became importunate and clamorous, and would not go away, and I sent for a constable to take her to the watchhouse, and he found on her this umbrella.</p>

               <p>-.I am beadle of St. Ann's Soho. Mr. Roinson sent for me to take this woman, who he said, would not go away. I took her to the watchhouse, and from there to Marlborough-street,and on bringing her back to the watchhouse, I found this umbrella between her legs, under her clothes.</p>

I lost my breeches on the 5th of December; they were in the bed room; the prisoner slept in another bed, and I afterwards took the prisoner on Limehouse-bridge with the breeches on him; this was near a fortnight after I lost them. When I took him he said he did not know any such place as mine. I turned his coat on one side, and said to him, why, you have my breeches on. I am quite certain he was the man who lodged in the house.</p>

The prisoner called on me to collect this sum, and said he came from Mr. Hopcroft for three pounds, due on a regester stove.

I paid him three one-pound bank notes, and he gave me the halfpence for the stamp.</p>

               <p>COURT. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is necessary the first marriage must be proved; if it be by licence, and the parties be under age when they marry, it must be by the leave and consent of the parents, or guardians. Why then, before we can try this man for marrying a second wife, we must prove that the first marriage was legally solemnized. But this does not appear. For what the witness, Waymouth, says of what the alledged first wife said to her is not evidence.</p>

I took the keys of the stable to feed the horse; I was looking in the loft for a truss of hay, and I found the meat tied up in a cloth in the loft. We had reason to suspect the prisoner, having no other servant in the house: there was no other person trusted with the key of the stable but the prisoner; he had been in our house three or four months; he was a general servant, and was occasionally sent to take out a joint of meat, or mind the door. I saw the hay taken in, and placed in the loft. Nobody could get into the stables but me or the prisoner. My father saw the beef there.</p>

               <p>THOMAS NEWSHAM. I am a carpenter. On the 19th of December, while I was at work on the scaffold, I saw the prisoner go to the farther bench, and take the saw from it. I called out, and asked him what he wanted there; and he dropped the saw. I collared him, and he asked me would I lend him a saw; I said no, we have lost saws enough last night. He endeavoured to get away; I had a wrestling with him, and got him down; and he was secured.</p>

             was on the foot-path; I had just been through the gate, and paid the toll; the cart had gone before me some distance; I ran to overtake it; I saw Roache before me, passing off the foot-path; he came up, and gave me a violent blow on my head, and knocked my head against the side of the the cart; before I could recover, he gave me another blow on the other side: as soon as I recovered myself, I struck at him with a whip I had in my hand. My hat and handkerchief he had knocked off my head, and where on the ground at the time. I called to the watchman, and as soon as he came up, Roache ran across the road, and took the hat and handkerchief in his hand, and I never saw it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. I and the prisoner are brothers-in-law; we have been on very bad terms; he has always been insulting me. I indicted him for an assault in this case, and took him up on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100049"/>warrant, upon the 23rd of December; it is about sixteen or seventeen months since I indicted him on a waistcoat before. That night, when he came up to me, he said, you had better go now and get another judge's warrant against me. I went to the magistrate's, and told my story. Upon my oath, I charged him to them with the robbery at the time;but through the neglect of the police clerk, it was omitted in the indictment, and when I was before the magistrate, both he and they told me, although the theft was not in, he was to be prosecuted for the theft, as well as for the assault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the COURT. It was between six and seven in the evening. I did not pick up the hat; a boy came up, and said, he saw him knock me down, and take my hat away. Upon my oath, I told the magistrate of the robbery. I have read in several books there is a reward of forty pounds for convicting a man of a highway robbery; I have heard so; but I don't know it will stand good in this case. The magistrates only held him to bail for the assault.</p>

            , Charlo -street, Rathbone-place. We went there, and met them; John Possey paid the carman ten shillings. Jack Winter, and I, and the others, were to meet again in the afternoon; but I was taken into custody upon this; I was locked up near where Cooper was, and I could hear a few words drop from him to the other three, who were locked up with him. Some of them asked him what he was pulled up for, and he said these goods; and said Jack Possey, and Jack, the Baker, were concerned, and he was taken up on suspicion. Jack Winter brought a newspaper to me, and read a statement that Cooper was apprehended upon this, and he said that Messrs. Winchester had offered a large reward, and he told me to keep my tongue quit, and all would be right.</p>

             BULL. I live in Holles-street, Cavendish Square. I was robbed on Thursday last, between twelve and one at night; it happened <placeName id="t18160110-97-crimeloc541">near Blenheim Steps</placeName>

I had been out to dinner at a party; I was returning from the Free Mason's Tavern; I had been drinking more than usual, but was not intoxicated. There were three of us in company, one of which, my youngest brother, was very much intoxicated. The gentleman who was with me had volunteered his services to assist me in seeing him home. Three persons were coming the coutrary way to ourselves, in a direction towards us, and passed us. We were arm in arm together; I had hold of one of my brother's arms, and Mr. Dupins, had hold of the other. The three persons returned, and said we had run against them. I said I was extremely sorry, but they saw the condition of the young man whom we where conducting. They did not pass on my side. I told them if it were so, I was sorry for it, but they stlil followed and abused us; my friend turned round to speak to them, and I looked towards them and lifted up my hand, to tell my friend he had better let them go on their own way. As I just lifted up my hand, I felt my watch drawn out of my fob; that was not the way I expected any injury to be presented to me. I brought my hand down quick, and caught the watch on the swing; it was entirely out of my pocket. I pulled, and the person who had got hold of it pulled, and the chain broke from the watch. It was a gold chain, cost me five guineas, it was worth two pounds, There was a seal, which was worth one pound, which cost me two guineas and a half. There was a gold mourning ring, which was worth ten shillings. As soon as the chain broke, I pursued the person with whom I tustled. He turned down a dark street, and was about to return down Winslow-street; I still pursued him closely; he was not out of my sight. He went about half way down the street, and was about to return. I seeing his intention, threw myself in his way, and put out my foot; and he came with such force against my leg, that he threw me down; I saw him falling when I was getting up; and a watchman came round the corner, and stopped him. He had not got out of my sight; I am sure the man who was stopped by the watchman, was the man whom I tripped up. My chain and seals were not found. At the time I put out my foot, there was nobody else running in the street, but the person who had struggled with me, and who had then my chain. I had an opportunity of seeing his face. I had not lost sight of him, and the person whom the watchman stopped must have been the man.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES DUPINS. I was in company with this gentleman. I had been to the Freemason's Tavern; I considered that I was not inioxicated. The prosecutor did not appear to be intoxicated. When I was near Blenheim Steps, three men passed us, who returned immediately, and accused us of running against them; Mr. Bull apologised, and I believe I aggravated it; for I said if they did not proceed, I should call the watch. Mr. Bull then tapped me on the shoulder, and advised me to proceed I had hold of his brother, at the time by the arm. Almost at that same moment, I observed Mr. Bull n a scnffie with the man, and then I called out watch. I did not see what they or either of them were doing. My intention was intirely taken up with Mr. Bull's brother, and I did nothing further than calling out watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-lebone parish; my beat is at 29 box, in Wells-street, at the Oxford-street end; I heard a cry of watch, when I was in my box, just after I had finished caling half past twelve. When I heard the watch called, I proceeded towards the cry; the first I saw was the prisoner running without his hat, as hard as he was able; I first caught sight of him within half a dozen yards of Winslow-street, which faces the Pantheon; it is a small street with a brewhouse in it. I did not stop him then; I made a catch at him, but missed my catch; he was then in Oxford-street, close to Winslow-street; Mr. Bull was within two yards of him. I laid hold of him in Winslow-street; Mr. Bull tripped him up first, and as he fell, I caught hold of him by the collar. There was nobody in company with him at the time; and nobody of his party came up. I asked Mr. Bull what was the matter, and he charged him with having robbed him of his watch. The prisoner denied it; the prisoner appeared as if he had been drinking, but he was sensible; he was capable of running, and did run.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, called some witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

He was in my house all night; I caught him in the house between five and six o'clock in the morning. I was the last person up, on the night of the 23rd of December; I had seen the prisoner the night before, before I went to bed. I saw that he was in the house between nine and ten o'clock, because I turned him from the fire. When I fastened up the house, I did not know he was in it. He did not call for anything to drink. When I fastened up the house, I thought he was out of the house. I saw him the next morning when I was awakened by my little daughter, before it was light; it was quite dark. I got up, my daughter was frightened with the noise. I struck a light, and went down stairs; my bar and till were secure, and locked the night before; I had taken the silver up stairs with me. I searched the room in which I lay; nobody was there, and then I went down stairs, and when I went into the tap-room, I found the prisoner behind the door; he had a cag of rum standing behind the back door; I presented a pistol at him, and told him, if he stirred, I would blow his brains out; and he surrendered himself. I had filled my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100052"/>cags in the bar, the night before; the cag he had was not mine; but he had poured the rum into it, in the course of the night. He was searched by Morris, the officer, soon after, and fifteen shillings and tenpence in copper money were found on him, I found the bar was broken into by the shutter being forced up. He said, he pushed the shutter up. I went into the bar; I found a canvass bag of copper on the counter; the bag was not mine. My till was not broken open; it had been unlocked, and was unlocked then; I am certain I had left it locked. At the time I laid hold of this man, the back door was wide open; I had left it locked when I went to bed; it was fastened by two bolts and a bar. Upon examining the back door, there was no appearance of force on the outside. I can say with certainty, that the door was opened by some person withinside the house. There were none of the outside doors open at that time. I had no such cag in the house as I found with the prisoner; the rum to fill this cag was got out of the bar. I examined the rum in the bar, to see if there was any deficiency, and I found there was; that rum in the bar was in casks. When I laid hold of the prisoner, I asked him how often was he in the house. I made no promise to him; I did not threaten him, that I would shoot him if he did not tell me; he said he was three times in the house. I asked him what way he got into the bar, and he told me. he said, he pushed the shutter up. I found the shutter corresponding with the account he gave; it been had pushed up. He acknowledged he was concealed; he said, he concealed himself in the house. I observed that a large quantity of halfpence was gone; but I could not tell the exact amount I sent for a constable; when he came, he overhauled him; we found half a candle on him, and a few matches, also a quantity of tobacco; I missed the tobacco from the bar; it was found upon him lose, as mine was. Among the matches I found on him, none appeared to be burnt; I did not take notice if there was a match about the house that had been lighted. He had no shoes on when I laid hold of him; we asked him where his shoes were; he told Morris that they were under the water but in the yard. Morris went out, and I saw him find them where the prisoner said he had left them.</p>

I found nothing on him until I came to his hat, in which I found some matches, and half a candle, the wick of which was quite warm, for it had been lighted. I came to Mr. M'Cormack's house at about six o'clock; the tallow appeared to have been melted, and the tobacco stuck to it; it was put in the hat with the tobacco loose. I found this tobacco in his hat also. I asked him if a man of the name of George had been with him, and he said that George was to have met him at six o'clock. He did not tell me who the cag belonged to until afterwards, he told me it belonged to a man who was convicted of burglary.</p>

I was in the shop, and a lad with me. The female in company with the prisoner asked for some French cambrick. The prisoner kept her distance. I shewed the woman some cambrick. While she was looking at it, the prisoner stood about two yards off, and did no ask for any thing. The other woman bought half a quarter of a yard of the cambrick, the price of which was one shilling and nine pence. She gave me a three shilling piece, and I gave her the change. They both went out together; I looked over the cambrick, and missed a piece. In consequence of that, I went about seven doors off, and found the prisoner in another linen-draper's shop. I charged her with being concerned in this transaction. She denied it, and an officer was sent for, and she was taken up stairs. I am confident it was the piece which I have missed.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Nettleship's, the publican, on the 2nd of January, between eleven and one in the day; during the time I was there, the prisoner came in, and offered a gold chain and seal for sale; there might be from eight to a dozen persons in the tap-room, and each of them took it into their hands; some of them said they did not think it was gold. He said, he would go with any one to any jeweller's shop to enquire whether it was gold or not. I immediately said, I would go with him myself; I went with him; we went to Mr.Ballautyne's; we asked him was it gold, and he said it was. I went back with the prisoner to the place we came from, and he asked sixteen shillings for them. After speaking a few words, he said he had bought them of a sailor for twelve shillings about five or ten minutes before. He said if I had a mind to buy them, I should have them for thirteen shillings, and a glass of something to drink. I bought them, and in consequence of something I heard, I went to Mr. Vesale on Thursday morning, with them.</p>

I spent the evening at Mrs. Bryan's; I had some supper there between nine and ten o'clock; I sent out Mrs. Bryan with a five-pound note to get half a gallon of beer; she brought in the beer, and four one-pound notes, and the change. When we had drank the beer, I expressed a wish to go home, as it was pretty late. She recommended that her son should see me part of the way home, to which I accepted. I am a stranger to that part of London. We went into the coach stand public-house; I wanted to treat him, and called for a pot of beer; it was at Mr. Christian's, in Ratcliffe Highway. This Bryan handed the pot to the prisoner, and two or three other men that I did not take particular notice of, and the prisoner came up to me, and asked me what ship I belonged to; I told him the St. Domingo, a seventy-four. He said he had a cousin on board that ship, of the name of William Gifton. I told him there was not a man named William; but Jack Gifton. He said, his name was not Jack, and he wished to know what sort of a man he was; I told him, and he made an account to me, that he had not heard from him a long time. I told him he was a mess-mate of mine, and that Jack fell off the yard-arm, and was lost. In consequence of that, the prisoner recommended me to an aunt of his, and said I should be well treated, and he wrote down the direction to enquire for Mrs. Browne, Iron-street, Lambeth; after this, the landlord wished the company to quit the house. Three men came out along with me, and proposed to seeing me home to my lodgings. They brought me down thrown some small courts, and into one called Starch-court, as I hear. They dragged me into the court, and held me by the head and arms, and took my watch, and what money I had. I had the silver in my waistcoat pocket, and the notes in my fob pocket, with the watch; they ran away; they took my watch, my silver, and bank notes; the prisoner, Bryan, and another man held me; but I could not swear to the other man. The officer detected the watch. I am sure ther prisoner was one of them, I was only hearty; I was not drunk, to my recol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100054"/>lection. I went to Mrs. Bryan's in the morning; Bryan was not at home; the mother requested I should stop, and take breakfast, and I stopped with the intent of seeing him. I breakfasted and dined there. I went to my own lodgings when it was dark. In a couple of davs after, I told the publican, Mr. Christian, and asked him if he knew the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I only know Mrs. Bryan; I did not know her son before; the son had been to sea, and he and I had some discourse together, and she recommended that he should see me part of the way home. It was about eleven when I went to this public-house. I did not know where the prisoner lived; but when I went to the landlord, he gave me to understand something, though he could not tell where he lived. In consequence of that, I applied to Mr. Jackson, and told him of my loss. I took pains to discover the prisoner. I gave a description of Bryan. I requested the landlord if ever they should come into the house again, to give charge of them, and I left my address with the landlord; the landlord could not tell me the prisoner's name. Nobody has told me about a reward for convicting a man of a highway robbery; Mr. Jackson, the officer, has not told me there was a reward; I have heard of it; but have not believed it. The prisoner was taken up last Thursday. I was asked if I should know my watch if I saw it. Bryan was in custody since this robbery, he was taken up on the Saturday following; I made a charge against him of this robbery, because I knew him to be one of the men. I was hearty, and had been taking a drop; but I was not intoxicated, to my recollection. I will swear that the prisoner came out with me, and I have always told the same story to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. I gave nothing to this old woman but some beer; I was sober when I left Mrs. Bryan's.</p>

            . I am a police constable of Shadwell. Last Wednesday evening, I, and two other officers, chanced to meet with Craig; knowing he was wanted for a robbery we took him to the office; as we were going up to the office, he asked me whether it was for a robbery that happened since this, and I told him no, it was for one formerly. In consequence of information that I received, I went to Battle, and asked him for the watch which he had purchased of the prisoner; I told him he must give it to me; which he instantly did I have the watch. I then informed Craig, the prisoner, that I had got the watch he sold to Battle he said, if that was what I wanted him for, he could prove he had had that watch twelve months, for that he won it at skittles. I then sent for the prosecutor; he came on Friday; I asked him the maker's name in the watch; I told him the right name. I don't know how Bryan came to be discharged. I think it was not entered into against Bryan; I think there was no deposition taken about Bryan; he is now in custody about another robbery, and we were advised not to bring him here; the other robbery is of a much more serious nature than this. I asked the prisoner how he came by the watch that he had sold to Battle, and he said he bought it of Bryan. I shewed it to no person but Bryan. I knew the prisoner to speak to him; but I did not know where to find him when I wanted him.</p>

Fox said he would send the things home by Pond, which he did, and he said he had some things to shew me, and he took me down into a brick field,and shewed me the cocks; and he went into a good many shops, and could not sell them. I did not see him any more, until after Mr. Haycock took him up. He said he had taken them from next door to the Shepherd, Robinson's Row, Kingsland.</p>

The prisoner at the bar followed me all the way from Whitechapel. He told me he was Mr. Mane's cousin, and said he had thirty five shillings a week for buying hay and straw for Mr. Mane. I missed my coat and whip when I was coming out of the yard; I saw the prisoner going out with them on his arm; I followed him out, but he got away from us. I heard him tell the man in the yard, to hurry me along, saying he was going to a gin shop at the corner of the Curtain Road, but he never stopped.</p>

               <p>PHILIP MAYHEW. On the evening of the 5th of December last, I had two twenty pounds, and five one-pound Bank of England notes; they were paid by the Commissioners at Somerset House; I had these notes some time about me; the two twenties were sowed in between the waistband and the lining of my trowsers. The prisoner spoke to me first; I saw her under the Piazzas, Covent Garden; she took me to a house in <placeName id="t18160110-110-crimeloc605">Hart-street, right opposite to Covent Garden Playhouse</placeName>

She was not in bed more than an hour, when she got up, and said it was too early to go to bed; I could not stop her; I let her go away; I did not at that time suspect any thing. I awoke as soon as it was day light in the morning; I found my trowsers under the window, with the two twenty-pound notes gone; the breeches seemed as if the lining had been bitten. I found my four one-pound notes in my waistcoat pocket; I never saw either of the twenty-pound notes since. I have heard her say that she gave them to an old jewis woman, as she thought they were two one-pound notes.</p>

The prisoner said to me going along, "I am all right, for the child can't swear to me." The girl appeared to be frightened, and I can't suppose she knew who the man was.

            . I sent my lad on the 26th of December, to take one hundred pounds of glue to Holborn-hill.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUGHES. I am in the service of Mr. Roe; I was to go to the Borough to fetch a hundred weight of glue to take to Mr. Powel, oilman, on Holborn-hill. I went into the house of Mr. Lowe, in Bishopsgate-street, in my way from the Borough, I left the truck at the door, and when I came out again, it was gone. I saw the truck about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100057"/>ten o'clock the next morning, it was brought from Petticoat-lane, by a young man, who was Mr. Lowe's porter. I saw the glue and the prisoner in custody at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN COHEN. I live in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner came and knocked at my mother's door, and asked was Lumpy at home; I told him I did not know whom he meant; no such person lodged there. He then asked me would I buy any thing; I told him, no; I did not buy any thing; I did not even ask him what he had to sell; I am sure it was the prisoner; he had another man with him. The prisoner said to the other man let us be off, or we shall be nabbed. When I heard that, I instantly called the patrole, who took the prisoner into custody, with the property.</p>
               <p>TITUS WELLS. I am the patrole who apprehended the prisoner, and the other man; but the other man got away. I took this bag of glue from the prisoner, which he said was bones.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character from some witnesses.</p>
