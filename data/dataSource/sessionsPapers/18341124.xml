On the 30th of Septem<lb/>ber, I went to bed, leaving my cellar safe, at a quarter to eleven o'clock—I am quite certain the listenings were quite safe—I go to my cellar from the dwelling-house—there is a flap outside the house, which is only used to take in liquor—I am master of the house—it is my dwelling-house—I fastened the cellar flap by three bolts—I was alarmed about four o'clock in the morning by the policemen, William Shields and Thomas Bradley Beck—it was not light—I opened the window, got a light, and came down—I opened the door, let the policemen in, and they sent me back wards—I went towards the cellar door, and found that open—I had shut it at night—the back door leading into my yard was open—I had left that shut and fastened—on entering the cellar, I found the cellar flap also broken open—the bolts were bent, and partly off—I found nobody there—I missed a bottle, con<lb/>taining two gallons of brandy, and a stone bottle, containing shrub—I am sure they were in the cellar the night before, at a quarter before eleven o'clock—I had seen the prisoner, John Holgate, the morning before—he helped the brewer's man to put two barrels of ale into my cellar—I never saw him before, to my knowledge—I am sure he is the man—I saw him in custody of the policeman close to my door that very morning when I was alarmed—the hinges of the cellar flap were wrenched out of the wood work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About three o'clock on the morning in question, I went down a passage by the side of the prosecu<lb/>tor's house, which leads to his cellar—when I got down, I saw a man stand<lb/>ing by the side of Thompson's cellar flap—it was the prisoner, James Hol<lb/>gate—I took him into custody, and asked what he was doing there—he said he had been drinking with his brother at Dockhead, and had come down there to ease himself—Dockhead is near Rotherhithe—I told him he must go with me to the station-house—I took him there, and then returned to the passage, and found the prisoner, John Holgate, in the passage—he was five or six yards from where I had found his brother—I asked him where he came from—he said he had been lying down there asleep—I asked him how long he had been lying there—he said it might be an hour, or it might be two or three hours, for what he knew—I took him into custody—I took him nearer to the cellar flap, and knocked my foot against a stone bottle, which I have here—I examined, and found the cellar flap open—I found another stone bottle near the one I first found—one con<lb/>tained brandy and the other shrub—the passage is no thoroughfare—there are some small gardens at the bottom, but it is no thoroughfare—I pro<lb/>duce the bottles.</p>

On Saturday, the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock at night, we heard somebody in the work-shop—a young man was with me who works for me—my family consists of my wife and child, and a servant girl—I had made the house safe my<lb/>self at eleven o'clock—the workshop is situated at the back of the pre<lb/>mises, not on the ground floor, but higher—there are four windows to it, which open—I fastened them about nine o'clock—my young man went into the workshop on hearing the noise—we have a room even with the workshop—I did not go into the workshop—I fastened the window with a large wooden button, which keeps two close—there is a tiling by the win<lb/>dow—a person could get into the window from the tiling—the window goes on hinges—it does not lift up—when I left the workshop at nine o'clock, I left a quantity of unfinished work on my bench—large button-hook han<lb/>dles and ivory—I made my way to the street door—I found it safely locked and bolted—I went into the workshop about an hour after and ob<lb/>served a 9-inch file sticking into a drawer, as if to prize it open—the file had broken in doing it—the file was mine—I had left it on the bench—I walked farther into the shop, and found a square of glass broken in one of the windows, which was open—that was not broken at nine o'clock when I left the workshop—a hand put into that square would turn the button—I then went into the tower shop on the ground floor—they communicate by a step ladder—I found a padlock broken off the cellar door—I keep my ivory in that cellar—the door had been opened, and all the ivory was gone—the box it was kept in was empty—there might be three or four dozen pieces gone—I then made to the street door, and found it fast as before—I called a policeman to have the place searched—the policeman did not come—my young man went into the front parlour—the street door commands a view of the parlour—on his going into the parlour, I hallooed out "Police"—my young man opened a large cupboard door, and I saw the prisoner in the cupboard—he worked for me as journeyman for four or five weeks—I have not a doubt of his being the man—he got out of the cupboard—I said, "You d—d scoundrel, what brings you here at this time on Sunday morning?"—he said, "I came here for my wages"—I said it was a pretty time to come for wages—he came to the street door while I was calling "Policeman," and knocked me down on the pavement—I followed him, but lost sight of him in Monmouth-street—on returning</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of George Dibden Pitt, of Gibraltar-row, West-square. On Friday the 8th of August, I went out to fish—I went to a ditch near the Surrey canal, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a child in the ditch—it was in the water, lying on its side—it had its clothes on—the water did not quite cover it—I did not touch it, but called a man named Carter—I saw nobody but Carter—he was about one hundred yards off, walking along—he came and took the child out of the ditch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener and labourer, and live in Downing-street, Camberwell—on the 8th of August, I was near the Surrey canal—Pitt called to me—I instantly ran to him, as he said there was a child in the water—I saw the child lying in the water, on its left side, in the ditch, which runs parallel with the canal—it is a ditch made to take the waste water—it is of a clayey nature at the bottom—it had been cleaned out a fortnight before, I believe; but there was mud and clay at the bottom—I should think the water was about eight inches deep—I instantly ran to the child—it was lying on its left side, and its hand a little out of the water under its face—I got hold of its left arm with my right hand, and when I pulled it, the shoulder cracked—it is a good bit down from the bank to the water—I should think it is from a foot to fourteen inches—the top of the bank, which is the towing path, is about six feet—I let go of the arm and got down, and took hold of the child under both its armpits—it still seemed to me to stick, as if it was forced in by some means—I had a difficulty in getting it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgement, would the weight of the child by itself have buried it so deep in the mud as it was, if it had fallen from the bank by accident, or any means? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. I should think not; for there was a great quantity of flags there, and there was sufficient strength in them—they are strong enough to keep a heavier weight than that from sinking so deep—there was a handful of flags lying on the bank, as if they had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240018"/>
               <p>just pulled out—they were wet, green, and fresh, as if just pulled up—I took the child out to the top of the bank, and called a veterinary surgeon, named Eldridge, whom I saw in Mr. Moseley's yard, about one hundred and thirty yards off—he came instantly and felt the child's pulse—he said he thought he could feel the pulse still beating—I ran from there to the Albany Arms as fast as I could—it is two or three hundred yards—I took the child with me, and got a hot bath ready as quick as possible—they had hot water in the house—I stripped the child and put it in—I ran directly and fetched Mr. Haskey, a medical gentleman, who attended to it instantly—I should think it was nearly a quarter of an hour from the time I first saw the child till Mr. Haskey came—every means were used to recover it, but in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> By "flags," I suppose you mean green flags that grow by rivers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I gave the same account before the Coroner as I have now, that it required more than extra exertion to lift it out of the mud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say it might have happened from the child rolling down the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the sinking into the mud—I said I thought it was forced into the mud—I said it might have rolled down the bank into the ditch—I said that was not impossible—it is possible it might have rolled down into the ditch—I examined the body of the child—there were no marks of violence on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the Coroner were you asked, at the close of the ex<lb/>amination, whether the child might have rolled down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said it was possible it might—the flags on the bank were only on that particular part—they were fresh gathered, as if pulled just out of the spot where the child lay, and the flags under where the child lay were driven into the mud—I went and examined them afterwards—there were no footmarks by the side of the ditch—it was impossible to see them, as it is turf and gravel—it had been raining for two days before—when I went down to take the child out, the footh-path against the side which had been fresh cut gave way, and my foot slipped—I made no impression, with my feet on the top of the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the flags to be taken out fresh and green, was it necessary, to enable a person to take them out, to have gone down from the top of the bank, to the place where you were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He must have gone down from the towing path to the lower path—I saw no marks there—the per<lb/>son must either have knelt down, or put their feet right into the water to get at them—I saw no knee marks—the nature of the flat part of the bank would not make even an impression of a heavy shoe—I stood on the lower bank in the first instance, and reached the body without putting my feet in the water; but finding it would not come up, I was obliged to put my foot down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a child had rolled from the upper foot-path, would it have rolled into the water, or only on the lower foot-path? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might, if it had tripped head over heels—the bottom bank is not above two feet or eighteen inches—I cannot say whether, in that case, it would have gone so far into the water.</p>

(meaning his wife)—I said, I had not—he said, "You are deceiving or betraying me"—I will not be certain which—I told him I was not—he seemed to doubt it—I told him I had seen my sister, who had seen his wife, and she had told my sister she had an ap<lb/>pointment to meet him at Clapham Common, but his wife was too ill to come, and she had requested my sister to come in her stead, that my sister was rather tenacious and unwilling to come, and I had come there to meet him, thinking he had something to communicate to his wife, which if he had, and would tell me, I would communicate it to her, as I should be very ready to do every thing in my power to bring them together again, and make them comfortable—some other trifling conversation took place be<lb/>tween us till we arrived at the Plough, at Clapham, still walking on while we talked—when we got to the Plough, I asked him if he would have a glass of ale—after hesitating a little, he agreed to go with me—we went in, and as soon as we got in at the door, I said to him, "You are my prisoner"—I saw a person named Fieldwick, of Camberwell, and said, "Mr. Field-wick, I claim your assistance to take this man for murdering his child"—Finnegan then said to me, "Don't make any noise about it, I will go where<lb/>ever you like"—I took him to the station-house at Camberwell, and from there to Union-hall, at seven o'clock that evening—I did not see the child after death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 33, Bishopsgate-street Within. The prisoner was in my service—I carry on the business of a butcher—on the 2nd of November, I had occasion to make some alteration in some boxes I have up stairs—I went up into the prisoner's bed-room, and looked into a linen chest—I there found some things between two fea<lb/>ther beds, which she slept on alone—they had been in a black leather trunk in the room next to her room—we call it the box-room—there was a gown skirt, petticoat, and some trifling articles—this induced me to ask her to let me see her box, in which I found some lawn, holland, nankeen, lace, and several other things—I missed some rings and lockets a day or two afterwards, and they were found concealed under some bricks in the cellar, in my presence—she had access to the cellar—the rings were taken from a glass drawer in my bed-room, and a key, which I saw found in her box, fitted that glass drawer—it was not the proper key, but it would open it.</p>

The prisoner had been in their employ about eighteen months—on the 20th of October, in consequence of information, I went to a back part of the shop, and found some new bolts concealed under some hay; I marked two, and set a person to watch—about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the street—I sent a man to fetch him back—when he came to the front of the shop, I went and took him by the arm, and told him to walk into the counting-house—he told me to let go his arm, and he would walk—the counting-house door which I went to was locked—I sent a man round to open it, and when I was going in with the prisoner, I saw at his feet some bolts—I took them up, and two of them were those I had marked—I sent for the officer, who found on the prisoner twenty-one bolts and nuts—I have no doubt they were Messrs. Thrupp's, but there was no mark on them.</p>

Allen came there to clean knives—on Tuesday, the 21st of October, I delivered my boxes to him to take to my mother's, at No. 9, York-row, Kingsland—when I got home in the evening they were there, but I found a band-box had been opened—I missed from it two small boxes with trinkets in them, and a cap, and several things; a bonnet, a remnant of lace, and other things, which were quite safe when I delivered it to him—I went next day to St. Katherine's Cottage and saw Allen—I told him of it—he denied it for some time—I threatened to get</p>

I remember on the 11th of October the prisoner returning from the bankers—he brought in a bag of money to the counting-house, and gave one bag, containing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, to me—he said he could not get any more silver—I saw him with a bag which appeared to contain other money—he put that into the drawer of his own desk, where it was usually kept—he had the key of it—I afterwards told him he had better go out to get more silver, and said I thought he might get some at Mr. Chapman's—I missed him afterwards, and thought he was gone for silver—he did not return—the drawer was broken open then, and no money was in it—he did not return.</p>

On Sunday, the 12th of October, a bill reached me respecting this robbery, and the prisoner came to my house that day, and called for brandy and water—he was served by my wife—I saw her give him change for half-a-sovereign—I took him into custody in consequence of the hand-bill I had seen—I told him I should detain him on suspicion of absconding with a considerable sum of money—he said, "Indeed, Sir"—I said from a hand-bill I had seen that day, I was positive he was the per<lb/>son—he said I might be mistaken—he was given into custody of Hans and Faulkner.</p>

Cubitt eighteen years, and knew him there—I had very frequent occasions of observing him—on the morning in question I was so struck with his conduct and behaviour that I went back, and said at the counting-house, "I think Ellis's family afflictions have turned his brain"—that is what I thought and expressed before I heard of this—he was not an acquaintance, I only knew him in business.</p>

I took several gentlemen with me—I had been to the gardens before, and found the summer-houses were strip<lb/>ped—I found Clements, and his wife, at home—I found Wicks, James and Thomas Douglas, and Stonehewer, there—I said to Mrs. Clements, "I am come to search your house"—she said, "You are quite welcome"—her husband did not say any thing—I found this cup and saucer, owned by a gentleman of the name of Pickford, this knife and spoon, and some other articles belonging to Mr. Casey—I knew that Mrs. Clements had lived there some time—there are only two rooms, both on the ground-floor—she said the boys had brought these little things for their own use—I took the things, and took her and the boys into custody—she did not tell me about any other things—I took the shoes of Wick, James Douglas, James Stone<lb/>hewer, and Price, (who was taken in the same house afterwards, by another policeman,) and fitted them to the marks in the gardens, where the robbery had been committed—they corresponded exactly.</p>

I feel it a duty incumbent on me, having a parent's feelings, to speak in justice to the lads' innocence, that were taken, at the time, on suspicion; they are all entirely innocent. Wicks, Douglas, and Stonehewer, had not been long in my house, merely calling for my children to walk out with them. I formerly knew their parents, and having a feeling towards their offspring, merely sheltered them through humanity, till, through persuasion, they were reconciled to return home. I bought the property in question at my own door, of two young men, entirely strangers to me; but questioned them as to the property being their own, to which they replied in the affirmative, and I purchased them without hesitation, thinking to make my son a present, as he was on the point of marriage. I feel it my duty to make a free confession of the male pri<lb/>soners' innocence, throwing myself entirely on the humanity of the Court"</p>

On the 3rd of November, I missed three pieces of silk handkerchiefs—Mr. Roe afterwards came, and produced one to me—I went with him to Mr. Waters, and saw two others—I then went to Harper-street, Goswell-street, and saw Mary Ann Davis—Roe and another officer then went and took Tyson, and brought her there—Mary Ann Davis then stated that Tyson and her had come to my shop, to ask for some quilling net—that Tyson had taken the handkerchiefs, and given them to her; but she had nothing to do with pawning them—Tyson denied it—the officer then went and brought Mary Davis—when she came, Tyson said, as the truth must be told, she would not bear all the blame—that Mary Davis knew all about it, and she went with her to pawn them at Mr. Upsall's—Mary Davis fell on her knees, and declared to God that she knew nothing about them—the pieces were marked, but there is no mark on these separate handkerchiefs—to the best of my belief, these are what I lost.</p>

Mr. James; I am very sorry"—Haxton said, "You cannot hurt me; you did not see the phials in my hand"—the bundle had not then been opened—she afterwards asked me what I thought the magistrate would do so her—there is a bell to that warehouse door, which should ring when it is opened, but it did not ring—a person inside could prevent it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser. I keep fowls in a mews—on Sunday, the 9th of November, I found my shed broken open, and missed one fowl—I then tied up the shed, and intended to destroy my other fowls in the evening; but in the evening they were gone—I was telling my suspicions to a man in the mews, and he said that Baker had been asking him for some corn—the next morning I saw Baker and two other boys come out of the mews—I went and asked Mrs. Baker to let me look at the fowls which were in her cellar—I then went down and saw my cock, which had its head cut off, and was picked clean—I then found my hen and the other fowls—I got the officer, who came and took the fowls and the prisoner—he came over to me, began to cry, and said a boy gave him the fowls in Cumberland-street, that he did not know it was my cock, but he knew it was my hen—his mother came out and whispered to him, and he said no more.</p>

From the 28th of October to the 1st of November, I did not attend the prosecutor's employment, for want of work, as myself and two apprentices were playing about; and not wishing to impose on the prosecutor, I kept away—on the 1st of November, being requested by the prosecutor to come to work, I attended, finding him slightly indisposed—he was obliged, next day, to go to bed, and call the doctor—the com<lb/>mencement of the week being devoted to attend to a sick friend, I in<lb/>formed him I could not attend to his work till the following week, which he approved of—he was confined the whole week to his bed—I attended on the Monday, as agreed on—I had two apprentices to instruct—on Monday, the collector of the water rate called and threatened to cut off the water—I appeased him by saying he should be paid when he called again—the collector of the poor rates called for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and threatened to levy—he called again on Thursday, and I got him to let it stand over till the following day, promising he should be paid—he sent a man next day to levy, if not paid—the prosecutor said something must de done to satisfy the rates, and he did not wish even his wife should be made acquainted with his situation—on Friday, when the poor rate collector called, I was compelled to introduce him to the prosecutor's bed-side, and by our joint supplications, he agreed it should stand over, and that afternoon I suggested to the prosecutor the propriety of pawning a watch for two days to relieve him from his difficulties—he replied, "Baxter, I leave it all to you, pray make use of all exertions to relieve me from such pressing difficulties;" again saying, "I will leave it all to you"—he was much pressed for a new bell to a watch, which could not be got from the maker—these two watches belonged to the same gentleman as the gold watch—he has a wife and four children, and I thought it best to pawn the watch to relieve him from his difficulties, giving him part of the money on Saturday evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I pawned the watch to relieve him from his domestic difficul<lb/>ties—Mrs. Phillips actually used some of this money for domestic purposes—I reserved the rest for my week's wages, and any demand which might</p>

               <p>be made in the shop—I told him on Saturday I would give him all the particulars on Monday—I want on Monday, and called up the apprentice—I afterwards met a friend and had a few glasses of liquor—I did not go to work till Tuesday morning; but I called on Monday evening, and un<lb/>derstood he was gene to look for me—I went home, and on returning to the shop was taken by an officer—since my confinement he has been distrained on, and his shop is closed—I suppose he was alarmed at my intemperance, and thinking I should not be able to make up the money by the time—had I meant to steal the watch, should I have given him part of money it was pawned for, and should I have called on the Saturday and Monday? it may be a matter of mystery how I could make of £3; but my con<lb/>nexions are respectable, and I should have written to a friend.</p>

On the 16th of October, I went to No. 1, Greystock-place, Tothill-fields, with Bannister and Clifton—I went to the top of the house, the two-pair front room, and found the door closed—I rapped at it—the prisoner and I both opened it at the same time—I told him we were officers; that we had information that he was carrying on coining, and we must search the place—he said we were welcome to do it—he was in his shirt sleeves—there was a strong fire in the room—I took him into custody—I searched the room, and under the fire place, up in one corner, on the right hand side, I found a mould which I produce—there was a lad in the room, and a little girl; and his wife and an infant in bed—I found a spoon, with white metal in it, in a table-drawer; and in a trunk, in the room, I found a file, with white metal in the teeth; and a piece of li<lb/>nen, with a lot of platter of Paris—I did not search the prisoner—he said he knew nothing about the things; and afterwards he said some man had left them there—he did not say who, at that time—asked who was the oc<lb/>cupier of the room—he said, he was—I found part of a tobacco-pipe—there was nothing in it, and I broke it.</p>

How came they in your pocket?"—he said, "I agreed to go out with the man in the evening."</p>

About half-past four o'clock, I was in a public-house having something to drink—I went down Union-street, into Wil<lb/>liam-street, and down a court there—I met a young man in his shirt sleeves talking to a girl—the girl said a person was walking up and down the passage waiting for die young man—he took off his coat and hat, and asked me to hold the basket a few minutes—he put his coat on the basket—I held the coat in my hand, and asked another young man to hold the hat—a witness saw a man deliver the basket into my hand, and while I had it in my hand the policeman came and caught me with the things.</p>

               <p>said, "How could I when these men have been here?"—Broom then came in, and I said to him, "Go, get some bread and cheese and beer;" which we were having when the officer came—there was no resistance, except the bedstead, which might have made some small obstruction to opening the door, as the prosecutor acknowledged—I said to them, "If you had been here an hour before, you would have had the right parties"—my wife stated that one was a tall man and one short—she said the same to the officer; and Broom told the same story before the magistrate.</p>

On the 17th of June, the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, came and said he was recommended to me by Mr. Raphael, my landlord, who understood I had some jobs to do—the prisoner said he was a tailor, that his name was Thomas, and he lived in Cloth-fair—I asked if he was a housekeeper—he said he was, and had been for years—I showed him my coat, and told him the alteration I wanted at the collar, and he said he would do it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I laid the coat across a chair, while I went to Mr. Raphael's to inquire about the prisoner—Mr. Raphael was not at home—when I re<lb/>turned, the prisoner and my coat were gone—I afterwards heard that the pri<lb/>soner was seen wearing my coat at Knightsbridge—I went there, but could</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City officer. On the 9th of October I was called in by the solicitor for the prosecution—I put such a letter at this into the general post, and left town for Weymouth the same night by the mail—next day I went to the house of Williams and Co., at Wey<lb/>mouth—I was in a back room adjoining the counting-house—I saw the prisoner there—I did not see her come in—I came from the back room into the front office, and the prisoner was writing this receipt (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she wrote nearly the whole of it in my presence—when she had finished writing it, I took it from her, and asked her if that signature was her name—she answered, "Yes"—I said, "How will you take it?"—she said, "In Bank of England paper, if you have got it"—I said, "I must trouble you to step into the back room, as I wish to ask you a question or two"—she said, "I hope there is nothing amiss"—I produced the letter in one hand, and the draft in the other—this is the document I speak of, (No. 1.) and this was the draft—I showed the letter and bill to her—she pointed to the letter, and said, "That is my handwriting,"—the face of the draft was towards her—she pointed to me to turn it, which I did, and she said, "That is my handwriting," alluding to the indorsement: I think I have gone rather too fast—as soon as I got her into the back room, I said, "You are not bound to answer me any questions unless you please; it will either be used for or against you"—that was before I asked her a question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your producing the letter and bill, did she state what you have said without your asking her the question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she said it was her handwriting—I held the bill in my hand—she pointed to the indorse<lb/>ment, "C. Hillier," and said it was her handwriting—when she said, "that is my handwriting," she referred to the "C. Hillier," on the back—she said, "I can only speak the truth"—I then told her I understood the signature purporting to be Lord Stradbroke's was a forgery—she said the had taken it of an agent in France, and that Lord Stradbroke was not personally known to her—I asked her in what part of France—she said, "Nantz"—I asked her the name of the agent—she said, "Percy"—I asked her when she took it—she said, "On the 16th of this month"—I said, "The 16th of this month has not arrived yet," and she said, "It was the 16th of last month"—I said, "September?" she said, "Yes, the 16th, I left on the 18th"—the said, "I took it in a money transaction for some pictures," or, "in a pic<lb/>ture transaction"—I do not recollect which she said—after this I went with her to Augusta-place, into two rooms there—she brought away a carpet bag, a trunk, and basket, containing wearing apparel and other things—I kept the trunk, and she had the key in her possession—there was a purse in her trunk, but nothing important—I found this piece of blotting-paper in the trunk, of which I took possession, and which she kept the key of—in consequence of a mark on the paper of the first letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240116"/>
               <p>I went to Mr. Thomas, a stationer at Weymouth, and made inquiry there—I found some paper corresponding with that in the trunk—there was some marked "Thomas, Weymouth"—here is the whole of the paper found in the trunk—it bears the same impression in the corner as the paper—the letter is written on, "Thomas, Weymouth"—it was in the same trunk.</p>

On the morning of Friday, the 10th of October, about one o'clock, or half-past one, I saw the prisoner there—she said she had a letter from Messrs. Drummond, the bankers, and inquired if we had received any instructions to pay her some money—I do not know whether she produced a letter to me—this letter (No. 2) was produced to me in the course of the morning, before she left the office—on her making the inquiry, I said we had received instructions respecting the payment of some money—I inquired if she was furnished with a receipt for the amount—I do not recollect whether she stated the amount—she said, "No," she was not furnished with one—I said it was necessary she should write a receipt, which must be on a stamp—she said, "Perhaps I had better get a stamp then, and bring a receipt," and immediately inquired whether we kept stamps—I produced this stamp (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) and she filled it up—this is what she wrote on that occasion—in consequence of something I said while she was writing the receipt, Forrester was introduced into the office—immediately she began to write, I had him brought in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother John. We are ivory comb-manufacturers, and live in Fleur-de-lis-street—we gene<lb/>rally have some thousands of dozens of pieces of ivory like these—they are turned by circular saws—on the 22nd of September we took stock, and again on the 11th of November; and we had lost sixty-nine gross of these pieces—they are worth about a guinea a gross—Jackson, of Gun-square, Houndsditch, cuts the teeth in the combs—on the 9th of November I went to Jackson, but nothing was shown to me then—on the 11th of November I went there again, and saw a number of our pieces—I knew them to be ours—Jackson showed me fifty-nine dozen—I recog<lb/>nized forty dozen, which were ours—I knew them by the way they were cut, and the various sized saws employed—they are cut different to the general way of cutting—some are cut upright, but these are not—we had different qualities of ivory, and these are of different qualities, cor<lb/>responding with ours—on Saturday morning, the 15th of November, I went with the officer to Edward-street, Kingsland-road—we went to the first-floor back room—I saw the prisoner there—I had known him many years—Hanley asked him to account for the pieces at Jackson's—he said they were his own; that he had bought a variety; and told us where he had cut them up—that in one instance he had bought some clumps of a sailor who came to his house; in another instance he had bought a tooth of Mr. West, in Charles-street, Hatton-garden; and these pieces were the proceeds of that tooth; and he produced a receipt for about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he did not know the sailor, he had never seen him before—he told me he would show me part of the proceeds of this tooth, and we walked into the front room—he then took a handful of pieces out of a drawer-case, and showed them to me—I said, "Why, David, these are my pieces"—he said, "If you say that, you will say any thing;" and he swept the whole of the contents of the drawer-case on the floor—I said, "David, if you had come by these honestly, you would have taken me out some of the tip pieces"—he said there were no tip pieces, for he had run the stuff—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240127"/>
               <p>but I found some tip pieces among them—I said, "David, here are some tip pieces, for here is the saw-race at the end"—he said he had got them all out of the tooth he had bought—I said it was nonsense to talk so, for I could show him five or six different sorts of stuff which they came out of; and I showed him the proof I had that they were mine—I found thirteen dozen in the prisoner's drawer-case that are mine—I certainly could not have sold them in the state they are in—the prisoner said he had them cut up by Pyer, a horn comb-manufacturer, in Fashion-street, Spitalfields; but they are cut by different-sized saws, and, when we got to Pyer's, he had but one saw.</p>

Are you extensive manufacturers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the most extensive manufacturers in the three kingdoms—ours are not patent saws—there are numbers to circular saws to the same description as ours for the slabbing of these pieces, but I sincerely believe we are the only persons who use them for rounding them—Mr. Simmons does not use them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this piece—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—it is done in the same way as yours, is it one of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not really think it is—I do not think it is done by our machine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not this one of the circular machines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it has been abused—I do not think it could be used—it appears to have been used, and I cannot tell how many more there are—many thousands of elephants' teeth are cut in London every year—I knew the prisoner in the trade—I had not seen him on our premises during the time we lost ivory, from the 22nd of September to November—they might hare, been stolen on the 1st of October, and have passed through many hands—Captains and sailors bring elephants' teeth sometimes—this piece has not been done by a machine similar to ours; it has been broken in' the rounding—a proper machine would not have done so—there may be other machines of different sizes.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a linen-draper's shop, in Newgate-street. The prisoners came into my shop last Wednesday, about two o'clock in the afternoon—they asked me for some prints, and as I turned to get them, I saw Mason hand to another girl, who is not here, something, but I could not tell what—I looked into the window, to see what it was, and out of five or six pieces of handkerchiefs, I missed one—I had seen them all safe five minutes before—I told Mason that the other person had taken a piece of handkerchiefs—she said she would go after her—I sent for the officer, and gave the two prisoners into custody—I saw them searched at the Compter—they had nothing on them—I have heard to-day, that the handkerchiefs are in the other person's hands, and I think I shall find her.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th of September, I was in Cornhill, sitting in Laithwaite's newspaper-office, (where I am shopman,) op<lb/>posite 'Change-alley, Cornhill, under the Royal Exchange—I had a full view of the street—I heard a number of people calling out to a cart to stop—I immediately looked, and saw a man, whom I knew as a porter, under a cart—I did not see the cart before the wheels had gone over him—I cannot tell at what rate it was going previous to the accident—when I saw it, the wheel had gone over the man—it was going at a fast rate, and had only one horse in it—was a particularly heavy cart, and had only two wheels—there was nobody in the office, and I could not leave it—the man was taken up, and taken into' Change-alley—I did not go over—I should say, at a guess, the cart was going at the rate of five or six miles an hour after it had gone over the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Cornhill, about half-past ten o'clock on the morning of the 12th of September, standing on the pavement—I saw the cart coming at the rate of five or six miles an hour towards the Poultry—I was nearly opposite Laithwaite's shop—I saw John Sanders take a newspaper in his hand, from Holmes' newspaper shop window; he was coming across, from the Royal Exchange, with it in his hand—he was not reading it—there was no carriage at that present moment—to the best of my knowledge he had spectacles on—he generally wore spectacles—he either had them on, or in his hand—he was a short-sighted man—I saw the cart coming—I hallooed three or four times to the persons in the cart—Sanders was then seven or eight yards from the cart, I suppose—I should think any body could hear me—the cart kept coming on—the horses touched him, knocked him down, and he went under the wheel—the wheel caught him, and dragged him for four or five yards—the younger prisoner was driving, and the other sat alongside of him—it was a calenderer's covered cart—the horse appeared rather spirited when I caught hold of him—it went five or six yards before I stopped the cart—if the eldest prisoner had not got Hold of reins, I could not have stopped him myself—I saw no other carriage near—there was nothing to prevent their see<lb/>ing the person cross—the street was quite clear—I should imagine San<lb/>ders to be between fifty and sixty years old—he was rather infirm—his name was John—I did not see what became of him—I stopped the cart, and asked the eldest prisoner whose cart it was—he said his father's—Mr. Reynolds, seeing the accident, went to the Mansion-house, and they were taken before the Lord Mayor, who asked Johnson what he had to say—he said he was very sorry, but he had merely given the reins to Miles to drive—Miles was afterwards apprehended—it did not appear to me that there was any violent driving—Sanders might have slipped—I did not see him slip—it was quite accidental, from what I saw—the boy was not whipping the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Ship public-house, Artillery-street. I was at the bottom of Change-alley, in Cornhill—I saw Mr. Sanders with the newspaper in his hand—I have known him about six months—he was a porter, and between fifty and sixty years old—I do not think he was near-sighted, for he went about without glasses, except when he was reading—I do not know whether he had them on that morning, but I picked them up when he was run over—I saw him cross<lb/>ing the road, and observed a cart coming at rather a quick pace—not violently, but faster than carts generally do in Cornhill—I did not notice who was driving it—my attention was directed to Sanders—I saw the cart coming so quick I thought he must be run over—I ran to him just as he was knocked down by the horse—the horse ran against him—he was on the other side of the way—I was going to stop the horse if I could, but it went on, and I saw the wheel pass over his body, across his ribs—I picked him up, and took him into Change-alley—I sent for a surgeon, who came, and I took him to the Borough Hos<lb/>pital on a shutter—he died about five minutes before we got to the hos<lb/>pital—he was rather infirm in one foot, I think—I think, if there had been proper caution used, or a stronger lad had been driving, the accident would not have happened—the cart was five or six yards away from him when he was crossing—he was generally a nimble man—the cart was certainly going faster than usual—he went in front of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ayres, and live and sleep at his shop in the Commercial-road. Last Saturday the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at a watch, marked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., about nine o'clock in the evening—there was another marked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which hung in the window—I showed him them both—he said he would consult he friend whether he would give so much, and return again in half an hour—he came back about ten o'clock—he said he had been gone longer than the time he mentioned—he asked for the watch—I showed him one of them again—he then asked for the other, to look at them both again—he then asked what was the least I would take for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one—I told him five guineas—he then asked if I had keys to fit them—I went to the glass-case, on the counter, to get the keys, and while I was getting them he ran off with the watches—the lad in the shop pursued him—he was taken up immediately, taken to the station-house, and searched there—he took both the watches—I saw them that evening at the station-house—I saw him searched—the watches were not found on him—the policeman produced them—I knew them again immediately—these are the watches—I am certain he is the man—Mr. Ayres pays die vent and rates of the house.</p>

               <p>"To hoist these every day will be like shutting up my own shop, as well as my neighbours': I must have some consideration for both. I am thinking that one day in a week will be enough: perhaps Sunday will be the best day, as that will not injure business; and that is the day on which the Church is most thought of—the people, in passing by, will see how it is supported. I have no view but public good; certainly no desire to injure any one, but a passionate desire to do some good in the world, so as to leave it better than I found it. Out of respect for the business of my neighbours, I will, after this week, fix on Sundays as the best day on which to exhibit the props of the Church,—the spiritual broker and the temporal broker."</p>

               <p>"We hoisted them full length on Sunday, and made the Bishop preach on the present state of the Church to all passers by, from eight o'clock in the morning until six in the evening, while the temporal broker officiated as clerk and published other notices. I very much respect the institution of the Sabbath, and never call on my shopmen to open on that day; but one of them requested that he might be allowed to open, and did so. He retailed seven hundred copies of <hi rend="italic">A Scourge</hi> over the counter, beside many other things. Thinking of the matter, I could not but consider it as doing more good than is done by an open gin-shop on that day, par<lb/>ticularly as I, the master, (as Cobbett would say,) was preaching the revelation of the gospel in assistance of a sick minister of the true Church, both morning and evening.</p>
               <p>"They have been partially exhibited on every other day; but Sunday is to be the grand gala day of public appearance, when the bishop is to have clean boots and clean linen; while the temporal broker must be content to remain as he is, as not worth repair."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live next door to Mr. Cariile's shop. I have seen the effigies up at Mr. Carlile's—this is a cor<lb/>rect representation of the exhibition in front of the house—there is a window with two figures in it—when I first observed it, it was the same, except that there is an additional figure now—this continues till the present time—I observed it this morning—the consequence of that exhibition has been, a continued assemblage of crowds on the pavement next Mr. Carliles, and on the opposite side as well, in considerable numbers—I have counted them—I should fairly state that, on one occasion, it happened to be Lord Mayor's day—yesterday I counted, on the opposite side of the way, upwards of fifty persons—if I was to say that is the average number of the crowd which have been there since the 21st of October, perhaps it would be more than was the case—there is a perpetual succession of people in the street—the numbers have been so great on the same side as the shop as to be, to me and my neighbours, a serious injury; at I have witnessed persons, passengers, coming from the west being obliged to turn off the pavement into the carriage road repeatedly—I and my neighbours have been incommoded to a considerable degree—I have not been able to keep my shop open as usual on all occasions—on some occasions I have not been able to keep it open—I do not mean to state I have closed altogether on account of the crowd, but partly, that part next to his house—I have had cases of some of my customers (ladies) approach<lb/>ing in a carriage, and fearful of coming out of the carriage lest they might be interrupted by the crowd.</p>

I am a coach-proprietor, and conduct the business of the Bolt-in-Tun—I noticed the figures exhibited at Mr. Carlile'g when they were first put up, and have continued my observation of them up to the present time—the effect has been the attracting a concourse of people on both sides of the street—I think usually there was more on the opposite side—there were placards on the wall as well—I read some of them—the crowd assembled caused the stoppage of the foot-passengers passing to and fro—I have frequently seen people obliged to go out into the carriage-way, there not being room on the foot pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walthamstow, in Essex. On the 27th of October, in the morning, I saw the two prisoners go by our house between eleven and twelve o'clock—I had a scythe on my shoulder—I followed them down Amber-lane—they seemed to look at me with particular anxiety—they kept turning round—I suspected them, and went on in a different direction—they turned down the lane, to the left—I threw my scythe down, and went into Amber-field, and stood behind a tree—I then got up into the tree, which was shaded with leaves—I had a perfect view of them—they came and surveyed the geese—some lads there were making a noise—they walked on, and joined the lads—I went on about a quarter of a mile—I went on cutting my grass, and in a quarter of an hour, they came back with each a stick, and knocked down a goose, and brought it into the field where I stood, and tucked it into the hedge—I suppose they meant to go and get another, but seeing me, they set off running—I chased them about three quarters of a mile—one hid himself in the brambles—I jumped into the brambles, and secured him—he walked with me till I overtook the other, and put both into the cage—when I came back the goose was dead—I took it up, and carried it to Mr. Robinson, the magistrate of Waltham<lb/>stow—it belonged to my father, Adam Charlton—I have the wings of the goose here—I saw them take it from my father's flock of geese.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a driver of a Stratford stage-coach. On the evening of the 25th of October, I was driving the coach to Stratford, and saw a cart, driven by the prisoner, pass me at the Harrow public-house, near the three-mile stone, it was going at the rate of ten miles an hour, when I first saw it—the prisoner was not driving fast, but trotting along—it appeared to me to be a very heavy cart—it had only one horse—when I got up by the side of him, he quickened his pace immediately and passed me, and went over the Harrow-bridge, at the rate of ten miles an hour—I cannot say he was galloping—he was sitting low in the front of the cart—I understand there was a bundle of sacks in the cart, which he was sitting on—he was sitting very low on something—he appeared to have a full command of his horse—he had the reins tight in his hands—I saw Monk, the deceased, walking in the road by the side of the curb, from two to three feet from the footpath—I was in the middle of the road—the road is wide enough for four or five carriages to pats a-breast—there was room enough for a carriage to pass on the right, or off-side, as well as the left—he should have passed me, not on my side of the coach, but on the other—we were both going one way—he passed me on the wrong side—I saw Monk walking in the road, and saw him knocked down either by the horse's head, or by the shaft of the prisoner's cart, and the near wheel ap<lb/>peared to me to go over his body—it was the near shaft—the deceased was between my coach and the cart, passing on the wrong side—he was be<lb/>tween the pavement and the cart—the near wheel went over him—the cart continued to go on—I was desired by persons on my coach to go after it as fast as possible, to get the Stratford turnpike-gate shut to stop him—I passed him about thirty yards, before I got to the gate—I do not know what became of the cart—at the time he got over Stratford-bridge he slackened his pace—I consider he was going at the rate of eight miles an hour when it occurred—I believe it was half-past six o'clock—it was dark—there was light enough for me to see the man walking—there are gas-lamps all the way down the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford, and was a passenger on Winch's coach. I was sitting on the dickey, at the hind part of the coach—the first I saw was the cart leaving the man lying dowr in the road—I pressed on the coachman to drive on—the cart came at a moderate pace after the coach—the coach was pasting the cart at the time the accident happened—the coach was on the right hand side, (the off side)—the road, I should think, is twenty-four feet wide there—I do not know the width of a coach—I allow five feet for each footpath, but from curb to curb it is about twenty-four feet—there is room for three coaches on the road with safety—the deceased was on the left hand side of the road, going into the coun<lb/>try, and the cart was on the left hand side, going down the road—I got down from the coach, and wished the prisoner to go back, telling him there was an accident—he got out of the cart, and went back directly—he said he did not know he had run over any body—he was a little fresh, but knew what he was about—he was sitting low in the back of the cart, with<lb/>out a seat—I think he was in such a position as would prevent his seeing what he could have seen if he had been on a seat—the cart I stopped with the prisoner in it, was the same cart as I saw leave the body of the de<lb/>ceased, and the prisoner is the man who was driving it—the deceased was taken to the sign of the Two Brewers—the accident occurred between the two gas lights—it was rather a dim light—there was a very good light from the gas, but it was between the two lights—I saw the cart and driver, and the body of the deceased when the cart was leaving him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mount-Zion, Tunbridge Wells, in Kent. On the 17th of November, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was in the Lower-road, Rotherhithe—I was intoxicated at the time—I had been drinking the whole day, and was going down to Woolwich—I found myself in the prisoners' company—I have a recollection of that, but how I got into their company I do not know—I went into some public-houses with them—I have a strong knowledge of Bush—the last house we were in was Dawson's, Lower-road, Deptford—I had a pint of beer, and came out—Bush had hold of my arm—Clarke was on before me, and he said to me, "Come along, do not stop so long behind"—Bush said, "Now, you b—, I will do for you," and that is all I can recol<lb/>lect; but I believe Clarke is an innocent man, because he wished to have nothing to do with it—I did not hear him say so—Bush knocked me down—I was in a state of insensibility—I do not know that Clarke did not come up—I received a blow on my forehead, and in my ribs, and on my face—I was sober enough to know that it was Bush knocked me down—I had hold of his arm—before I went to the first public-house with them, I had some silver, but to what amount I do not know—I had no gold.</p>

On the 17th of September I went to bed about twelve o'clock at night—I saw the doors fastened, and the windows also—between one and two o'clock in th'e morning I was awoke by a ringing at my bell, and knocking at the door also—I called to know what was the matter—they</p>

               <p>told me to come down directly, for my premises were entered by thieves—I went down, opened the street door, and went out—I found a shutter-box, which is in a line with my shop window, was broken open—the lock was broken—the box holds my shutters in the daytime—it was empty that night, but it had been locked up—I looked into the shutter-box, and found a hat; and in that hat a blue bag—I told the policeman, and gave them to him—I do not know which policeman I gave them to—it was one of the two policemen—they had the prisoner Paine down on the pavement at that time—I examined the lock of the shutter-box with the key I lock it up with, and found the key would not act—the lock had been picked, or something—the key would not turn it—one end of the shutter-box communicates with the inside of my shop window which holds the silver goods—a person could get through that end into the window—I am a silversmith—they could get into the shop window from the box, and so into the house—the shop is part of the house—no property was moved at all—the inspector has a plan of the premises.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you open the shutter-box from the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With a key—the shutter-box was made after the house was built—the shutters rest against the wood work, which is the lining of the box, in the daytime, not against any window—the win<lb/>dow is on the right hand of the shutter-box—there is a wall at the back of the shutter-box—the left hand side of the box is wood pannelling, on the right hand side is the window—the window is all glass—there is a door which locks with a small key—it is a glass door—that is inside the shop—it was secured by the shutters outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When a person has got into the shutter-box, what have they to do to get into the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To cut through this end into the window—they would have to cut through a wood pannelling, on the other side of which is a sheet of iron, which I put up for my own security, which they were not aware of—it was a plate of sheet iron—the shutter-box partly projects from the house like a watch-box.</p>

               <p>—I am a policeman. The shutter-box is outside, and attached to the house—it cannot possibly be called part of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman harness-maker, living in Crown-street, King-street, Westminster. I have been out of work lately—I went to Richmond on Monday, the 27th of October, with the two pri<lb/>soners—we set out from London at half-past eight o'clock, and arrived at Richmond at twelve o'clock at night—Gray said he was going to see his friends there—we went to the corner of Richmond-green—both the pri<lb/>soners told me to stand at the corner of the green, and they parted from me—I staid half an hour, I suppose; they returned both together, and Gray said they had not seen their friends—they went to the corner of a place where there was a field, at the corner of Mr. Long's house, and they said they were to lie down a bit—instead of laying down, they went to a wall close by Mr. Long's—I went with them as far as the wall—Gray said that was his uncle's—they both got over the wall—I got on the top of the wall, and sat on it—they got over another wall close by, that wall parted Mr. Long's wall from the house—they then went to the left, towards the house—I then lost sight of them—after they had been gone a little while, I saw a light in the back apartment of Mr. Long's house—the house ad<lb/>joins others, I believe—I neared as if it were the report of a gun—the prisoners came back again in about half an hour, or three quarters, to the place where I was—it was near two o'clock—I was not sitting on the wall all the time—I was at the wall when they came back—they had two boxes, one containing the tea, and two or three square pieces of wood in the other—Bryan had the box containing the tea—Gray had the small box—I saw the spoons, but I cannot say how many—I did not see them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240194"/>
               <p>open plainly, to see how many there were—Bryan had them—one table<lb/>spoon was broken in halves before I saw it—Bryan broke open one of the boxes, which had tea in it, he took it out of there, and put it into a handker<lb/>chief—he took the boxes back on Mr. Long's hill, close by the wall, and came back again—we all three went away together—we met a man having the appearance of a policeman, who stopped us—he asked us what we did over the wall, over in that field—Bryan said he did nothing over there, that he was not over there at all—the policeman said yes, we were there—he had been in the lane, and watched us—Bryan said we had not—Gray walked away—he followed Gray a little way, and I saw Bryan throw the spoons over the wall, while the policeman was following Gray—he threw them into a garden opposite Mr. Long's—the policeman searched us all after Bryan had thrown the spoons over; he did not take off our hats, and we went away altogether—we came to town in the morning, all three together—on Tuesday night I saw Ford, a policeman, and told him what had happened—on Tuesday morning, before I told the policeman, the prisoners took the tea to a man and had it weighed—I saw Bryan take it out in a hand<lb/>kerchief to get it weighed—it was the same handkerchief that he put it in the night before—he took it to a house next door—Hill, I believe, keeps it—Bryan came out, and came into his own house, and the tea was divided into two parts—I saw it divided by Bryan—one part was given to Gray, and the other part Bryan kept.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you lived in Crown-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not long—about three weeks—I do not carry on business as a harness-maker there—I only lodge there—I went to my mother when I wanted any thing, not being able to work—my mother paid for my lodging—I lived in Vine-court before that—I had been there two months, I believe—I know it was more than a month—I did not work as a harness-maker there—my mother paid for my lodging at times—I could not pay it at all—if I could not pay one week, I might stop till the next, and then pay—I was in Orchard-street before I was in Vine-street—I might be there twelve months for what I know—I will swear that it was more than three months—I did not carry on business as a harness-maker there—I did no<lb/>thing—my mother paid for my lodging there—I went from one place to another, because I could not pay any more rent—that was the only reason I had—I did not pay myself at all—I was in Union-court before I was in Orchard-street, about three months from this time, I believe, it may be rather more—I have been confined in Kingston-gaol, to appear against the prisoners—it is since I was in Union-court, that I was in Orchard-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it was about twelve months ago you were in Orchard-street, and that is since you were in Union-court, which answer is true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last one may be true—I do not know that I was in Orchard-street twelve or six months—I did not keep a memorandum of the time—I was too ill to do any thing in cither of the places—I was too ill to more about—I got up—I could not keep my bed, because I had no support—my mother pays my lodging, because I could get no work—I was in Union-court some time—I might have been there twelve months—I cannot ex<lb/>actly say, it might have been six months or seven months—I will swear it was six months—I sometimes worked there as a harness-maker—I was not too ill to work in Union-court—I worked in New Tothill-street as a harness-maker, while living in Union-court—some days I was better and some days worse—I was not ill the whole time—I believe I said I did not work there because I was too ill, that is true—I did not work the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240195"/>
               <p>whole of the time, I am certain—I worked a little of the time, not in the court, but in Tothill-street—one day one week, and I believe two days another—I worked for Herbert, who lives in Tothill-strett, he is a harness-maker—I worked for him only a day, or three days, I believe, while I was in Union-court—I was in Monmouth-street before I was in Union-court—I paid for my lodging myself there—I believe I was six months there—I am not exactly sure of the exact time—I will swear I was there four months—I was in work there, at harness-making for my<lb/>self for four months, I believe—I cannot exactly say in what months it was—it was not in this year—I do not know whether it was in the winter or summer time—I have named all the places I lived at within the last twelve months—I was pot-boy at the Two Sawyers public-house, Lam<lb/>beth, for sixteen months—I worked as a harness-maker longer than at the public-house—I worked for myself as a harness-maker, in Crown-street—that was before I went to the public-house—I was at work three months at a Mr. McKenzie's, as a book-binder, and I lived at a green-grocer's shop, in King-street—I think that was four years ago—I think I was at work for myself before that, as a harness-maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you mentioned all the places you have lived at for the last two years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have—I have never been in trouble—I am quite sure of that—I was never in the House of Correction, nor in any prison, except for this case; and about ten minutes at Queen-square, for a fine which I paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the night in question, you, say no purpose was mentioned for your going to Richmond, except Gray saying it was to see his friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to get a little money of them—I am sure he said that—I am quite sure no other purpose was mentioned—I never said I went for the purpose of breaking open Mr. Long's house—the second wall is about six feet from the first one—when I found, instead of lying down, (as they said,) went over the wall, I thought something mysterious, and I stop<lb/>ped there to see the end of it—I had not the slightest notion of what they were about, or I would not have gone with them—I walked all the way with them—I merely went to accompany them—I had no object at all—when they went to the green where they were to see their friends, they were tired, and talked of lying down—that did not excite my sus<lb/>picion—I wanted to go home—they did go to see their friends, as I under<lb/>stood—they parted with me for half an hour, and when they came back, they went to Mr. Long's house—I did not think it right to lie down in a field so late—when they went to the wall, I thought it wrong—they told me to stop on the wall, and watch to see if any body came, but instead of that, I watched them—I had no idea of breaking open a house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not when you saw the light in the apartment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I told the policeman I saw a light in the apartment—the tea was in Gray's hat—I told the policeman so next night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my property, in the Vauxhall-road, Pimlico. On the night of the 22nd of August, I was returning from Blackheath to my residence—I got to New-cross about a quarter or ten minutes to ten o'clock—I had drank more than I should have done—when I got near New-cross, I found myself Very ill in the stomach, and sat down on the bank by the side of the road—I found my watch was gone, and my chain, and six gold seals—afterwards I got up from there, and walked on; and met a policeman, named Redwood, whose father I had known very well—I told him of it—I had discovered I had lost my watch, before I met him—I discovered that before ten o'clock—I felt it safe about the turnpike gate, on this side of Deptford—I do not think the bank it above one hundred yards from the turnpike-gate—I felt in my pocket, and found the guard-chain, which was round my neck under my waistcoat, was broken, and the watch gone—I had not felt any body tugging at my watch—I was either knocked down, or pushed down fin the road, I think—I did not feel any body near me—I felt a knock or push when I got up from the bank—it was after that that I found my chain broken—a man pushed me down—that is the person standing there, (the prisoner)—I gave a description of him—it was after that man knocked or pushed me down, that I missed my watch—after that I met the policeman, and told him some<lb/>thing—to the best of my recollection, it was the prisoner—I did not know whether I was pushed or knocked down, but the more I have looked at the prisoner these three or four days, I am the more convinced—I got into a hackney coach, and went home without speaking that night—when the witness looked for me that night, I was gone off in the coach—I did not see the prisoner before that night—I have no recollection of drinking with him—he was shown to me the morning after the robbery, and I swore he was the man who was ill using me that night; and I asked him what he had done with my watch and seals—he said he had never seen them—I do not recollect feeling any thing done to my watch or watch chain, at the time I was pushed or knocked down—my watch was in my fob, and the guard was round my neck—that was broken, and I look upon it it was broken with a pair of pinchers—it was a very strong one—I put it under my waistcoat—it was made of strong steel—I do not know what parish the place is in where I received the push—I believe they call it St. Paul's, Deptford—it is in Surrey—I had six gold seals to my watch, and a steel chain—the watch was a silver hunter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's servant. On the 22nd of August I was in the service of Mr. Halden, at New Cross, near the turnpike—on that night I was coming out of my master's gate, about ten minutes before ten o'clock—I saw two men up against a high wall on the opposite side of the road—I think the road is about twenty yards wide—they were both close together, and did not move on—they were standing up—during the time they were standing against the wall a cart or waggon went by—I did not take particular notice which—after that went by, the young man's hat fell off—one was an old man, and the other a young man—the young man had his back towards me, and he had the old gentleman against the wall for about two minutes—they were standing still, only the young man had his arms round him somewhere about his middle, as I thought—after they had been there about two minutes, or two minutes and a half, the young man's hat went off, and he left go of the old gentleman, and walked away—the footpath is <hi rend="italic">feather-edged</hi> off, and the old gentleman walked away about fifteen yards into the road—the young man then felt on the footpath, as if he was feeling for something—he also grappled in the grass on each side the footpath, both by the wall and the other side—he then picked up his hat, and ran after the old gentleman, who had got about fifteen yards down in the middle of the road—he laid hold of him, and flung him down on his back—he had him there about a minute and a half in the middle of the high road—the old gentleman's hat fell off about five yards from him—I was standing at the end of the lane—I had not gone on—I stood my ground—I did not stir a foot—it was fifteen yards from where I stood to where the young man threw the old man down—the young man left the old man down in the road—the old man had gone rather farther down the road—I do not think I was more than fifteen yards off when I saw him thrown down in the road—it was the width of the road—the young man left him, and ran towards me—I was standing at the end of the lane—I could not see his face, but I took the <hi rend="italic">dimensions</hi> of his height and his dress while he ran up towards me—I saw he had on a dark coat, a dark waistcoat, and dark trowsers, and he had on a very narrow-brimmed hat—he passed by me—he was running, but not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240199"/>
               <p>very quick—a slow run—he went by me down Newcross-lane, the lane leading to Mr. Hardcastle's—it leads down—it is a kind of back carriage way down to Mr. Hardcastle's house, and it leads down to a pathway—it is a narrow cut for foot-passengers—it leads also to a footway either going to the Five Bells, or you can turn to the right—I lost sight of him for about two minutes—I ran to the old gentleman, and asked him what the man had done <hi rend="italic">at</hi> him—the gentleman said something, and I immediately ran after the man down the lane—I could see nobody going down the lane—I ran half way down, and thought he had jumped over some palings into a field—I ran back again to the old gentleman, and said, "Has he robbed you of any thing else?"—he said, "I don't know at present;" and while I was speaking to him, I saw a man come from over the field, which was twenty or twenty-five yards off, up the road, over a kind of bank, not a hedge—the man who ran down the lane could very well have returned and come over that bank—I did not see him come over the top of the bank, but I saw him run from the bank into the middle of the high road, across the footpath—I did not see him come over the bank—he came from the bank—he came into the road with his hands under his coat flap, and walked coolly down to the old gentleman and me—I was not making any words, or talking—he said, "What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was the young man with his hands under his coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The pri<lb/>soner—I said, "This gentleman has just been robbed of his watch"—he said, "Oh, that be d—d, nothing of the kind"—I then said, "He has, for I saw it all"—I said "I will have nothing to do with it," and I bade them good night—I ran up towards Croydon canal bridge to see for a policeman—I did not see any, and I returned back again—I did not see either the pri<lb/>soner or the prosecutor—they were gone—I saw the prisoner again about a quarter of an hour after, below the Newcross turnpike-gate, opposite Mr. Hardcastle's gate nearly—it leads up to what I call the front coach-road, further down from London—he was by himself walking along the road—I did not give him in charge—I told the policeman, when I saw him coming down Mr. Hardcastle's coach-road, what had happened—I gave a descrip<lb/>tion of it to the policeman, Ledger, of the R division, and he took him in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You observed the height, figure, and dress of the man; what is your belief as to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is the same man by dress that passed me at the end of the lane from the old man, and came up again—he has the same dress, and is the same height, as near as I can guess, but I did not see the young man's face—it might be another man in the same dress—I cannot say.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240200"/>
               <p>I had the front door in my hand, and he came and gave me a push out; not because I was drunk, but because I smiled in his face—I was examined before the magistrate—the young man appeared to be feeling for something, and was grappling the grass at the side—I stated that before the magistrate, and about his picking up his hat—I am certain I said the old man was fif<lb/>teen yards down in the middle of the road when the young man overtook him, and that he laid hold of him, and flung him down on his back—the young man had the old man against the wall for about two minutes and a half—I said so before the magistrate, and that he took hold of him round the waist—that the old gentleman's hat flew off five yards from him—that I took the dimensions of his height—that he went away past me at a slow run—that when he asked what was the matter, I said the old gentleman had been robbed; and he replied, "That be d—d," &amp;c.—that he came up, with his hands behind him, as if nothing was the matter: and that I said I would have nothing to do with it.</p>

This horse was turned out about five miles from our house, on the 19th—I had information that it was lost—I had seen it at Mr. Butt's meadow about ten days before, at Willy, near Farnham—I had taken it there to grass—it had been there three months—I saw it be<lb/>fore the Magistrate on Monday, the 27th, in possession of the ostler—I have had it in my care ever since—it is the horse I lost—it is worth £30—I found it at Barnes—Chant, the constable, had it put in a stable there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass-founder, and live at No. 44, Maze, Tooley-street. I saw the latter part of the transaction—Mary Hurley was in the act of stamping her feet on the chest of the deceased, John Cole, when I came up—that was with violence—he was lying on his back on the ground at the time, in no situation to resist—there did not appear any life in him, merely a noise in his throat at the time—I begged of him to keep his head up—he was taken to Dr. Walker's—I assisted myself to carry him part of the way—I did not know him before—he was afterwards taken to the hospital by the advice of Dr. Walker—he did not appear to me to have any sort of life remaining in him—I did not observe any wounds on him—it was morally impossible to get near him—he had no jacket on—his other clothes appeared to be a sailor's dress—all the per<lb/>sons about him were acting against him—he did not appear to me to have any friend to protect him—I merely came out of my house on hearing the cry of "Murder"—It was twenty or thirty yards from where he was knocked down—I did not see him at the hospital or before the coroner—I did not know him previously.</p>

               <p>accosted him as John Cole; and he answered to that name—Captain Codd did not go to the hospital with me, but he told me he had visited him there; but I visited him at the hospital, and called him John Cole, and he answered me by that name—nobody in my presence spoke to him by that name—I afterwards saw him a corpse—his body was present before the Coroner—he was taken to the hospital on Sunday evening, left the hospital on Wednesday morning, and died on board the vessel about three o'clock next afternoon—I did not go on board the vessel, but Kinsey did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student of Guy's hospital. On Sunday evening, the 10th of August, I recollect the man being brought to the hospital—I do not remember hearing him accosted by any name—I think his shipmates brought him in—I did not see Collins—I do not think I had any other case of a like description on the 10th of August—I do not recollect how he was dressed—he was in a state of insensibility, and had the marks of a blow over his right eye—that was all we observed in him outwardly—he appeared to be a strong hearty man—he appeared at the time labouring under the effects of intoxication, though I thought some blows which he had had might cause part of the effect—I saw him the following morning—he was sensible enough to answer questions, but seemed very much inclined to sleep—he complained of pain in his head, and on the Sunday evening, and during the night, he was sick—I did not see any thing he vomited—he was bled on the Monday, and his head was relieved by the bleeding—he left the hospital on Wednesday morning without permission—he asked if he might leave the day before, and was told not to leave—I saw him dead next day, and examined the stale of his skull—it was not fractured at all—there was a great clot of blood at the base of the brain, and the brain itself had a greater quantity of blood than was natural—there was sufficient coagulated blood on the brain to cause his death—it appeared to arise from the rupture of some vessel; in the scalp there was rather an extensive bruise, and extravasation of blood—I think the blow which caused that was very likely the cause of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240206"/>
               <p>the extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—I think if he was struck, and trampled on, and knocked down, his head coming in contact with the ground, and his receiving other blows, would account for the appearance I found internally—I have heard the witnesses' evidence—I do not remember hearing them mention any blows on the head, but there was the appearance of a blow on the head—I think the circumstance of his having a blow on the head would alone account for the appearances—I think the state of the clotted blood quite sufficient to cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been a medical student long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six years—this is the third winter I have been at Guy's—I have a guest, many cases of accidents brought in there—I am not quite certain this was the only case brought in on the evening in question—there might have been others brought in—he was not bloody when he was brought in; that I swear—I saw no wounds except the one on the right eye—the bleeding he received on Monday was by the lancet—it was not fit that he should leave the hospital—we told him not to leave, but he felt himself well enough to leave—we should not have permitted him to leave, if we had had our own will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you heard of his leaving the hospital, drinking rum, and exposing himself to the night air, would not such conduct have been sufficient to pro<lb/>duce death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, unless he had received some injury before—my opinion is formed from the blood on the brain at the post mortem ex<lb/>amination—I think most likely he would not have recovered if he had not left the hospital—I cannot be positive of that—his exposing himself to the night air, and drinking rum, would not be sufficient to kill him unless he had received some previous injury—he died of apoplexy, but I believe it to be occasioned by the blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, from the appearance the head exhibited, and hearing the account the witnesses have given, have you reason to be<lb/>lieve his death was caused by the application of external force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I be<lb/>lieve so—heaviness and stupor are the consequences of force, causing coa<lb/>gulation of blood; and a blow on the brain, without extravasation, might cause it—concussion would also produce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a student of Guy's hospital at the time in question. I saw the deceased on the Sunday evening—I believe him to be the same person as I saw dead before the Coroner, but I could not swear to his person—he was in bed when I was called to him—he appeared labouring under the influence of liquor when I visited him—he vomited fluid which smelt of porter—sickness is one of the symptoms of concussion, but I smelt porterin what he vomited, but a man drinking moderately would void the contents of his stomach—I conceived he had been intoxicated—he had symptoms of stupor—he could speak and answer questions incohe<lb/>rently, as far as I can recollect, but I go principally from what he vomited—I cannot say what quantity of liquor he vomited—he vomited frequently during the night—I did not see all he vomited—I bled him at four o'clock—he expressed himself considerably relieved—I believe the causes spoken to by the witnesses sufficient to produce the appearances I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe death was attributable to the application of external force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is more than I can assert—it possibly could have arisen from common causes—if he had diseased arteries, this clot may have been formed—I believe the man died from the injury received, but it is possible it might be from natural causes—I have no reason to suppose so—I observed a wound under the scalp—I might have covered it with half-a-crown—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240207"/>
               <p>were no corresponding appearances internally with that external wound—there was no coagulated blood immediately under the wound—there was a a lot the base of the brain—I should expect to find the clot of blood there—I should expect to find blood on the base of the brain if there was a blow on the vertical part of the head—that is the most common, but not the invariable consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The person of the individual you saw at the hospital, and the body you subsequently examined, you cannot swear to be the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear to it—I believe him to be the same—I did not distinguish his features when I saw him in bed—I believe him to be the same man—I certainly should not swear to him—I did not notice his features—the symptoms arising from intoxication and from concussion are very much alike—it is very difficult to distinguish—it was doubtful, when he was admitted, whether he was labouring under symptoms of intoxication or concussion—he could not have been on Sun<lb/>day in the state which I found him in on the post mortem examination on board ship—I conceive the treatment he received at the hospital might enable him to walk about a day or two afterwards—the exertion of walking from the hospital to the ship might bring on hemorrhage, and produce death—the exertion of leaving the hospital, accompanied with the previous symptoms, might have been the cause which produced his death—he had symptoms both of concussion and drunkenness when he came to the hospi<lb/>tal—the clot of extravasated blood on the base of the brain was the imme<lb/>diate cause of death—I conceive that was from the rupture of a vessel or vessels—I conceive the wounds were kept down by our treatment, bleed<lb/>ing and purging—I think he would have had a very fair chance of recovery if he had remained in the hospital—if he had drank to excess, and had a violent fall or shake after leaving the hospital, it might produce rupture of vessels—I did not take any accurate examination of the external injury when I saw him on the Sunday—we were not aware of the blow we found till we removed the scalp—I do not recollect the blow over the eye at all myself—I saw no blow whatever in the hospital, nor the appearance of any, that I recollect—he did not complain of any thing except the head—he was not then labouring under symptoms of frac<lb/>ture—I did not conceive it necessary to examine his head—I treated him, the night he came in, as a drunken man; and, on the Monday, I treated him as a man labouring under a very severe headache, as I sup<lb/>posed, arising from a slight concussion of the brain—it is extremely difficult to distinguish between drunkenness and concussion—I had no reason to suppose he was mortally injured on the Sunday—I cannot undertake to say that he was mortally injured when I saw him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he received the blow you discovered, on removing the scalp, are you of opinion that it caused the coagulated blood, on the base of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive so; if it was sufficiently severe, it would produce that consequence—it was not a severe one—I found the blood in the place I should naturally expect to find it, if a blow was inflicted on the vertical part of the brain—it is not usual to find the blood exactly under the place injured, unless it is fractured—it is sometimes on the op<lb/>posite side, sometimes at other places, but not immediately contiguous.</p>

               <p>of his men was very ill—he was dead when I went on board—his body was before the Coroner afterwards—I made no examination of it—I was exa<lb/>mined at the inquest—assuming the facts to be true that the witnesses have deposed to, I certainly am not of opinion they were calculated to produce the appearances described—a blow on the vertical part of the head is not likely to produce extravasation of blood on the base of the skull, not from what I heard on board the ship—his death might or might not be from drunkenness—if the man was knocked down, I certainly should attri<lb/>bute the blows he received to external injury—I had heard he had been drinking three or four days previous to this happening.</p>

On the 5th of September, at a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw a waggon, with four horses, at length proceeding from Black-friars'-bridge—the driver was by the next horse to the shaft-horse, com<lb/>monly called the body horse—he was on the left hand side of the road, and the horse was at the right-hand side of him—I was about five yards behind the waggon on the carriage road—I saw a string of five horses coming after the waggon—there was a rider on the near side horse of the string, which was the foremost of the five horses—the deceased was about fifteen feet from the curb, and about a yard from the horses—the prisoner was riding the foremost of the five horses—this happened opposite a coach stand—we were all on the left of the coach stand—the prisoner came along-side with the string of horses, between the deceased and the footway—thinking there was not room between the waggon and the coaches or cabs, the prisoner, unfortunately for the deceased, came on the near side—there was not room between the waggon, and the hackney coach-stand, for the string of horses to go—I should consider there was about fourteen feet between the coach stand and the waggon—there was fifteen feet on the other side, for I measured it—there was as much room on one side of the waggon as the other, within a foot—the curb was fifteen feet from the near side of the waggon, where the deceased was killed, and fourteen from the other—I heard no words take place—I was about five yards behind the waggon—the prisoner came quietly along, riding on the horse—they were walking at a slow rate—owing to the waggoner holding his whip up, after the horses had escaped the waggon, the horse made a quicker step, touched the deceased, and he fell down—I believe it was a pure accident—the deceased had a whip over his right shoulder—the five horses coming by the wheel of the waggon, seeing the whip in his hand, plunged against the deceased, knocked him down, and he died, as the waggon wheels went over him—he did not die till the wheels went over him—it was about it quarter before seven o'clock in the evening—it was daylight—the waggon had about four tons of coals in it—the deceased was in my sight at the mo<lb/>ment he was thrown down—I saw him fall, and I believe it was purely accidental—I never saw the prisoner before—I was in company with the deceased—he had drawn a load of coals to my house that day, and these were going there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker. I was standing at the end of Charles-street, Blackfriars-road—I observed the waggon coming towards me, with four horses, one behind the other—the waggoner was on the right side of his horses; on the near side to the pavement—I am sure he was on the proper side; his left side was towards the pavement, and his right to the horses—he was on the left hand side of the horses—he appeared to be nearest to the second horse from the shaft—the horses were walking—I saw a string of horses come up—I consider there was from fourteen to fifteen feet between the waggon and the pavement—the horses came inside the man, between the footway and the waggon—the five horses were not exactly abreast—I saw the horses passing by—a grey horse, as they passed by, touched the deceased, which caused him to fall—I am not aware which of the five horses it was—I immediately ran and stopped the waggon horses, but not in sufficient time, as both wheels went over the man—he was quite dead immediately—I rather think the horse that threw him down shyed, being the near horse to the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Vauxhall. On the 21st of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house—there were persons there—a party at cards was made up—we played at Whist—the prisoner was one—I was one, and there were two other persons played—the cards were dealt, and they wished me to go and fetch the pot of ale for which we were playing—I do not know who asked me to go, but I left my cards on the table, and when I came back the prisoner proposed a bet—he said he had a very excellent hand, and he thought he should win the odd trick—he said, "I will bet I do it"—he looked at me—I said I should not bet—he said he would bet 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a reason why I did not bet—I told him I should not bet—he then proposed it again, still moving his cards about—I said, a third time, I would not bet—he then said I had no money—I told him I had, but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240223"/>
               <p>did not think proper to bet—he again said, "You have no money, I am sure"—I then produced a bag, in which I had game money, which I took out of my left hand trowsers pocket, and put it on the table—there was a £5 note in it, and sixteen or seventeen sovereigns—I am sure there were sixteen—the prisoner instantly took the bag and said, "I shall retain this till we play the game out, and see whether you win the odd trick or not"—I said I should do no such thing—I put down my cards, and refused to play the game—the prisoner got up and went to the door, taking the money with him—he went out—I had not given him any permission to take up my money, to retain it, or to go out with it—he went out at the side door—I thought he had gone out for a necessary purpose; but he was gone, and the rest of the party immediately followed him—I saw him again in the Strand on the 30th of October, and gave him into custody—I had seen him twice before, but had no acquaintance with him—we had some conversation—I was looking for him when I met him in the Strand—he was taken before the Magistrate, and bailed after three examinations—I have never got my money since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you kept your beer-shop in Vauxhall-road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four years, and upwards—I play at cards at times, but very seldom—many weeks elapse when I do not see a card—we have other amusements when we do not play at cards—we play at quoits and knock-em-down—we play for love, or a pot of beer, or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we generally play so—always—never for more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever play at quoits for any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have done so, for more than a shilling or two—on one occasion we played for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not at the beer-shop—I was one who played—I won half of the money—I cannot say how long it is ago—about two months, I think—we played at Clapham—the persons we won the money of, were Magnus, a butler, and Buxton, who, I believe, lives on some property—he is not a friend of mine; not at all—I know but little of him—I have known him three or four months—it may be five, not six—I can well swear it, is not twelve months—I never knew he was in the police—I heard he was one of the Union-hall officers—I never heard he was tried for felony—before I kept this beer-shop, I was a publican for three years—I kept the Red Lion, at Lambeth—this game of whist was played in my tap-room—there were only the four persons present who played at it—when the prisoner came in, there were several persons present; but my time expired at ten o'clock, and others left—I had no appointment with the prisoner to come there that afternoon, to play at quoits; none whatever—I do not know John Cotton—I know this person, (<hi rend="italic">a witness</hi>,) but I understood his name was Colton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you never, in presence of Cotton, appoint the prisoner to come to your house that evening, to play quoits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; but I dare say I can explain it—Ryland came to my house a few days before this, and had several pints of ale with a person at the bar—he then addressed himself to me, and said, was not I a quoits player?—I said I could play, but I was not the best player—he said there was a person at Chelsea, whom he knew, who was anxious to back a man he had against any other, for any sum of money; and if I thought I could play sufficiently, he would get the match for me—I told him I had no objection to see the parties, and if I thought I was able to compete with him, I would play—he told me he would see him that night, and mention it to make an appointment to meet me; and the same afternoon, I received a note from Ryland, (but I have not got it here,) wishing me to meet him at the General Hill, at Chelsea—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240224"/>
               <p>I went and saw Ryland—he said he had seen his friend, and he had pro<lb/>mised to be there, and he was agreeable to put down 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to make the match—we waited about two hours, and his friend did not come—he ex<lb/>pressed his sorrow, and told me he would see him again, and come to my place on the following Sunday or Monday morning, and let me know what he said—he did not come on either of those days, but he came on the Tuesday evening, the 21st, and said his friend had given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make the match with me, and if I did not think that sufficient, I was to meet him at the Spotted Dog, in the Strand, at nine o'clock, and there the money would be made up to any sum I pleased—I wished to know on what particulars the match was to be made, and he pretended to find a paper, (but could not,) stating the terms which his friend had written down—the prisoner is a Chelsea carrier, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell the Jury, just now, that you seldom play, and then only for a shilling or a pot of beer, when you went to find a stranger to get him to play? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did so, from what the prisoner said—when I play, it depends on chance whether I win or lose—I won the man's 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and kept it—the money had been deposited—when I played at whist with the prisoner, the money had not been deposited—I never said it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you never directed your attorney to apply for the restoration of a sum of money deposited in his hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to my solicitor, and he asked in what manner I should wish it to proceed—I said, as quietly as possible—I did not wish to make any <hi rend="italic">oration</hi> about it—I wanted my money—I did not direct my attorney to apply to him for a sum of money deposited in his hands—I heard his clerk had written—it was on the 21st I lost this money, and I went to the attorney the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did Mr. Humphreys know where to find him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not know—he wished me to make inquiries—I understood his cart came to the Spotted Dog in the Strand—I went there and got the address, and then I went to Mr. Humphreys directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, on the 22nd of October, you knew that he lived at No. 1, Cheyne-row, Chelsea, why did you not go to the cart and take him di<lb/>rectly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not drive the cart, for I watched for several days after Mr. Humphreys showed me his answer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sir, In answer to your application to me, of the 23rd, I beg to inform you, as a solicitor, I had no money, as stated by you, deposited in my hands by Mr. C. Ireland. I have been advised to answer your letter, and inform you of the same, as whatever inconvenience I may be put to in consequence, all parties con<lb/>cerned shall have due notice previous to their illegal proceeding, as threat<lb/>ened by you;—further, if it is the intention of you to proceed, after this no<lb/>tice, (if by bailable process,) my solicitor will give an undertaking to your officer, if you will inform me his name, or will receive any process for me, which will prevent your sending so far.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you apprehend him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I believe it was on the 30th of October—I cannot say when I spoke to the police about it—I spoke to two or three—I took him on the 30th, a little before he got to the Spotted Dog.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did not you before the Magistrate state, in the pretence of Mr. Wontner, that you gave no information to any officer, till after you had taken the man into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that I did—I do not believe I did—I should expect that if I had been asked the question, I should have said I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you state in the presence of Mr. Wontner, and on his cross-examination</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240225"/>
               <p>of you, that you went for no warrant to have him apprehended because you did not know where to find him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he ask you how it was, if you did not intend, nor make any bet, that you put your money on the table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not make any bet with this man—I put the money on the table to show I had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to state that you (under all the circumstances that you have now explained) was induced to put the money merely to satisfy an almost entire stranger that you had got money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was my motive—that was the first game we played—we did not play it out—I did not play twenty games afterwards with him—decidedly not—I did not bet ten to one on the odd trick—I did not lose any money after I had lost the bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first before the Magistrate, did you state that the prisoner went out of the house alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went out frequently—he went out alone—I found Grinham was coming to give evidence—I had him taken by the Magistrate's direction—Mr. Minshull was the Magistrate—I did not state, when Grinham was before the Magistrate, that he and the prisoner went away together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you did not, at the first examination, state that the prisoner went away alone, and afterwards say that he and Grinham went away together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not—I do not believe I could say it, I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the Magistrate and his clerk both fern to your de<lb/>position, and tell you that you had sworn that the prisoner went away alone, and discharge Grinham instantly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They discharged him be<lb/>cause none of the money was found on him—there was some remark made by one of them—he was not discharged because I at first swore that the prisoner went away alone, and afterwards that Grinham went him—I have seen Grinham about—he was one who was playing at whist, and Shillitoe was the other—I did not have Grinham taken up to prevent his coming forward—I have known him four or five yean—he was not a very intimate acquaintance, but was frequently calling in—I did not lend Grin<lb/>ham money to play, that I will swear—I did not lend him any money that night, that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you did not lend him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not lend him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any money whatever—he had no money of mine at til that night, to my knowledge—I do not think I could lend him any money, and have forgotten it—I swear positively I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask the prisoner whether he would bet twenty to one upon the odd trick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not ask him alter that if he would bet ten to one—I did not tell him he was no sporting man—it was between ten and eleven o'clock when I lost my money—I did not con<lb/>tinue to play till between one and two o'clock—I did not play for stakes varying from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was Mr. Humphreys to suppose that this money had been deposited by you in the prisoner's hands, if you had not told him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was not at home—his son was—this letter is not stating what I told him—I did not tell Mr.. Humphreys, Senr., that his son had written the letter according to my direction—I did not know whether it was his son or his clerk—I said the letter was according to my di<lb/>rection, but I never said the money was deposited—it was laid on the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Wontner read this note of Mr. Humphreys, describing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240226"/>
               <p>the mode in which the money was deposited, before the Magistrate, to you, and did not you state it had been written in those terms by your direc<lb/>tion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was to that effect, that it had been written by my orders. I did not state the terms were by my direction—I did not dictate the letter—I did not tell the Magistrate it had been written in these terms by my direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that the prisoner went out of the room, as you sup<lb/>posed, for a necessary purpose, but before he went, he said he should keep this till the game was played out—I suppose you did not ask him what he was going out for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I went out in a minute or two after<lb/>wards—I found at the Spotted Dog, that he lived in Cheyne-row—I did not go to his house—I thought I should not be able to find him—I was at a loss how to proceed—I have not seen Buxton here to-day—I did not employ him at all in this transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that the cards were dealt—that you left yours on the table, and went to get a pot of ale—upon your oath, when you were before the Magistrate did you state that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—I do not know—if I had been asked the question I should—I believe my cards had been improperly dealt with while I was out—I do not know whether I said a word about that before the Magistrate—I should expect I did, for I stated every particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the first occasion before the Magistrate, did you say a single syllable about your having been playing at any game whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider that I must—I explained how the thing occurred—I will swear I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, upon the second examination, did not Mr. Min<lb/>shull complain of your having omitted to state any thing about the game till you came to the second examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard any com<lb/>plaint.</p>
