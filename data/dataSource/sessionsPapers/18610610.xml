On Friday afternoon, 3d May, I was on the canal near Staines-moor, Ballasting for mud—James Wicks was with me—whilst there I saw the two prisoners upon the London and South Western Railway—they kept dodging about round the railway-bridge—I thought they were up to no good, and watched them, and as a train was approaching just before 3 o'clock I saw one of them throw a piece of wood on to the rail—this is the piece <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it was the biggest one (<hi rend="italic">Tilley</hi>) who threw it—I could not get out of my Boat at the moment, or I should have tried to go and take the wood off the rail—the train came on at a great pace—I beckoned to the driver, but he had no time to stop the train, or do anything; he could not have done it—I got out of my Boat, and went after them, and the Boys ran away—I knew it was no use running after them, so t watched them—they went to the next bridge, further down the line, and I went after them again—as soon as they saw me coming they got up, and ran away again—I saw a young man coming along with a horse and cart, and he caught Tilley—I went with him to the station—I am sure the prisoners are the two Boys—I was about a hundred yards from them at the time this was done—I had seen them for about seven or eight minutes before they did it, or it might have been ten.</p>

                  </hi>. On the afternoon of 3d May I was with Wooden—I saw Tilley standing behind the cattle Bridge on Staines-moor—when the train came up I saw him step out and stand by the side of the metals, and when the train came within about two hundred yards of him he stepped back behind the Bridge, and I saw the piece of wood now produced thrown across the metals—Wooden got out of the Boat, and went after him—I saw both the prisoners, but I did not see the little one till they ran away from behind the Bridge—I could not speak to him—I am certain they are the Boys I saw run from the Bridge, but I did not see Peat till they ran away.</p>

On 3d May, about half-past 4 o'clock, I was on duty at Staines police-station—Tilley was brought there by Wooden—I searched him, and found upon him this knife—it has a saw to it—I have compared it with the stick from which this wood was cut, and in my opinion it was cut by that saw—it forms a paling running along the side of the railway—it appeared to be fresh done—it was quite close to the Bridge.</p>

I am now residing with my father at 1, Brunswick-street, Hackney-road—I was fifteen years old on 27th of last March—I remember going to the Garrick Theatre last Whitsun Tuesday by permission of my father—I left the Garrick Theatre about half-past 11—I saw the prisoner, about twenty minutes to 12—I was then with a young man who had taken me to the theatre—I asked him whether he would excuse me for a few minutes—the prisoner was not capable of hearing what I said to my friend—I then left him, went to the prisoner, and went home with him to 7, Hatfield-street—he is a married man, and has two children—I remained with the prisoner a fortnight—during that time we were living as man and wife—his wife was not living at Hatfield-street then—after that time I went home to my parents—my father met with me, and took me home—I afterwards went back to the prisoner, and my father took me home again—I had not met the prisoner by arrangement—he had asked me to live with him before I went with him that night.</p>

I am a carpenter at Hackney—the last witness is my daughter; she was fifteen on the 27th of last March—up to the time of this occurrence she had lived with me and her mother—the prisoner was a visitor at my house—he used to bring his wife to my house—Both of them were visitors frequently—I gave my daughter permission to go with Mr. Holding to the Garrick Theatre—I never consented that she should go away with the prisoner—I have always forbidden it, and he knows it—I sat up for my daughter on the night she went with Mr. Holding till after 1 o'clock—I know a public-house which the prisoner was in the habit of frequenting—I used to frequent it myself at one time till the landlord left—I went to that public-house from day to day to find him, from the Wednesday up to the Saturday—I saw him every night, and he denied all knowledge of the child until I threatened to put it into the hands of the police; then he came round to my house on the Sunday afternoon, and told me that he had seen the party where she was residing, and had made arrangements for me to see her at half-past 8 on Sunday night, opposite St. Luke's Church; I went and saw her and took her home to my house, but she went off again when I left' the room a short time, and J never saw her again till the following Sunday, at a lodging—first I saw Culmer at the King John, and gave him in charge—the second time I found her she was at the prisoner's lodging in Hat field-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, T</hi> 7). I had a communication with the prosecutor, and in consequence of information he gave me I went on Wednesday, 8th May, about a mile and a half Below the Wagon and Horses, on the Uxbridge-road, in the parish of Hayes—I saw Hughes and Cook come along with a wagon loaded with hay—Cook was riding on the hind part of the load, and Hughes was driving the horses—I followed them to the Waggon and Horses—they pulled up nearly opposite the stable door, within about a yard or so—Cook then got off the load—Hughes and Cook then walked to Wright, the ostler, who was then in the road, about eight or nine paces off—they stood close by him, apparently in conversation, for two or three minutes—they then left him minding a horse and chaise, and they came back to the load of hay—Cook got up on the top—Hughes laid hold of the horse's head and put it a little towards the stable, in such a way that; the end of the load was close to the stable-door—Cook then put down one of the eight trusses that were on the load Behind, and Hughes took it into the stable—I was from fifteen to twenty yards off—Hughes then came out, laid hold of the horse's head, and drew it on three or four paces, and put it before the trough—I then came up—Cool had got off the load—I asked them why they left that truss of hay which they took into the stable—they both said that they had started with a load and had got a load then—I said, "You have left a truss in the stable, and you have started with more than a load, for there were eight trusses Behind, and now there are only seven"—they both said then that they had not taken any into the stable—I told Hughes that Cook had put it down, and that he had taken it in—he said that he had not—I then went into the stable, and found a truss of clover hay under the manger—it weighed fifty-six pounds—I brought it out and said, "I believe this to be the truss that you left"—they both said they knew nothing about it, and had left none—I told them I should take them into custody for stealing that truss of hay—I took them to the station—I then called Wright and asked him whether he knew what they had left it for—he said that he did not, in the presence of the two other prisoners—I asked the landlord if he knew what they left it for, and he said that he did not know; that the stables were in the occupation of the ostler, who had the full charge of them—I then took Cook and Hughes to the station, and then came back for Wright—I told him that I was come back to take him in custody for receiving two trusses of clover hay, yesterday evening, knowing it to be stolen, and to be careful what he said, as it was very likely I should have to</p>

               <p>make use of the words against him again—he said that he had had two, and they were in the stable—I said, "Who was that left By?"—he said, "The same parties that left the one to-night"—this was not in the presence of the other prisoners—they were locked up—Paine was with me when I took Wright—he came up just when I was bringing the first truss of hay out of the stable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample of the trusses of 8th May—these other two are samples of the other two trusses that I found in the stable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer and Baker, and live at South all—early in April, I bought a rick of clover-hay at a sale in Hayes parish—I employed the prisoner Hughes to Bind it—I did not employ Cook to drive it; he was in the service of Mr. Ford, my neighbour, and drove his cart—he was so employed for three or four days—in consequence of certain feelings in my mind, I gave information to Ravening—on Wednesday, the middle of the day, I directed him to watch—I saw him again at about half past 7 o'clock—he had Cook and Hughes with him then—Wright was not charged till late at night—some trusses of clover hay were brought with them at this time—the sergeant had charge of one, and there was a load on the cart also—the two other trusses were not brought till late at night—I did not count the load, but it was sent to one of my customers, and he found it all right—I looked and found that it was clover hay—the single truss corresponded with the bulk in the cart—it also corresponds precisely with the hay which. I bought early in April, in Hayes parish—About 10 o'clock in the evening I saw Wright, and desired him Be taken to the station—I then saw two more</p>

               <p>—on Thursday, 26th February, I went to Messrs. George Lee and Co.'s premises, and found the car cases of seven sheep—they were in the back premises, lying on the ground—they were in a very bad state—they were car cases of animals very much diseased, and totally unfit for human food—the whole seven weighed about 170 lbs. odd, together—these sheep would have weighed about six or seven stone each, in a proper state of health; that is about 56 lbs.—I did not institute further inquiry on the subject—I on demand the car cases at the time, and gave Mr. Lee a certificate of condemnation—I have not got that note—in my opinion the sheep had not been dead long; about two days perhaps—I have been a butcher—I was brought up to the trade—from the state of the meat when I saw it, the animals were decidedly diseased before they were killed, and that must have been quite apparent before they were sent off from the country.</p>

I am an inspector in Newgate-market—about half-past 8 o'clock, on the morning of 26th February, I saw these seven sheep; they were pointed out to me by Mr. Fisher—they were very wet, and sheep that had been ill from rottenness—I should imagine that they had been ill some months before they were killed—any one who knew sheep at all could tell that they were suffering from the rot, because they had wasted away so much—I was instructed to make inquiries about these sheep, and on 25th of April, I went down to Wimborne, and saw Mr. Clifton—I made inquiries from him—I had a summons with me—that is the summons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at the time I took that summons, down it was in blank as regards the name of the party.</p>

Baker and Son, of Newgate-market—he said, "Is there going to be any bother about that? I have had two bothers already about it"—I said, "Do you mean going to Highbridge and paying the railway charges?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said, "I have heard that you did not consign the carcase of the cow on your own account, and if you choose to give me an explanation concerning it you can: you are not obliged to do so"—he then stated that a man of the name of Boddy, a butcher, living at Biddenham had come to him, and after some conversation had asked him to Buy the cow, and had asked him thirty shillings for it, that he bid him twenty-five shillings and he had the cow—he said there was some arrangement between him and Boddy, that he (Cox) was to send the cow to market, and that whatever the cow made, he (Cox) should have a profit—he likewise stated that he himself had taken the hamper containing the cow to Highbridge station, and had got the porter at the railway to sign the forwarding ticket, and the porter did sign it for him.</p>

She said she had; and was going to meet him again that night, and he would buy her a new cap; and that he would not give me any more money. I saw Mrs. Clark and my husband go upstairs together, and come down, and I heard her say to my husband, that Charley could see that something was the matter with her.

                  </hi>. I was ledger-keeper in the Commercial Bank of London, at the Henrietta-street Branch—I have been at the ledgers nearly ten yean—the prisoner Durdin, was a ledger-keeper at the same Bank—there were five current account ledgers latterly—they were divided from A to C, from D to H, from I to M, from N to Sl, and from Sl Z—the ledger D to H was kept by Durdin—it contained the Balances of the current accounts of customers whose names begin with D, and ending with H—it contains their accounts altogether—I know Holcroft by sight, as a customer of the Bank—I have seen him there generally two or three times a day, and on those occasions, he nearly always spoke to Durdin, either a note, or by word of mouth—they generally talked in the first portion of the Bank, away from the cashiers' desks—I have very frequently seen Holcroft's wife come to the Bank—she generally had a letter for Durdin, or spoke to him—I was not near enough to hear what was said, and I should say the other clerks were not—when I have seen Holcroft there, I have put many questions to Durdin at different times, and he always evaded it—I did not put any direct questions to him, as to his connexion with Holcroft; but I used to call him his man of business, which he did not seem at all times to approve of—six of the clerks used to take it in turns to remain till 9 at night—I remember one Saturday when it was my turn to remain till 9—I am not quite certain whether it was the Saturday, or Saturday week previous to the discovery of the fraud; but think it was the Saturday previous—Durdin had not been to the Bank since the Thursday—he left on the Thursday, and sent for me on the following Saturday—he had been away from illness; an attack of paralysis, I believe—he sent a ca B for me while I was at the Bank, saying that he should very much like to see me—I got somebody to remain at the Bank for me—I knew one of the parties who used to stop at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186106100041"/>
               <p>the Bank for Durdin; but Mr. Beal, one of the senior ledger-keepers, was there, and he offered to remain for me—I went in the cab to Durdin's house at 7, or half-past 7, and found him in bed—he said that he merely wished to ask me how his portion of the work at the Bank was getting on—I thought it was only natural, as I presumed he felt an interest in the concern—I think he detained me full an hour—I made several attempts to leave; but he requested me not to hurry away—when I got back to the Bank, it was about half-past 7—if I had remained at the Bank, I should have bad access to Durdin's books—Durdin returned to the Bank to do duty, I think, on the following Wednesday—he worked at his calendars to see that the balances were correct—they would contain the balances from the different ledgers—he was decidedly very ill—he worked at his calendars for a day or two the Bank, and I offered to come and help him in the evening, as I did not like to see him getting so much behind—he said that he thought he should soon have them up by himself again, as he was only able to post—I considered his remark was very natural; and said, "I shall see how you get on"—I believe I spoke to him one Saturday, about coming to work at night, as he told me that Mr. Beadon had told him I was coming to help him with his work of a night, to make his work right—he said that he would not allow any one to touch his work for anything—I said, that I had told the men that I was coming in, and therefore I should come—he said, "Well, if you are coming, I shall stop, and I shall stop as long as you stop"—he pushed himself back in his chair, and said to the porter, "Here, help me to the desk; it seems as if I could not get on fast enough for them"—I left at 5, returned at 7, and found Durdin there at his old post—(about 5 o'clock was his average time to leave); he asked me to take the ledgers, and he would keep the calendar and go through it, and tell me which accounts were altered, as every account does not alter during the day; it is merely those who draw money out or pay money in—I took the ledger, and Durdin kept the calendar—we continued to work till about 9 o'clock, when Durdin appeared ill; he looked excited, and said that he should give up, and lock up his papers—I said that he could do as he pleased, the papers were of no value, and it would take me some time to get the particulars again—we were very busy, as we had lost one of our clerks—he locked up the papers—he left first; I then assisted the other ledger-keeper, and left between 9 and 10—I came next morning, Friday 15th, at my usual time, 9 o'clock—Durdin was not in the habit of coming before 11 or 12—I examined the calendar which Durdin had had the previous night; he had not locked it up, but merely the papers—I found that he had taken the amounts correctly into the other calendar which I re-cast, and found it differed 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the three calendars—there is not. one calendar to each ledger; two calendars contain two ledgers each, and the other but one—they are A to C, D to M, and N to Z—the D to M calendar was kept by Durdin, the balance of the three calendars would be posted up and the first calendar A to C would contain the balance of the three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this a calendar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; these are the dates of balances—we have not to write the names every day, they last three weeks; they last as many days as there are columns, eighteen days—these figures represent the balance of the A to B ledger, these the D to M, and these N to Z—this is his casting; it is 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. exactly—these are his figures these two rows, and these are the senior ledger-keeper's.</p>

               <p>merely the pounds, not the shillings and pence, and found that it had been mis-cast about 36,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance truly corresponded with the ledger, but it had been mis-cast—when I found that large deficiency I did not speak to the manager immediately, not during the morning—that same morning Durdin came to the bank; Holcroft came during the day and was asked into the back room to see Durdin—he remained with him alone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—after banking hours I left at my usual time, leaving Durdin there—I went to Mr. Chancey, the manager of the bank, that night, and communicated with him—I was afraid to communicate it to him during the day, fearing some serious consequences might arise—he and I returned to the bank and examined the books—we got there about 8 o'clock or a little after; we found Durdin there in his usual place with some books before him, his calendars, I believe—Mr. Chancey told him that he wished to speak to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you right, every night after the drawings out and payings in are put into the ledger, it is the duty of the ledger-clerk to put down in the calendar the actual balances as they appear in the ledger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; those that have altered—those that did not alter he would merely repeat—we turned them over by the papers; wherever there is any paper, we know it is the same, and that facilitates it; all those that do not alter we enter as the same—that is done after the last possible paying in or drawing out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186106100044"/>
               <p>rather speak in the absence of Mr. Slann, who then with drew; and on his withdrawal I believe he said, "I see by your face that there is something wrong, how much is it?"—he had a pencil in his hand, and he wrote on a small piece of paper the sum of 66, 992<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have it here; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was very much agitated and amazed when I saw that, and I did not know what to say for a moment or two—I then inquired how it was done, and he said, "It was done through Mr. Holcroft's account"—I asked him how it had been done, and he said it had been done by posting sums which had been received to some one else's account, to the account, not only of the owners of the sums, but Mr. Holcroft as well—I believe, but I am not certain, that he said he had operated through his own account as well—I am not quite certain whether he said that account was closed—he also informed me that Mr. Holcroft was not cognisant of the transaction in any sort or kind of way—very little more was said, and I left the bank—he told me he had some promissory notes of Mr. Holcroft's to the extent of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he thought they would be ultimately good—I believe he alleged that Holcroft's father or a relative died shortly before, and that, through him, he was likely to receive a certain sum of money—I think he said something to the effect that he hoped the Bank would make him a loan of the money, and take his promissory note, or some such proposition at that—he said he had house property to the amount of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which he promised to give me particulars—he asked what my intentions were—I said I could not tell; I might probably have said, "I shall feel it my duty to consult others"—I knew Holcroft by sight, and knew that he had an account at the bank.</p>

I am one of the directors of the Commercial Bank—Mark Hunter is one of the trustees—in consequence of information I received, I went to 9, Park Village East, Regent's-park, on a Saturday, and found Durdin there, in his bed-room—we were introduced by Mrs. Durdin—we found him in his armchair, very feeble, and rather overcome from seeing us—Mr. Wentworth, the other director, said, "Mr. Durdin, I presume you can imagine the object we have in coming to see you?"—he did not speak, but bowed assent—I then said, "Durdin, we have come to ascertain what you have done with the large amount of property you have taken from the bank, and what securities you hold at the present moment" he said that he had been engaged in building speculations; that he had taken sums from the bank to the amount of 66, 992<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him where these speculations had been carried on—he said in Westbourne-square, and some streets adjacent, the names of which he could not exactly re member—I asked him where the title deeds of the property were—he said they had been mortgaged for between 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were in the hands of his solicitor, but he would send me the particulars on the following day, Monday, and was willing to make all the amends he could, and give all the particulars—I asked him what further securities he had—he went to his cash-box and took out various papers, amongst which were six promissory notes signed by Holcroft, and fourteen cheques—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are they—twelve of the cheques have various sums of money introduced into the body of the cheque, but are without date—they are all signed James Hol<lb/>croft; all are undated, and two are entirely blank—I believe they amount to 885<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On 20th February, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I accompanied Mr. Chauncey to Durdin'a house—I found him in a chair in his bedroom—I found on him one of Holcroft's business cards, with some figures written on the back of it—I asked him what it related to—he said he could not tell me now—I asked him where he had seen Holcroft last—he said the previous morning, the 19th—I and Inspector Felton searched his house—I saw Felton find a large pocket-book in which there was a pass-book of Durden's with the Deposit Bank in the City, this cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a memorandum-Book with some papers relating to mining shared—next morning, the 21st, about 9 o'clock, I went to Hol<lb/>croft's residence; I found him there—I said, "Your name is Holcroft"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You were at the Commercial Bank?"—he said, Yes"—I said, "Will you allow me to have the pass-book and cheques?"—he took out a key and gave me them—I was in plain clothes—I opened the pass-Book, turned over the leaves, and referred to a sum of 1, 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 14th January, 1861, to his credit—I said, "There is some mistake in this entry, can you explain it?"—he said, "No, I cannot"—I said, "Would you be good enough to walk with me to the Commercial Bank, in Hen-rietta-street?"—he said, "Yes"—on getting there I saw Mr. Chauncey, the manager, and said to him, "This is Mr. Holcroft; probably he will explain to you the sum you mentioned to me last night"—Mr. Chauncey read from a piece of paper he had—he said, "Mr. Holcroft, you are charged with the sum of 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

I am one of the firm of Paul and Turner, accountants, of Coleman-street—I know Holcroft—he was introduced to me by a person named Ramsay—I went through his books; but never heard by that, or by his statement, of a creditor named Durdin—Holcroft told me that it was necessary to trace certain bills which had been discounted, and were in the hands of third parties—I asked him for the names of the holders; he said that they were in the hands of a particular friend of his, who held a high commercial position, and he had rather his name was not mentioned—I saw the creditors, and obtained their consent for the composition—I afterwards went to the clerk to Messrs. Lawrence and Plews, and paid the composition—the bills of which he was holder amounted to about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., among which was one for 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by Holcroft and Millard, on 29th October—I got that partially from Holcroft's statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier in the Henrietta-street branch of the Commercial Bank—I know both the prisoners—I have known Durdin twelve or thirteen years, ever since he has been in the bank—I have been in the habit of seeing Holcroft there, for some years—during October, November, and December last, he has come to get his pass-book himself three or four times a week—the Bank returns the cheques in the pocket in the usual way—these six promissory notes are in Holcroft's writing, and these fourteen cheques also—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ledger containing Holcroft's account in 1860 and 1861—it was opened on 1st October, 1860, with what is credited as "Cash, 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that entry is in Durdin's writing—it is carried over from the apparent balance of Holcroft and Co.—here is 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." entered on 1st October, and 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October, in Durdin's writing—all the entries on that page are Durdin's, and up to the 29th—on the debit side, I find 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 18th, and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th—they are in the same writing—all the debits are in Durdin's writing—I should say that this amount to the account of Holcroft and Co., from which the 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been brought forward as a credit, is in Durden's writing; but it is a little different—the credits entered from time to time for several pages appear to be in Durdin's writing—he was ledger-keeper, and would, in the ordinary course of business, be the keeper of that particular account—I have got the paying cash-book here, in which we keep an account of those customers who bring cheques to the bank—it is partially kept by me—they are cheques presented at the counter, and bills—the greater part of it is in my writing; I think nearly all—I find, from an entry in this book, that on 18th October, I cashed a cheque for 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by James Holcroft—I paid him in bank<lb/>notes; a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the number of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was 34,318—we have not the dates in this book, merely the numbers—I can get the dates by the waste-book—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was No. 16,126; the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 00,530; the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. No. 91,405; and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. No. 16,794—on 19th October, I also cashed a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Holcroft—I want another book for that this is it—the paying books are alternate days—I paid with a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 25,482, and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 57,836—on 29th October, I cashed a cheque, drawn by Holcroft, for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was paid short, with a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am one of the ledger-keepers of the Commercial Bank at the Henrietta-street Branch, and was so at the latter part of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the prisoner Durdin was ledger-keeper—it was his duty to keep the two ledgers from D to J or K at that period—those ledgers would contain the current accounts—Besides those he would keep the calendars; that would be the summary of the ledgers from D to K, corresponding with the ledgers—in February last, it was the practice of one of the clerks of the Bank to stay till 9 o'clock at night—there were six of us—I remember the Saturday night when it was my turn to stay—I am not quite sure whether that was the Saturday before the fraud was discovered; I think it was the Saturday week previous—at that time Durdin had been absent from illness for about two days or two days and a half—I think he left on the Thursday afternoon in the middle of the day—while I was at the Bank on that Saturday, Durdin sent a ca B for me, stating that he should very much like to see me—that was about half-past 6 or 7 o'clock—when 1 remained of a night I should, in the ordinary course, have access to the ledgers and calendars kept by Durdin, if I had liked to examine them—when the ca B was sent, I went to Durdin's house—he was in Bed—he merely put a few questions to me regarding the Business of the Bank; how we were getting on, and so forth—I should think I was there fully an hour—I wished to go two or three times, but he rather persuaded me to stop—it was about half-past 8 when I got back to the Bank—I had just time to finish my portion of the ledgers—on the Monday or Tuesday following, the prisoner was again absent—he came to the Bank about the middle of the day on Wednesday—he had then lost the use of his left side or very nearly so—there was no particular remark made on the Wednesday; he commenced casting his calendars, trying the Balances of his ledgers, to see if they were correctly posted, and he continued at that for two or three days; but I found that he was not getting on very satisfactorily, and I said, "I have been thinking of coming o£ an evening to assist you in getting your work up close again"—he said, "You see I cannot do anything else, and I shall soon have them up close again if I continue at this"—I merely remarked, "Very well, I shall see how you get on"—on Friday, 14th February, about 2 o'clock, I went into the room at the Bank where Durdin was, and spoke to him—I rather think he spoke to me first—he told me that Mr. Beatle, the senior ledger, had been telling him that I was coming in the evening to get his workup close,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186106100072"/>
               <p>and he said he would not have anyone touch his work for anything—I told him that I had told the manager I was coming in the evening to endeavour to get his work up close, for I wished to commence perfectly straight next day, as we were going to have a new clerk, and I thought I could keep the work up close myself—he was very irritated and put out about it, and he said if I was coming in he should remain, and stop as long as I stopped—I returned to the Bank on Friday evening about 7 o'clock, for the purpose of working up Durdin's Books—when I got to the Bank, I found Durdin there at his usual place—he said, "If you will take the ledgers, I will take the calendar, and I will tell you which of the accounts are entered," to see that the Balances were carried out correctly—he had previously made the castings—I remained there till 9 o'clock—he made some memorandums upon the papers and castings—he then said he should go and lock up his papers—I said he could do so if he pleased—that would throw a difficulty in the way of casting the calendars, until he came in the morning—on the following morning, before he came, I thought it right to examine the calendars, and found that the summary had been mis-cast about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>placed on a piece of paper, which I now produce, the amount of the fraud, I asked him how it had been committed—he wrote down on the paper "66,992<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the original here—I asked him how he had done it—he explained that it had been perpetrated by two accounts; first of all his own, and secondly that of Mr. Holcroft—I asked him by what method, and he told me that sums which had been paid into certain accounts had not only been credited to those accounts, but also to the account of Mr. Holcroft.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been the manager? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was nominally manager on 31st July, 1854—I was actually manager on 14th February, 1860—a gentleman named Cadogan preceded me as manager in 1851—I do not know anything of him—I had nothing whatever to do with the Bank before I Became manager in 1854—I think the prisoner received 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year when he first commenced, and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at last—it was not 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for several years after 1 was there—there are entries in the Books which can Be seen—I am sure it was more than 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he sometimes to act as cashier in the absence of the other cashier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think, during my management, that he ever, acted as cashier—he might have done ao for a single afternoon, or something of that kind—I will not Be positive, but I do not think he ever did—he may have received money across the counter accidentally, but not as cashier—he would have to give it to another cashier to account for—I do not know that he constantly received money across the counter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that if he received money at the counter, he might enter it in the cash-Book himself, enter it into the ledger himself, check it himself, enter it into the calendar himself, and into the total summary himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt; there would be no check whatever upon him, from the time he received it and entered it in the cash-Book, until it got into the summary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say there would be no check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not if he received it as cash; but I think it will Be found upon an examination of the</p>

               <p>Books, that he very seldom received as cashier—there may Be entries in the cash-Book which represent credits in the cash, but upon which there was no cash received; simply transfers—I think it will Be found if the cash-Books are examined, which I have not done, that whatever entries of his are made, are principally of that class, and not actual cash received.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Durdin "there is the entry of the customer's cheque to his debit in the cash-Book—the name is the drawer's name—it means that Durdin's cheque was paid—the fact of his having entered it himself, in his own handwriting, shows who was the particular clerk that paid it; that the himself paid his own cheque; that it was a cheque payable to himself—that is not shown on the face of this Book—it is shown in the ledger—the entry in the ledger on 19th May, is "Durdin, self, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I have here the ledger account of Mr. Freeman, of 6th May, 1851—that is in Durdin's handwriting—I find there an entry of 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was therein 1851—this is the cash Book of 6th May, 1851 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is only one entry to the amount of 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day, and that is entered to the credit of J.

               <p>in a very dirty night-gown—I did not examine its under clothing—I saw that it was very thinly clad, and it was a very dirty night-gown—in cones quence of what was told me I went to make some inquiries at the house in Start ford-place, No. 1, where the prisoner lived—I went there with the deceased child's sister, Mary Ann Barnard—I found no food there—there were three children besides the one in the workhouse—there was one lump of coal—I asked the child why she did not light that—she said she had no wood; there was no wood—I noticed the parents' Bed; it might have been made a com fortable Bed, but it was extremely dirty—the children's Bed was at the foot of the parents'—it consisted of a few flocks—I felt it; it was extremely hard—I tore the tick and found that the flocks from various causes, no doubt by the children, had got clotted and hard—there was a sack in two parts on the tick, and I said "What are these sacks for?"—the child said, "We lie on one and the other covers us," and that was the only covering.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was more covering; there was a thick knotted quilt on the Bed, and the Bed was sufficiently good for me to lie on—there were sheets on, only they were taken off to dry.</p>

I am the wife of James Wright, a Bricklayer, of 12, Stratford-place, which is right opposite the prisoner's—I have known her for two years by living opposite—I noticed the child Hannah Barnard since its Birth—I was present at the Birth—it was Born the Friday before Christ-mas-day—I think, as far as my judgment as a mother goes, it was a likely little Baby—after Christmas it seemed a nice little thing, but after the time that the mother went out it was neglected wonderful—I cannot exactly say what that time was, but I know very well she was out night after night, and I have heard her and her a busivetongue—she was away during the day, I do not say one day after another, and the poor Baby has been at the window, left neg<lb/>lected—I have seen it while she was away and have given it food—I have seen the last witness carrying it, and I have told her to take it in out of the cold—it was dressed in a Bed-gown and a little bit of a shawl tied round it—I never examined underneath its clothing—I have given it Bread and milk, and have actually Borrowed the money to get milk for it; it seemed very hungry; it would even devour a dry crust—it was not properly clothed, according to my idea, for a little infant; not warm enough for that cold time of the morning—on the morning it was taken to the work house, before 9 o'clock, my children went out and gave it some Bread and Butter, part of their own Breakfast—I did not see the prisoner that day until after 9 o'clock at night—the child went to the workhouse at 9 or 10 in the morning—the prisoner was in an intoxicated state when I saw her at night; the girl said she was not at home during the Friday night—it was my idea that she was always drinking in the same way—I have seen her come home in the same state several times, early and late, and insulting her husband in the most dreadful manner at the same time—the child did not seem to be properly clothed at any time after its Birth; I never thought it was nicely taken care of; it was very much neglected as to cleanliness after Christmas—the little girl washed it in a little iron saucepan on the stove the morning it was taken away, and she made Bread and milk in that same saucepan afterwards, and told me her mother had not washed it for a fortnight—when the little girl has been nursing it in the child seemed very hungry; she has been to me to ask me for the crusts that my children have thrown away.</p>

               <p>it constantly daily, and the first few days it seemed to improve—I did not see it take its food, but I had the report of the nurse that it took its food—it seemed to do pretty well for the first few days, and increased in weight; but on the succeeding Thursday, when the child was taken before the magistrate, I Observed a change in it, and it died on Saturday, succeeding that—I made a post mortem examination; there was a slight degree of con<lb/>gestion of the vessels on the surface of the Brain—the Brain itself was pale and softer than usual; there was very minute effusion at the Base of the Brain—the lungs were in a healthy state, but pale and thin—the stomach was healthy but pale, and contained some partly digested food—the intes<lb/>tines were examined throughout their whole length, and there was no trace whatever of any disease in or about the Bowels or glands—the death was caused from want of proper and sufficient nourishment; the different parts being pale would be evidence of want of food—it had not for some time it ought proper maternal care or the substitute for that maternal food which had the to have had—Dr. Barnes assisted me in my examination.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Finsbury-square—I am a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, assistant to Obstetric physician to the London Hospital, and physician to the London Maternity charity—I was called in by Mr. Clark to assist in the post-mortem examination of this child on 13th May—I found what Mr. Clark has described, a state of extreme emaciation, no fat on the body, a want of nutrition; the organs internally were in an entirely Bloodless state, which accounts for the paleness observed—it was a want of formation of Blood—there was hardly any in the body—the skin was exces<lb/>sively pale—the parts were excoriated where the Bones project Behind—there being no cushion of fat to protect it from pressure—the skin had given way or was about to give way in one place over the spine—there was also exco<lb/>riation about the cartilage; I consider from dirt and neglect—the Brain was very soft, Bloodless, which I consider to be the result of want of nutrition—it might Be attributable to that, but I could not draw anything considerble from that—the organs in the chest were perfectly healthy—the only thing I observed was that the lungs were exceedingly Bloodless; just a little had coagulated at the lower part of the lungs as it lay on its back—the heart and stomach were healthy—there was no disease of any kind in the Body—I attribute death to want of nourishment—it was a child of five months old—it ought to have weighed at least ten pounds—a small child would weigh that, at least, if well nourished—it is a little remarkable that it seemed to increase in weight—that goes to prove that there was some amount of nourishment going on at that time, but it did not come soon enough to rescue the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was very fond of my Baby; it has always been a sickly child; it was Born before the midwife came, and was a very small Baby; it did not seem to have strength to take the Breast, and the midwife said I should have a great deal of trouble with it. I suckled it, and attended to it night and day, and gave it all the nourishment I could. It was very sore and inflamed about the lower parts of its body, and I took it to the doctor; there are two certificates from him in Court. He told me it had diseased glands of the inside, or consumption of the bowels, and ordered beef tea and milk, but if I had not sufficient milk myself I need not buy it any. I fed it, and continued to suckle it; it ate very ravenously, but never seemed satisfied. The doctor said it was of a very weak digestion, that I must not give it so much bread, accordingly I did not It had places like ulcers come out upon its body; I attended to it, and washed it, and put fuller's-earth upon it; the doctor said I could not do better. It was ordered cod liver oil twice a day, and sometimes a bark mixture with wine in it three times a day, and that it had constantly up to the time of its death. On the morning that it was taken away I had been ill, and I went to the hospital, and when I returned I found the child had been taken to the workhouse. My little girl could get whatever she wanted, and I had left enough in the place for breakfast. I had been, to look for my husband, who belongs to the volunteers, but he was gone into the country that day, and I did not return home till rather late, as I had been looking for him. I have four children living; they all went into this same emaciated state, and have all been under medical treatment from four years of age. My husband is consumptive, and has brought up a good deal of blood for years, every now and then.</p>

I am a menber of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on 30th May last I saw the deceased Boy when he first came into the hospital—he was what we call "concussed"—he was capable of giving a monosyllabic answer when roused—I asked his name, and he said, "Teddy," and then went off again into a sort of sleep—there was a ragged wound abovey the left eye, extending through the scalp to the Bone—I could not detect a fracture until after death—he died about 6 o'clock next evening—I then examined the body, and found a fracture a the back part of the head, through the Bones—there was extra<lb/>vasated Blood, and the Brain itself was ruptured in parts—I therefore concluded that he died from the fracture and bleeding, the result of the injury he had sustained—it is difficult to say whether the wheel of a ca B knocking him down would produce that injury; it might, but I could not assert one way or the other.</p>

I am a cab-driver—I was first ca B on the stand the night this accident occurred—not one ca B left the stand at this time, or just before, and not for twenty-five minutes afterwards—I was waiting on my box at 10 o'clock, and saw the policeman coming across the road with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186106100085"/>
               <p>two children on his right—in the meantime, the Hansom cab was coming across the road, and, as soon as it had passed my cab, I heard him say, "Stop!"and the cab stopped at about twenty to thirty yards after—he said, "You have run over the child"—I got off my box; and at the same time, Bowman came and picked the child up—when the cab came up, the police<lb/>man was about two feet from the horse's head—they were about one yard in advance of my horse, towards the Hansom, past my cab—the policeman was close by the side of it—I saw the cab pass the policeman, and the first child, and saw it strike the other one, who was a little in advance—if the policeman had a child in each hand, he would have saved the pair of them as well as himself it would not have happened—if he had taken one step he would have cleared the horse—the prisoner was not going at all at an unusual pace for a Hansom cab; they are not stopped directly—he pulled up in very good time—it was two or three cabs down, when the policeman halloed out "Stop!" and I do not suppose the man went more than from twenty to thirty yards after that—from what I saw, the accident could not have been prevented by the cabman—I do not think he was to blame—the night was dark; and I considered the one that was in fault was the constable, for not having one in each hand—I do not expect persons to be passing directly under the horses of a cabstand—it is rather a dangerous place—one would suppose he would look before crossing the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Brother of the prisoner—I was with my cab on this night in Dorset-street—I was not on my cab—it was behind the four-wheeler, standing second on the rank—I noticed a Hansom cab coming across from Baker-street to Dorset-street, not knowing it was my brother—the cab was,—about six yards past the crossing—he pulled up between twenty and thirty yards after—it was about the third cab down—I saw the policeman with these two children—he was walking across the road with both children on his right-hand side—the youngest had hold of the hand of the eldest one—the Hansom cab passed the policeman and the eldest child; and the stock of the wheel caught the skull of the youngest child, he being farthest out—it just brushed his forehead—it could not have been prevented, whether my brother was sober or otherwise—I look upon it as a pure accident—the policeman, placed as he was, would hide the children from my" brother—it was rather a</p>

               <p>darkish night—I have known my brother all his life—he is a very sober man, and kind—I never saw him under the influence of liquor before—he is a careful driver—he was not going at an unusual pace—it was a pace that is constantly gone by Hansoms, fare or no fare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at Somerset House, and live at 11, Hanover-street, Islington—my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—on the night of 16th May, I secured my house—I believe the windows and doors were all safe—next morning I found one of the windows open—it had been opened by taking the pane of glass from over the latch, and the latch was unfastened—the pane was cut out, I believe—I had gone to Bed that night at 11 o'clock—I came down a little before 7; I should think a quarter before 7—I missed a great quantity of property—I have seen this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine—there were four printed Books, nine</p>

I said they were not mine; he then asked Brown, who said they were not his. On being taken to the station-house, I said I was innocent of the crime; the things were given me by Brown to sell, who said that he would give me a shilling or two; that night I was in bed asleep at my place, and I have a witness in Court to prove it.</p>

I am a hairdresser, at 57, Amelia-street, Walworth—I was with the prosecutor and the prisoner at the Duke of Wellington—the prosecutor lent me some money—for that purpose he took a Bag out of his pocket—I did not see whether it contained other money—he afterwards left the public-house with me; he was able to walk—he knew very well what he was about—the prisoner was on the step when we left the public-house—I left the prosecutor twenty or twenty-five yards from there; has house is about one hundred yards or a little more from the public-house—he would have to walk the rest of the distance alone.</p>

I am the wife of William John Pool, of 12, Lower Fenton-street, shoemaker—the prisoner lives at 29, Duke-street, St. George's-in-the-East—that is some distance from my house—I have been acquainted with her for eighteen months, previously to the 22d May—we have quarrelled on more than one occasion—on 21st May we had a quarrel and fought, at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see her again till the 22d—about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was passing along Duke-street, St. George's-in-the-East, with Jane Bouten, another young woman, and I felt a stab in my shoulder—I had not seen the prisoner before that—I did not say anything to her then—I never saw her—I did not know which way she could have come—after I felt the stab I remembered no more till I found myself in a doctor's shop in Charles-street, and then my wounds were partly dressed—I did see her before I was insensible—I cannot say whether she had anything in her hand or not—I found afterwards that I had received seven wounds—I was very weak from loss of Blood.</p>

               <p>and pushed me on one side, and I thought she was pushing Mrs. Pool, but instead of that she was stabbing her—I saw her give her two Blows with the knife—I saw the knife at the second Blow—the prisoner said, "You B—y whore, I have got you now," and then she stabbed her again—that was after she had struck her in the shoulder—she stabbed her five times, I think, after that—at the fourth stab I saw the blood come from the back of her head, and the back of her neck—I did not see the prosecutrix so anything—she Bent her head down and prevented the knife going in the front of her neck, and put her arm up, and that is how she received the stab in the shoulder—she also received a stab in her hand—she then fell on the ground—I saw a man come up and pull the prisoner's arm back—when the pro<lb/>secutrix fell on the ground the prisoner was stabbing her, as she fell; she kept on stabbing her—she stabbed her once after she fell down—a person named McKenzie then came up—the prisoner was secured and the knife taken away—nobody screamed out—there was nobody near—I was as frightened as Mrs. Pool—I did not catch hold of the prisoner, I was too frightened—I caught hold of Mrs. Pool to try to save her from falling—she was then taken to a chemist's shop down Charles-street—that is all I know of the matter—the prosecutrix had not said or done anything at all to the prisoner before I saw these stabs—I am quite sure of that.</p>

He said, 'If you will go with me to Hope-street, Spitalfieids, I will give you three or four shillings for your trouble;' I went with Crane to Hope-street, Spitalfieids, thinking it was no harm, as it was a friend assisting a friend"—I said, "Now who was this man?"—he said, "He is a perfect stranger to me; I never saw her before or since"—I told him I should have to take him in custody, and I took him to the Leman-street police-station.</p>

Agg and Jim Hunter; they owe me nigh upon 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and it will Be the ruin of us"—he asked me whether we had got Agg or Hunter—that was before the conversation took place that I have just given, but it was in the same conversation—I said that we had not—he said he knew nothing of those two men that we had got in custody—I had not told him who the men were who were in custody; I had said nothing to him; but he might have heard it.</p>

Agg and Hunter;" he produced the receipt, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him what Agg and Hunter were—he said they were dealers in silk, and kept public-houses in London—I said, "I do not see Hunter's name on this receipt"—he said, "No, sometimes one sells and sometimes the other, for it so happens that people will not Buy of one of them, when they will of the other; they were both here yesterday, and I paid them myself; I gave Agg three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and a cheque for 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "But that does not make 738<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I turned, and was looking at the silk again, when Newton left the room by a side door which goes into the house—I sent a constable to keep watch that the silk should not Be removed, and then went to the Town-hall; at that time De Bock and Barker were in custody—I had them taken before a magis trate, and they were remanded for a week; they were brought into my outer office on the way to the gaol, while the commitments were made out; they were then conveyed to gaol—I had heard nothing of any robbery of silk at that time—I told De Bock I was going to London to make inquiries, and asked him his address; he gave mo his correct address, and said that I should find the silk was all right; that he bought it of a man named May, and gave 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it, that he did not know the weight, but he bought it by the lump—I said, "Well, if you bought it of May, you can produce the invoice and the receipt"—he said, "No, I cannot; I never had any; it is about four months ago, and it has been warehoused in my Brothers house ever since"—I said, "You mean Mr. Barker"—he said, "Yes"—I after wards saw Barker—De Bock said, "I called at Agg's, and I came down with hi a to receive the money"—I told Barker I was going to London to make inquiries about the ten Bales of silk which had been sold to Mr. Newton; he also gave his correct address, 2, Hope-street, Spitalfields—he said "I know nothing about any ten Bales of silk; I never saw any in my life"—I said, "Your Brother-in-law has just said that you have had it in your house for the last four months"—he said, "No, I have not; it might have been for three months"—he said he did not know what he came to Derby for; but he was out of work, and his Brother said if he came he would pay his expenses—I went to London, and returned on Friday, 22d—I telegraphed to Derby on the 22d, and when I arrived there, I found Sergeant Green in possession of 109 Books of silk, and a complete Bale of skeins—I saw Mr. Newton, Mr. Newton, jun., and Mr. Leach, Mr. Newton's solicitor, all together—that was on Saturday the 22d—I said to Newton, "I want a receipt I</p>

Rothschild, and part to Messrs. Glodstein—I have never found out the entire value of the silk less one Book—it does not concern me—the variation in con<lb/>signments of silk is very considerable—I believe it is an invariable practice for Buyers of silk to examine it carefully, and they have every opportunity of doing so—I saw the Bags weighed that were brought from Derby—they varied from two pounds four ounces to three pounds—that signifies that they are not the Company's Bags.</p>

               <p>that neither Newton nor the men changed places, though I cannot swear it—I saw Newton directly he got out, but did not see him get out—I had then been on the platform a minute or so—Gutteridge was with him; nobody else—I did not see Bartlett—I Began to put out the parcels—Gutteridge came to me and made a communication that Mr. Newton had lost his ticket and portmanteau—Wilcoxon is a guard in the Company's employment—he came down by the train from Leicester to Derby—I do not know where he rode—I saw him after we arrived on the Derby platform—he said, "I have been asleep; I am going to Row Botham's: there are some passengers going there;, I have recommended them for a Bed" I understood him they were two men with whom he had been riding—I do not know why he told me that—he asked me if I would go and have a glass of ale, and I said, "No"—there were several houses open—there were two Breaks, up to North Derby Junction, and only one from North Derby Junction to the station—I never saw Wilcoxon in the Break—the first I saw of him, was when he came to the Break-van that I was riding in, and took his signals out—that was the only Break-van there was—he was not in the Break before that: had he been I must have seen him—if he rode to Leicester in the Break-van, he must have got out there—he was not in the hind Break-van in which I came—if he came in the first, he must have got out at the junction—there is a train from Derby to London at a quarter-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a platform porter at the Midland Railway station, Derby—I occasionally collect tickets at night time—I collected the tickets on the night of 18th March—the collecting platform is about one hundred yards from the station—if my re recollection is right, the train came in on that night at a few minutes after 1 o'clock, or something like that—it was composed of three carriages; one parcel van, one composite carriage, and one guard's break van—I collected the tickets from the composite carriage—that was a first-class between two second-classes—there was nobody in the first-class—there were three in the first second-class compartment; two passengers and one guard, that was Wilcoxson—he was lying asleep on the seat—in the other second-class carriage was Mr. Newton by himself—I Began at the end of the train and worked up to the engine—I did not receive a ticket from Newton—I rode from the ticket platform to the station, on the step of the carriage Newton was in; and riding for one hundred and fifty yards in that way I will swear that there was nobody in the compartment but himself—I did not see Bartlett at the station—I rode on the step of Newton's carriage, because he could not find his ticket—when I got to the platform, I saw Mr. Measurer, the foreman—I saw the two men who were in the carriage with the guard, and also saw them on the night following on the platform—De Bock and Barker are the men—I saw them step out of a carriage—they took no notice of Newton at all, or of anybody—Newton did not get his portmanteau from the train on his arrival at Derby—I afterwards went up to Bartlett in relation to that portmanteau—that was the first time I had seen Bartlett—I had to walk about a hundred and thirty yards to him—he was in the entrance hall—that is not in a direct line of sight—when Newton did not get his portmanteau, I spoke to Taylor about it—I afterwards went with Newton for him to pay his fare—he paid it to a clerk in the office—I saw what money was given—there is a clerk there all night to Book the night trains, and he paid it in the ordinary office to the ordinary clerk—I afterwards went with Newton to Row Botham's, and there saw the two men who I had seen in the carriage with the guard—they did not in any way recognise Newton, or Newton them—I had some ale—Newton paid for it—I stayed at the counter perhaps three or four minutes—I afterwards accompanied Newton home—I have never seen him come from London by any other than the mail-train—it is generally my habit to walk home with him when I am not on duty—there are no cabs at the station to meet persons, so that a porter must carry a portmanteau—we generally call at Row Botham's as we go By, and drink—when I spoke to Bartlett in the entrance-hall, he had not time to see the parties get out of the carriage—I recollect De Bock and Barker being apprehended—I heard Bartlett say, after that, that it was those two men who had come down by the mail the night previous—that was all he said that night with reference to them; but a night or two afterwards it was being talked over on the platform, in Bartlett's presence, and he said, "I must have my spoon into that affair"—some weeks after, we were down in the lamp-room, talking about this affair, and he said to me, "Are you not going to London?"—I said, No; not that I am aware of"—one of the other men asked him if he was going; he said, "Yes"—the other man said, "It will Be a good job for you, if you go"—he said, "I do not care if I can only make a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of it"—the other man said that he would make the cat's tail spin about that night—I do not know what that meant—Fearn and Vessey came to my house, and asked me some questions—that was before Bartlett was brought up to London as a witness—I do not know when he was brought up, but it was about 23d or 24th March—some time afterwards, I went to</p>

Joseph Wilson")—this name, "John Newton" is my lather's writing—this was given to me on the afternoon of 19th March, in part payment of the account running—up to that time I had not bought any silk of Agg, but I had sold some right out, not on commission, on several occasions—I found an entry of them—the first sale to him is on 24th January—all these that have got 5 per cent. allowed are sold out and out—this cheque and the Bill were payments on account of sales made—it was Alexander Cox's Bill—my father came in afterwards and Hunter—Agg then said, "Your father has bought these ten Bales of silk from me for cash"—my father said to me, "You pay for them"—I asked Mr. Agg how much they would come to—he said, "Over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "It will not Be convenient to pay the whole amount at this time; we have other payments to make; will 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. do to-day, and more in a few days?"—he said, "Yes"—I then wrote a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not specify any particular amount that he wanted—I took the cheque to the Bank, and cashed it as I was going there on other Business—this is the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I drew—it is my writing—this counterfoil is also in my writing—I went to the Bank, because it was getting near closing hours, and I had to run to get there before it closed—he asked me to cash the cheque for him as I was going to the Bank—when I brought back the notes he gave me the invoices of ten Bales of silk—they were three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I believe this invoice is in the same state as when he gave it to me—it has my initials on it—he had written it out when I came into the office with the notes, and receipted it as it is now—I did not observe that it was headed "London," or "15th March"—I was in a hurry, because I had many letters to write that night, and hands were waiting, and he said he wanted to go to London by a train leaving at half-past 4—I do not know what day it was my father spoke to him about the silk—when the invoice was handed to me I asked my father how much we were to pay—my father said, "Pay him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so, and carry a Balance to his account"—I proposed 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to the notes, and to carry the Balance to his account—I wrote out a cheque for 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and made it payable on 22d March—that would be the three days that I had proposed—I find the counterfoil here of that cheque, "Agg, March 22"—immediately after that I find a cheque drawn on March 20th, another on 21st, another on 22d—I gave that on the 19th—it was incon<lb/>venient to me to pay the cash on that day—I had other payments to make</p>

               <p>at that time, and it was inconvenient to give the whole sum—Agg saw that I had post dated the cheque—the difference was not made out, and the account gone into between us—he went away with Hunter and my father, and shortly after he had left I Balanced the account in the ledger—I showed him where to get a ca B as he was in a hurry to catch the train, and the station is a mile from our house—I have never seen him or Hunter since—I directed the police at the police-office to go to the address of Agg and Hunter—I made an effort to find them For the police-constables—I did not look into the invoices particularly, as I had been dealing with Agg for some time—he owed us a Balance of 394<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not before the cheque—the whole amount that Agg owed us before he came was 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—first came a cheque for 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then the acceptance for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; deducting that, we get 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when he left he owed us 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find Agg's acceptance to the amount of 323<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered in this pass-Book—some short time after the 19th I was requested to return the acceptances with another name—he owed us more than 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at that time—during the whole of these transactions my father took no part in it at all—I have entered up the purchase of the ten Bales in the bought invoice-Book, which I have got here—I also posted up the ledger the same night—I have copied this from the invoices—I also enter up the sales in this sold invoice-Book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about 2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 20th, Inspector Fern came to my house, and knocked me up—I live away from my father, at my own house—he asked me whether we bad had any silk transactions that day—I told him that we had had transactions with Mr. Agg, and that we had paid him three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and the Balance was to be carried to his account—I proposed to go with him to my father's, and did go—my father said, in answer to a question by Fern, that he should Be at the mill in the morning—Fearn then left—Between 9 and 10 in the morning Hilton came, accompanied by Fearn and Vessey, and I explained the facts to them, and offered the Books which I have now produced, and the invoices, but they left them with me—I offered to show them all the Books—I fetched them down stairs—Mr. Hilton placed his hands upon them, and said, "There, I see them, but I won't see them"—I did everything in my power to clear up the transaction—I never saw De Bock or Barker until they were in custody—I had seen Crane as a porter at Drakeford's—I gave a plain description of Agg and Hunter—when my father could not go to the police-court I went—I took one Bundle of silk to the station and one of the Bags—that was on the 20th—I attended before the Magistrate—Mr. Hilton came again to the mill on the afternoon of the 20th, accompanied by Mr. Davenport and Mr. Cramont—they are in partnership as silk manufacturers and thrusters—they looked at the silk in the presence of the police, who came with them—I repeated that I had paid for it in their presence—on Saturday, 23d March, Hilton came again with Mr. Leach, and I gave up the invoices, and offered to show the Books—Mr. Leach said he did not want them except for this one transaction—the silk was then packed, and taken away—Between giving the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the cheque coming due I sent for some money to meet the payment—it was a telegraphic message to Rigg, "Send me a cheque on account of sales"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it—in cones<lb/>quence of that I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to enter that corrected account into this Book while this matter was under trial?"Agg owed us some money, and we had an acceptance to meet it for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some silk was returned by Agg's agency since this robbery—this was written in Derby—this was the original entry—some portion of it is what I referred to as the original account of Agg—I wrote it on 19th March—I entered it from our consigning Books—Agg had given us notice of the sale of the silk—I believe he had gone over some of our Books containing this account and different invoices—there is an account sale of China train and Bengal train—no part of these ten Bales is contained there—I have not entered them in any part of this day-book because I keep a Book for all sold accounts, and you will find nothing but received in that—I copy all the invoices—the invoices always specify the weight; this Book only exhibits the date of the original invoices—there is no Book at all which exhibits the date of the transaction except this which I took from the date of the invoices—I should put against it "clod" for "cleared" from the Docks—the Bill had been sent down, and we paid for it when it came back—if we had a ready money transaction at Derby the ledger would show it—I am quite sure I am correct in saying that I entered this 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., having discovered the mistake the same evening the 19th.</p>

               <p>different parts, and the carrier's signature—this is the goods delivered Book—you have seen every Book in our establishment which contains an entry of these ten Bales—there are no other entries than what you have seen—I never saw De Bock or Barker at all till they were in custody—a Balance is struck from the entries on this page (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out to the Jury</hi>)—this is the Balance of the silk account—it is carried on from here—if there was a line drawn here it would not much matter—there is no other Book from which this Balance is taken—I am sure this was written at the same time—I do not see any difference in the ink—it might possibly Be so; for I have two inkstands, one with Blue ink and the other with Black—I have made three credits and one debit, but the result is the same—the cheque which I gave to Agg was to be paid on the 22d—we had also a London cheque-Book—this cheque-Book truly represents the transactions between the 18th and 22d—we have not a London Banker: they are agents—this cheque on 23d was given to Mr. Leach to draw out the Balance of our account—the Bank wished it; the Bank wished us to retire our Bills, and to close our account—we had to retire Bills between 19th and 22d out of the Balance in our favour—here it is in the pass-Book—the postponement of the 22d would enable us to meet the intervening claims upon us—we did not want to leave our Bankers without a Balance in our favour—the 121<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would come the very next day, and by the postponement of the cheque to the 22d I should have more time to get money in—I made this delivery shortly after Breakfast time, shortly after I received the letters—that was after my father's interview with the officers—it is my usual custom to go out about 1 o'clock, and come back at 2—I got to the mill at 8 in the morning; I was there till I went out to dinner at 1—I was there from 2 until I went to the Banker's, and cashed the cheque and got the cheque-Book—I was not gone to the Bank half an hour—I had to retire Bills there, I cannot say positively whether I did or did not, but I paid these two sums in on the same day—I do not always pay sums in myself—the pass-Book will not show whether I retired a Bill on that day, but I have no doubt I paid in a cheque and a Bill, though they have not given credit for the cheque on the day I paid it in—I believe there is an entry of it in the pass-Book—I have had dealings with Agg Before, and have sold goods to him.</p>

I am an accountant, of the firm of Broom, Bag shaw, and Westcott, 35, Coleman-street, London—I have been in Business some thirty years—shortly after Newton's arrest, I was directed by his principal creditors to investigate the affairs—in consequence of that I went down on 4th April without any communication from him or his friends—I appeared there on 5th April—all the Books and papers were su Bmitted to me—I examined all the Books, the day-Book, ledger, bought and sold invoice-Books, the consignment-Book, and the carriers-Book—I saw the Bankers' pass-Book, and examined it sufficiently for the purpose for which I went down there—I prepared a statement of account for the creditors from those Books, and from the materials and assistance which I had—for instance, we had to take an account of the stock—I prepared a statement of his affairs—I examined Agg's account—my attention was directed to it from the circum<lb/>cumstances that I then heard—I see the account of Agg's in the ledger—I have carefully, for that purpose, traced that account from the Books, and other documents, more particularly the-consignment-Book—I find that this supports the subordinate Books, but it is very Badly put together, unscientific<lb/>cally—if the Jury have time to go through this Book and the consignment-Book, they can trace out every item in the ledger—there is no appearance of fraud about it, nor in any portion of the Books I have seen—I found that Newton was solvent, and as my object was to get the true statement of his affairs, I took care not to overstate anything—I found there was a surplus; not very considerable—I did bring the account here with me.</p>

Hunt ad Guthrie—the pouch was returned to us, as not being according to the regulation, and we made another instead—I believe the one produced to be the one we made—the first was silver, and this is gold—it is a particular shape, made especially to order—it is the only one of the kind we have made—I know it is one of our make.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a military outfitter, at 32, Argyll-street—I knew the prisoner as servant to a medical officer in the Artillery for about four years—on 17th April last I met him at the railway station, London-Bridge—he said he was about proceeding to my place, that he had got a day's leave, for the purpose of disposing of a set of dress belts which he had, and would I purchase them, or direct him to some persons in London who would purchase them—I said I thought he would not be able to sell them so well in London as in Woolwich, because in London they would give little more than they would burn at, which would be about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but at Woolwich he might get a trifling advance upon that price—he said, "I should Be very much obliged if you would take them of me; I should Be quite satisfied with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I have lately disposed of a set in Woolwich for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so I can promise you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if not a little more"—he said, Very well"—I took the parcel from him, suggesting that we should adjourn to the waiting-room to examine whether the Belts were as he represented them to Be, as good as new, having only been worn two or three times—the train was near starting, and he said, "There is not time for that; I will leave them in your possession"—I was going to Eltham, and said I would be in Woolwich about 6 in the evening, and appointed to meet him there, and give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or return the Belts—I got to Woolwich about half-past 5, and sold them to Mr. Hart, an old neighbour of mine, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot swear to the Belts—there was a mark of this description on the Belts I sold Mr. Hart—the prisoner said he had had them locked up in a Box for a considerable period, and he thought they belonged to an officer who had gone on the Chinese expedition—I had not then examined them—I did not see anything in their appearance calculated to excite suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Collyer, of the Plough and Harrow public-house, in Lambeth parish—on the morning of 7th May, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was awoke by the servant, Mary Ann Stone, coming to my door, and, from something she said, I went down into the Bar—as I was going down, I heard a sound as if the door was closing—I went to the door—it was not as I had left it the night Before, it was open—I did not notice whether there was any violence outside or not—I then went outside the door, and saw the prisoner (Upton) in custody—there was a Basket very near to him, on the pavement, which contained eight Bottles of Brandy—I knew the Brandy by the seal—it had been on a fiat behind the Bar the night Before—it Belongs to my employer, Mr. Collyer—I went outside, and looked at the window—it had been pulled down from the outside—it slides up and down—I went to Bed at half-past 11 the night Before—the window and door were safe at that time—I fastened the door with this Bolt inside the night Before—I should imagine the parties got in at the window—Both the prisoners were in my master's employment about twelve months ago.</p>

I accompanied the last witness to the house in Westcott-street, on the morning of 4th June—I went into the room on the first-floor—after we had taken the two prisoner in custody we tent back again into a room on the ground floor, and found Collins there—on searching the place I found these two towels and a white neck-handkerchief—I asked bow she came by them—she said the handkerchief she found to Bishopsgate-street, and the towels she had got to wash—I took her to the station, and when I got there she threw two pawnbroker's tickets under the form—I picked them up and asked her what she threw them away for—she at first denied ever having them in her possession—one was for a coat and the other for a quantity of silk—she afterwards said the coat belonged to her husband—I asked her how she could account for the silk—she refused to give any account of it—nothing further passed at the station—I left her at the station, and went back and searched her apartment, and found this portion of a red velvet bonnet and this white cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sexton of St. Peter's Church, Walworth, and live in Peacock-terrace, Liverpool-street, in that neighbourhood—on the evening of Monday, 27th May I was engaged about the Church and church-yard till half-past 8 o'clock—after leaving work at that time I went as usual into the church and looked round to see that all was right—I then locked it on and returned home—I came away at a quarter to 9 exactly—the alms boxes were at the other end of the church—they were safe—on Tuesday morning my duty called me to the churchyard again—I am sure that on the evening of the 27th the door at the back of the church wad closed, locked—I am just as certain that it stood wide open—on the morning of the 28th, at a quarter to 10 o'clock—the vestry also was broken open, and in great con-fusion—among the articles I missed were the trimming of the pulpit, the hangings—this is a small portion that was left behind on the pulpit door—I have compared that piece of velvet with some portions of bonnets shewn to me by the policeman—they form part of the same, in my judgment, and likewise this binding—they exactly correspond, and the binding is exactly alike—there weir also some damask curtains missing—I did not miss them—this has been shown to me by the policeman—I never saw it in the church before—this alpaca coat belongs to a brother of mine—it was safe in the church on the night in question—I identify it by this white mark on the sleeve—here are also two silk hatbands, but I should not like positively to swear to them.</p>
