               <p>bundle contained five ends of damask, an end of linen, two remnants of figured plush, and other miscellaneous things—he said "Sergeant Batchelor, who is outside, knows the man, and knows that he brought the parcel here"—I then went outside with the prisoner, but could not see the man to whom he referred; we saw Sergeant Batchelor, and I said to him, "This man is housekeeper at Zion College, and he states that a parcel was brought there on Saturday by a policeman, and that you know who the constable is, and know that he took the parcel there"—Batchelor said "I don't know who it is, I don't know anything about it"—the prisoner said "Yes, you do know who it is"—Batchelor again said "I don't know"—I then went back with him into the house, and I said "Now, are there any more things?"—he said "No, there are no more," and having further searched the house we came into the yard, and after searching several places Mr. Millman went to a doorway in rather a dark place, we had already passed that place, Mr. Millman went to it—I did not know there was such a place—the prisoner said "For God's sake don't let him go in there, there is a lot of silks and a bundle of shawls in there: Mr. Batchelor took them in there, and they belong to him"—after some difficulty we found the key, opened the door, got a light, and went in—Mr. Millman insisted on the prisoner finding the key, and he went back to the house and got it, and we went in and there found four pieces of silk, four pieces of satin, 13 shawls, and a piece of velvet; I think there was nearly 500 yards each of silk and satin—they were the ordinary size of a piece in a warehouse—they would not go through the bars of a window five and three-quarter inches apart without great difficulty; they would have to be squeezed hard—the prisoner repeatedly said "They are the things belonging to Batchelor"—I said "Now, if you have any more things you will save us a great deal of difficulty if you will tell us where they are"—he said "There are some more things under the hall on the other side of the yard. Mr. Batchelor and the others brought the things to me and said they had bought them, but could not take them while they were on duty, and asked me to take charge of them and they would fetch them away when they were off duty. Mr. Johnson is one, but I don't know the names of the others"—we then went into the hall on the opposite side of the yard—the front door was open—this was a little before 2 o'clock in the afternoon—it is a large hall used as a reading-room—the prisoner lifted up a trapdoor in the floor under the carpet, and we went down a ladder into a cellar below, and there, in a small room or large cupboard covered over with pieces of string and paper, we found 90 yards of Welsh flannel, three pieces of muslin, a bundle of new cotton, and other things, and in a cistern in another part of the cellar six large pieces of brown cotton and one piece of white calico—I said "Is this all?"—he said "Yes, this is all; I believe this is all"—I then took him to the Chief Office of the City Police, Old Jewry, leaving Oldhampstead behind in charge of the property—on the way I said "We shall continue to make a search"—he said "If you will wait till after 4 o'clock, when Mr. Millman and Mr. Perkins, the sub-librarian, will be gone, I will show you where there are some more things in the library"—I left the prisoner there and went back to Zion College, and there learnt that the things in the library had been found; I saw a heap of things—I then went back to the Old Jewry and told him the things had been found—I took him back to Zion</p>

               <p>College to show them to him—when we were near the college he said that Batchelor and the others had brought the things to him, and that the goods were all in the room together until Monday morning, when they were removed and concealed in the places where we had found them, as Batchelor said they had got scent that the things were there—we then went in and I showed him the things—he said "There are some in the fire-buckets, have you got them?"—I said "No," and I took some things out of the fire-buckets, which were hanging up over where the other things were found in the library—the things found in the cupboard were one piece of damask, one piece of coloured flannel, four pieces of twilled winsey, four pieces of plush, one piece of brown cotton, one piece of white cotton, a bundle of shawls and some ladies' under-clothing—all the things were more or less damaged, and most of them wet—some were partly burnt, rather scorched—the things were taken to the station in a cart—I took the prisoner to the station, Moor Lane—I then sent for Batchelor and saw him in the prisoner's presence, and, pointing to all the goods, I said "I found all these things in Zion College, and the prisoner says you have taken them there in parcels"—Batchelor said "It is false"—the prisoner said to Batchelor "You know you have brought parcels there to me"—Batchelor again said "It is false"—the prisoner said "You know others have brought parcels there to me"—Batchelor said "I don't"—the prisoner said "Johnson has brought parcels there to me several times"—I said "Do you mean now that it was Johnson and not Batchelor that has brought the things to you?"—he said "They have both brought them"—the prisoner said to Batchelor "Do you know the fair man on duty at the gate?"—Batchelor said "I know two fair men, Fagan and McKee"—the prisoner said "Yes, that's them, and you know they have brought parcels to me"—Batchelor said "I don't know"—Johnson was then sent for, and I said to Johnson, in the prisoner's presence, "I found these things in Zion College, and the prisoner says you have taken some of them there in parcels"—John son said "I don't Know anything about it"—the prisoner was then charged—the charge was read over to him—he said "Batchelor, Johnson, McKee, and another, I forget his name, brought the things to me"—next morning, about 10 o'clock, I saw Fagan and McKee in the prisoner's presence at the station, and I said to them "I found these things in Zion College, and the prisoner says you have taken some of them there in parcels"—McKee said "I deny it, I was never inside Zion College in my life, and if you speak the truth you will say so"—the prisoner said "Yes, you have been there, and you fetched a parcel away on Monday morning to take to Romford"—McKee said "I deny it"—the prisoner said "You left a note with my wife on Saturday evening to say when you would call to fetch a parcel away"—McKee again said "I deny it"—Fagan said "It is not true, I was never in Zion College"—the prisoner said to him "I saw you on Saturday afternoon, and told you that I should not be at home during the evening, and if you went to my place you would find no one at home but my wife"—Fagan said "I don't remember anything of the kind"—Mr. Kent, of Perrott's, has seen the things I found—I have looked at the windows of Zion College looking into Philip Lane; they are not large enough for all the parcels to be put through—there is a space of 5) inches; the small things could be put through, but the large ones like the calico and winsey it would be impossible to get through; loose things might, but not the more bulky portions.</p>

I am chief officer of the Salvage Corps—after the lire the property that was left was in a great measure taken charge of by the Salvage Corps, a hoarding was put round, and police were on duty at every gate—there was no sale of salvage stock before 21st January—when the search was made at Zion College a good deal of the property had been removed to the auction rooms by labourers, to be sorted and arranged for sale—the prisoner was never employed by me to take any property away—I never authorised or knew of his taking any away—until the search at the college I was not aware that any had been removed from the ruins—I was acting for the whole of the insurance companies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was acting in respect of all the damaged property—perhaps 25 firms claimed from the insurance offices, to the amount of about 900,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the hoarding was put up as soon as possible—before it was put up there was a cordon of police, so that no one could pass—there were about 10 gates to the hoarding, and police at each—the salvage men began to remove some portion of the damaged stock early the next day after the premises were reported safe, about 10 days after the fire—the worst were left and the best taken away at once—the whole of the salvage service men wear a uniform—some goods of the best description are carried off the premises by labourers—the vans are loaded by labourers, but each van is conducted by our own officers—the vans would be drawn up inside the hoarding; there would be no necessity to carry parcels out—the police would turn them back; I have known them do so—about 20 or 25 of my men would be in uniform, but we have more than 100 labourers employed—we are always at work from 8 o'clock in the morning till 6—I am there on an average every day myself; I may miss several</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at Miss Smith's, Britannia public-house, in Bishopsgate Street, before 8th December—it is a house frequented by policemen, not very many—the police barracks in Rose Alley are nearly opposite, turning out of New Street—I entered Miss Smith's service last June—I had seen Batchelor there several times but never knew who he was—I remember seeing three umbrellas; these produced are the three—I did not see who brought them to the house; they were in Miss Smith's possession—she gave me this one—I saw the other two at that time—this was given to me the next day I think—as near as I can remember it was about two months ago—there are marks of water inside this one; it was in my possession about six weeks, I think; I did not use it—I did not hear Batchelor make any request with regard to the umbrella—Miss Smith spoke to me—I saw a parcel brought to the public-house by Batchelor's daughter one evening before 6 o'clock—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188304300022"/>
               <p>that was three or four hours after Miss Smith had given me the umbrella—Miss Smith opened the corner of the parcel and I saw flannel and linen inside; it looked a little saturated at the edges—it had no appearance of household linen or wearing apparel that had gone to the mangle; it was material that had not been made up—it was put in the bar parlour on a chair, it was there about an hour I think, I don't know who took it away, I was not there when it was taken—I saw another parcel after that—I was down stairs in the kitchen, and when I came up I saw it there on the top of the other in the chair in the bar-parlour before the other one was taken away—Miss Smith undid the corners of both parcels, I can't say what was in the other one—I think Miss Smith told me that Sergeant Batchelor came and fetched them away—I don't know who fetched them—on 30th March I was about three hours in Sergeant Bachelor's company.</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness is my daughter—I saw this umbrella in her possession at my house—I believe it was brought there after the prisoner was in custody—I can't say exactly how long after, but I should think a week or so—my daughter had it in her possession all the time; she never returned it—I did not know that Sergeant Batchelor was an acquaintance of my daughter—I saw him when my husband made some allusion to the Wood Street fire, about a month ago; I heard my husband say to him "You are a beast, you are not clear of the Wood Street job yet"—Batchelor said "I know that"—he also said "I will do anything for you I can if you don't name it," some<lb/>thing to that effect, I don't rightly remember, but I know he said "I will do anything for you I can"—my husband answered "You would lock me up if you had a chance"—Batchelor said "It's a bad job"—I don't know what he meant by it—I afterwards attended before the inspector and made a complaint of his misconduct to my daughter—my husband is not here, he is in Shoreditch at work.</p>

I am a waiter at 48, Wardour Street, Mr. Birkett's pancake shop—about 10 p.m. on 12th April I was near Lisle Street with a box of pancakes—three men came up, and all asked for pancakes; the prisoner was one of them—I gave them a pancake each; they were 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—the prisoner gave me a florin—I had no change, and went into a public-house just opposite to get change, and my friend remained with them—I put the piece down on the counter—the barmaid took it up, put it into a machine, and broke it—my friend came in and said something, and I took up the pieces and went out—I could not see the three men; they had run away—we ran in the same direction, but did not catch them—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner at the station-house—I met a policeman about half a minute after coming out of the public-house, and told him what had happened</p>

I am assistant at a publisher's and printer's in Bedford Street, Strand—on 3rd April the prisoner came in and asked for a certain article for a gentleman, who had sent him—he gave me a half-crown, and I gave him two shillings change—after he left I found the half-crown was bad—I kept it, and on the 11th he came again about 7 p.m., and said again that he had been sent by a gentleman for the same article and put down a half-crown—I bent it and rushed round the counter and held him till I got an officer—he three or four times offered to give me two good half-crowns for the two bad ones, but I gave him in custody with the coins—these are them, I marked them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective G</hi>). I live at 20, Charlotte Street, Caledonian Road—on Sunday night, 11th March, about 11 o'clock, I was undress<lb/>ing, and heard some one in the street shout "Murder," "Police," and "Help"—I ran out and saw the prisoner and two others holding Harris down on the footway, and a fourth man walking towards Caledonian Road—I followed the prisoner and took him in Copen<lb/>hagen Street—he had an umbrella—I told him the charge—he made no reply then, but after we had got a few yards he said, "You have made a mistake, I am not the man," and threw away the umbrella and his hat and became violent—Irons assisted me and we took him to the station—when, the charge was read over he said, "I am out of work, and what I have got to say I will say to the Magistrate."</p>

I am a jeweller, living at 138, Great Portland Street—on 21st February I returned home about 11 in the morning, and found the prisoner waiting for me in the shop—he selected a ring, value 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., tendered me this cheque, and said, "Will you give me change for a cheque?"—I said, "We never cash cheques for strangers"—I looked at it and said, "The cheque is not endorsed"—he said he would get it signed by Mr. Taylor, and went away with it—he brought it back about twenty minutes afterwards with this written on it, "To be cashed by Mr. Hartig"—I said it was very irregular, and whoever signed the cheque could not understand what he was doing—he ultimately took the ring and left the cheque and a letter, which I delivered to Mr. Taylor, with me—I asked for Mr. Taylor's address, and he gave me Dean Street, Soho, no number, and said he was a coffee-house keeper—I went to the coffee-house and made inquiries, and in consequence communicated with the police—when the prisoner left the cheque I did not give him the</p>

"How can it be done?"—he told me to put down entries in the book for work which was not made—these entries in the book are consecutive numbers, the number of pairs, the quality, and the price—the work is given out to the men by the manager's dictation, and when it is brought in I enter it on the other side, and the amount he is entitled to receive—Goldstein told me to put down the number of pairs and carry them out at the same time, and always to put the list number—there was only one price—I made this entry on 17th February, 1883, by Goldstein's dictation: "5460. 1510/3. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that is a false entry right through—I put any number that came into my head first—I added the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the end of the week, as if due to Goldstein—on a number of other dates I entered a number of other items, also falsely.

I should not give the money without having the cheque—I have seen the prisoner write five or six times, or perhaps more—to the best of my belief that is his usual writing—the "Robt. P.

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 4, Mortimer Market—the deceased Mary Scoines was my niece—she was 32 years of age—she was the prisoner's wife; they lived together at 23, Pancras Street, a few minutes' walk from me—they had one room—they had one child—on Saturday, 31st March, about 3.45, I saw Mrs. Scoines in the passage of the house where they lived—she was then in very good health and spirits—the prisoner came downstairs and spoke to me—about 11.45 that same night he came to my house—he seemed to be pretty sober—he had been drinking, without a doubt; he was rather excited—he came and asked if Polly was there—I said "No, I have not seen her since the afternoon when I saw you"—he said "I have been home, and I found the door was locked; but I could hear the child in the room. I will go back and break the door open"—he then went away—he returned in about 10 minutes and said "I have broke the door open and found her drunk on the bed; you had better come and see for yourself"—I said "No, I do not wish to come; I would rather not come"—I asked Thomas Albert, a lodger in the house, if he would go—he said "I don't wish to go"—I said "Do go"—he said "I will go if the boy will go with me"—that was Richard Austin, who also lodges in my house—the prisoner then went away, and Albert and Austin followed him—some little time after Albert came and fetched me, and on going into the room I saw my niece down on the floor, crouched up, with her hands to her head—the prisoner, Austin, and the child were in the room—I took hold of Mrs. Scoines by the arms and said "Polly, Polly, rouse yourself up," but she did not speak to me; she appeared to be insensible—I said to the prisoner "Roger, raise her on the bed," and he lifted her on the bed; and as he did so her clothes were lifted up and I saw blood on her stockings—I raised her clothes higher and found more blood, and I said "Oh dear, who has done this?"—the prisoner said "I suppose you will say I have done it. If so, you had better leave the room"—I looked at her again, and felt that her hands were quite cold—I went to the door and called out "Police, police! will any person in the house come to my assistance?" but no person answered me or came—a few minutes afterwards Albert came into the room, and I called his attention to her stockings, likewise her hands—he felt her pulse and said "You had better take her to the hospital, Roger"—that was the name we called the prisoner—she was taken to the hospital and I remained, taking charge of the child till the prisoner returned—I went to the room again at 11 o'clock next morning to fetch the child to my house, as the prisoner had to go to the hospital at 12 o'clock—I did not notice a pail in the room</p>

I hare got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the gentleman gave me, and I can give you that, and I dare say if the horse suits he will bring the remainder up in a day or two and you can have that"—he said, "That won't do for me, I cannot afford to keep people's horses here for nothing and get no money for it, if I let it go I shall not get a copper"—I began to speak up and said I wanted my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back—Wicks and the liveryman Smith were there—Mrs. Lowry said, "Oh, yon can't have that back, you must fetch the remainder of the money, and then you can have the horse"—they shoved a cart against the stable and I could not get the horse out—we had a few words and I sent off my brother to fetch my young master—we all had a talk about it—I did not get my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, and I did not get the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 72, Coleman Street, and am a fine art pub<lb/>lisher—on 15th March I saw an advertisement about a horse, 15 1/2 high, and in consequence went to 38, Southampton Street, Pentonville, a small private house—as I drove up Wicks came to the door, and said "You have come about the advertisement?" I said "Yes, I should like to see the horse"—he said "It is just a few doors off, if you will follow me I will show it to you"—I just saw Mrs. Lowry at the side of the door, she was looking out; I don't think she could hear what passed, she could see us—I went just round the corner, to a stable at a dairy—Wicks said the advertisement would give me every particular—I fetched the adver<lb/>tisement from my brougham, and looked at it again—Wicks said his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> had sold the business and had no further use for the horse—he did not say what the business was; I concluded it was a milk business—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188304300059"/>
               <p>he said it was not worth while putting it in harness, because it could be sent on to my stables, "but," he said, "you had better go round and see the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> about it"—upon that I went back to 38, Southampton Street, and saw Mrs. Lowry—I did not know her name—no name was given in the advertisement—Wicks went with me, and heard everything that passed—she said "I will let you have the horse on trial for a fort<lb/>night;" I said I did not require it for a fortnight, if I tried it for an hour it was safe, and I said it could be sent down to our stables in the City, and I could let her know by the next day whether it would suit—she said "I will send it," but afterwards she said "Will you send for it? it will save my man trouble;" I agreed to do so—before I left she said that she should like a small deposit left—I said "What is the idea of a deposit? I am not buying the horse;" she said it was just simply as a guarantee that I meant business—I said "What amount shall I leave you?" she said she would leave it to me—I said "Will 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be sufficient?" she said "Perfectly"—I said "I will not leave it, but I will send it with my man when I send for the horse"—I called my man in who drove me, John Barton, and told him in their presence I would give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he was to bring, and that he must take the horse away, but not to leave the money without the horse, and I said "Is that right, madam?" she said "Yes"—I left, and afterwards gave my man 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with directions to go for the horse—he came back in about half an hour, without the horse, and showed me this receipt—I sent him back a second time—he returned a second time without the horse and without the money, and I went with a constable to the prisoners' house—I there saw both of them, and said "Why did you not send the horse?" Mrs. Lowry said "You never sent the whole money"—I said "I have not bought the horse of you"—she said I had, and she had given my man the receipt—I said "Unless you pay me the money back I will give you both into custody;" Wicks said I had better be careful what I said, or he would have me up for damages—I charged them, the constable took them in custody, and they walked willingly to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in London about 18 years—I thought it rather strange that Lowry would let me have the horse without knowing who I was—she said my address was sufficient—if I were selling a horse I should not trust a stranger because his address was in the directory—it was a fair-conditioned brown horse.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, residing at Chesterfield—on 5th April I was staying at Wheeler's Hotel, Devonshire Square, and: about midnight was walking through Devonshire Street coming home—I was set on by three men who came out of a court in Cavendish Road—I had my watch in my pocket two or three minutes before, as I looked at the time—they came up with a rush and threw me in the road—one of them held me by the shoulders, and one got hold of my legs and held them, and the third got hold of the guard and pulled—I called out "Help, help!" as loudly as I could, and one of them said "Put your hand on his mouth"—they did so, but in doing it they liberated one shoulder, and I caught hold of one of the hands over my mouth and shouted out again "Help, help!"—a policeman came up and succeeded in securing one of the men—I lost my chain and have not seen it since—the watch remained in my pocket broken off at the ring—this bar of the chain is mine, I believe—the value of the chain was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot identify any one—I could only see the one in a stooping position holding my legs; I did not see his face at all—my face was hurt by my cheeks being pressed against my teeth—I am not suffering from it now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Twyford Street, Caledonian Road, Islington, and am an engine driver on the Great Northern Railway—on the night of 9th April I locked the front parlour door and left the key in, and went to bed about 9.20—the outside door was shut—about 12.15 I heard a click, listened, and thought I heard someone in the house—I got up, opened my bedroom door, and saw a light shining out of the front room into the passage—I pushed the passage door open and went into the room—I saw two men—the prisoner stood with his back towards me; I saw his face afterwards—I said, "What are you up to here?" and I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the other man—we had a struggle—I was in my night-shirt with nothing on my feet; he trod on my toes and got away from me—they both got away—my bedroom is on the same floor as my sitting-room—the gas was alight in the sitting-room—when I came back I noticed that a writing-desk which had stood on the top cupboard was on the table and broken open—several papers and letters from it were strewn about—an ivory penholder with a gold pen in it were laid on the table, and the tongs were laid on the table—they left their bats and silk scarves behind them—I saw the prisoner's face, he tamed round to me—I gave information to the police, and a few days</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Lovett, a solicitor, of 4, King William Street, who acted for Mr. Chittock in the action of Chittock <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Marshall—the writ is dated March 25th, 1882, and the judgment April 24th, 1882, for 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. debt, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. costs—Marshall carried on business at 116, Kingsland Road—the balance at first is "To goods 608<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" then there is "By cash 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Discount 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Balance 444<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the balance contains a bill for 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a cheque of Lodes and Son for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that judgment was never satisfied—I have got a writ in the action of Lovett <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Martin, dated April 14th, 1882—it is for the balance of bills drawn by Thomas Marshall, accepted by Charles Chaplin, endorsed Thomas Marshall to Chittock, for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. interest, and dated 8th April, 1882—the judgment is dated May 5th, and there is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—there was a writ of elegit—the officer has it—on 3rd May I went to 106, Kingsland Road—the premises were closed, and I only saw the housekeeper—I went over the premises—there was no stock, simply a <hi rend="italic">trolly</hi> in the shop, no stock there or in the warehouse, and only a little office stock at the back part of the place—as I was leaving I saw Marshall get out of a tram car and come towards the premises—I asked where he had removed his stock to—he declined to tell me—I told him I knew of the judgment, and no doubt that was why he had moved it—while speaking to him Hammond got out of another tram car, and I said "Are you the manager of Marshall?"—he said "I am"—I said "Where is the stock gone to, and the things from 116, Kingsland Road?"—he laughed, and refused to tell me—I found out that some of the goods had been taken from there to Middleton Road, and went there on the 16th with a Sheriffs officer, and tried to get possession, and get the goods, but was unable to do so—I got possession after Marshall's trial, and the goods sold for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the costs were 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was present in June, when Marshall was con<lb/>victed at Middlesex Sessions of removing his goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Lovett was one of the prosecutors in that case, and I believe he is one in this case; Mr. Carder is another—there is a count for defrauding Mr. Peverley; I do not know whether he is Chittick—he is not here—Chittick took the business from Peverley, and carried it on—there is a real Peverley—I do not know him, but I may have seen him—Chittick is not our client now—Mr. Lovett lost money by him—he was our client when we issued this writ—I believe he has absconded—he is a bankrupt, and I believe he is running away from his creditors—I am</p>

               <p>almost certain he gave evidence against Marshall, and after that he went away—he never authorised us to put this Count into the indictment, alleging that he had been defrauded—I believe there is a writ out against him from the Bankruptcy Court—he was not called at the police-court—I don't know whether he had absconded then—he became our client through several matters of business—Mr. Lovett discounted an 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for him, drawn by Marshall, accepted by Mr. Chaplin, and endorsed to Mr. Chittick—this 164<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is part of the amount of which I say the prisoner has defrauded Chittick—Marshall did not plead guilty, he was tried and found guilty; his sentence was postponed from one Session to another for two months, that he might make restitution of the pro<lb/>party; he said that there was sufficient at Middleton Road to satisfy all his creditors—I saw him several times in the House of Correction after his conviction—I did not press him to make a statement against Ham<lb/>mond—I do not think I suggested it, but my documents will speak for themselves—I have Marshall's statement signed in the presence of the prison authorities and taken down from his own lips after his conviction, for the purpose of getting up evidence—I did not press him to make a statement against Hammond to put pressure on Lodes, of Norwich—I did not endeavour to get the money from Lodes which Mr. Lovett had discounted the 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for—I did not actually serve Marshall with a debtor's summons in bankruptcy; I don't-serve debtor summonses—I did not ask Marshall to allow me to serve it, and let it go by default, it if your own imagination—I did not charge Mr. Lodes at the police-court; Mr. Carder applied for a criminal process against Lodes for conspiring with the prisoner, and he was brought up and evidence given against him and for him, and the Magistrate—dismissed the case, saying that there was not sufficient evidence for a Jury to convict, he could not even find a <hi rend="italic">prima-facis</hi> case—Mr. Cooke, Mr. Lodes'a manager or traveller, was called and examined at length—I heard his evidence—it was taken down—I charged Hammond at the police-court with aiding and abetting Marshall in receiving the goods in defeat of judgment—the Magistrate dismissed that charge—I did not then prefer this charge, it was preferred I should say before the Magistrate dismissed the original charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I can tell Mr. Grain in detail what Marshall was charged with before he was tried—this is a draft of the indictment and this is Mr. Fulton's brief, who appeared before the Magistrate, by which I see that Marshall was committed for trial on June 7th—I think he was tried on June 21st or 22nd—the trial began about midday and went on till 7 p.m.—I did not then know that Hammond was carrying on Marshall's business—it was on 17th August that I went to the prison and made notes—that was after sentence had been passed on him—he was not recom<lb/>mended to mercy by Mr. Chittick or Mr. Lovett—he had not given up the key and the goods were gone—I did not know that Hammond had got the goods away—he did not tell mo they had gone to Lodes and Son—from the time of his committal till he gave up the key he was in prison and could not give it up—I visited him because Lodes and Son had tried to make Mr. Good bankrupt on some bills of exchange which had been paid to Aden and Son by the prisoner—Mr. Good stated that the goods had been obtained from him by fraud—the interview with the prisoner was for the purpose of getting up the evidence—these are my entries (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I attended again on 18th and 24th August, and I have</p>

                  </hi>. I am now working for my father, a pawnbroker—prior to July, 1882, I was a furniture dealer at 173, Hoxton Road—about November, 1881, Hammond came to me with Marshall—Hammond said that he was Mr. Hammond, of Norwich, and had taken a lease of 106, Kingsland Road, and was going to start Marshall in business there as a boot and shoe maker, and he required furniture for household pur<lb/>poses for which he, Hammond, would be responsible—he' showed me one or two documents, and a letter from his solicitor respecting the house, and chose bedsteads and bedding, value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I delivered the goods; while the order was being executed he chose office furniture, value 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was delivered at Kingsland Road—he paid me and asked me to make out the bill for a suite and a carpet which I delivered at 106, Kingsland Road, in the name of E. Field and Co., of Norwich—in February or March, 1882, he said, "I can help you to do a great deal better than you are doing now, if you were to start as an auctioneer I could supply you with goods"—I said, "I have not enough money to do so"—he said, "I can draw bills on you and you can get them discounted"—I objected, but said I liked the idea of being an auctioneer—he got me to sign a four months' bill for 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he wrote the body of it; I accepted it—he took it-to Norwich, there was then no drawer's name to it—he brought it back torn in half and said he had met with a mishap—he asked me to accept another for the same amount, which I did—I kept on asking him where it was, and he said he had given it to Chittick to discount—there was another four months' bill for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which came due on 21st July—he could not get Chittick to discount it, and he said he was going to take it down to Lodes to discount, and I was to put the money into the bank and buy furniture with it, which he had the means of getting rid of at Norwich, as he knew the Mayor there, who was an auctioneer, and if I sent the goods there for sale he would bring me the money and we could turn it over again the following week, but I never got a farthing—the office furniture which I supplied first was paid for, but in April Hammond called with Mannion and ordered some furniture to be sent to Mr. Egan, to whom I sent about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—Hammond said he would be responsible for it, that he owed money to Egan, but he thought he would give me a chance, and he would pay me, and it would go off Egan's account—I have been paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—Hammond owes me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now besides the bills—were was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of household furniture which he sent Marshall to buy—I suppose that was for Marshall's benefit—he said that Marshall was going to bring his wife to London, but the goods were delivered at Bishopsgate Street, and Hammond met them there and took them to Norwich—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the debtor's summons served on me in respect of the bills in Mr. Lodes's possession—I never saw Hammond again till I saw him in Norwich County Court, in February this year—I was subpoenaed there in an action against the <hi rend="italic">Daylight</hi> news<lb/>paper</p>

I am waiting for a tramcar, the best thing you can do is to walk alone with me a short distance till a tramcar overtakes us"—after we had walked a little way I thought she seemed nervous, and asked her if she would have a little drink to revive her—she said she would, and she had three-pennyworth of whisky—I had three-pennyworth of brandy—we walked half a mile farther, and came to another public-house, and she said "Are you going to give me another drink?"—I said "If you think you want it I have no objection," and she had gin and I had bitter ale—when we came out she asked me what I was going to give her, and solicited me to go down a private road—I said I would give her sixpence, and we walked down the road—as we walked down the road I touched my waistcoat pocket, and found my purse was gone—I had seen it safe when I had started to go down the road—it contained 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in two half-crowns, a florin, and small coins—I accused her of taking it—she denied it—I said "You have taken it out of my pocket, and unless you deliver it up I shall charge you"—a constable came up—I gave her in charge—I went down the lane again with the constable to the spot where I detained her—I was a short distance from him when he found the purse on the road—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I usually carry it in my waistcoat pockets—it had a postage stamp and a small key besides the money.</p>

You had better be careful what you do say"—she replied in a very excited state "Yes, I have killed her, and would myself if I had the opportunity; I done it in the way no one else would have my children"—I took her to the station, where she was charged—I read the charge over to her, and she said "I wish I had caused my own"—she spoke very much about the baby, wanting to know what state it was in, and was desirous of getting it—from Saturday till Monday morning, when I took her before the Magistrate, she kept repeating that she wished she had the opportunity of doing away with herself—she had been carefully watched.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 96, Kennington Park Road—on Saturday, 24th March, at a quarter-past 8 in the evening, I was called to 22, Eaton Street—I there found a female child, aged between three and four, with her throat cut, quite dead—the wounds were the cause of death—in consequence of what was told me I then went over to No. 11, where I found the little baby with its throat cut, but still alive; I ordered it to be taken to the Lambeth Infirmary—I then went to the police-station, where I found the prisoner—she asked me to give her her baby; I told her I would see about it—she was in a very nervous, excitable state, very excitable indeed—that was the first time I had seen her—in consequence of the state she was in I gave directions that she should be watched and taken care of.</p>

               <p>January I went to Mr. Martin's premises, Cardigan Road, Bow, and his son and a lad named Busher opened the gates—the van backed and we loaded it with 62 bales of wool which were in the yard about. 20 yards from the gate—I took them to the Royal Mint Street Station, and young Martin handed me this consignment note, "John Martin, 92, Cardigan Road. Consigned to Mr. George Hasleden, wool stapler, Upper George Yard, Halifax, 12 bales of wool, 1 to 12. Please forward weights"—the weights were put in afterwards—I cut two or three of the bags to prevent them slipping.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the eldest son of the prisoner Martin—I am 15 years of age—I left school last year—since then I have been doing what I could to assist my father in his business—I was taken into custody at the same time as my father, and was charged with receiving these 12 bales of wool—the Magistrate dismissed the charge against me—my father deals in wool—I have assisted in copying invoices into this book—many of them are in my writing—I generally get up in the morning from 8 to 8.30—on the morning of 31st January I was up when the wool came—I sleep dowstairs in the kitchen—I heard a knock at the door, and <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Bush</hi>) went to the gate—he was also taken in custody, and charged with receiving this wool, and was discharged by the Magistrate—when the gate was opened I saw 12 bales of wool in bags in a two-horse van—I went to my father, who was in bed, and said "Father, Henry has brought some wool"—he said "Very well, I will be down presently"—I went down and told Henry that father was not up—he said "Very well, that does not matter now"—the wool was rolled in while I went to tell father; it was put in the yard—there was about 20 other bales of wool there at the time, before the 12 were taken in—they were left in the yard until the Great Northern Railway men came and fetched them away about 1 o'clock—I was there at the time—I could not say how long this tarpaulin had been in the yard; I had seen it there—at one time father had some wool to go away, and the Great Northern Railway men left it underneath the bales; they were constantly coming to the place—the next day after this wool went away I went with father to Halifax, and there saw Mr. Heselton—he also went to Jowetts and Barker, of Leeds, and Rose, of Halifax, for business purposes—they are all dealers in wool with whom he had done business—we returned on the Saturday, 3rd February—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I made it out, under father's instruction, before it went away—I put the date on it at the time; it is the 5th—that was the date on which I made it out, and then it was sent off to Mr. Heselton's—it was copied into this invoice-book because the copying-press we used was broken—it was a wooden one—I believe that was the only reason why it was not copied—I usually copied them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Henry I have spoken of is the prisoner Henry: he is the man who came with the van—Bentley came with him—there was a third man, a carman—I could not swear to him—I think I knew Henry by name—he had brought wool once or twice in small quantities—we never had such a lot before from him—I did not know that he was</p>

               <p>a working lighterman on the river—he gave father a card—I did not know where he lived or where he carried on business—I knew Bentley by name—I did not know that he was a working lighterman—he was in the habit of coming with wool when Henry brought some—I did not know his Christian name—they generally came together when wool came—I did not know where Bentley lived or his place of business, or anything about him except bringing wool—I did not know Nicholls at all—I did not know that this van load of 12 bales of wool was coming—my father did not come down till about 10.30, after the wool was all unloaded—I don't think the bales were bound with iron—I know Mr. Heselton; we had done business with him before—I believe my father saw the bales when he came down—he examined the wool after he had had his break<lb/>fast; it was piled up in the yard; we had no room for any more—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is father's scribbling diary—these entries on January, February, and March are mine—it contains a sort of ledger account with Mr. Heselton—the transaction of 6th February, 12 bales, 159<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was entered on foolscap, I believe; I don't know why it was not entered here—the entry of February 5th is my father's—he marked these bales—they were sent off at about 1 o'clock in the day—no invoice or slip of paper or any<lb/>thing was left with the bales—my father has had considerable experience in the wool trade—I did not notice all the shipping marks on the 12 bales—Henry promised to send an invoice on—he said "Tell your father that the invoice is to follow"—it never did follow—I suppose you have got invoices of the previous transactions among the books somewhere—this receipt for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we got at Halifax is my writing; I signed it in my father's name—I don't know why he did not sign it; I dare say he can write—we came back on Saturday, 3rd February—I believe father paid Henry and Bentley—I did not see him—I don't know that he paid them; he told me he had paid something on account—I have not got the receipt; I never saw it—I do not see any cheque among the counterfoils in this cheque book paid to Henry or Bentley—I don't know whether the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque from Halifax was paid into father's bank—I made out this delivery note; my father told me what to write—I did not know the weight; our scales are not large enough to weigh them—my father has no name up outside—he does not deal in anything else but wools that I know of—I knew he had the boots, not the trousers or coats; I knew he had some shirts—I did not know who brought them, or when—Alfred Bush assists in the business—I examined the bales in the yard before my father went to the Great Northern.</p>

I live at 173, Tredegar Road, Bow—I have known Martin for nearly 10 years, carrying on business in Cardigan Road as a dealer in wool and sheepskins—I knew a man John Clegg; he carried on business in Bevans Road, Bromley—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of his memorandum forms—I knew him for the last four or five years—in January last he had been ill some time; about the 16th he was very ill,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These memorandums being read, one was addressed to the St. Katherine Dock Company</hi>: "Please deliver to Martin the bales now lying to my order, and oblige yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN CLEGG</hi>."<hi rend="italic">The other was</hi>: "Mr. Martin, I have sent you the delivery order, please cash per return.") I was in Clegg's room on the Tuesday before he died—I recognise this document; it is dated January 16th, 1883—it was written out by Martin, and Clegg made that cross and I signed my name there—Clegg wanted us to be executors to dispose of his goods after his death, and Martin wrote that out—Clegg was very bad at the time that he made the cross—it was in another ink and my own pen; I generally carry an ink bottle with me when I am making deals, to make a memorandum, I cannot always trust to my memory—I am a general dealer. (<hi rend="italic">This memorandum was dated</hi> 16th <hi rend="italic">January</hi>, 1883: "I, John Martin, do undertake to sell all goods for John Clegg, and repay myself 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on balance borrowed, the balance to be given to his wife and daughters.") It was well known that money was owing to Martin; I knew it—I actually saw Martin lend Clegg 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself, or I knew it at the time—I did not actually see the money pass, but I understood it did—Louisa Clegg, the daughter, was present what this document was made out, and when the cross was put by the dying man—after Clegg's death Mrs. Clegg received some more money from Martin on Clegg's behalf—I saw Martin give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the daughter—Clegg had one man in his employ—after his death I paid the man; Martin gave me the money to pay him with—I don't know how much, I never made a memorandum of it—after Clegg's death I removed his goods to Martin's in a van—Martin was with me—it is impossible to tell all I moved, because there were so many sundries; I counted them at the time—there were six or seven bags of what they call skin pieces, about 15 cwt. of wool sweepings, and there were some bags of clothes, but I did not have a good look at them, because it rained so much—there were some cheeses, there were two in one bag—there was what looked like white linen, but what it was composed of I could not tell—all the things were moved to Martin's place in the week Clegg died—I had to do with his funeral—Fox was the undertaker—I saw the money paid, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this looks like the receipt—Martin paid it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Olave's Chambers, Tabard Street—on 81st March, about 10.30 p.m., I had just come over London Bridge towards the Borough, and Burke stepped up to me under the railway arch and said "Are you going for a walk?"—I said "I don't want any <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> with you at all," and turned towards the station—she pushed me against some shutters, and I found her hand in my right trousers pocket—I said "Don't take those few halfpence, it is all I have got"—I had a shilling and a few pence in my purse—I pressed her hand and Connor stepped up and hit me on the mouth with his fist and loosened two of my teeth <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and two more <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and one was taken out at the station—a constable came up and Connor went away, but was brought back—I was almost <hi rend="italic">insenseless</hi>.</p>

               <p>from his mouth—he gave both the prisoners in custody—Connor was very violent and said that he would go to no b police-station—I struggled with him and Bold came up and took Burke—the charge was read over at the station and Connor said "If you don't say two months on Monday morning I shall call on the inspector as a witness"—the divisional surgeon saw Kempshell at the station, and finding one tooth hanging to the gum, pulled it out with his fingers, and two more teeth were very loose.</p>

Seven or eight weeks ago I advertised for a potman and barman, and Rosser called on me and told me he had been in the employ of Mr. Gardener at the Ship, Marigold Street, Rotherhithe, and that Mr. Gardener had sold the house about two months, and he wanted a situation. He said he had been employed at the Ship about a year and 10 months. He told me I should find Mr. Gardener at the White Hart in Aylesbury Street, Clerkenwell. I said I would call there about 11 in the morning. He said a friend of Mr. Gardener's kept the White Hart, and he was living there. I called at the White Hart on the following morning, I believe. I asked for Mr. Gardener, and a man behind the bar pointed to a man in front of the bar that was not the witness Gardener. I spoke to that person, and asked if he had a man named Rosser in his employ. He said 'Yes.' I asked if he had been in his employ a year and 10 months. He said 'Yes.' I asked if he was the man that kept the Ship, Rotherhithe, and he said 'Yes,' and I asked if he was honest and industrious, and he said 'Yes,' and he corroborated all that Rosser had previously told me as far as his character went. With that I left him. I felt satisfied that the man was right enough. Before I left the White Hart, Rosser came into the bar, and he asked me if the character I had received was satisfactory from Mr. Gardener. I told him 'Yes,' I and he was to come to work on the Saturday following. He came to work on the Saturday morning, and he was in my employment at the time he was apprehended. I have nothing at all to say against him as to his honesty. I can prove nothing, and I will say nothing.</p>
