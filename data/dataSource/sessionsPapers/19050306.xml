                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the secretary's office at the General Pest Office—in February information came to my knowledge, in consequence of which I gave certain instructions to Thomas Bradford—on February 15th, about 6.40, I was at the sorting office at Mount Pleasant—I knew the prisoner by sight at that time—he was a porter and his chief duty was to convey packets from the table where they arrive in the mail bag to the table where they were afterwards sorted—he was employed at the table where the French packets were dealt with—I saw him look round the office—he then went to a basket and took this packet out, addressed to Madame Du Visme, hurriedly put it in the upper part of his apron and walked out of the sorting office—the packet was then concealed—I gave instructions to Bradford to tell the prisoner I wished to see him—I saw him and cautioned him and told him who I was—I said, "A minute or two ago you put a packet in your apron and apparently into one of your pockets; what explanation have you to give?"—he took the packet from his apron and said, "I was not going to keep it; I was going to look at it"—I said, "You had left the sorting office when you were spoken to by Mr. Bradford and you were in the passage"—he replied, "I was going to the w.c. and I did not intend to keep the packet"—I saw the packet—it was closed then—there was something on the outside of it in French, indicating that it was a book packet—it was opened at the Police Court and contained two French school books—shortly afterwards a Post Office constable brought me these French papers and post cards—there were thirty-two post cards in one packet and sixteen in another; also three French periodicals—the sixteen post cards are stamped as having passed through the post—the others are unstamped and were sent under cover—the prisoner said, referring to the post cards, "They belong to the office; they are what I stole. The unstamped ones I stole out of a packet about a month ago.

I am an overseer in the Post Office—part of my duty is to attend to the sorting office at Mount Pleasant—I knew the prisoner as being a porter there and carrying certain packets which had arrived by the French mail to a table where they would be sorted—on February 14th I saw him place a packet in his coat pocket—he took it from No. 1 bag opening table—he left the office and went to the w.c.—I repeated what I had seen to Mr. Watts—I had seen the prisoner pick up several packets and examine them—Mr. Watts gave me certain instruc<lb/>tions—he was with me about 7 p.m. on February 15th—I saw the prisoner place a packet under his apron, leave the sorting office and go towards the w.c's—I went after him and found him outside the office—I told him a gentleman in the secretary's office wished to speak to him—he came with me to the first floor, where Mr. Watts told him he was seen to put a packet under his apron—the prisoner produced it and said, "I did not intend to steal it as I was only going to look at it"—I was present when his locker was searched and these post cards and French newspapers were found—I went to Mr. Watts and the prisoner said, "These cards are what I have taken from the sorting"—there were two lots—of one lot he said, "These I have taken out of a packet"—those were the plain ones—he said he had taken the journals about a month ago—Mr. Watts asked him where the cover was and he said he did not know.</p>

When a letter came my husband always received it; it was not my business"—she said she did not know where he was—I found out afterwards that he was detained in the Dublin Bridewell—I sent to the Dublin police, who arrested him on the 20th—I went to Dublin and showed him the warrant—I cautioned him—I told him in French he would be charged with stealing money and with stealing a cheque, and with forging an endorsement to the cheque—he said, "Yes, I took the money with his authorisation"—I know him very well; I had met him at Whitcombe Street—he said, "You remember the evening (<hi rend="italic">referring to Ganna</hi>) Pena was locked up, and I paid the lawyer £17 for him. I kept two women at my house, and afterwards I gave Pena money. He told me I could take my money from the cheque when it came. I would not trust him to pay me, so I cashed it myself"—the two women he referred to were Ganna's wife and Poffo's wife—I then produced to him four £5 notes and two brooches, each composed of a sovereign and two half sovereigns—I also showed him two slips showing the dispatch of a registered letter to Madame Buchlar and one to his wife at Princess Court—one letter was from the Post Office in College Green in Dublin, dated February 15th, and the other from an address in France, which is illegible—the numbers of the notes are 35002-3-4, and 8, and they are dated August 4th, 1904—the note Buchlar attempted to cash is No. 34005—I showed these notes to Caccia, and the register slips and said to him, "These notes were taken from you in the presence of Detective Lannaghan of the Dublin police, and they are part of what you received in exchange for the cheque"—he said, "Yes, the register slip is the one I sent to my wife"—I brought him up to London—on the way he produced this account, written in Italian—he said, "Here is the bill which he owes me. It comes to £66, so I have to return him £13"—the items are exaggerated—I took him to Vine police station and charged him—he said, "Yes, with his authorisation."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Sangora Road, New Wands<lb/>worth, and am a clerk at the Credit Lyonnais Bank, Lombard Street, the head office in London—on January 4th a man I do not remember presented a cheque for which I gave eight £5 notes and the rest in gold and silver—he gave the name of Ganna Mario and identified himself by letters and envelopes in his possession—the numbers on the notes are 35001-8 and they are dated August 4th, 1904—I did not see him endorse the cheque—it is endorsed.</p>

I am a clerk in the Issue Department of the Bank of England—on February 18th I remember a woman accompanied by a boy presenting a £5 note number 35005, dated August 4th, 1904—at my request she or the boy wrote her name on it—she had to go near the stove, where the inkpot is—on the back is "4, Buchlar, Princess Court"—then on the front, "4, Buchlar"—when she came back to the counter I saw that it was a stopped note—I took her to the secretary's office and left her there.</p>

                  </hi> (25 <hi rend="italic">H.R.</hi>) About 5.15 p.m., on February 24th, I was on duty in Virginia Road, Bethnal Green, with another constable, when Francis came up to me and said he had lost a van load of leather cuttings—I said, "Where have you lost them from?"—he said, "Huggin Lane, City"—I asked him if he could give me a description of the van, or any<lb/>thing, and he said, "No," and I then advised him to go to the police station—I went to Brick Lane, and kept observation on No. 277—about 5.45 p.m. a van drove up and two men jumped out and went into No. 277—I went up to the carman and told him to get down; I then said to them all, "Consider yourselves in custody"—shortly afterwards Robinson and Francis came up, and Mr. Francis said, pointing to Castle, "That is my man. I will charge him"—the men were taken to Commercial Street station, where they were detained—on the way to the station Castle said, "I employed those two men. They cannot know anything about it. I am employed by a fair-haired man," meaning the driver—I went back for the driver, but could not find him, but he was eventually taken to Cloak Lane police station—he was not charged, as I had not sufficient evidence to connect him with it—I am quite certain that Yoxall was the man who took the sample in.</p>

I am a carman and contractor, of 2, President Place, where I work with my father, I managing the vans, and he the wood—on February 24th Castle and another man came to me and said they wanted a van to go to Huggin Lane, City, to get some leather cuttings, and from there to go to Brick Lane—I went with them in a van to Huggin Lane, I driving—on reaching there I looked after the van, and did not see them going into a shop—they then came up with some sacks on a trolley and put them on the van—Castle said to me, "Drive to St. Martin's Lane"—on getting there we waited about a quarter of an hour for a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> whom Castle said he was expecting—on the <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> not turning up Castle said, "Drive me to Gee Street"—on getting to Gee Street I pulled up at the corner of Golden Lane as it was such a narrow thoroughfare—I went to a coffee shop to have some tea while Castle went to try and find his <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>—he came back and said he had left a note for him, saying that he would either be at the coffee shop or at Brick Lane—he went away again and brought back Yoxall—it was then 6.30 p.m., and as I had something else to do I asked another carman to take Castle and Yoxall to Brick Lane—I know Castle from having done one job for him before—it was he who paid me.</p>

I am being punished for the guilt of another man who the police are now searching for; if he is not found, the police tell me, I shall have to suffer for the lot. This man employed me to do odd jobs for him from the City to any place he might tell me to go. On Friday, February 24th, he came round to the place I was stopping at, and told me he had a load of goods coming home from the City, but I would have to get a van. I gets the van, and he tells the carman to drive to Huggin Lane, City; when we get there he tells me to take the weight of the stuff as the man weighs it off. I did so, and after we had loaded up he tells me I need not wait for him, but to go off and have some tea and meet him at Smith's, of Brick Lane, about 5.30. On the way home the carman tells me he will have to go home and get another carman to take the van as he has his own regular job to do at six o'clock. While the carman is having his tea, I leave the van under his care while I go to a friend of mine to ask him to come and give me a help to unload when we got to Brick Lane. On our arrival at Smith's, of Brick Lane, me and my friend jumps down and goes in smith thinking to find my employer there, but he had not come yet. On going out of the shop we was stopped by two constables, who asked us Whether we was in charge of cuttings what was in the van, and I answered "Yes," The constable then told me he would have to take me in charge as the goods had been</p>

               <p>stolen, and we was both taken to the station and charged with being con<lb/>cerned with a man, not in custody, of obtaining or stealing goods by means of a trick. The man Yoxall did not even know where the goods had come from, but merely came for a ride with me, thinking to earn something by helping me to unload. All I have stated here I swear, by my Heavenly Father, is the truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>

Ellis," but not by me or by my authority or by my brother—I am the only one who has the power to indorse cheques, which I do in a different manner to my usual signature—the receipt of the amount was not entered in the cash book—on another counterfoil there appears 3s. received from a Mr. Roberts—it is in the prisoner's writing—the prisoner had given Mr. Roberts a receipt on the invoice without using the receipt form, which was irregular—we never received Mr. Roberts' cheque.</p>

B.</hi>), on which I recognise my signature—this was about 8 p.m., and next morning I handed the prisoner the cheque—it was made payable to him in accordance with instructions I received from him, to prevent having to send the cheque to London for indorsement—in the ordinary course the cheque would be indorsed and paid into the Credit Lyonnais, and this cheque is indorsed by the prisoner—I obtained this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Ex. D.</hi>) from M. Stern's secretary for the purposes of this prosecution; that is all I know about M. Stern's account.</p>

I am a clerk employed by Sandon &amp; Co. at their Paris branch—Mr. Stern's valet came to the shop, saying he would first go to the bank to cash a cheque, and then would come back and pay M. Stern's account—I told the prisoner what the valet had said, and at his request I made out this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Ex. D.</hi>) ready for him when he came back—I was told afterwards by the prisoner that the valet had come in and paid the money—this receipt is not dated—I was instructed not to date receipts by the prisoner—this was about March 25th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The reason he told me not to date receipts was that he did not always receive from the London office his cheque for petty cash, and he had to use money that he received, and afterwards bank it: and he did not want the dates on the receipt and on the bank book to be different—I cannot tell you whether I thought that to be a proper ex<lb/>planation for not putting in the dates; I had to go by the orders I received.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Sandon &amp; Co., tailors, of 8. Saville Row, W., and we have a branch at 5, Rue Clement Marot, Paris—the prisoner is our agent; he is called that in our agreement with him; on May 27th, 1898, he was the manager of our business over there under that agreement—the prisoner was certainly our servant. [<hi rend="italic">Paragraph</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">of the agreement was then read, in which it was stated that the said William Clarke Oliphant should keep proper books of account, in which he should enter every transaction and matter, however small, in any wise concerning the agency; that on Monday in every week, except bank Holidays, he should send a full, correct and dear statement in writing of all monies goods, orders and transactions which were received, sold, delivered,</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">or should have taken place in relation to the agency during the preceding week; and that he should send till monies received by him direct to them. Paragraph</hi> 8 <hi rend="italic">stated that Sandon &amp; Co. agreed to pay the rent and all other expenses in connection with the establishment in Paris, and that the prisoner should not incur expenses without their special authority in writing.</hi>] I cannot say that all monies received by the prisoner were remitted to London, as at first the expenses he was put to were deducted from the money that he received until we got into a more regular method of pro<lb/>ceeding—he bought a banker's cheque and remitted the balance to us in London—in June, 1901, we opened an account with the Credit Lyonnais in Paris, and after that date instead of remittances being made to us, it was his duty to pay every penny he received into the bank in Paris with<lb/>out any deduction whatever—we sent him a cheque on that same bank for the amount of his expenses, and he went to the Dank, drew the amount of the cheque, and so was put in funds—in the first instance a sum of £20 was placed at his disposal in cash, so that he could pay his petty expenses, and that sum was renewed every week—he used to send me a slip day by day recording the amounts paid into the Paris bank; if he paid in to-day, he would send the slip in the evening—I have a bundle of such slips re<lb/>ceived by me, in the prisoner's handwriting in 1904, and January, 1905—on receiving these slips I would enter the amounts on them in a book called the Paris Cash Account, kept specially for that purpose (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I had no other means of making entries in that book except from the slips—I have the receipt (<hi rend="italic">Ex. B.</hi>) and the cheque (<hi rend="italic">Ex. C.</hi>) before me re<lb/>lating to Baron de Rothschild's account—the prisoner did not tell Us he had received that cheque until he came to London in January, and that account remained on our books all the time as unpaid, and it is now—I have the receipt before me (<hi rend="italic">Ex. D.</hi>) for £160 0s. 7d. received from M. Stern—the prisoner did not let us know that he had received that cheque until January, and that account still remains on our books as if it were unpaid—the prisoner went through this book (<hi rend="italic">Ledger produced</hi>) with me about twice a year, and certainly last year he did so in April and Sep<lb/>tember—on those occasions he never called my attention to the fact that there were no entries relating to the two accounts of Baron de Rothschild and M. Stern—on the morning of January 14th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Ex. K.</hi>) from him, addressed from the Langham Hotel: "Dear Sir,—When you have finished your pressing morning's work, could I trouble you to come and see me here? Kindly give an answer to bearer and oblige"—I had previously written him in Paris, saying that I intended going over to Paris in the early weeks of this year, and I received a letter from him suggesting that January was not a very good month in which to come to Paris, for some reasons not connected with business, and he suggested that I should leave it until a little later—I then wrote and said I was willing to defer it until the middle of February, and I received a letter from him saying he wished that I would go to Paris immediately, and that if I did not come he would come over to see me, and asking me to wire as to what I was going to do—I wired confirming my previous arrangement to go in the middle of February, and the next thing I heard was his note from the</p>

               <p>Langham Hotel on the Saturday morning—I gave a verbal message to the bearer that if the prisoner wished to see me he was to come to Saville Row before eleven o'clock that morning—he came and I invited him into one of the private rooms, and, having closed the door, I said "Well, Oliphant, what is the matter?"—he said, "Well, I have made an ass of myself"—I said, "What have you been doing?" and after a few rambling remarks he began to tell me that he had received certain sums of money which he had not paid into the bank and not accounted for, and he produced a slip with nine names on it (<hi rend="italic">Ex. A.</hi>) with the sums opposite, amounting in Eng<lb/>lish money to £745 5s. 6d., and said that he had received those monies, and had not accounted for them—there is a mistake in that list, the ac<lb/>counts against two of the names being transposed—I said, "Well, Oliphant, I might not have been surprised at your having made an ass of yourself, but it is a very different thing to come and confess to me that you are a thief," and I explained to him that it was an affair with which I could not deal—having consulted my partner, I sent round to Vine Street for a police inspector—Sergeant Tupper came first, and then In<lb/>spector Drew a few minutes later—I made a statement of the facts to Inspector Drew as far as I knew them—he then repeated to the prisoner the statement I had made to him, and the prisoner made a statement—he was taken into custody—if the prisoner received an order in Paris he wrote it out on a slip and sent it over to us, and we made the garments and sent them over—if there were slight alterations, they would be made in Paris, but anything taxing the skill of the staff would be sent over here—the accounts were sent to the customers from here, and generally in English money, except when we specially transferred it into French money for the convenience of a French customer—our accounts here Are kept in English money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had nothing to do with the books that related to the business of the firm generally in London, but there were no other account books referring to the Paris business except those kept in London, and those he went through with me when he came to London—it is his duty by paragraph 3 of the agreement to use his best en<lb/>deavours to solicit and to procure orders—he began those duties in 1898, and certainly he has been very successful—the year prior to his entering our employment we did about £2,000 a year turn-over in Paris, which has been raised to £7,000 a year since the prisoner has been acting for us—I am not interested to dispute the fact that that was the result of his procuring orders for us—those would be the gross receipts—our trade is done with people who are, generally speaking, in a better class of society than ourselves; that is to say, wealthy people—I should not say that any servant of ours was brought into contact with customers who are socially above himself; there would be no question of association—I wrote to the prisoner about his looking up his horsy friends and getting their accounts paid; I had previously written to him warning him against taking orders from jockeys and horsey people, and that the credit of jockeys was not good enough—I believe M. Stern is a sportsman—we cater largely for owners of race horses, because we are sporting tailors; our chief produc<lb/>tion</p>

               <p>is riding breeches—I have learnt since that the names on the slip is not an inclusive statement; I have had one or two accounts repudiated since—I suppose he could have run away if he had liked, and not come to England and confessed—I most distinctly refused to entertain any pro<lb/>posal of any kind in face of his statement to me—he said that he would see that every penny was paid back, but I am a business man and I have heard things like that before—I have heard of such a thing as compound<lb/>ing a felony—I did not mention that at the time—he kept in Paris a book in which he recorded the orders, but no account books of any kind.</p>

The amount will come to £745. I am very sorry indeed, but, whatever the result of this case is, I shall in due course pay every penny of it back"—I showed him this document (<hi rend="italic">Ex. A.</hi>) which I had got from Mr. Moore, and he said, "That is the list of monies I have received. I wrote it myself before I came here. I have lent the money to a gentleman in Paris for stock broking purposes to pay his debts. He told me he had to pay 10,000 francs. It has been going on now since February 26th last"—I wrote that statement down in his presence after cautioning him, and read it over to him—I then conveyed him to Vine Street police station, where he was charged, and on searching him I found £1 gold, a French 50 franc note, 5s. in silver, and a French pawn ticket for a ring; he said the ring was one he had advanced a man 100 francs on, and it is pawned for 30 francs; and an I.O.U. for 18,000 francs, dated February 26th, 1904, in Paris (<hi rend="italic">Ex.

On February 17th I went to Shadwell police station, and there saw in custody Hayes, Manning and Adams—I told them I was a police officer, and that they would be taken to Moor Lane police station, where they would be charged with being concerned with a man already in custody, named Hart, in obtaining goods by forged orders—Hayes said, "You are quite right"—Manning made no reply—they were taken to Moor Lane—they there all three volun<lb/>teered to make statements, which were taken down in rough notes—Hart was then brought out, and the statements were read over before all four—they were signed by the prisoners—I asked them if there was anything wrong in the statements and they said no, they were quite right.</p>

We afterwards sold one of the cases to a man whom, I think, is named Rolfe, who kept a shop in a basement in Fore Street, opposite Wood Street, for a sovereign.

                  <hi rend="italic">Manning, made on February</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th, read</hi>]: "As I was walking along Cam<lb/>bridge Heath on Thursday I met Hayes, Adams and Hart. We walked along till we got to the City. Hayes brought out some bills and sent Adams to a warehouse; we waited in a public-house, Hart and I together, and Adams came back with a parcel. Adams took the parcel into a shop and sold it; afterwards we shared the money, and Adams gave me 3s. 6d. I was not with them to-day, Friday; the place where I left them last night, the Camden Head, I met them to-night and they asked me to go round to Hart's address, where I was arrested. I have only known Adams and Hart but two days. Hayes I have known for about four months." [<hi rend="italic">Adams' statement, read</hi>]: "I have been in the habit of going to Newbery's, Charterhouse Square, and Lynch's, Silver Street, to order various articles for Hayes, and I have also been down to the docks with him to get the medical chest, and on Wednesday, lath inst., I met Hayes and Jack Hart, and we went to Newbery's, Charterhouse Square. Hayes came in with me and wrote out the order, which was for nine bottles of Bovril and two pounds of Plasmon chocolate; the Bovril I sold to a man in a shop in Aldersgate Street, for which I received £1 2s. On Thursday, 16th inst., I went with Hart, Hayes and Manning to Falcon Square, where we all had a drink, when I left the others for a little while. When I came back I saw Hayes with a number of razors and strops; we all then went to the Duke of York's theatre and then to the Lyceum theatre, where we went in, and after the performance we went home, Hart going to sleep with Hayes. About 11 a.m. this morning, the 17th, Hart and Hayes called at my place and Hayes told me he had been ringing up on the telephone, and asked me to go up to Newbery's and see if they had any orders from Moore &amp; Co., Houndsditch, which I did, and when I got there they gave me an order to go to the Bovril Co., Bunhill Row; the order which I took to the Bovril Co. was sealed up, which I handed to a clerk there, and they gave me two dozen Bovril. I carried both cases out and handed one each to Hart and Haves; then Hayes gave me 2d. to get two sheets of brown paper, which we placed round the two cases so that anyone seeing them carrying the cases could not see the marks on the cases. I then took the case that Hayes had been carrying and went to an Italian shop in Fore Street, opposite Wood Street, which is in the basement. I asked the Italian to give me 24s. for it, but I only received £1, which I handed to Hayes; then we went and had dinner and Hayes paid. When we came out of the dining hall we went to try and sell the other case of Bovril which Hart was carrying, and we met him in the neighbourhood of Silver Street. I have a razor and strop at home which Hayes gave me on Thursday."</p>

I believe the razor had been used once—Manning's father is a laundryman and, I believe, is in a comfortable way of business—Manning was living at home with his parents and had a comfortable home—I have made inquiries as to his character—I find he joined the Army in 1895 and served for more than eight years with the colours, that he was about five years in India and served two and a half years during the war—that he gained two medals and four bars for good service, and that his conduct was fairly good, but that he was guilty of trivial offences, such as being half an hour late in camp at night—so far as my investigation has shown, no charge of the slightest character has ever been made against him before—I believe he receives a pension of 3s. 6d. a week, being on the reserve list, and that since he left the Army he has been employed by a large firm of brewers.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspector, City</hi>). About noon on February 20th I went with Detective Stewart to Messrs. Morley's premises in Wood Street, where I saw Braeger—in consequence of information received I took him into custody on a charge of stealing two and a half dozen umbrellas that morning—as we walked along he pointed to Sender—I went up to Sender and told him I was a police officer—I then called Braeger to me—I said to Sender, "This youth told me that he had been stealing umbrellas and handing them to you"—he said, "I don't know the boy"—Braeger said, "Yes, he is the man, but there is another man"—I asked Sender where the other man was, mentioning the name of Serafino—he said, "In there," pointing to one of Lyons' restaurants in Wood Street—Stewart brought him out and Braeger repeated his state<lb/>ment in front of Serafino—the three were taken to the station and charged—they all three made statements there in the presence of each other—they were made in very good English—I did not write them down, but they were written down, read over to them and signed by them. [<hi rend="italic">Braeger's statement, read</hi>]: "I reside at 144, Vallance Road, Bethnal Green, and am employed at J. &amp; R. Morley's factory, Golden Lane. About four months ago a man who worked at the Italian shop in Silver Street asked me I could get him some umbrellas. I got him some. He then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060036"/>
               <p>introduced me to Serafino Gillia, who asked me if I could get him some umbrellas. I said, 'Yes,' and got him some about a month ago. I believe it was a dozen and he paid me 6s. for them. From this time till last Saturday I have got in all about twenty dozen at different times, and I should think I have received about £6 from him. On Saturday, February 18th, Julius Sender came to the warehouse; I saw him outside and he said Serafino Gillia had sent him to me and asked me if I could get him some. I got him two dozen, and he gave me 5s. This morning I saw Serafino Gillia in Golden Lane and he asked me to go round to Bridge-water Square with him because he did not want to see Sender, who was waiting close by, he having had a row with him because the umbrellas he got on Saturday he kept for himself. I said to Gillia, 'We will go and see him, Sender,' which we did. They both asked me to get them one dozen each, which I agreed to do. I then went into the warehouse for that purpose, and was caught bringing them (the umbrellas) out, the two and a half dozen." [<hi rend="italic">Gillia's statement read</hi>]: "I am an electrical engineer and reside at 2, Mornington Crescent, Euston Road. About a month ago a man I know by the name of 'Loo,' and who then resided at 26, Lambeth Road, offered me an umbrella for sale at 4s., which I bought the next day. I sold it for 5s. The following day I saw Loo and a man named Harry in Compton Street, Soho Square. Loo said to me,' My friend and me have got a dozen of umbrellas each and want 3s. each for them' I agreed to buy them and paid each man 36s. They said, 'We get some every day; can you do with them?' I said Yes. Harry said, 'I know a firm that will sell them cheaper to you.' He afterwards introduced me to Arthur Braeger, who said he would get me some, the same as he did Loo and Harry. I should think I have had in all about twenty dozen, but have never paid Braeger more than 6s. a dozen for them and 6s. a dozen each to Loo and Harry. Monday, the 13th, was the last time I had any. [<hi rend="italic">Sender's statement, read</hi>]: "I am a hairdresser out of employ<lb/>ment and reside at Mellman Street, Gray's Inn Road. About four weeks ago I met Gillia and told him I was out of work. He said, 'I can find you a job; see me to-night,' which I did, when he showed me an umbrella and asked me if I could pawn some and he would give me 5s. a day for my trouble. This I agreed to. I should think I had pawned six or seven dozen in various parts of London, giving Gillia the money and the tickets. On Saturday, the 11th, was the last time I pawned for Gillia. On Saturday, the 18th, I saw Loo and Braeger in Gresham Street. Braeger said to me, 'Where is Serafino? I said, 'He has sent me for a dozen.' He (Braeger) then went into the warehouse and brought four boxes. He gave me three of them and Loo one, and said to me, 'Never mind the money; Serafino will pay on Monday.' My three boxes contained thirteen umbrellas. One box I gave to Loo"—the Loo who is referred to is the prisoner Rigozzi Harry is Manzi and Gillia is Serafino—when searched, Sender had on him 13s. 6d. in money and forty pawntickets, thirty-seven of which related to umbrellas pledged singly in different parts of London in different names—I have recovered a large number of them, which have been identified by Messrs. Morley as their property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to arrest Braeger—directly I arrested him he said, "It was Serafino or whom I was doing the work"—we then came across Sender—I know Sender has been in regular employment as a hair-dresser—"Loo" and "Harry" are Italians and I should not be surprised at Sender's saying that a conversation between those two was carried on in Italian—some of the umbrellas pawned were of a cheap sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sender's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I am innocent all the time; I only did business for Serafino Gillia. When the detectives asked me if I knew the boy I said I did not, because Serafino never introduced me to him, and I was never mixed up with him. Serafino told me he had bought a job lot of somebody who had gone bankrupt, and he (Serafino) lived far away from that place and he must go and fetch the stuff by himself. He told me to wait many times outside the post office. One week before, I had been waiting for Serafino between eleven and twelve in the post office, and the porter did not allow me inside; I did not know about the case that it was stealing, because Serafino spoke to Loo and Harry in Italian and I could not understand it, and two days before I said I would not pawn any more for him and he said next morning, 'You go and fetch a dozen and take someone with you to pawn them, And say to the boy I sent you.' I did not know the correct place and I was just waiting for the boy. Serafino said, 'You see Louis too.' I met Loo there and I went with him; a little further he met the boy. He asked me where was Serafino and I said Serafino sent me, and the boy brought out three boxes. I said I had not so much money and he said, 'Never mind, Serafino will pay me the rest on Monday.' On Sunday morning Serafino came to my place and wanted to murder me and told me to give him the money I got the day before for the stuff. I said I would give him the money if he'd give me my box. I went to Serafino on Monday for the box and he would not give it to me; he went out And I went after him, and I followed him to the City, and he went into the restaurant when the boy was locked up, and the two detectives passed me, and I was looking after the boy and then I was arrested."</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Marshall Fox and have charge of his office, 28, Victoria Street, Westminster—he is a director of several companies—I also have charge of his cheque-book and all his paid cheques—the cheque-book is ordinarily kept either in the safe in the office or on his person, or in charge of his valet at the hotel—this is the cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) which was in use on September 22nd—on July 30th, about 12 p.m., Mr. Fox went to the London Joint Stock Bank and got this book; he was away for perhaps ten minutes—he came back and drew with his own hand four, five, or six cheques, putting the cheque-book in his waistcoat pocket—he then left the office, saying that he would not be back for three weeks, and that I might take my holidays—I did not see him again until August 23rd—during the whole of that time this cheque-book was either on his person or in charge of his valet; it was never in the office from July 30th to August 2.3rd—I next saw it on August 27th, when I wanted to draw a cheque, and then I found it in the safe; I did not put it there—I fill the cheques in and my employer signs them—I have one key to the safe and Mr. Fox has the second, which is sometimes left in charge of his valet when it is not in his pocket: there are only two keys—after August 27th the cheque-book was sometimes in the safe and sometimes with Mr. Fox at the Hyde Park Hotel, where he was staying—I think I saw it on two or three occasions between August 27th and September 22nd—about 12.30 p.m. on September 22nd Mr. Fox sent his valet up to the office to me with the hotel bill, asking me to fill up a cheque, and return it by the valet for him to sign—in order to do that I had to go to the safe for the cheque-book, and it was there on that date—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060039"/>
               <p>I filled out the cheque, gave it to the valet, and immediately there and then in his presence put back the cheque-book in the office safe, locked the safe, saw the valet out of the office, locked the office, and went over to the telephone to speak to Mr. Fox about some letters—I found he had just left for golf; the valet had told me that he would be there till 12.30 p.m.—I was absent from the office about ten minutes—I walked back, put back the letters in the office, and then went out to lunch—I was absent from about 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.—there were no other clerks employed, so I left the office empty—I shut the outer door, and the key is kept down at a little arrangement in the front door, hung with hundreds of other keys—nobody has a right to touch them, and nobody would hardly know which key it was, amongst the hundreds there—coming back at 2 p.m., I did not go out again that day—about 4.30 p.m. a clerk came from the bank and told me something, and a subsequent clerk came and showed me this cheque, which purports to be signed by Mr. Marshall Fox (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I am well acquainted with his signature, and I was certain when I saw it that it was not his, and I said so—in the presence of some other bank clerks and the detective who came up we examined the cheque-book, which I took out of the safe, and whether I discovered it, or one of the clerks, I do not know, but it was found that the counterfoil of this cheque No. B/E 095124 was missing from somewhere about the middle on the unused cheques; it had been torn out without any trace of the counterfoil being left—I had not noticed it before; it was impossible to—we also discovered that there were two other entire cheques and counterfoils, Nos. B/E 095123 and B/E 095127, torn completely out—there was a fragment left of one counterfoil, but nothing to attract attention—I had not noticed those either until then—Mr. Fox left for America last Saturday week, and should have arrived there last Saturday; I have not heard from him since he has been away—he has a business connection over there—he gave evidence at the Police Court—I have known Dr. Bridgwater, of 57 and 59, Oxford Street, for a little more than two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a rule Mr. Fox sends his valet for the cheque book—nearly always when he travels on the Continent he leaves his cheque-book in charge of the valet in his bag where he carries his letters and pipers: I have not actually seen it, but I know that is his habit—he kept his valet for two months after September 22nd; he let him go on the first day of this year—I do not know if any efforts have been made to find him—the week before Christmas he came up and told me that Mr. Fox had given him the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>, and that was the first I heard of it—I have some lodgers at my house, amongst whom was one who had some connection with America; I cannot say whether he absolutely came from America—he had business on there—his accent was not at all American, although his actions might have been—he might have been taken for one—he was a fairly tall man of medium height, not strikingly tall or short, very thin, more dark than fair, a very nut-brown complexion, not sallow, light eyes, and rather <hi rend="italic">lantern-jawed</hi>—he dressed sometimes in an ordinary tweed suit and sometimes in a frock coat with a silk hat, with which he wore an exceptionally high waistcoat, almost up to his</p>

               <p>collar; I never saw him with a low waistcoat—he was rather inclined to be consumptive; he was hollow-chested and round shouldered—I saw him at my house on the evening of September 22nd—I did not men<lb/>tion to him about the forgery—September 22nd was Thursday, and I think he left on the Monday following—when he came in June he told me he might have to go to America any week, but for certain the last week in September or the first week in October—he had a bedroom and sitting-room; he never had anybody there—he came in late at night and went out the first thing in the morning—he sometimes took breakfast, but very seldom except on Sundays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He had not the slightest resemblance to the prisoner, who is broad, and this man was long and narrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier to the London Joint Stock Bank, Victoria Street—this cheque for £819, purporting to be signed by Mr. Marshall Fox, an old customer of ours, who usually kept a current balance of £2,000 or £3,000, or rather more, was presented to me for payment on September 22nd, a few minutes before 4 p.m., closing time—I asked the man how he would have it; he said, "Half in £50's, half in £20's, and the cdd £19 in gold"—at that time of the day the notes had been taken round to the back of the office to be got ready for the manager—I went there, and, finding that I had not got quite sufficient £20's, I gave him two £10's—I gave him £400 in £50 notes and £380 in £20 notes and £20 in £10 notes and £19 gold—the two £50 notes, Nos. 58307 and 58308, that have been produced were two of those that I gave him—it was past 4 p.m. at this time, and I saw the porter open the door to let him out—about eight minutes after, either the manager showed the cheque to me or I showed it to the manager, but, at all events, we looked at it together carefully with some of the other clerks, and two of them thought the signature was very doubtful—in consequence, communication was made, to Mr. Marshall Fox's office in Victoria Street, and we had some informa<lb/>tion from Miss Toovey, in consequence of which we immediately com<lb/>municated with the police—this was within twenty minutes after the man had left—two others at the bank besides myself gave a description to the police of the man who had cashed the cheque—on January 6th I went to Westminster police station for the purpose of identifying this man, when I saw in the yard thirteen men, amongst whom I saw the prisoner—I feel quite confident that he is the man who cashed the cheque—I said that there were two men there whom I was rather undecided about, and they told me to touch them—I went to the prisoner first, and touched him, and then to the other man, but it struck me that I was doing wrong by touching the second man; he was of a bigger build than the prisoner and rather of a rougher appearance—I concluded that the man I had touched first was the correct one, and I say now that he is the man—I thought the second man might be the man, but immediately afterwards I changed my mind—the man who cashed the cheque stood at the counter and appeared to count the notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not stand at first in front of the frosted window at the back of my desk; towards the end, when I was taking down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060041"/>
               <p>the notes, of course I could not see him at all—I should say he was in the bank about eight or nine minutes, four minutes of which he was under my observation—during that time there was nothing in his demeanour so unusual as to be calculated to attract my attention to him—he appeared to count the notes—we have a large number of persons coming in during the course of the day, the majority of whom are well dressed, and there was nothing in the prisoner's appearance to attract attention—I gave a verbal description of him to Inspector Fuller at Scotland Yard; this is it: "A big man dressed in a black frock coat with silk facings and a tall silk hat, showing what seemed to be a white waistcoat or shirt front, big build, tall and stout"—I said "stout" and I corrected myself and said "rather stout" afterwards; he appeared stout at the counter—I said he was about six feet tall—I did say that the prisoner having the bottom of his coat buttoned up, it was difficult to tell the colour of his waistcoat; I should say the lower button was done up—I expect I did say that there was very little waist coat to be seen—I did not assist the inspector to get out a notice for the "Police Gazette"—I do not think I have given any other description to the police; he took it down in his pocket book—Mr. Sisman was with me when I gave the description, but not Barrett—I do not re<lb/>member whether Fuller read out the description to us—there was no other description either written or printed that I know of as to this man's appearance—I know there was a description given to the "Police Gazette"—I had not given information for a description to be printed in the "Police Gazette" that I know of—some photographs were shown to me a few days after September 22nd and some after that date—certainly no photo<lb/>graphs were shown to me shortly before January 6th—I never saw any photograph that was said to have been taken from the prisoner's house—the messenger tried to trace, on two or three occasions, the cabman who drove the prisoner to the bank to see if he could see him in the vicinity—there has been no attempt to find him by advertisement or other means to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No photograph of the prisoner was ever shown to me before January 6th—two other clerks and myself together gave a verbal description to the officer, and he took down a joint description of the three—the frosted window at the back of my desk is a little higher than the customer's head; it is really a screen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of the Lon<lb/>don Joint Stock Bank at the Victoria Street Branch—I was in the bank on September 22nd when this cheque was presented—it is my duty, just before closing time, to take over the balance of the notes from the cashier—I was waiting near Mr. Yallop to take the numbers of the notes and the amounts from the books—there were two customers in the bank at the time—the man who cashed this cheque was in my sight about a minute to a minute and a half—I was doing nothing, simply waiting—I did not see the man leave the bank—I got the balance of the notes and went away with them—it was not necessary for me to see the cheque at all—about ten minutes after the man had left, my attention was called to the cheque—I am acquainted with Mr. Marshall Fox's signature—I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060042"/>
               <p>examine the signature on this cheque, because it would not be my duty to do so—between five or ten minutes after the man had left the bank I was sent by the manager to Miss Toovey—another clerk went after I came back—I would not have an opportunity of forming any opinion as to whether the signature was a genuine one—I went to make enquiries of Miss Toovey before I had had a good look at the cheque—I gave a descrip<lb/>tion to the police of the man who had cashed the cheque on September 22nd—I went to Scotland Yard, gave the best description I could of the man, and returned to the bank for the numbers of the notes, and I think, when I got back again to Scotland Yard Mr. Yallop was there; I did not give my description with him; mine was before his and separate from it—on January 6th I went to the Westminster police station to see if I could pick out the man, of whom I had given a description—I should think there were about fifteen men in a line, and I picked out the prisoner from them—I believe him to be the man who presented the cheque; I am quite satisfied that he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no conversation with the man who cashed the cheque—my attention was attracted to him simply because I was waiting at the counter to receive the balance of the notes, and, seeing someone there cashing a large cheque, my attention was attracted to him—the other customer was well known to me—the prisoner being a stranger, I noticed him more particularly—he had a tall hat and a frock coat on, which was rather open on account of the button being buttoned at the bottom, and I noticed that he had a large expanse of shirt, much more than ordinary people would have, as though he were wearing a low cut waistcoat—I gave to Fuller much about this description: "Dressed in a tall hat and frock coat; of fairly gentlemanly appearance; inclined to be dark, with a fairly broad face; and rather inclined to be sallow complexioned"—I was asked by Fuller whether I thought the prisoner was a tall man, and I said, "Yes, fairly tall," and, I think, after that I was asked about the height, and I said again I considered him to be slightly taller than I am myself—I am a little more than 5 feet 7 1/2 inches—I said before that I was 5 feet 7 1/2 inches—if I were describing a man 6 feet tall, I should say he was a good deal taller than myself—before the description was printed I never saw or heard of any proof of what was to be pub<lb/>lished in the "Police Gazette"—the same evening, or perhaps the next day after I gave my description at Scotland Yard, I was shown one or two photographs by the police, and was asked whether I recognised one of them as being the man who came into the bank, but I could not—I was not shown any photographs a few days before, or some little time before I identified the prisoner—I am not aware of any endeavours having been made to trace the cabman who brought the prisoner to the bank; there may have been—the fifteen men from whom I picked out the prisoner were fairly well dressed: perhaps one or two not quite so well as the rest of them—there may have been one or two not so well dressed as the prisoner, who was wearing a tall hat—there were others there with tall hats—when I walked into the yard I had a general glance at the men who were standing there, and I noticed particularly the prisoner amongst</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060043"/>
               <p>them—to make certain that I was not making a mistake I walked up and down the line perhaps twice, and immediately after that I touched the prisoner, being certain that he was the man—the principal reason for my identifying him was, to my mind, that his features and general appearance resembled those of the man who came into the bank—the man who passed the cheque had a dark, rather thick moustache, turned out side ways, and rather straighter than the prisoner's is at the present moment; it had been curled up or combed a little more—it had more of a French appearance—I do not think it was more of an American appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think I know the American appearance of a moustache; to my mind Americans are either clean shaven, or wear a beard—as far as I know I am 5 feet 7 1/2 inches in my boots; I might be a little more—very likely I am—I have seen the prisoner more than once since I identified him, and I see nothing about him that is in<lb/>consistent with my description of him, only that his face appears to be a little more drawn than it was at the time, but, as far as I can see, I do not see very much difference—I should still describe him as slightly taller than myself, but it is very difficult to judge the height of a man standing by a counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at the London Joint Stock Bank, Victoria Street, and it is part of my business to attend to the door—just before 4 p.m., closing time, on September 22nd, I recollect a man coming into the bank and cashing a cheque, which I now know to be for £819—I was standing at the door ready to close it—he came in a hansom cab—I saw him standing at the counter, and the notes and gold being handed to him—he pretended to count the notes; he appeared to be looking through them—I then opened the door and let him out—I noticed whilst in the bank and before the money was given to him he turned very white; I thought he was ill—before going away he turned colour; a flush came over his face—he drove away in the hansom which was waiting for him, towards the House of Commons, City wards—about three to five minutes afterwards my attention was called to the fact that there was something wrong with the cheque, and I recalled to mind the man who had presented it—within a short time I gave a description of his features to the police—on January 6th I went to the Westminster police station yard, where I saw a row of twelve to sixteen men—I was acting quite independently of Mr. Sisman and Mr. Yallop; they were not with me, and I knew nothing of the man they had picked out—I looked down the line and I came to the pri<lb/>soner—I pointed him out, and they said, 'Touch him," and I touched him—I recognised the prisoner as the man who had been in the bank on Sep<lb/>tember 22nd—I say now that he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not my duty to look in any particular direc<lb/>tion when the bank door was open—another customer was in the bank at the same time as the prisoner, who came in two or three minutes after; I let him in—I was waiting to let them out, so I could not help looking at them—Mr. Sisman and Mr. Yallop had an opportunity of seeing the pris<lb/>oner's appearance—after the cheque was known to be forged we three did not have a conversation; I saw the manager and Mr. Sisman talking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060044"/>
               <p>about the cheque, and, of course, I went and heard what they said—after they had the conversation they asked me whether I had observed the man, and I told Mr. Yallop and Mr. Sisman that he drove up in a hansom to the bank, that I had noticed he was very white, that I thought he had come over a bit queer, and that he looked whiter than usual—I had never seen the prisoner before—the reason I said "whiter than usual" was that when he came in he was white, and while standing at the counter, waiting for the money, he turned whiter still—I also told them that he seemed rather timid and that quite a flush came over his face after he got the notes—when he went away there was nothing to attract my attention to the cab; the prisoner looked at me through the glass, and then at himself in the mirror—a few days after I looked all along the Embankment and every<lb/>where I could where I thought there would be a lot of cabmen, and endeavoured to trace the cabman who drove him—I had noticed his ap<lb/>pearance sufficiently to be able to identify him—I gave a description of him to the police—nothing has been heard of him that I am aware of—I was standing about three yards from the prisoner when he was cashing the cheque, the distance from the door to the cashier's desk being six yards—I was three yards from him when the door was closed—I went from there more to the centre of the bank—I think I only described his features to the police—I noticed that he had a frock coat on with silk facings, buttoned up at the bottom button, which description I gave to the police—I made a mistake when I said I only described his features—I cannot say if he had a white waistcoat on; he had on a white shirt—his waistcoat was rather an open one, showing a good deal of shirt—what I noticed about his features was his high cheek bones; as to his mouth, I only went by his moustache—I did not say on a previous occasion that he had a peculiar mouth; I think there must have been some mistake about that; I do not con<lb/>sider he had a peculiar mouth, nor did I identify him by it—his moustache was pulled down; it was not waxed, nor straight; it was dark, rather heavy and turning grey—I said on a previous occasion, "I cannot say whether he really counted the notes. He went through them the same as anybody would do. I think he was rather hurried"—I should think about two days after, I was shown several photographs by the police, and five or six days afterwards I was shown some more—I am quite sure I was not shown any shortly before the day I identified the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, employed by Messrs. Cook and Sons, tourist agents—they are now registered at Somerset House as regular bankers—in September last I was at their office at Lud<lb/>gate Circus—about 4.30 p.m. on September 22nd a man cashed these two £50 notes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), on the backs of which I had marked the number of my cash; there is no doubt about their identity—I fix the time because I had just finished balancing my cash at the time—he asked for gold only, but as I had not sufficient French gold to spare I gave him 1,000 francs in gold and the rest in French notes of 100 francs each—I should say the gold consisted of 20-franc pieces and 10-franc pieces, and I should say some of them would have the Gaelic cock upon them—it is quite a recent coin-age, of two or three years ago—he seemed rather in a hurry, and he took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060045"/>
               <p>up the 1,000 francs in gold, and ran out, leaving the notes behind him—I called him back and so did Mr. Bode—he came back smiling, took up the notes, and rushed out again—this is a 20-franc piece with the Gaelic cock on (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—in January I was engaged for Messrs. Cook In the South of France—I was not in this country when the prisoner was arrested—I was brought back in February and then I went back again—on a day in February in the cells at this Court I was shown about seven or eight men, and I was asked whether I could pick out the man who had changed the £50 notes—I walked down the line of men and there were two men whom I could not decide on, of whom the prisoner was one—I turned to the detective and said there were two men of whom I was not sure which one had been to the office—he said, "Look again"—I thought over the matter and for some reason, I do not know why, I chose the man who was not the prisoner—one of the detectives then said, "There were two men that you said you had picked out"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Show us the other man," and I picked out the prisoner—I think I touched him—I have more reason to believe that the prisoner is the man who came into the office than the other man—the morning after the man came into the office I was told a notice had come in, and when I was at the Strand office Inspector Fuller came up to see me on the matter some days afterwards—my mind was called back to the changing of the £50 notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk employed by Messrs. Cook &amp; Sons, of Ludgate Circus—I was at their office there on September 22nd, about 4.30 p.m., when two £50 notes were changed into French money—I was two desks away from my colleague who actually handled the transaction, but I overheard most of what took place—just as the man was moving away from the desk I happened to go along to him and I saw some notes and money lying on the counter and I called the man back—as he was leaving the counter I saw his back—on my calling him back he simply turned round very quickly, grabbed up the money, and rushed out of the place—I only caught what I might say was a glimpse of him—he was leaving about £50 worth of the money lying on the counter—I cannot be certain whether it was paper or gold—I saw him leave the premises—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060046"/>
               <p>the next morning was the first time my attention was called to the fact that there was something wrong—about 9.30 a.m. the police gave us the official numbers of the notes as having been stolen—I then endea<lb/>voured to recollect what had taken place on the previous day—in January I went to Westminster police station yard, where I saw ten men in a line—I was asked if I could pick out anyone, and after some slight hesitation I picked out the prisoner—I say now that to the best of my belief he is the man who attended at the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing unusual in a man changing £100 for French money—I did not see the prisoner's face while he was at the counter; I only caught a glimpse of him as he turned round to pick up the money he had left—as a matter of fact I saw more of his back than his face—I went to identify the prisoner by his face, but more by his bearing, because I had more impression of his general bearing, that is to say, his walk, than I had of his figure and face—the prisoner was standing still when I identified him, and so far as his walk was concerned that would not assist me in identifying him—it is true that I said, "I could not pick him out by his dress, as he was dressed in a different attire"—I expected, of course, to pick out a man in a frock coat and silk hat, and he was dressed in a different attire; that is what made me hesitate—it is true I said, "I picked him out by his general bearing as I had an idea of that"; his face was a secondary consideration—it was not ab<lb/>solutely present to my mind—the man who changed the money had a dark moustache—I cannot say whether I had ever said he had a dark moustache before—it is correct that I said before, "Before identifying the man I had an idea he was a man of fairly moderate height; I only caught a glimpse of his face"—I do not know that I said, "I cannot say whether he had a black moustache"—I was under the impression that his moustache was dark, but that he had one there is no doubt—I can<lb/>not say off-hand whether I said anything about the colour before—I was somewhat aided in my identification of the prisoner by the fact that he resembles somebody that I know—I noticed the resemblance on he following morning, when I tried to recollect the facts—I did say at the Police Court, "I only gave a rough description of the man two or three days ago"—I said that he was a man of forty-five to fifty years of age, with a silk hat and frock coat; a wide expanse of waistcoat, one of these low-cut waistcoats, and I think I said, "A short sharp walk with what is called a fairly upright appearance"—I think I was asked something about the height of the man because I said he was a man of medium height—my definition of medium height would be about 5 feet 10 1/2 inches, and my definition of a tall man would be 6 feet.</p>

               <p>Inspector Kane of the D Division, and I am going to arrest you for forging and uttering a cheque for £819 about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of September 22nd last, at a bank in Victoria Street"—he made no answer, and I addressed him again, saying, "Do you understand the charge I have just told you?"—he said, "Yes, I understand, but I know nothing about it"—he did not express any surprise or indignation—on the way to the railway station I said to him, "I am perfectly well aware that you did not write the cheque. I know who did," to which he said, "I shall deny the charge."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not have any conversation with him—I did not caution him that anything he said would be taken down and used against him—I first heard of the forgery on September 22nd—I did not see any officials of the bank until January 6th—accompanied by Inspector Fuller, on the evening of the day of the prisoner's arrest I went to his house and looked for clothing—I found a frock coat—I saw a lady there—I do not think I asked her for a white waistcoat belonging to her husband—I asked her if she had seen a white waistcoat about the place—she said she had lever seen one—I did not take any description of the prisoner from any person before the prisoner was arrested—I saw a description on the afternoon of September 22nd, as soon as possible after the offence was committed, when it was telegraphed round in the usual way—the description of the prisoner in the "Police Gazette" of September 30th, 1904, is an exact reproduction of the description given to me by telegraph on September 22nd—the description was: "A man aged 45 to 50, height ft feet; complexion, sallow; hair and moustache, dark; wearing a black frock coat with white vest and silk hat"—when I was at the prisoner's house I am quite sure I did not ask the lady there whether she had any photo<lb/>graphs, neither did Fuller—I personally have not endeavoured to trace the cabman who drove the prisoner to the bank, but I know, officially, that every possible effort has been made to trace him, such as printed bills being posted at the cabstands, but without success.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector D.</hi>) On September 22nd I received infor<lb/>mation of the forgery about 4.30. p.m.—I got a description of the man who had passed the cheque at the same time—Sisman was the first man who called upon me with regard to it—after that I got a description from Barrett and Yallop—thereupon I circulated what we call police information, giving the description—"6 feet" is the description given in the print, but it should be "about 6 feet"—neither Yallop, Barrett, nor Sisman described him as being 6 feet tall—one of them said he believed the man was wearing a white vest—I was with Inspector Kane when the prisoner was arrested—he said, "I understand, but I know nothing about it"; nothing beyond that—after the question of height had been discussed at the Police Court I measured the prisoner's height when he was in custody—I found that he measured 5 feet 9 1/8 inches in his shoes—I say that is not his height, but it was his height when I measured him—I have three heights in the official registers; one is the official height taken by the</p>

               <p>police at the time of his arrest and before any question of height arose; he was then on the official papers as A feet 11 inches—my measurement of 5 feet 9 1/8 inches was not wrong, but the height at which he stood was wrong—I know from my experience that a man can alter his height by an inch and a half if he allows his head to sink into the trunk—if a man's normal height were 5 feet 10 inches he could make himself 5 feet 9 inches, 5 feet 9 1/2 inches or a trifle over 5 feet 10 inches, by stretching or sinking himself—the prisoner's proper height is 5 feet 9 1/2 inches without shoes—I was present when he was identified in each case—on January 6th, at Westminster police station yard, the inspector, in the prisoner's presence, said to me, "You see this prisoner has been identified by these three men." pointing to Sisman, Barrett, and Yallop—I said to the prisoner, "These three men are from the bank"—I then showed him the cheque and he said, "I am quite satisfied with the identification"—I took him to mean he was satisfied with the fairness of the way in which the identifi<lb/>cation had been conducted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sisman's description, which was a verbal one, and which I took down in writing (<hi rend="italic">Note-book produced</hi>) is, "About forty-five to fifty; about 6 feet, full face; pale; frock coat, silk hat, white waist-coat—the description in the "Police Gazette" is, "Aged forty-five to fifty; height, 6 feet; complexion, sallow; hair and moustache, dark; wearing a black coat, white vest, silk hat"—I know that there is another descrip<lb/>tion published; I do not know that they altered it; it is not different from the one in the "Police Gazette"—it is, "A man aged forty-five to fifty; height, about 6 feet; complexion, sallow; moustache, dark; appearance of an American; dressed in black frock coat and silk hat"—the previous one has not "the appearance of an American"—it was correct when I said on a former occasion, "The description of the prisoner in the "Police Gazette," which is a combination of about five descriptions, was given to me"—they were all given to me the same day—I got some more witnesses to corroborate what one had told me—from September 22nd to about ten days before January 6th I was looking for a man of about 6 feet, and with the appearance of an American—before I arrested the prisoner I am positive I had never obtained any photographs from his house—I never saw the prisoner, nor knew where he was living until the day of his arrest—I might have asked Mrs. Holmes after his arrest whether she had any photographs—very likely I did—I have no recollection of it, but I should have endeavoured to find one—one of us asked whether there was a white waistcoat and she said, "I have never seen him wear one," or, "He has never had one"—after his arrest I searched him and found a few papers, a copy of his birth certificate, and a few pence—I did not make any enquiries, but I have not any doubt that he might have been employed at the Brewers' Exhibition at the Agricultural Hall in October—I do not know if I said on a previous occasion, when being examined as to my finding him 5 feet 9 1/8 inches in his boots, "I found no objection to the way he stood up on the second occasion"—I could not have found any objection; he stood erect—I did not take any exception to the way he stood—I noticed when I was measuring him that his chin came down</p>

               <p>of them has been prosecuted and convicted of distributing indecent literature—probably two or three have been convicted for obstruction, but I should not agree with you that it was for distributing indecent literature, since Sir Albert de Rutzen held that there was nothing indecent in the bills, and dismissed the charge—Mr. Denman has convicted one of my employees for obstruction, but not for distributing obscene literature—a man mimed William Foster may have been convicted and fined at Marlborough Street for distributing matter of an indecent nature on November 18th, 1902, but it is impossible for me to go back three years—I may have paid the fine—I paid fines for some of the men because I considered it was my duty so to do—I cannot tell you whether some more men were fined on November 20th; it is such a matter of indifference to me—this has nothing to do with the mode of conducting my business; I maintain that there is nothing whatsoever that is indecent in the literature I distribute—among the men in my employ there was a man named Shackell, whom I know to be a convicted forger—I have known him as a casual acquaintance for eight or nine years; he came to ask for some work; he did not want any introduction; my bill men do not have intro<lb/>ductions; they come and ask me if there is any work—very possibly the prisoner asked me to find the man a job—I did not know that he was a convicted forger at the time I put him on, but within a few days the police took very great care to let me know—he was one of the men who superintended the distributing of my pamphlets—I did not know anything of his whereabouts; I never saw him probably more than two or three times during the nine years—he was clerk to a man named Keen, who drew up my lease of my new Oxford Street premises some years ago—after knowing that he was a convicted forger and when he was in my service I gave a reference to enable, him to obtain some furniture on hire—I certainly did not represent him to be a man worth £40 or £50—he wanted to get a little home together and could not afford to pay cash for his furniture—I heard on Wednesday this week that he has been convicted of stealing the furniture—I swear that I was not at Marlborough Street Police Court when he was tried and con<lb/>victed—the nearest place that I was to the Court was at my consulting room—I did not know of his having been prosecuted till the day after—as far as the number of my men who were convicted goes, it is a matter of indifference to me—in one or two cases the men preferred to go to prison for seven days, and when they came out I paid them the fines—I did not have a conversation at the Police Court with the solicitor who defended him; I do not even know him and I have never spoken to him in my life.—Miss Toovey has been a patient of mine for some three years—I swear that the acquaintanceship between us was nothing more than that of medical man and patient—I am certainly not aware that she said she anticipated I would marry her—I cannot be responsible for what she has said—I heard at the last trial that she said that I talked about going to Australia, and asked her to accompany me—that was the first time I was aware of it—I spoke about going to Australia, but I swear I did not suggest her returning with me—I certainly did not know that she was studying dispensing in order to</p>

               <p>accompany me—I understood she was studying chemistry, dressmaking and cooking—I suppose she was desirous of further accomplishments—outside my consulting room I only saw her on one occasion, when I met her near Victoria station, and we went into Odone's restaurant to have some coffee—it is a common occurrence for me to meet a patient in the street, and I ask them, male or female, to have a glass of wine or some other refreshment with me—there is no harm in that—this happened about two years ago—I heard the last time, that Mr. Marshall Fox saw us in Odone's restaurant, but I should not have known him if I had seen him—I am a specialist in nerve, skin and blood disorders—if you produce any indecent literature published by me, I shall bow to you—very likely Miss Toovey has described me as her sweetheart—I expect a good many ladies have—some ladies are very fond of having sweethearts—the first time I heard of Mr. Marshall Fox was perhaps a week after Sep<lb/>tember 22nd, when Miss Toovey called on me and said there had been some robbery at her place—I was under the impression at the last trial that the first occasion I learnt of the forgery was when I read it in the papers, but on my memory being refreshed I know that it was on that occasion when Miss Toovey called upon me—she wanted sympathy and somebody to confide in—I like to make my patients my friends—many patients ask their doctor's advice on matters besides medical matters—I cannot swear it was not in September—it is a matter of indifference to me—I do not think she mentioned her employer's name—I swear I did not ask her who he was, and I swear that I never knew who her employer was, or where she was employed—she told me that her em<lb/>ployer's name had been forged, and she seemed very much upset—of course I sympathised with her—she said a cheque had been stolen on the Continent, or something, and that she had had an American lodger with her answering to the description of the man who was wanted—I said, "Do not you know anything about the lodger? Where is he?"—and she said, "I do not know. He has gone away"—she said the cheque was for £800—I will swear that she told me this lodger was tall and dark, and she thought he answered to the description of the man wanted—I suppose I said at the last trial, "She never told me anything about the description of the American lodger; only the description of the man who had got this money"—it was utterly impossible at the time to remember—I think your shorthand writer has made a mistake about that; at Any rate, it is only a quibble—I had a patient named Wigram, whom Mr. Muir was pleased to designate as "Billy Wigram," some years ago—I knew James Duncan Robertson as an old friend—he is the son of one of our wealthiest and most respected squatters in Victoria—his father left him £100,000—I know Wigram and Robertson were committed for stealing money from a stockbroker's clerk on the way to the bank—because some of my patients and friends fall into trouble it does not reflect upon me—a man named Joseph Hayces is in my employ at the present time as a dispenser—I know he went to Glasgow with money for the purpose of defending Wigram and Robertson—he was for twenty years the bosom companion of Robertson in Australia—he</p>

               <p>kept a chemist's shop and they were brother Masons—Walter Macdonald was also a patient of mine—he was never, to my knowledge, sentenced to three years, imprisonment at Adelaide for forgery in 1890—I know there is a central criminal court at Adelaide—I left Australia in 1894—Walter Macdonald is at present under my treatment—I saw him only yesterday—the Walter Macdonald I know is a sergeant who fought in the Boer War and was presented to Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor—this photo<lb/>graph is somewhat like the man, but it is a very blurred picture—I know Charles Taplin, who is a lawyer's clerk—I am not aware that he was sentenced to twelve months' hard labour at this Court for conspiracy to de<lb/>fraud Somerset House by means of forged stamps—I have only seen him two or three times—on one occasion he brought a letter up to my rooms from a solicitor, Mr. Benham—I know a man named James Adieasan L.R.C.P. at Edinburgh—he was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude for abortion—I have known Flackman some five years—he is an hotel manager—his wife was a patient of mine some years ago—I believe he has had the misfortune of being convicted for keeping a brothel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first made Flackman's acquaintance by lunching at the Tudor Hotel Buffet—I have attended numbers of the staff there—I met Miss Toovey quite accidentally in the street—the money for the defence of Robertson and Wigram was subscribed by men at Tattersall's and sporting men—I did not subscribe a shilling—a furniture dealer called upon me and asked me if I had a man in my employ named Shackell—I said, "Yes," and he said, "Will he be all right for a few pounds' worth of furniture on the hire system?"—I gave no guarantee—my bill states that I have twenty-five years, honourable record and practical experience and that I have had many thousands of patients; that I am not a common apothecary, but have a title and right to practice, which was indorsed by Mr. Justice Grantham and Mr. Justice Collins in the Queen's Bench Division on May 19th, 1896—as the police find fit to slander me and launch all sorts of calumnies on me for coming to speak the truth, I will produce my pass books for the last twenty years if desired.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an hotel manager, but at present I am representing a Brighton firm in London—I was the manager of the Tudor Hotel, Oxford Street, when it was opened on may 1st, 1899—I left the Alexandria Hotel to open that hotel—I got to know Dr. Bridgwater, as he used to lunch at the Tudor Hotel Buffet very fre<lb/>quently—on different occasions he has attended the staff when we have not had time to call in the hotel doctor, and on one special occasion he attended my wife—I was on sufficient terms of intimacy with him to visit him, and I did so frequently during the last two or three years—before September, 1904, I was assistant manager at the Hotel Metropole, South-end, which went into liquidation, and the liquidator dispensed with my services on September 17th—I remained in Southend with my wife and children, hoping to get taken on to the staff again, until the following Thursday, and, failing to do that, I came up to London on September 22nd by the 9 a.m. special train—I called on several people connected</p>

               <p>with the wine and spirit trade and people like that in the City, to know if they knew of any appointments—at 2.30 p.m. I lunched with the manager of the Clifton Hotel in Welbeck Street, whom I invariably visit when I am in Town—I remained there about an hour—I then went to call on Dr. Bridge-water to see if he knew of a place vacant, as he goes about a good deal in hotels—I arrived there about 3.45 p.m.—I should allow myself half an hour, as I was catching the 5.15 p.m. train to Southend—on arriving there the prisoner came down and asked me what I wanted, and I was shown into the waiting room, where I was kept waiting for about half an hour—I simply said I wanted to see Dr. Bridgwater—the prisoner knew my name and took it in—while waiting the prisoner came in at intervals several times and I also spoke to him—I had met him two or three times when I went to see the doctor, which I did whenever I came up to Town—I left there between 4.25 and 4.30 p.m. in order to get down to the Bank by the tube, and walk to Fenchurch Street to catch the 5.15 p.m. train—I had to wait about five or ten minutes for the train—I did not know anything about the proceedings at the Police Court—the first thing I heard of it was in the "Daily Telegraph" on a Friday after the case was tried—in consequence of seeing Dr. Bridgwater's name I went to see Dr. Bridgwater, and gave my evidence—I know it was absolutely impossible for this man to be at the bank at Victoria Street at 3.55 p.m. or 4 p.m., or at Cook's in Ludgate Hill at 4.30 p.m.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Dr. Bridgwater before I left, but only for a very few minutes, because I was in a hurry to get away—I promised to call on him on Saturday, September 24th—I only had time to talk to him at the door and ask him if he heard of anything to let me know—I saw him next on September 24th—I used to see him every time I was in Town, sometimes twice a week—I did the buying in Town—it was uncertain what day I came up to Town—remember September 22nd because it was a most anxious time for me—I was most anxious to get an appointment—I know this was not on the Wednesday or Friday—I could not have afforded to wait after Thursday—I have no note or memorandum of my visit on September 22nd—when I saw the announcement in the paper I went straight to see Dr. Bridgwater—neither he nor the prisoner asked me to remember that I had been there on the 22nd—I should not have gone had I not remembered—Dr. Bridgwater said, "Well, you had better go and see my solicitor"—when I went to him on September 24th it was about 3.45 p.m.—I did not see the prisoner there then—the next week after that I stayed down at Southend and the week after that I saw Dr. Bridgwater again—I know Shackell by sight—I do not know when he left—I have known Dr. Bridgwater nearly six years, and apart from as a professional man a little over five years—I opened the Tudor Hotel Buffet on January 1st, 1000, a year after opening the hotel—I knew the prisoner about a month, or possibly longer, by going to the doctor's—I did not know him well until recently—I knew Frank Tarbce, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Frank Taylor, whom I know as Frank Terry—he was staying in the hotel, and the guests are the associates of the manager if the manager is any good, but I did not know anything about him until I was informed by Inspector</p>

I was valet to Mr. Marshall Fox—I left him on December 30th—on August 1st, I think, Mr. Fox went to Paris with his motor car and I followed him with his luggage—it was Bank Holiday—I saw the cheque-book at the hotel when he went away, and he gave it to me while we were in Paris—I take charge of it when we are on the Continent—in Paris I noticed that some cheques were missing from it, and I called Mr. Fox's chauffeur's attention to it—I did not tell my master—I was just opening the book; I was packing it with the luggage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We went from Paris to Dinard, and it was the day before we left Paris that I noticed the cheques were missing—Mr. Fox said, "Take all my letters and lock them in your bag," and he gave me the cheque-book—he went in his motor car from Paris to Dinard; he left in the afternoon, and I in the evening by train, and got into Dinard the next morn<lb/>ing—we stopped a week at Dinard—it was ten days before we returned to London that I discovered the cheques were missing—we were away for about three weeks—the counterfoils were in when I noticed the missing cheques—I am sure of that because I should not have seen the cheques had been torn off if I had not seen the counterfoils—I was talking to the chauffeur and packing up some letters, and I wanted to make it into as small a parcel as I could—I was just doing this (<hi rend="italic">Letting the cheques run with his fingers</hi>), and it seemed to go so quick when I got near the end that I turned back again and found some missing I should say somewhere past the middle of the unused cheques—it was a bit too long to pack it, so I folded it up and put them in a brown paper parcel—I know now that the counterfoils have been taken out because the detective came and showed me the book, and I could not see the place—I cannot see the place now—the three cheques were not missing altogether; there was one between—I did not mention it, because I often see Mr. Fox with cheques in his pocket; in his letter case where he carries his cards he has sometimes notes, or cheques, and I always take it out if there is anything in it; I did not take any notice of the cheques—I do not know whether I had the cheque-book in my possession when we got back to London; Mr. Fox might have brought it to the hotel—I did not have it in my possession after we returned to London—when we left Dinard it was in my bag, and I brought</p>

"Don't they do their own slips?"—he said, "Yes, but they are full up rubbing up their directories and we only want a few to tide us over a few days"—he said he was a canvasser.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Lamb, of Gloucester House College, Muswell Hill—I recognise Pike; he called at my house, I believe, on October 21st, 1904—he said he had called for £1 in reference to Lloyd's Directory, for which I had given the order twelve months before—he showed me a slip of paper which he called an order form; apparently my signature was upon it—I told him I had no remembrance of it, but, seeing my signature, I believed it to be all right—I paid him £2 because he said that the arrangements at the office were altered, and for the future it was to be paid in advance—I believe I got this receipt next day from Lewis, who called—he said he had called from the "Times" Publishing Company for money due for an insertion in a directory for that year—I do not believe I had given any order for it—he showed me an order form very much the same as the one before and apparently signed by me—I believe it was in my own writing—there was other writing on the form which was not mine—I strongly objected to it and said I could not remember anything about it, and that if I had given an order for the directory it was not for that amount of money, and the figures must have been altered, for I had not promised that amount of money for any ad<lb/>vertisements—he would not go away, and in the end I paid him altogether £5—he gave me this receipt, purporting to be on behalf of the "Times" Publishing Company, Lower Thames Street—when I told him I did not think there was a directory published by that company he said it was quite a new one and a thought of Mr. Arthur Waters—next Monday, October 24th, Forest called and said he had called in reference to Langford's Directory and that the person who had called before had made some mistake—I believe he wanted me to pay something like £2 10s.—I did not pay him anything—I told him I believed it was a fraud and I would not believe him to be an honest man until I heard from the firm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ex-detective of the City police, now of 837, Salisbury House, London Wall—in November I received instructions and made various enquiries, and as a result on November 9th I went to Fenchurch Street station about 10 a.m.—I saw Boyce, Forest, Pike, and Lewis in conversation inside the station—they crossed to a public-house</p>

               <p>called the Railway Approach—they remained standing in the door of a compartment for about twenty minutes, when they returned to the station—they remained in conversation—Boyce took from his overcoat pocket a large envelope, opened it and took out some papers which appeared to be the size of a cheque book or printed form with counterfoil, but I could not see one—it may have been a cheque-book—Boyce then handed some of the papers to the others, retaining some himself—my impression is that the papers were longer than this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they remained in conversation a short time longer and then left the station—Lewis and Pike walked together and Forest and Boyce by themselves—I followed them along Fenchurch Street and Lombard Street as far as Mansion House railway station, where I left them—next day I went to Fenchurch Street station about 10 a.m. and saw Forest, Boyce, Pike and Lewis arrive there from different directions—it seemed to be a meeting place—they remained in conversation, when all four went to the Railway Approach and stood in conversation at the bar—Pike had in his hand some printed forms which were being looked at by Boyce and Lewis, and Forest was standing on the outside of the three, apparently on the look-out—I was in a private bar; they were in the public one—my son John was with me and had been with me the day before; he is twenty-one years old—on the second day I gave him some directions—on January 11th I was at Fenchurch Street station about the same time; Pike and Lewis came again—I kept them under observation, as before, with John Davidson—they remained in conversation, then went to the public-house, and remained at the door in conversation—they were under observation for about forty-five minutes—I did not see any of them again, except Forest, until they were in custody—I also gave directions to my younger son James, who is sixteen—on those three days Lewis had a heavy moustache and no beard—when I saw him in custody on February 4th he was growing a beard—when I saw Pike on those days he had a slight fair moustache—when I saw him in custody on February 6th he was clean shaven—when I saw Boyce he had only a heavy moustache-since he has been in custody he has grown a beard—he looked different—Forest was arrested on January 13th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Samuel Morris Samuel, of Houndsditch—on January 30th, about 5.40 p.m., Donovan en<lb/>tered our shop and asked to see a 22-carat wedding ring from 20s. to 25s.—I took a tray out of the window containing thirty-seven 22-carat wedding rings and showed them to him—he selected one, tried it on his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060064"/>
               <p>ringer, and remarked that it was too large—he replaced it and while looking down the tray for a smaller size, he snatched the tray out of my hand and ran out of the shop—he ran down a side turning—I ran after him and at the corner, was stopped by a man who pretended to be drunk and who tried to trip me up—I fell, and as I got up I received a blow on my head from a stick which partially dazed me—when I got into Ald<lb/>gate I lost sight of Donovan—on coming back I found eleven of the rings had been recovered which he had dropped out of the tray—I informed the police at once—I went later on to the police station by request of the police—at the Guildhall, in one of the cells, I picked Donovan out of about fifteen or sixteen other men—I had no hesitation—I am quite certain he is the man—my shop at the time of his visit was well lighted by electricity; he was in the shop about three minutes and I had quite a full view of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We do not deal in cheap jewellery—any stranger coming into our shop will be shown a valuable jewel—we do not make any discrimination between different persons—if a person comes in shabbily dressed we are a bit careful to be on our guard, but Donovan came in dressed very neatly and I did not suspect him—I think he was dressed in a dark brown suit—when one is running in the street it is not unusual to jostle someone else—it is a surmise on my part that the man who knocked up against me was lying in wait for me—if he were here he might say I jostled him—I think I mentioned about the blow on the head before the Magistrate—if it is not on the depositions, I suppose I did not—it seems very remarkable not to have done so—I gave a verbal description of the prisoner to the inspector at the station—he took it down—as far as I remember it was of a man about as tall as myself, rather stout, full red-faced, wearing a dark suit at the time, a double collar, a hard bowler hat and, I believe, a heliotrope tie—I went to the Guildhall expecting to find someone answering that description—I was anxious to find the culprit—as soon as I went in I recognised Donovan—the police did not come to me suggesting they had got the man—they simply said they had arrested four men on a different charge, and would I go and see whether my man was amongst them.</p>

I am a 'bus conductor and live at 115, St. Dunstan's Road, E.—on January 30th, about 5.40, I was outside the Three Nuns, Aldgate, with my omnibus—we were going east—four men hailed the 'bus and boarded it just outside Aldgate station—they went on top—three of them sat on seats while the fourth sat on the knees of one of the others—when we got to Commercial Street they got down in a hurried fashion—I had not then collected their fares—I said to one of them what about his fare, whether he was going to pay it—he said, "I am very sorry, I thought you went down this way," pointing to Commercial Street—I concluded that they had made a mistake and let them go as they had only ridden about 100 yards—the first man, I think in my own mind now,</p>

               <p>although I could not swear to him at the Guildhall Court, is Donovan—Gibbs was with them, sitting on the back seat—I have no hesitation in saying he is the man—I have sworn to him—when the bus got to the yard I found this jewel tray—it was under the front seat on the off-side, the one in front of that which Donovan had occupied—on February 21st I went to the Guildhall and was shown a group of fifteen or sixteen men—I there picked out Gibbs—I had no hesitation in doing so.</p>

I am Donovan's sister and live with him and his wife at 12, Stuart's Cottages, Bow—I help to keep the house—I remember Monday January 30th, because the prisoner and his wife went to Wickhams a draper's—I did not go with them—they asked me to get tea for them—they got back at 5 o'clock, bringing a paper parcel with them, containing flannelette and calico—there was a sale on at Wickhams'—the prisoner said he would like some whelks for his tea, and I went out to fetch them—I was gone ten minutes—when I came back I found the prisoner and his wife there and a Mrs. Smith—I remained in the house the rest of the day—my brother went out about 9.30 or 10—he was practically in my company the whole time—a Mr. Suttee came in later on—they do not go to sales every day and I do not buy whelks every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I identify January 30th, as I was going after a situation on the 31st—I told our solicitor at the Guildhall Police Court that I was at the house when the prisoner got into trouble—I did not give evidence there—I was first spoken to about giving evidence here last Tuesday by a gentleman—I do not know his name—he asked me if I knew any<lb/>thing of the case—he said to me, "Was not January 30th, Monday, the date that you had the whelks and flannelette?" and I said, "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went to Mr. Bedford, our solicitor on another matter, with Mrs. Donovan, but I never said anything about this charge—the matter did not arise.</p>

               <p>January 30th I called on the Donovan's about 6.30 p.m.—I went to see Miss Donovan, with whom I am keeping company—I remember that date because Mrs. Smith produced a pawn ticket saying she had had to pawn something to pay her fare from Leyton to Bow—when I got to the house they had had their teas—I stayed there till just on 12—Donovan was in the house all the time except when he went to see his sister off in a tram about 11.45.</p>

I live at 30a, Goodall Road, Leyton—Donovan is my brother—I do not often go to see him and his wife—the first time I saw him after Christmas was on January 30th—I fix that date because I pledged a bodice of mine and a blouse for 2s.—this is the ticket—I bought some food and firing with part of the money and then went to see my brother at Stratford at 5.30—I noticed the clock—my brother was at home with his wife and my sister, Annie Donovan—they were having tea—after tea my sister's young man came in—my sister showed me some things she had been buying, flannelette and cotton things—I stayed there all the evening—I left about 12.</p>

Two of his men are now in custody for stealing a quantity of provisions from their place at 62, and from what they said I have reason to believe you can tell me something about the matter"—I also told him that we should like to look over his place, which he gave us permission to do, and went with us—Mr. Marshall picked out the goods set out in this list (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they were all taken possession of by me and eventually conveyed to Moor Lane police station—they are a parcel of tea, one parcel of raisins, a box of raisins, a box of sul<lb/>tanas, two boxes of Epps' cocoa, a case of sugar partly filled, and one case of tinned peas—I asked Parkinson if he was in a position to produce any receipts for them or any part of them—he said, "I might find them</p>

He knew through con<lb/>versation with me where I worked. One day he said to me, 'Have you got a long pocket?' By the way he said it I knew what he meant. I then commenced to take various articles which are sold by us to his shop at first I handed the articles I stole to Parkinson himself, and then at the end of each week he would pay me, and I used to receive from him about a quarter of the value of the goods I handed to him. When we got used to each other I would hand the goods to any of Parkinson's employees over the counter, and in Parkinson's presence, and he always settled up with me at the end of the week"—Parkinson said, "I always paid full value for the goods I received"—all the goods were then produced and Buckley picked up a piece of brown paper and a piece of string and said, "That is the bag I took to Parkinson and which contained coffee"—Parkinson said, "Some of those beans you saw in the box at Aldersgate street"—I had seen some beans—Buckley said, "Those are the whole of the goods I took or sent to Parkinson at various times."</p>

               <p>the end of September or the beginning of October last year at the corner of Media a Road I had a conversation with him—he said, "You are just the one I wanted to see"—I said, "Oh"—he said, "Yes, I think I can put you on a deal; you will get a fiver out of it"—I said, "Yes, where is it? What is it?"—he said, "Come along, we will soon see," but I could not get any other word out of him edgeways as to what it was about—I walked as far as Battleburys' place, where I saw James Battlebury in the yard—I had never heard of the Battleburys before—Lamplough spoke to him, and he said, "You want to see my son," or words to that effect—I was taken into an office at the back of the yard—Fred Battle, bury was there—Lamplough said, "This is the one I was talking to you about," and he walked out—I said, "What is it about? Let's have a look at it; I want to go back to the shop," or words to that effect—I thought there was something for sale—Fred Battlebury said, "Sit down; that will be all right," and then he started telling me about an accident—I sat down—he said, "You know there was an accident in arch to one of my horses"—I said, "I do not know anything about it"—I was in a little bit of confusion at the time—I said, "I was at Spitalfields at the time"—he said, "That will be all right," and then he drew a sketch of his yard-way showing where the mare was driven and the turning round towards Cambridge Street—he said, "That is the hole where my horse fell down"—I said, "What is the good of talk<lb/>ing to me about it?"—he said, "Well, that is where the accident was"—I said, "I have already told you I know nothing about it"—the sketch was in ink on a piece of paper and a couple of lines were drawn for the opening of the gateway—he said that there should have been planks and a watchman, but he was having a drink somewhere—I believe he said the horse was a grey mare and worth about £80, but I would not be sure about that—he said there was no lamp there—I have not got the sketch; I did not think about it, but I can draw it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness drew a sketch upon a piece of paper</hi>)—that is just about how it was—he put marks where the poles ought to be round the hole, or on each side of it, but as I never saw the hole I did not know whether there was a hole or not—I said, "It is a little bit thick"—he said, "That will be all right you will be seen all right about it"—the sketch was on the table—he gave me this slip of paper and said, "Come and see me at 10.30 on Friday"—(<hi rend="italic">On the slip was</hi> "10.30 <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>, 315, <hi rend="italic">Mare Street"</hi>)—I kept the paper, and it has got dirty—I saw him write it—when I was told about going again I said, "No, it is a bit thick; I do not want to have anything to do with it"—I think I put both the sketch and the paper in the pocket of this overcoat, where, I believe, this paper has been ever since—I showed it to my brother—I did not trouble any more about them—I found the paper quite promiscuously in my pocket and wonder it had not been thrown away—I have searched for the sketch, but I have not seen it since a day or two after I had shown it to my brother—he asked me to show it to somebody else—I do not remember doing so—when I came out of the office Lamplough was waiting—he said, "Wait a minute," and he went and saw Battlebury in the room I had</p>

               <p>just left—he came out and said, "Charlie, come and have a drink; I have just got a half-crown off Battlebury"—I said, "All right," and went and had one in the Cock Tavern, next door—Lamplough said, "You know this means something for me; I am all right for a certain job"—I do not think we had any further conversation then—I left the Cock Tavern—I did not keep the appointment—I met Lamplough in the Median Road two or three days afterwards—he said, "I was just coming to you," and that he had a letter for me from Battlebury—he opened the envelope himself and read the letter to me, but kept it in his hands all the time—I said I should not keep the appointment—it was to meet at Battleburys' office and go on to the solicitors, or something of that effect—it appeared to be in the same writing as the slip of paper—the envelope was addressed to me at 28, Clifton Road, and the time mentioned was 10.30 to be at Battleburys' office—he tore the letter up and threw it in the gutter—I said, "That is just about the use it is fit for"; then we parted—I have not spoken to either of the prisoners since, but Fred Battlebury has been to the place I am working at—I next saw the prisoners in the Police Court—after I had given my evi<lb/>dence I saw Fred Battlebury at some auction rooms in Median Road, but he did not see me—he was with my young governor—when I was at Battleburys' office this book was lying on the desk—I am quite sure of it, because I could not forget the name outside, which was "Accidents"—it was open about the middle—Fred Battlebury wrote down "Haysman, Accident No. 2"—I saw him write it; I was sitting quite near and partly behind him—I do not know the page of the book, but it was between 235 and 238—some people incorrectly spell my name "Hasman" and "Hazeman"—I lived at 22, Hale Street, Deptford, from 1887 to 1889—I left when I got married—I did not give evidence in Janu<lb/>ary, 1893, for Battleburys, I did not even know they were in existence.</p>

I work for my living at 15, Kenmure Road—I have been a cabinet maker on and off for fourteen or fifteen years—I have regular wages according to the work I do—I renovate and keep antique furniture—I do not fake it—I put lines where they are wanted, but not marqueterie lines—I worked for Mr. Waatt—I have been in the public-house trade, and in one place for eight years. I had the super<lb/>vision for eight years—I held two licenses previous to that—I looked after the Duke of Cambridge, and the Artillery Tavern—I did cabinet making then—I went backwards and forwards to the workshop—I was at the Duke of Cambridge about three months, and about eight months at the Artillery Tavern—since then I have worked for my brother only—I worked for about eight years at 237, Victoria Park Road—I have since been in trouble about some jewellery to the amount of about 2s. 6d. where there was collateral security—I was in a lawyer's office, where I read about collateral securities in the papers—that was about 1884, and I had to copy it about a mortgage—I was office boy to Mr. Green about twenty years ago—I left because I could not understand the abbreviations; every time they put "sd" I put "second"—the next place I got they gave the work out to be copied, and I stopped over twelve months—I had six shillings a week—then I went to</p>

               <p>a public accountant's office, where I might have been about a couple of years—I was born in the cabinet line—I left school about thirteen or fourteen—I did some cabinet work when I was about twelve—Lamplough might have handed me the letter, but it was not entirely out of his posses<lb/>sion nor absolutely in my possession—I may have turned it round to see it—I have done some work on a grandfather clock for Mr. Waatt—Fred Battle<lb/>bury did not mention a word about a grandfather clock to me—I thought I was going to see him about a deal, and you never know your luck, you might get a fiver, but he Would not tell me what it was for—I was in a posi<lb/>tion to get money within a short time to pay for whatever I bought—I should have sold it as it was—when I saw Fred Battlebury I saw at once there was something fishy about the matter—I did not keep the sketch because I did not trouble any more about it—I missed it when I first went to give evidence—I cannot give the date when I was first asked to give evidence, but it was about three months before Christmas—I mentioned the matter to one or two people, I think two were police officers—a detective came to me once or twice about January 19th—I had only mentioned it to my brother previous to his coming—I tried to find the sketch when I was asked about it, but I could not—I have only three rooms to look through—in my answer at the Police Court I said I believed it was a grey mare, but I would not be sure that Fred Battlebury said it was a grey mare—I would not be sure that he said there were two accidents—he said there were no red lights, and there was no watchman—Battleburys' address was 313, but I was told it was called 315 on account of the public-house—I did not know Mason or Horn before this case when I saw them on the Friday—I have known Lamplough pretty well for the last four years, but I have known him a good many years—I bought some plate for 1s., sold it for 2s., and it cost 9d. to sell it—we have both attended sales—I did not ask his opinion about things sold—sometimes I might ask him, "What do you think of that," about some old thing outside a door—I saw him in Amhurst Road when he took a man out of a public-house to be a witness, but the old man said a fiver was not good enough—Lamplough and he went to Battlebury's and came back again—when I said at the Police Court that that witness was only 6 7/8 parts of a man I meant it would only take 1/8 to finish him—the man came back by himself.</p>

               <p>answered what Mr. Young asked me at the Police Court—I do not know why Lamplough said, "I am all right for a certain job," but I know he had been out of work a considerable time—I was under the impression that he had been out of work for a fortnight or three weeks, because he asked me if I could give him a job of washing off—I have met Lamplough several times since, in fact he has been in my workshop after that—we have talked about the accident—I think I spoke to Sharp about the accident about the same time the detectives spoke to him, I saw him speaking to the detectives, and I saw him afterwards—I did not keep the dates—Sharp was coming along Mare Street when Lamplough pulled him up and spoke to him and Sharp said to Lamplough, "Give us a chance to earn a straight tanner," I did not hear what Lamplough said to Sharp, but Sharp said, "No, I do not want anything of that, I would sooner push a barrow to earn a straight tanner"—goodness knows how many were to be paid for being witnesses—I knew Sharp from his doing work for the same people as I did, but he was never a witness then.</p>

I live at 1, Rushmore Road, Clapton—I was a provision salesman, but I am not now—I have recently gone into other employment—I have known Lamplough eight or ten years, first as secretary of a football club and then clerk to Bunch &amp; Duke, auctioneers—prior to the beginning of October last year I lost sight of him for some time—I had been to the north of England a good time and when I left the north I went to south London—towards the end of September or the beginning of October I met Lamplough casually at the corner of Clarence Road, Hackney—we simply said, "How do you do?" and I left him—about the beginning of November I met him again in the Clarence Road about noon—he asked me how I was doing—I told him I was out of work and was doing pretty rough—he asked me would I like to earn a five pound note—I said, "Yes, I should, very much"—he said, "Come along with me"—I said, "Well, what am I to do for you?"—he said, "Come and see a friend of mine, and then we will explain matters fully to you"—I accompanied him to Battleburys' premises in Mare Street—on the way I kept asking him about it, but he would not give me any definite reply—he said had I seen an accident?—I said, "No," and he told me that they wanted a witness or two, would I come and see Mr. Battlebury about it?—he said that some improvements in Hackney were taking place by the County</p>

I know what I am brought here for; let's know what you are going to say," then I got into conversation with Battlebury—Limplough remained in the room—Battlebury told me that on a certain date in March, I do not recollect which, the London County Council were making improvements in Hackney, and that Battle<lb/>bury's horses and vans had met with an accident—he then drew me a plan of the place where the yard runs into Mare Street, from point to point—this is the sketch that he made in my presence—this is on a scrap of paper which he picked up on his desk—there are marks on the plan which he showed me, which was supposed to be the Town Hall and the Cock Tavern, adjoining his premises, and I wrote "T. Hall" and "Cock Tavern" in their presence—he explained what took place when he drew the sketch—he told me the horse and van drew out of their yard, and they had to cross a hole about eight inches to ten inches deep; that the London County Council had put planks across to make it secure so that the vehicle could pass over, that while passing over those planks I believe he said the weight of the near side horse, I believe it was a grey mare, broke through the planks, that the van came down with a jump into the hole and that the horse fell, but that it gained its feet again, that the driver was not thrown from the dicky, and that then the van was pulled round into Morning Lane—this is what I am supposed to have seen—then Battlebury two or three minutes after the accident took place was supposed to have come across to Morning Lane, hobbling on two sticks, and he was supposed to have seen me standing by—he said, "Did you see the accident?"—I was supposed to say "Yes"—he then took my name and address and said I should hear from him—I was to say that to their solicitor as what was supposed to have happened—he then made an appointment for me to appear at Mr. Clifford Turner's office the following Tuesday at an address at Finsbury Pavement—this paper in my writing contains the notes I made from Battlebury's dictation to prepare to make my statement to his solicitor, Mr. Clifford Turner, the following Tuesday—he also gave me one of Mr. Turner's headed memorandums—I took it down after he had said it, after the first conversation; then when he approached me about appearing at the solicitor's office I said, "The best thing is to give me full particulars; of course I shall not commit myself at the solicitors', and then he made notes about the grey mare and what he wanted me to say at the solici<lb/>tors', and I said, "The best thing I can have is the notes ready so that I shan't make a mistake when I am making my statement—he handed</p>

Clifford Turner &amp; Co., 68, Finsbury Pavement"—when Fred Battlebury had told me the solicitors' address I had handed my pen back to him, I took a pencil out of my pocket and wrote what is written in pencil—I saw him write "Friday, 4 o'clock"—I had put the paper in my pocket and I took it out to add the name—I then left—Battlebury gave me half-a-crown to get a drink, and I took it to my wife, in consequence of which I had a conversation with her, the result of which was I went to the London County Council on the Monday morning following and had an interview with a repre<lb/>sentative of the Council—the following day, Tuesday, I went to Clifford Turner's office—I saw a clerk, and came away—I next went to Turner's office on Friday, October 7th—before that I had seen the three prisoners—I met Lamplough I am positive once or twice walking through Hackney—on the Friday I saw at Turner's office Battlebury, Lamplough, and Horn—I had been meeting Lamplough every day and the Battleburys on and off—on one occasion I told Fred Battlebury that I should tell Clifford Turner exactly what sort of a witness I was going to be—he said, "The best thing you can do is to keep your mouth shut, and wink at these things. He knows all about it; you only do what you are asked"—the "he" referred to the solicitor—on the Friday I reached Turner's office about 4.5 p.m.—I found Fred Battlebury, Lamplough, and Horn in Mr. Turner's private room—they were sitting down when I was shown in by a clerk—Fred Battlebury said to Mr. Turner, "This is Mason, the witness on the Morning Accident"—as far as I can recollect, I was asked to take a seat and then Mr. Turner called in a shorthand clerk, who sat on the right of him and he then commenced to take Lamplough's statement—Lamplough commenced making his statement about the accident, and when they came to the point as to where the accident exactly took place outside what house in Hackney, Turner put him right—I believe Lamplough had said that it took place, as far as he recollected, outside Dresdner's shop, but Turner said it was opposite the jeweller's—my opinion was that Turner knew all about it and Lamplough didn't—I think Turner had to tell Lamplough it was a grey horse instead of a brown one, or something of that—there was an argument between Turner and Lamplough about those points; they were a long time getting Lamp<lb/>lough's statement correct—in nearly everything Lamplough said Turner had to put him straight—when Lamplough had finished Horn was the next to make a statement—as far as I recollect, Turner asked him if he agreed with the previous witness—Horn said, "Yes," and then turner dictated to the shorthand clerk the long statement which read precisely as Lamplough had said it—Horn never said a word to interrupt the statement—I cannot recollect Turner asking Horn any other question—then they dealt with me—Turner asked me practically the same, and then dictated to his shorthand clerk precisely as he had done with Horn,</p>

               <p>but I interrupted—I said, "Excuse me, I did not"—he said, "You mind your own business," so I shut up—a few days afterwards I wrote out from recollection what Turner had dictated to his shorthand writer as nearly as I could recollect it: that on the morning of a certain date which, I believe, was in March, I was walking from Clapton towards Cambridge Heath about 10 o'clock a.m. Passing Battleburys' yard a pair-horse van drew out. I stood back on the pavement to allow it to draw by me. I think I saw the London County Council's workmen putting some planks down over a hole which was just on the right of Battleburys' yard. The grey horse stumbled, put his foot through the planks, and the van came into the bole bumb. The driver did not fall off the dicky; he then drew round to Morning Lane on the left of Battleburys', coming out of their entrance, and Mr. Battlebury was supposed to come across and see me standing by the horse and van after it was pulled up, and I gave him my name and address, as I stated first. The horse was all of a tremble and kept <hi rend="italic">purring</hi> with its fore feet or pawing with its front leg—that is as far as I can really recollect it—there may be other things, but that is the substance of it—after the statements had been dictated to the shorthand clerk, Lamplough, Horn, and I adjourned into the waiting room outside Turner's private room, leaving Battlebury behind with Turner—we waited there about ten or fifteen minutes—when Battlebury came out we all went out of the-office together, and into a public-house for refreshment—Battlebury gave us-half-a-crown apiece—the following day I saw the prisoners, I think the two Battleburys and Lamplough, somewhere in Hackney—Fred Battlebury told me that he was going to take the carman from their premises to go to Turner's to make a state<lb/>ment, and Mr. Turner wanted us to sign our statements—I told him I should decline absolutely point blank to sign any statement—I cannot remember dates, we had such a number of conversations—one conver<lb/>sation was with James Battlebury in the warehouse, when he told me the Council had retained Mr. Dickens, but <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had beaten <hi rend="italic">him</hi> two or three times and meant to beat him again—I believe that was the time he threatened to kick me out of the place—I walked into Battlebury's yard and asked if there was anything fresh, when he said, "You damned young scoundrel, things have come to our ears which have rather sur<lb/>prised us, we are going to drop this case with the London County Council," then, I believe, I left the place—this happened as I was passing down to the gateway—he told me that Clifford Turner had advised them to drop the case—I asked him why, and he said. "You must understand you know that the solicitors are dead against each other in Court, but they are the best of friends outside, and give each other the tip of what has taken place," and he said that he had been told that somebody had been to the County Council and had given the game away—he said that I had, and that it had come to Clifford Turner's ears that somebody had been to the County Council making statements—I had been there a good many times, making reports—roughly speaking, I believe I denied it—a day or two after I left James Battlebury I saw Fred Battlebury in his private office and suggested that Lamplough had been touting</p>

               <p>it round Hackney just like dirt to everybody, and that somebody had gone up to the Council—he said that might be the case—I said, "Then how are you going to finish up with the County Council?"—he said, "Of course we shall have to pay their costs. The explanation I shall give is that we have not got sufficient to carry the case on with," and I think he said that the evidence was not sufficient—I had another conversation with Lamplough on one occasion, I do not recollect the date, when he asked me to go as witness for Battleburys in an action against Mann &amp; Crossman—I told him I would not do it for a £1,000—that took place facing the Hackney Railway Tavern—I said I could not stop any longer I wanted to get away—that was soon after the conversation about dropping the case against the County Council, but Fred Battlebury had told me of the action against Mann &amp; Crossman long before that—he said that when their man was driving in Holloway Road the horse was startled by one of Mann &amp; Crossman's traction engines, and that the driver was thrown out, or thrown down and hurt—subsequent to that conversation Lamplough asked me to be<lb/>come a witness—I remember one occasion when Fred Battlebury told me that a surveyor was coming down to take the plan of where the accident took plate—that was in an action against the County Council—he promised me £5, carrying out Lamplough's previous promise—he said he would make me a present of a £5 note or perhaps a little more according to the damages he got—I asked the Battleburys for my expenses two or three times—Fred Battlebury said that he could not be bled—that was before the case was given up—he also said that it would cost them about £100 as it was—he contradicted himself a few days afterwards by telling me that Clifford Turner's did these sort of things on commission—James Battlebury told me that in the warehouse when we were speaking about Clifford Turner's and he said that they had done their law work as regards accidents and such like—he said they were the recognised firm of solicitors for accidents and that he had introduced young fellows from Hackney who had met with accidents, and that Clifford Turner's never charged them anything, but if they were to get £100 damages Clifford Turner's would give them about £40 out of the £100 damages.</p>

I am a watchman in the Works Department of the London County Council—I live at 3, the Churchyard, Mare Street, Hackney—I was employed with the last witness on the Mare Street widen<lb/>ing on the 8th and 9th March as watchman—I went on duty about 5 p.m., and remained till about 6.30 a.m.—I heard of no accident—the lamps were lighted, one on the trestles at each corner—there was also a strong electric light opposite the gateway—on going off duty at 6.0 on the 9th I made my ordinary report to Gray that all was right, and I left—I came back about the same time the next evening, and remained till 6.30 on the morning of the 10th—there was no accident—the lamps were hung in the same way, and there was the electric light—no report was made to me of any accident—Gray came every morning about 6.30—I met him, and made my usual report that everything was all right—during the whole time that I was watching on the nights of March 9th and 10th no complaint was made to me by Battlebury, or his son, or by anyone on his behalf and the trestles were not disturbed—the ventilator was not near the gateway, and that was protected by the poles, which were not disturbed.</p>

               </hi> (M.R.C.V.S.) I live at 3, Story Lane, Tooley Street—I have been in practice over twenty-one years, and have had considerable experience of horses—on April 5th, 1904, I went to Battleburys' premises to examine two horses which were alleged to have</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060101"/>
            <p>sustained injury in an accident—I first saw Fred Battlebury; he pointed out two horses to me in the stable—one was a grey mare—I spoke to James Battlebury, but do not recollect the conversation—I asked to have the horses brought out, when I examined them—they were walked up and down—I found no traces of recent injury—If the grey mare had been injured on the 8th I should have expected to find some trace of it—she was lame in the hind leg from spavin of old standing—the hock was quite hard and callous—there was no heat in it—I should say the lameness was caused some time previously—there was nothing but spavin to account for it—she was very aged, and not grey, but white—apart from any accident, I should value her at £12 or £13, taking her as sound and before she had met with the accident—I also carefully examined the bay mare and had her walked out and trotted up and down—she was lame in the near hind leg, the other was lame in the off hind leg—spavin was the cause—it was of long standing; there was nothing else to account for the lameness—she was an aged mare too, but not so old as the white mare—supposing she was sound, I put £16 value upon her—I made a report to the London County Council—as the spavin had existed for some time, these mares could not have been sound at the time of the alleged accident, in my opinion.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
               <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MARSHALL HALL</hi>. I was told to go and examine a couple of horses that had met with an accident—I did not assume anything—the objective symptom of bone spavin generally is an en<lb/>largement in the hock from a bony deposit, or an abnormal deposit of bone—it causes a stiffness, especially when the horse is first brought out of the stable—with the spavin the horses would be worth about half the value I put upon them as sound, say about £15 the two—a horse is always worth more money for commercial purposes—a horse putting his foot in a hole four and a half inches deep might sprain the muscles of his back.</p>

               <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUTTON</hi>. I examine the London County Council tramway horses—before examining these horses I did not communicate with the prisoners, nor ask them to bring a veterinary surgeon to meet me—I do not do so personally; I cannot speak for other people—another gentleman would not have changed my opinion—I was examining the horses about a quarter of an hour—I did not take a note of the time—I was there more than five minutes—I was there long enough to examine them—I cannot say, but I expect I put questions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> James Battlebury was present when I was conducting the examination—he represented the firm—I had the horses run up and down in front of me—I made a thorough examination—if an acci<lb/>dent had happened there would have been a sprain—the objective symptoms I saw were not consistent with sprain—the horses could do slow, steady work; spavin does not affect a horse much except at the start—you can not only feel spavin outside the horse's hock, but you can see it.</p>

On that charge I shall take you to the Hackney police station, where you will be detained"—they made no reply—about two hours later I saw Lamplough outside Battleburys' gate—I said, "Is your name Frederick Lamplough?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police officer, and hold a warrant for your arrest, charging you with being concerned with the two Battleburys in attempting to obtain money by false pretences for the London County Council"—I took him to Hackney police station, where he was charged with the other two prisoners—they made no reply—on searching Fred Battlebury I found these four letters and this Bill of Costs from Clifford Turner &amp; Co.—I think he had taken them out of the safe in my presence and put them in his pocket when we were in his office—I also saw this account book in his office—it was afterwards produced at the Police Court—I had taken extracts from it before then—we noticed several pages had been torn out and I pointed that out to Fred Battlebury, and asked him whether he could account for it—he said, "Yes, these books are not much good; they are what we buy as lumber, and when we want a bit of writing paper we tear the leaf out of a book the tint to our hand"—I then pointed out to him that a portion of the leaf was left in the book, and that it had some writing on it, and I asked him whether he could account for it—he said he could not—James Battlebury was then in a little office, he could hear—there axe three leaves torn out between pages 569 and 570, also another one further on—a greater part of page 235 is gone—he said he could not account for it—it does not appear to have been used for accounts since 1893—I find accounts have been kept up to January 27th 1893—the word "Accidents" is on the cover—I find there is an entry, dated December 31st, 1904, and one on November 29th, 1901—there are notes of accidents in the book and on the sheets—the three sheets</p>

            <p>he saw Mr. Slater on the 9th And gave him an account of the accident of the 8th—on the 23rd he saw me, when I took down the particulars of both accidents fully—at that time I was under the impression that Mr. slater had taken particulars of both accidents, therefore I did not write a letter in regard to the second accident till I noticed that the previous, letter had not mentioned it, and then I wrote calling the attention of the Council to the matter—in pursuance of my notice I issued a writ and instructed counsel to draw a statement of claim for tort in the usual course, making the claim a little on the safe side—on May 24th, 1904, I wrote to Battlebury asking for an appointment with his witnesses—I had no reply, but subse<lb/>quently I had a telephonic message and I saw him on June 29th and 30th when we went through the business—on October 5th I got a letter stating that he would call on the 7th—if Mason says ho called on the 5th it is untrue—Mason came on the 7th—on that day Battlebury, Lamplough, and Horn came in first, and afterwards Mason—I do not remember any<lb/>thing about his smoking a cigarette, but I should not have allowed it—Lamplough had commenced the account of the accident when Mason came in—the statements of the witnesses were taken in each other's presence, and I have never heard that that is a wrong thing—I do not know the practice in criminal work, but I have taken down statements of witnesses together plenty of times, and I have never heard that it was wrong—first Battlebury came in with Lamplough and Horn—Lamplough was on the right and Horn on the left—Battlebury was a little more forward—I said, "Who are these men?"—he said, "These are the wit<lb/>nesses"—I then took Lamplough's statement in the usual way, asking him first "Your name?"—he said, "Lamplough"—then after getting his Christian name I said, "What do you know about this accident?"—he gave me an account of it, and I put a few questions to him, and then called in my shorthand clerk and I was actually dictating the statement to the clerk when Mason came in—he was exceedingly talkative and I asked him to be seated, but he kept interfering and repeatedly stopped me, interrupting about the boards, whether they were lengthways or crossways—Lamplough said they were lengthways—then Mason said "That is right"—I said, "Do be quiet; I cannot speak to everybody at once"—eventually, when I had finished with Lamplough, Horn came—he was not an intelligent witness and I could not understand where he was standing when he saw the accident, and we got at loggerheads a little because he said that he was walking north and was on the right-hand side of the pavement when I said, "You could not be; you must have been on the other side," and I drew a rough sketch and got the particulars for the proof into form, which was the proper thing to do—after that Mason's proof was taken exactly in the same way—he seemed to know more about it than anybody—it is not true, as he states, that I told him to "Shut up" and stopped him—I never made such a remark to a man—all I did was to say, "Wait till your turn comes," and when his turn came he had an opportunity of saying anything he desired—I asked each witness to give his name and address—I was furnished with a transcript of the statements for the three proofs—I do not lose much time—their then left the room—</p>

            <p>in a few minutes Battlebury came back and spoke about Mason's fee—I said I should subpoena him in proper course—the statements were not then signed—they were not drawn up till a few days afterwards, as I was very busy—I did not give Mason any money—he asked me for it once or twice—on the 11th I think he called when I was out and saw my clerk—on the 13th I was asked by Mason for money—I was told that he had called and desired to see me—I went to the door and said, "What is this about?" as I did not then remember the case—he said, "Mr. Battlebury sent me"—I said, "You came to see me before; what do you want?"—he said, "Look here, this is all very well; you are making a nice shuttlecock of me. I first come to you and you or your clerks send me to Battlebury for money and he tells me to come here"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "All I have got is half-a-crown; you are not very generous, but never mind, I am not coming to you any more. Do you mean to say you are not going to give me any more money?"—I said, "What on earth do you mean? certainly not; what for?"—he said, "I want my subpoena and fee. I may not be found to give evidence. I shall move and you won't be able to find me; I am going to Streatham"—I tried to lead him on—he said, "I have asked for my subpoena and you will not give it me," and to make an end to the argument he said, "Very well, all right," and went away—I formed a very strong opinion about him—I did not like him from the first time I saw him—between that date and the 24th certain information and rumours made me distrust him still more, in conse<lb/>quence of which I wrote for Battlebury to come and see me—I told Battle<lb/>bury I had found out about Mason's previous convictions and he said he had heard rumours about the man's character—I advised him that the evidence was not good enough for an action for £90, and that he might lose over £200 over it, and I advised him not to go on with it—I said that I did not care about the case—the result was that he gave me in<lb/>structions to withdraw the action—he paid our costs and those of the County Council—it is not true that I ever worked on commission—I have never done so in my life, except that it is the usual practice in debt collecting to charge 5 per cent.—Horn was a bit stupid and occasionally appeared to have had too much, to drink and I was suspicious of him—the was not drunk—Mason we could not possibly have relied upon—so that we had only Lamplough and the carmen to give evidence; besides, there was an under current at work, in my opinion, against us; therefore I ad<lb/>vised Battlebury to abandon the action—on October 31st Battlebury called upon me with Mason—I declined to see Mason—I asked Battlebury why Mason wanted to see me—he said two private detectives had been to Mason and that Mason had tried to frighten him by saving that h had been to the Council—I advised Battlebury what to do and said, "let him go to the Council or do anything he likes," but I would not see him—I have conducted nine actions for Battlebury in five years connected with their running vans, which are the most dangerous vehicles out com<lb/>pared with walking vans—we have not previously made any claim against the County Council—from first to last I had no suspicion of the evidence till Battlebury told me what he did.</p>

               </hi> (M.R.C.V.S.) I live at 126, Dalston Lane, and I have been in practice as a veterinary surgeon since March, 1890—for some years I have attended to Battlebury's horses—on March 8th, 1904, I went to his stables in the evening and saw a grey mare—she was very lame in the hip—I had it fomented and some liniment rubbed in—I found no spavin in the hock—I gave instructions for the shoe to be taken off—I formed the opinion that an accident had caused the injury—I communi<lb/>cated the result of my examination to Fred Battlebury—I told him to keep on fomenting and to use liniment for a couple of days—on the 10th I saw the bay mare, and ordered liniment and robbing—about a month after<lb/>wards Battlebury came to me and said, "These horses do not appear to be doing much good," and I went and looked at them, and had them driven out, and thoroughly examined them—they were both still very lame—I told Battlebury that I did not think the grey mare would be of any use;
</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060108"/>
            <p>the other might be, but it would be a long time—another gentleman was called in and in consequence of our advice the horses were put up at Barbi<lb/>can for sale without reserve—in my opinion it was a reasonable thing for Battlebury to dispose of those horses at the time he did—the brown mare was lame by the near hind fetlock—the bay mare was seven or eight years old and the grey nine or ten—it is quite a mistake to say they were older—the grey mare could not have been twenty years old—they would not fetch more than 30s. each if they were—I will swear I did not see any spavin—if it had been there I would have seen it—if she had had spavin the bay would not have fetched £16 as she did, but about 30s. for dogs' meat—they were worth £30 if they were true in harness—the omnibus companies pay £35 to £37 each for their horses, but they buy in a large quantity, and a private purchaser would have to pay £40 or more for the same horse—I should say the lameness was not of old standing.</p>

I have been a carman in the employment of Battleburys since they started business—I was about two years away in South Africa, as I am a reserve man, after which I came back to work for them—on March 8th I took out a pair-horse van to go to Gravesend—as I could not go straight out, I had to turn to the right—after going twenty or thirty paces I found that from ten to twelve feet square of blocks had been taken out, and to get over that the foreman of the works was sent for, who had some planks put down—I did not notice any sand—three or four men were employed to put down the planks, when I drove on—the grey horse and the bay trod upon the planks, which seemed to buckle under—the grey stumbled, but struggled up again—I drove on towards Morning Lane—I noticed the mare was lame, when I pulled up on the other side of the road, after I had driven her a little time—she never went lame before—when I found that she was lame I got down and had a look at her—she seemed to have got lame in the hind legs—I tried to drive her on a little further, but in about five or ten minutes I had to stop again, and then I took he home and got out another horse, and resumed my journey—I was away two days—when I came back I saw her in the stable—she was lame—I know that the governor sold her, or got rid of her in April—we came back the same day as we went out.</p>

Coop; I be<lb/>lieve that is his wife—I know the prisoner, he was the great international football player in years gone by—since I have been appointed secretary he brought an action against the company on October 20th, 1904, for £66 2b. 8d.—my company defended that action and have claimed £37 10s. by way of counter claim—we are prosecuting him now for an offence said to have taken place in 1903, and in respect to which there if a civil ac<lb/>tion pending—until he brought this action to recover the £66 there was no suggestion of a prosecution, but there was a suggestion made to me to recover the money—our books are audited—this cheque and voucher were duly passed to the auditor—T swore the information in this case be<lb/>cause the directors decided to prosecute, and as secretary of the com<lb/>pany I laid the information—I gather from the minute book that be—be<lb/>tween June, 1902, and September, 1903, the prisoner had sole control of the banking account and drew cheques upon his own signature alone—I cannot tell from the stock book what is the price of these three pianos; I do not know that we had them—our pianos are first valued at £30 each I think, and the next year, I think they are valued at 10 per cent, less—some are let out and put into public-houses—some are in better posi<lb/>tions than others, one of these three bought from Fiorillo was at the Im<lb/>perial Anns, Chelsea, and one at the Railway Tavern, Lower Edmonton—the information was drawn up by the company's solicitors—I do not know how to draw up an information—one of the pianos earned 19s. and the other just over £1 per week.</p>

I am a poultry merchant at 2, Big Hill Yard, Clerkenwell—in February, 1903, I went to the workshop of Rose, Coop &amp; Co., about some repairs and to ask them to take away some pianos which were in some public-houses—I saw Rissone and Mr. Alfred Coop—to avoid having any further trouble I offered the com<lb/>pany to buy my share out—they asked me what was my price, and I asked £22 each—I spoke to Rissone—the prisoner was not there—I did not see him about these pianos—I sold two pianos for £60; there was £1 commission on each—there were three pianos—one was in the work-shop, one at the Railway Tavern, Lower Edmonton, and one at the Im<lb/>perial Arms, King's Road, Chelsea—I was paid £59 for them by Rissone the day after the sale—I received five £10 notes, and the rest in gold and silver—I gave a receipt in Italian—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is not the one; it is not in my writing nor my signature—I never authorised anyone to sign this—I never received the £97 10s. mentioned in it—I never re<lb/>ceived this cheque for that amount—it is not my name at the back—I never saw it, nor authorised anybody to sign it on my behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite sure that I received five £10 notes—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is my usual signature—I never had a £20 note—this note (<hi rend="italic">looking at a</hi> £20 <hi rend="italic">note folded up</hi>) has on it "Fiorillo, 9, Great Bath Street"—that was my address—I am a business man and receive 50,000 of these notes (<hi rend="italic">unfolding same</hi>)—I do not know if this is one of the identical notes handed to the prisoner when he cashed the cheque—I have never been convicted in Italy—I have never been in prison—I have been in the Italian Army—I did not desert—I am not a deserter—I do not know how many English notes I have had in my life—I do not know how much business I am doing—I believe I have had a £20 note and more than that in my possession—I swear this is not my signature on this receipt—I wrote these signatures at the Police Court (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I see that the "b" and the "e" in Umberto are not joined, and that it is the same in the receipt—that is why I always said it was a very good imitation; it all de<lb/>pends how my hand is; I never pay any attention to whether the last stroke goes up and down—I believe the signature I have just given is far better than the one on the receipt—I handed the Italian receipt to Rissone, the man who paid me—I know Mr. Alfred Coop; I thought at first his name was Mr. Rose, but a week before the case came to Marl-borough Street I found out what his name was—on February 7th I met him between my house and the Holborn Town Hall; another gentleman was with me—I did not say, "I am afraid now I have gone too far to alter my evidence"—I said to Mr. Alfred Coop, "If I had only seen you before, the case would never have been brought"—I did not say, "Tell your solicitors to hand me the receipt once again when I am in Court and ask me if that is my signature"—they suggested that I should say if they</p>

I live at 48, Scroop Buildings, Portpool Lane, Holborn—I was working there—I know Rissone—I was working at the factory in February, 1903—I received a £10 note from Rissone, and cashed it at the Blue Posts public house and brought back the change to him—I flaw Fiorillo there at the time—I saw Rissone then hand five £10 notes and £9 in gold to him—I did not see Fiorillo give any receipt for the money—I went downstairs directly to my work.</p>

I went with him on a Saturday. He gave me some money. I cannot say he cashed a cheque. Very likely I went into the bank with him. I did not see him endorse the cheque, or write on it. I went back with the money he gave me to Mr. Rissone. I handed that money to Mr. Rissone the same day. I did not see the cheque. The money was given to me in a bag, gold and silver only, for wages. I did not get any notes from Mr. Coop. There might have been £50 or £60 in the bag. I knew the money was for wages. I usually went on the Saturday to the bank"—I am not aware of any messenger in the business who would be likely to take £60 in notes to Rissone's place in Clerkenwell—I have no idea who took it—I do not know any<lb/>body who would have been trusted with that money, unless it was some of the staff of the offices in Regent Street, which had nothing to do with the works—I went every Saturday to the bank—I usually got a bearer cheque from the office and went to the bank for the wages; but on this occasion they refused to cash it, so I took the cheque back to the office and that was the time that Mr. Coop came with me to the bank—Rissone gave Fiorillo the notes between, roughly, 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.—I cannot say to an hour—I knew the pianos had been sold to the com<lb/>pany—I generally worked to 10 or 11 p.m.; I was on piece work.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was secretary from the beginning of the company—I believe the prisoner, his wife, and one other person, found £250 to start it—I do not know that some portion of the business has been trans<lb/>ferred to his wife; it is since my time—I knew the prisoner before I went to the company as the secretary of some big football clubs, and as a well-known footballer—during its early inception the whole cash of the company was in his hands—I have nothing to say against him—I was told that the pianos were being bought from Fiorillo—the name is spelt Wrongly on the cheque as "F-e-r-r-o-l-l-o"—it is an order cheque, therefore, it would have to bear at the back an endorsement exactly similar to the name of the payee—the endorsement is also spelt in the same way—Fiorillo was entered in the books as of that name—I see the name is spelt differently in the body of the stamped receipt, F-u-e-r-r-e-l-l-o, whereas the signature is spelt right—I do not know where the prisoner came from, but he came and asked for a cheque—he did not bring Morini, whom I know quite well by sight, with him—the offices of the company are at Regent Street—I do not recollect that Morini was at the offices when the cheque was drawn; I think not—I should not have seen him if he had been downstairs—in the middle of 1903. this receipt would come before the auditor—the prisoner remained managing director of the company down to Sep<lb/>tember, 1904—I left the secretary ship in December, 1903—during the time I was there there was no suggestion of fraud against the prisoner.</p>

B.</hi>) because, in the first place, the secretary drew my attention to it, and then I saw that the signature was very similar, in my opinion, to the handwriting in the body of it; I also looked at the "F"—in consequence of that I made inquiries of the prisoner if that was Fiorillo's signature—he told me it was, and said, "If you are not satisfied, I will get you another one. If you art not satisfied then, I will produce Mr. Fiorillo"—I accepted his word—the next time I was on the audit, I cannot say for certain when, the receipt was produced, and the prisoner told me, as he had told me before, that it was Fiorillo's signature, and that he could produce me another receipt if I was not satisfied with that one, or he could produce fiorillo himself—there was nothing special about the other receipts to draw my attention to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 79, Catherst Road, Lefer Street, Mile End—between 7 and 8 p.m. on January 7th, Saturday, I met the prisoner in the Al beerhouse with several men—I never spoke to him—while I was in the bar a man threw something at me, and I remonstrated with him—I have never seen him from that day to this—the prisoner interfered and said to me, 'What is the matter with you? Do you want a row"—I said, "No, I do not want a row"—the man in the bar said, "Come away, Green; don't have a row," and I went outside—I did not see the prisoner there—I went into another beerhouse—the prisoner came and called me out, and wanted to renew the quarrel, saying, "You wanted a row. Have one outside now"—I went out and blows were struck on each side; we both struck one another together—he ran away saying, "Stop a minute, I will soon stop you"—I went away with another man—I was standing outside the Al again, when I saw the prisoner standing at the opposite corner of the street jeering—I said to him, "Let us finish the fight, or shake hands and be friends"—he thereupon rushed across the road and struck me from behind with some<lb/>thing in his fist and I remembered no more—I had no weapon with me—I had not threatened the prisoner at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman—on the evening of January 7th Green came into the A1 while I was there—somebody in the bar threw a paper bag at him, whereupon he turned round and told the man he did not want to be made a target of—the prisoner then turned round and asked Green if he was after trouble and asked him to have a fight—I turned to Green and said, "Come on you don't want to fight. Come oat of it"—I took him up the street and came back and went into the Albion—I then heard a noise at the back and went out and saw Green and the prisoner quarrelling with words—Green said, "Why don't you shake hands, and let us be friends, or let us fight and finish it?"—I said to Owen, "You do not want any fight. Come on out of it," and I took Mm as far as the Al, and the prisoner went to the other side of the road—while at the corner he began jeering and sneering and Green came across and said, "come on, Tom, if it is like that, let us finish it," and he threw off his coat—I turned round and caught hold of Green, when suddenly the prisoner rushed from the corner and struck him across the head—green was standing so that he could not see the prisoner coming—the prisoner hit Green several blows on his head with a hammer, or a piece of iron with a big head—Green was knocked down and I closed with the prisoner and brought him to the kerb, and his sister took the hammer away from him as I held his arms—I then released him and went over to pick up Green, whom I took to my house—I then fetched a cab which took him to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner was jeering Green stood in the middle of the road and wanted to fight—the prisoner did not come up from behind but sideways—Green was knocked down by the first blow and he got up again—he had absolutely nothing in his hinds—there was any amount of people round, and some ought to have been here—they are rather rough people—Green could not defend himself—he was too dazed by the first blow—I did my best to stop the prisoner striking him—there were several blows struck by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to the London Hospital—about 9.30 p.m. on January 7th I examined Green, and found two wounds, one a contused wound at the back of his head, about 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch and another one extending from about 4 inch above the ear, dividing part of the ear to the cheek—it had slit the ear and a piece of the scalp just behind the ear—the wound at the back of the head might have been caused by a blow from some blunt instrument or by a fall, but the one on the ear was undoubtedly caused by some<lb/>thing with a cutting edge, in my opinion—it would be caused by moderate violence—he was under my care until February 1st.</p>

I am manager to Thomas Perry, jeweler, of 272, Oxford Street—I was in the shop between 6 and 7 p.m. on December 19th, when Milne came in—he asked to see some rings—I showed him some and he selected a plain gold Belcher ring, value £3—he then asked to see some bracelets—he selected a curb bracelet, valued £1 4s. 6d.—he said he had not enough cash with him, would I take a cheque—I naked to see it, and he produced one drawn by Smith for £12 10s.—he said Smith was a collector or an inspector to the New York Life Insur<lb/>ance Co.,</p>

               <p>and the cheque was given by Smith to him for work done—he pro<lb/>duced this business card, "W. J. Milne, builder and decorator, 63, Navarino-Road, Dalston"—he also showed me several letters to himself—I cannot say who they were from, and a mortgage debenture on some property valued at £1,000, which he said the London County Council were en<lb/>gaging to purchase—he said it was a mortgage debenture—he said the address on the card was his and that he had works there—he said he would be responsible for the cheque and he endorsed it on the counter I believed his statements and handed him the ring, the bracelet and £8 to. 6d.—the cheque was banked on the 20th—it was returned about the 21st, and I at once sent a messenger to Navarino Road, but he could get no answer from anybody. I wrote to Milne the same night and five days later I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was surprised that Smith had not met the cheque and asking him to put it through again</hi>,—in consequence the cheque was again put through the bank—when I first received it I did not particularly notice the date—I am under the impression that it was dated the 18th—I put it through the bank again, I think, on December 29th, and it was again returned—I wrote again to Milne and on January 14th received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had been doing his best to get the money from Smith, so that he could take up the cheque he had given, but had been unsuccessful; that he had exe<lb/>cuted a mortgage on some property and was quite certain the County Council would take it tithing a month, so that he would then be in a better position as regarded funds; that he proposed giring Mr. Perry a promissory note payable in two months, and he to return the cheque, that he (Milner) could then place it in his solicitor's hands and instruct him to proceed against Smith</hi>)—I agreed to accept a promissory note for one month and I re<lb/>ceived this promissory note, dated January 18th, promising to pay Mr. Perry or his order in one month in consideration of Mr. Perry returning the cheque—I returned the cheque and the promissory note passed into the hands of the police—we have not received our goods or money back.</p>

Smith on the Economic Bank, dated December 28th, but it looks like the 20th—I said, "Is not this more like an 8 than a 0?"—he said, "No, it is merely a slip of the pen"—it looks like an 8 to me, but I took it for a cheque drawn on the 20th—going to the mill we had a fairly long ride by train, and on the was he said he had some property in Barking which the County Council would probably want very shortly, and he would get a big profit on it—I believed what he said about the cheque and gave him. £2—we came back late from the mill, and the money in the office was banked—he said he could do with very little money, and I gave him the £2 out of my own pocket, and sent the 19s. 6d. balance up with the goods to Wells Street, Haekney—I paid the cheque in, and it was returned, marked "Postdated"—I thought the bank had read it for the 28th, and I paid it in on the 27th to be presented on the 28th—it was returned again marked "Refer to drawer"—I wrote to Milne and I received a letter, but before that I handed it over to the company's solicitors—I did not see Milne again—the letter was dated January 14th (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had been unable to fit the money from Smith, or he would have brought it; that he had just executed a mortgage on some property, and was quite certain the London County Council would want it in a month or two, and that he would then be in a better position as regarded funds; that he proposed giving a promissory note payable in two months, and Mr. Schwartz to return the cheque so that he could instruct his solicitors to proceed against Smith</hi>)—the matter had been put into the hands of the Timber Trades Protection Society—a summons was issued, and the ordinary proceedings in the County Court taken—in the first place Milne gave notice of defence, and I had to turn up, but when I got to the County Court there was no defence—our solicitors put in an execution, but of course they got nothing.</p>

Charles Smith's account from November 1st, 1904, to January 31st, 1905—the amount which passed through the account was £30; it was opened with a payment in of £10, which was the largest sum ever paid in—there is a cheque-book debited on November let, 2s.—there was £5 paid in on November 22nd, and postal orders on the 23rd for £2—at the end of November £24 had been paid in and £16 7s. 3d. taken out—on January 2nd £1 7s. 6d. is paid in and by January 31st there is a balance of Is., which was returned to him—I frequently saw Smith at the bank—this 5s. is commission for keeping the account—we received cheques when there was no money in the bank to meet—I have here a list which I have made of the cheques pre<lb/>sented and dishonoured—on December 10th, 1904, a cheque for £1 10s. was dishonoured; on December 12th cheques for £2 and £12; on De<lb/>cember 13th, £5; on December 19th, £2 5s.; on December 21st, £1210s.; and on December 22nd, £9 7s. 6d.—the cheque given to the Great Eastern Timber Co. was presented before it was due, it is dated December 28th, but it might be 20th or 28th—the cheque is in Smith's writing, or at any rate the signature is—there is also a cheque dishonoured, dated December 23rd, for £17 12s. 6d.—it is signed by Smith—that was post-dated also on December 29th there was one for £12 10s. which was dishonoured on December 29th for £10 10s.; on the 30th, one for £8 15s.; on January 7th one for £7 4s. 9d.—that is undoubtedly drawn by Smith—we should honour it if there was money to meet it—on January 9th there was one dishonoured for £10 15s.; on January 11th, £8 17s. 6d.; one on the 12th for £10 17s. and one on the 17th for £2 2s.—the account was not in a satisfactory condition, and I requested him to close it I think after the second or third cheque which I sent back—if we cannot see the cus<lb/>tomer we send a printed notice requesting that the account should be closed—I sent Smith a notice like this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) on two occasions, if not more, but it wan not necessary, because I told him personally we should close his account if he kept on this sort of thing.</p>

I did it in sell-defence"—I went afterwards to 19, Woolmore Road, where I found about ten yards from the right of the gate in the road this broken razor, which was then quite wet with blood—two other portions were picked up and handed to me by detective sergeants, who made a search—they almost made the razor complete—I went there at about 11.45 p.m. the same night, and it looked as if a severe struggle had taken place in the garden and in the roadway; there was blood on the wall and all down the fore-court.</p>

I am fourteen and a half years old, and live at 3, Westbourne Terrace, which is part of Woolmore Road—about 7.45 p.m. on February 2nd I was playing outside either 18, 19, or 20, Woolmore Road, with my friend, Annie Holmes, when I heard someone say, "I want my children"—I turned round, and saw the prisoner go up to No. 19, and look through the window—he then knocked at the door, but nobody opened it—I did not hear any voice from inside—Hill came along and said to the prisoner, "What do you want here?"—he said, "I want my children"—Hill said, "What do you want them for?"and the prisoner said, "I only want to see them for a minute"—Hill pushed the prisoner in the road—that was the beginning of the row, and the first violence I saw—the prisoner said, "I will not have that for nothing, "and rushed at Hill, who threw him to the ground—Hill then knelt on him for about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner shouted, "Oh, let me get up, for God's sake"—Hill <hi rend="italic">holload</hi> out, "Nellie, run and fetch a policeman; I have got him now," and the girl said, "All right, Bill"—I had not seen her before that night—she went to fetch a policeman—the prisoner got on to his feet, and they started fighting again—I then saw a boy whom I know as "George" coming along with Hill's barrow, and Mrs. Bramble came out and helped him to push it into the stables at the side of the house—the boy, who is Hill's regular boy handed a piece of iron like a fish hook to Hill, and said, "Here you are Bill, here is something for you"—the iron war straight like that one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—when the boy turned round to give Hill this fish hook he and the prisoner were covered with blood about the face—Hill rushed at the prisoner, and struck him with the iron—the prisoner fell down in the road, they both went to the ground, and there was a good struggle—George <hi rend="italic">holload</hi>, "Go it, Bill." and then they both got up, and Hill went indoors, while the prisoner went on to the opposite side—he said to me, "Have you got a rag?"—I said, "Yes, you can have my handkerchief, but will you give it me back?"—I gave him my handkerchief, and ran to fetch a pinafore, which I gave him, and he put it round his head—he then said, "I haven't got <hi rend="italic">no</hi> money, and I want to go to Stratford to-night"—he said that because all his money had fallen on the ground, and I helped him to pick it up—two policemen then came up and took the prisoner and Hill to the station—the prisoner, whose head was bandaged up, and whose face was bleeding, said, 'How far is it?"—the policeman said, "Not far, old man"—he seemed as if he would fall down and faint—he was sober.</p>

Edmund Nichols sent me some presents for the children, bat I do not think he sent some money to roe to enable me to get home as the company had come to a standstill, which often happens in the drama<lb/>tic profession—he treated me well in every way—I know the prisoner had a tin hat box into which he was in the habit of putting letters, which went to Ashford to my mother's place, and from there we removed it to Twickenham; when we went on tour it was taken to my mother's at 30, London Road, Twickenham, with our furniture—my mother did not live long there and the goods were sold by Mr. Forge, who destroyed all the letters in that box—I never went to Brynmawr on tour; that is before the prisoner gave up the medical for the dramatic profession—Brynmawr is in Brecanshire, and Rhayader is in Radnorshire—Beconshire</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Sandon &amp; Co., tailors, of 8, Saville Row, and we have a branch business at Paris, of which the prisoner has been the manager since 1898 under this agree<lb/>ment (<hi rend="italic">Ex. F.</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">Paragraph 3 stated that the prisoner on receiving orders was to remit full particulars to the London establishment. Paragraph</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">that the prisoner should keep proper books of accounts and make correct entries of all sums received by him, and of all petty expenses and outgoings, and also of all goods received, sold and delivered, and all orders and other transactions, however small; that on the Monday of every week he was to transmit to Sandon &amp; Co. a full, dear and correct statement in writing, of all monies, goods, orders and transactions which shall have been received, told or delivered, or have taken place during the preceding week, distinguishing sales of cash and sales of credit. That all monies received by the prisoner should be remitted to London Paragraph 7, tights he was to have a clear yearly salary of £100 and a commission of £5 per cent, on all orders of full price taken by him. Paragraph 8, that Sandon &amp; Co. were to pay the rent and the other expenses, and that the prisoner was not to incur any expenses without the authority in writing of the firm</hi>)—at first all monies were to be remitted by him, but I cannot say that all monies were actually remitted—as far as I know, all monies were accounted for by him to me—in the early part of the time money that might have been used for business purposes was accounted for, but not remitted; he regretted the balance—subsequently that course of business was altered and we opened an account in Paris with the Credit Leona's, and it was the prisoner's duty to pay all monies received by him on our account into that tank absolutely without deduction—we supplied him with a weekly sum for whatever he spent during the week, so that at any time after the receipt of that cheque he had 300 francs in hand—the books of the paris branch were kept in London, and this is the book in which the entries were made relating to the Paris business called' Paris Cash Account (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) which I kept personally—it contains the entries of all cash received in Paris excepting tome possible oases where cheques were sent to me—in London—it would not be correct to say that this contains an account of all the cheques received in Paris—the cash paid out in Paris is accounted for in this book on the other side—the prisoner made payments out in Paris in the ordinary course of business except, perhaps, when we made payments for customs charges, which were pretty considerable; that cheque would be sent by me direct to the customs agent—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060144"/>
               <p>prisoner's duty was to send me immediately on receipt of money a slip notifying that he had received it—these are the slips for 1904 (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—there is nothing at all on the slip as to what has happened to the money; the only thing he had to do with them was to pay them into the bank, and I should know that—provided there were payments daily, they would be sent to me daily—except for these I had no other means of knowing what monies the prisoner received in Paris—he never accounted for the receipt of £146 15s. 6d. from Baron Robert de Rothschild, nor for any account of £160 0s. 7d. from M. Jean Stern, or for £35 11s. from H. A. Vanbergen, and I did not at any time in 1904 make entries of those payments in the Paris Cash Account as he had not informed me that they had been paid—he knew that this Paris Cash Account was kept by me in London and that I made entries in it, so far as the receipts of cash were concerned, from his slips, because occasionally one might be missing, as I should find out from the passbook, and I should write, and he would send me the slip to account for that one—when he came to London he did not go through the Paris Cash Account with me personally, but went through this ledger (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) to vouch for the validity of the balances in it—the items made in the ledger are in part from the Paris Cash Account—the last time he went through it with me personally was on April 5th, 1904—there are some entries in marginal notes in the handwriting of Harry Honeyball—in December there was some correspondence between him and myself about my going to Paris for the purpose of going through the accounts with him, and the final letter was that I would postpone going until February, at his suggestion—I had not seen him personally in September for a sufficiently long time to go through his accounts; he was on his holidays and I saw him just as he was passing through London, and when he had returned from his holidays I had not returned to Town and I missed the opportunity of going through the ledger that I should have had—he wrote and said that on further consideration, if I were not coming over immediately, he would himself come to London, and I wired that I would not come until February—the next communication I had from him was this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) delivered to me on January 14th by a messenger from the Langham Hotel, where he was staying, asking me to go and see him there—I sent a verbal message to say that if he wished to see me he could do so in Saville Row before 11 o'clock, as I had an appointment—he came about 10.30 a.m., and after the usual salutations I motioned him into one of the private rooms and asked him what was the meaning of this and he said, "I have made an ass of myself"—I asked him what he had done and he told me after some rather rambling remarks that he had received 18,000 francs, for which he had not accounted, and he gave me a list (<hi rend="italic">Ex. A.</hi>) of the names of customers who had paid their accounts of which I had not been informed—in English money those accounts amount to £745 5s. 6d., and there are two of them which have the names and amounts transposed—I said that I might not have been surprised to hear that he had made an ass of himself, but it was a very different thing for him to come and confess</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060145"/>
               <p>to me that he was a thief, and that this was a matter with which I, per<lb/>sonally, could not deal, and that I should have to send for the police—before doing that I sent for my partner and told him whit the prisoner hid said, and we sent for the police—Sergeant Tapper and then Inspector Drew came—I stated the facts as far as I knew them to Inspector Drew and left the matter to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After the prisoner had paid the monies he had received into the bank, and informed me that he had done so, his imme<lb/>diate duty was then at an end—he had other duties connected with cash; to account to me for the expenses which we stood at in Paris—there are slips here for February 12th and 13th, 1904, and the com<lb/>plaint is that upon February 12th he did not make the entry of the £145 15s. 6d., Baron de Rothschild's account—I received that slip through the post in London on the following morning—I subse<lb/>quently compare the entries derived from those slips with the pass-book, and if there were any discrepancies I would have to call upon him to explain them; it would not be correct to say that his duties were completed when those slips were sent, because I have to refer to him to check them with the passbook—he was a very successful agent in a business capacity; when he took up the agency the gross receipts were about £2,000 per annum, and in the five or six years that he worked for us he raised the turnover to something like £7,000 per annum—with the exception, of course, of the suspicion I had: on receiving the letter stating that if I did not come over he would come to London immediately; on his arrival in London there was no suspicion of anything being wrong, he came voluntarily from France into the jurisdiction here—he explained that he had lent the money to a friend and showed me an I.O.U. for 18,000 francs; no mention was made of bills; I understood that he had had no benefit himself—I did not understand that his object in coming to me was to make some proposition with a view to replacing the money—while I was waiting for Inspector Drew to come he said, "I did not think you would have done this"—I said, "Well, what would you have sup<lb/>posed me to have done?"—he supposed that I would have given him some time in which to repay it, but I did not entertain that for a minute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I find that there is a slip here for March 25th, the next March 30th, and the next April 7th—I find also a slip for December 15th—he also sent me with the slip a covering letter, and the same remark about the slips coming daily would apply to the letters—we have got any amount that we have received from him—I have looked through all the letters, and I can find no statement with regard to these particular sums—his letters generally began, "Enclosed payments." which referred to the slips—he would send a summary of the orders he received during every week—in the course of business if any cheque required endorsement it was sent to London—the ledger shows the exact state of the customers, accounts, and he has been through this ledger with me, but I cannot give you any definite date—he has seen the Paris Cash Account open in my presence.</p>

Jean Stern of £160 0s. 7d.—I made notes of what he called my attention to, and there is no note of them—that was the last time I saw him.</p>

I am very sorry indeed, but, whatever the result of this case is, I shall in due course pay back every penny I have had"—I then showed him the list I had received from Mr. Moore of monies alleged to have been embezzled, and he said, "That is a list of the monies I have received; I wrote it myself before I came here. I have lent the money to a gentleman in Paris for stockbroking purposes to pay his debts. He told me he had to pay 10,000 francs.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert William Catchpole, of 130, Ashville Road—the prisoner is my sister; she is single, and up to the end of last November she had been in the service of Mrs. Bains in Stratford Street, Blackfriars—she came to live at my house about No<lb/>vember 25th, and remained with me till January 14th—she had a little room at the back of Mrs. Nix's on the first floor—I and my husband occu<lb/>pied the room downstairs—on January 13th I had a baby which was about a fortnight old—I noticed that the prisoner was getting stout—I said, "Clara, you look rather stout"—she made no answer—between I and 2 a.m. on January 14th she came to my room and said, "Have you got such a thing as a little drop of gin, Louie?"—I said, "No, Clara, I have not. I have got a little drop of warm tea in the pot"—she said she felt bad, as if she was going to die—she went straight out of my room; I could not hear where she went—about five minutes afterwards she came back for some matches; she came back and returned the matches and I noticed that her right hand was covered with blood—between her borrowing the matches and her returning them I heard a baby cry—it seemed as if it was against the kitchen door on the ground floor; there is a little passage form my room to the kitchen—I had my baby with me; she did not cry—the cry I heard was one long cry—I also heard the back door, which leads into the yard, shut—I think that is the only other sound I heard—when the prisoner returned with the matches, I said, "I heard a baby cry"—she said, "You did not, Louie; it was the cat I sat on that you heard cry"—when I heard the cry I roused my husband, who was with me in my room—I got up and put on my skirt and coat and stockings, and went out—I took my lamp with me—I saw some blood on the passage floor and against the foot of my bed—I called out to the prisoner, who was going upstairs, "Clara, come down to wipe up this mess. Whatever have you done?"—it struck me that she had had a baby—she came down and said, "There is nothing more unusual, Louie"—the blood was in clots—and she picked them up and put them on her apron, which was in her left hand—the kitchen floor was all wet and had been wiped up as if it had been washed—in the scullery beyond the kitchen there is a sink, and in it there was a brown bowl, yellow inside with pale bloody water in it and an ordinary dinner-fork with curls down it; it was not a carving-fork—after a little while my husband came down and took the prisoner to her</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Nix, of 120, Ashville Road, Leytonstone—I knew the prisoner before last November and that she was Mrs. Catchpole's sister—in November she came to lodge at my house and used the little back room which opened out of mine, which is on the first floor—I noticed in November that she was a little bit stout—I think it was one night about a week or two before this day, when she was undressing in my bedroom—I cannot say how long after she first came to my house—I told her I thought she was rather stout, more so than she ought to be for a young woman—she said, "There is nothing the matter with me"—previously I had asked her if she had ever gone wrong and she said, "No, Mrs. Nix"—I don't think I spoke to her on any other occasion about her stoutness—I remember her being indoors during the day of January 13th—about one o'clock she complained that she had come on unwell and asked me if I had any cloves to give her to eat—she had some and I believe she put them in hot water and then drank it—this took place in the kitchen—she was mostly on the couch in the kitchen—I advised her to go upstairs and rest herself as she complained of her legs being bad—she said, "I would rather sit here, Mrs. Nix, if I am not in your way, because it is rather cold upstairs"—she remained in the kitchen till 8 or 9 p.m.—between 9 and 9.30 a young man came to see her and stayed in the kitchen till nearly 10.30—after he left I and the rest of us went to bed—Mr. Nix went up first and then I and the prisoner followed about 10.45—she went up to my room and then to her own—she did not then say that she felt unwell—Mr. Nix slept in the front room with a little boy—I was in the other room with a little girl and the prisoner in the back—she had to go through my room to get to her own—about 1 a.m. I heard her in her room complaining about being ill—she said, "I feel so bad, I feel so ill, I feel as if I was dying"—I was lying in bed and asked her if she was in pain, as if so I would get her a cup of tea—she said she was not—she then complained of being in pain and I again asked her if I should get her a cup of tea—she said, "No, Mrs. Nix; you</p>

               <p>lie there, I shall be better presently"—a little while after she said she must go downstairs—she came to my room—I advised her not to go down, as I could hear fog signals going and it seemed a bad morning—the railway goes at the back of our house—she went back to her room—a little while afterwards she wanted to go downstairs and she went—she did not take <hi rend="italic">no</hi> light with her—I had a small lamp in my room—it sounded it if she went out at the back—I am almost sure I heard the back door shut as she was coming back again—the next I heard was when she came ape airs and went into her own room—I do not remember speaking to her as she came through—a little while after she came into my room and asked for my lamp because she felt so nervous and so ill and bad, because her stepmother had boxed her ears on the Wednesday night and she felt unwell—she took the lamp of! the mantelpiece and went back to her room again—as she was so nervous I asked if I should go and lie beside her—she said, "No, Mrs. Nix, I shall be better presently"—she when downstairs again, saying she was going to ask her sister if she had a drop of gin—I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> her pass and I heard voices—I heard no other sounds then—she came up to my room again and lay on the foot of my bed for a minute or two—she then said, "I cannot stop here," and went downstairs—I could not hear what part of the house she went to—I heard a lamp glass shake as she lit a lamp and then I heard the cry of a baby—there was only one cry—at first I thought it was her liter's baby—it was rather a strong cry—as far as I knew, Mrs. Catchpole's baby was the only one in the house—I cannot say from what part of the house the cry came—I then heard Mrs. Catch pole call up the stain to the prisoner to come down—before that I heard splashing of water like water running, and the backyard door open and shut—Mrs. Catchpole called out, "Come down, Clara, and clear up this mess"—the prisoner was then in my room but I did not see her come in—she did not answer Mrs. Catchpole—I said to the prisoner," By what I can hear your sister saying you have had a miscarriage; have you or have you not?"—she said she was surprised at me and her sister accusing her of having such a thing, as she was only more unwell than usual—she went downstairs when her sister called—I got up and went down—I did not see any blood marks in my room, but towards the bottom of the stairs I did—the prisoner was stand<lb/>ing at the foot of the stairs, holding a white apron covered in blood—I said to her, "There must be something wrong"—she said, "There is nothing wrong"—I referred to the blood on her apron—I went into the kitchen with her sister's lamp and saw that the oilcloth had been washed over—I asked what the mess was—the prisoner said she had been sick and had cleared it up—I said, "I thought I heard the cry of a baby"—she said, "No, Mrs. Nix, it was the cat you heard cry; I sat on it"—the cat was then on the couch—I went into the scullery and saw splashes of Wood on the wall, on the wood work, and in the passage from the kitchen to the scullery—in the sink I saw a basin lined with yellow, and pale Wood and water in it and also this fork (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); it is an ordinary dinner fork; it had not been there before—I said to the prisoner, "You have had a child and done away with it, and killed it with a fork"—I thought she</p>

               <p>had killed it—I said. "Where have you put it?"—she said, "I have not had a child"—I told Mrs. Catchpole to go and fetch her husband—she went towards the front parlour to fetch him—I remained in the kitchen with Clara—she got hold of my hands and said, "Pray forgive me, Mrs. Nix, I have had a child"—I said, "You wicked girl, where have you put it?"—she said, "I have put it in the rabbit hutch next to the closet"—she then went into the passage towards the kitchen—by that time Mrs. Catchpole had come back from her room—my husband had got up and was standing at the top of the stairs—I said, so that the prisoner could hear, "For God's sake, Will, come down quick; this girl has had a child and done away with it"—I do not remember if he came down directly—I told the prisoner she must go upstairs and I asked Mr. Catchpole to take her up and I followed behind with the lamp—as I was going towards my husband's bedroom she said, "Mrs. Nix, I want you. I have not put the baby in the rabbit hutch, I have put it down the water closet"—shortly afterwards the police and the doctor came—I did not have any further conversation with the prisoner before they arrived.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner may have said, "I have put it in the water closet"; I cannot say for certain—it is a small V-shaped pan—the prisoner slept in the room adjoining mine all the seven weeks that she was at the house—all that time she would have to go by my room and by my bed to get to her own room—it was the rule for her to go about in the day in a scarlet petticoat, combinations and a grey ulster—I have seen her undress—sometimes she would not take her petticoat and com<lb/>binations off until she got into her own room—the cat was mine—it some<lb/>times slept on the couch—the prisoner complained of her right leg hurting her—I have eight children—I do not know if it is usual when a woman is carrying a child that it is the left leg which generally gives pain—the prisoner complained of costiveness on the Friday night—when she said she was going to the lavatory I understood she was going to relieve herself—I had no idea then that she was going to be confined—that night she had on her scarlet petticoat, her combinations and a red blouse—she had not got her Ulster on except when I saw her with the lamp—women sometimes are unwell right up to the birth of the child—I was with my first child, and the doctor said it was extreme weakness—I cannot swear that I was like that right up to the time, but I had to go to the doctor's.</p>

I have not done murder"—I said, "The dead body of a child has been found in the pan of a water closet downstairs, which I have reason to believe is yours. I should advise you to be careful what you say, for whatever is said may probably be used later in evidence against you"—she afterwards said, I gave birth to my child in the kitchen and took it to the lavatory. I laid it on the seat while I cleaned up the mess; it must have fallen in. I had not been to the back for two or three days, and in straining to go the child came. I have seen things a little every month and did not know I was like that. I was assaulted by a man in a train between Broad stairs and Chatham in June. I do not know who he is"—Dr. McGregor arrived and the prisoner was taken to the infirmary and the body of the child removed to the mortuary—I examined the</p>

Ashfield Road—I saw the prisoner therein bed—I examined her and found she had quite recently been confined and that some blood was still coming from her—I removed the afterbirth and she was subsequently sent to the infirmary in an ambulance—I examined the body of the child—it was a newly born female child and had been dead about an hour—it was still slightly warm—it is very difficult to give an exact opinion as to the time—it was a fully-developed and a full-time child—two inches of the umbilical cord were still attached to it—it had not been tied—I am not able to say precisely how it had been severed, but I believe by some very blunt instrument or possibly it may have been torn—the other portion of the cord was from 14 to 16 inches, but I did not measure it—that would be about the normal length—the child's body had been partially washed; on the back of its right shoulder there were some small scratches as if the body had been pulled over a rough floor—I described them as scraped scratches and dirty-looking—there was dirt in them—across its chest there was a superficial scratch about three inches long and rather deeper than the back scratch—it was red, and blood had been washed away—in my opinion some sharp instrument caused it—it may have been the fork which I saw in the basin—it was something bigger than an or<lb/>dinary pin—there was a little rubbing of the skin on the right knee—above the left eye there was a large bruise which extended downwards towards the left ear, and there was, in addition, a large bruise extending from over the left temple to the ear and cheek, where there was a small abrasion—it occupied the whole side of the child's head—the abrasion over the left eyebrow was about 1 1/2 inches long by 3/4 inch wide—there was blood-stained or watery blood serum which had come from both of those abrasions—the bones beneath the area of bruising were broken and felt quite pulpy—on January 17th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that the weight and size of the body were that of an ordi<lb/>nary child—the internal organs were healthy and the stomach empty—under the scalp on the left side there was a large clot of blood and more extensive than the area of bruising—the frontal bone was broken into five pieces—one piece was quite detached and brain matter was oozing out through the orifice—the left parietal bone and the temporal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060153"/>
               <p>bones were broken in two places—the injury which caused those frac<lb/>tures was the cause of death—the child died of shock caused by injury to the brain and by haemorrhage as a result of those injuries—I believe the fractures could all have been done at once with one blow—the only opinion I could form as to how the injuries had been caused was that it had been caused by direct violence with a blunt instrument—a severe blow with the blunt side of this chopper could have caused them—the abrasion above the left eyebrow had a similar shape to the head of the chopper—the bones of the head of a newly-born child would be very gelatinous—I examined the child's lungs—they were healthy and con<lb/>tained air—I put both lungs with their attachments in water at a tem<lb/>perature of 60 degrees and I found they floated—I cut them in small pieces and pressed them with my thumb against the table as hard as I could—I put them into the basin and they floated—that satisfied me that they contained air, and they appeared to me to have been fully inflated—in my opinion the child had lived and had had a separate exis<lb/>tence and circulation—its heart had acted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot tell if the child lived for half a minute—I did not compare the wounds of the head with anything in the house—ell I can say is that they might have been caused by something like this hatchet—the injuries would not be accounted for by the child falling, on the floor if it had been a delivery in a standing position—the locality of the wound on the head was consistent with that theory—I said before the Magistrate that any blunt instrument would have caused the wounds on the head and I cannot think of any blunt instrument which would not have caused them—the bones of a child just born are not at all strong and they are very thin, but they are very gelatinous—a young child's head will stand a good deal—I think the edge of a table or something, like that would cause the wounds on the head, but the violence would, be great—if the prisoner in the dark was dragging the child by the arm or leg and its head struck such an object as the corner of a table with great violence, the injuries I found might have been caused thereby—some of the scratches on the child's body were as if it had been dragged—I do not suggest that the fork had anything to do with the child's-death—I do not think that the blood on the hatchet came from the abrasion on the left of the child's head—where women have never had a child before there is a possibility in cases of this nature, and especially in illegitimate pregnancy, that an occurrence of transitory mania may be followed by loss of memory of events at this period—loss of memory may follow any confinement—I would not say as to illegitimate pregnancy—I should say especially to first labours, whether they were illegitimate or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The scratches on the shoulder were not severe—the most likely explanation of their being caused is that the body was dragged on the floor—I cannot say if it was a lengthened dragging—I cannot say if the suggestion that the injury to the left side of the head was caused by the child being dragged by the leg or arm, and being banged against the table or anything else, or if the scratches fit in with that suggestion—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190503060154"/>
               <p>I am quite sure that the child being born from a standing woman and falling would not cause the injuries I found—I went into the kitchen on this night, and have in my mind the position of the couch—taking a course from the couch to the door in the scullery, I think the table would be in the way—I noticed spots of blood on the leg of the table just where the floor had been washed up, and on the couch side—I can hardly conceive the table leg causing the injury—I think it was a square leg—if the table was upside down, and the leg sticking up in the air it might have caused the injury—the abrasion had two right angles with about 18 inches be<lb/>tween them—I have not measured the distance between the right angles on the two edges of the chopper, but I should say it is about 1 1/2 inches—leaving the upturned table out of it, I do not think there is anything between the couch and the door which could inflict the injuries—the table was on its legs when I saw it—a person suffering from transitory mania shows symptoms at the time—I should expect to find them wild and excited, eyes staring, and manner altogether strange for the time being—a person in that condition is not able to think or to know what he or she may be doing—I do not think that the concealment of the body of a child recently born would be the act of a person suffering from tran<lb/>sitory mania—it generally comes on after the last pain and before the child is born—it is the pain acting on the nerves of a woman; that is why it is called transitory—it does not last long—it is not dignified by the phrase of mania except in extreme cases, where a person did some damage to herself or her child—puerperal mania comes on afterwards—when T saw the prisoner she was sobbing—I did not speak to her—I cannot say whether she was suffering from transitory mania or not.</p>

You need not say anything unless you like, but what you do say I shall take down in writing, and it may be given in evidence against you later"—she said, "I thoroughly understand"—she was then taken to the police station, where she was formerly charged—she said, "I am exceedingly sorry. I did not mean to murder the child, but I was so worried I did not know what I was doing."</p>

I am a medical man, of 291, Victoria Dock Road—on January 3rd I remember the prisoner bringing a child between one and two years old to me—I examined it about 3 p.m.—I said to the prisoner, "What is this terrible stench?"—she removed the bonnet, and then I discovered that the head was covered with thick yellow scurf, the hair looking very unhealthy, and smelling very badly—it was caused by vermin—ordinary soap and water at the very commencement might have kept it clean—if it had had proper attention at the beginning, it would not have occurred—the vermin certainly caused the child unnecessary suffering—the prisoner inquired of me if she could get the child into an institution—and I gave her a letter to the London Hospital—she came back soon afterwards with the child, which was then dead—the following afternoon I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the body was slightly', but not excessively, emaciated—there was some vermin on the upper part of the chest, and at the back of the shoulders there were about a dozen small sores and abrasions, the largest of them being about the size of a 3d. piece, undoubtedly due to the irritation caused by the vermin—the head was found to be full of vermin—I think death was due to bronchial pneumonia, accelerated by neglect—the stomach and the intestines were absolutely empty—there was no evidence to show that the child had been fed at all—carrying it about by day and night would be injurious.</p>

The pipe and watch and chain I never saw till I saw them at the station. When the prosecutor came in the station he said, 'Where is the officer who has got my pipe?' I have no witnesses here."</p>

Will you write to them and rest their minds? You know there is a great change in Reggie; he seems unnerved, his hands won't keep still at school. D. F., this lady wanted me to come and fetch you to-night, no matter what it cost or expense. She said, 'Go at once by tram cab, 'bus, or anything,' but I told her it was beyond my power.

They break their hearts if anything said; they are all ill and they are awake. It is now 2 o'clock, Monday morning"—on the Monday night Frederick and Frank were very queer.

If you do anything like that they would be both left parentless at once"—he said "I do not care; she has not cared. If she would have only come back to the children!"—about 1 o'clock I received a message and went in—I found Mrs. Thompson in the kitchen with the prisoner and Rose—I said to Mrs. Thompson, "I am so glad to see you back"—she said, "I am not going to stay"—I said, "Are not you?"—the prisoner said, "Why are not you going to stay?"—she said, "You know why; because you have been <hi rend="italic">messing</hi> about with other women"—he said "I have not, and if I have, what about yourself"—she said, "Nothing of the kind"—he said, "If you are not going to stay, my life is ended"—he rushed out of the kitchen and I rushed into the garden—that is all I heard or saw—I got round into my own house, went out into the front and saw the prisoner pass my gate.</p>

I went up the common on the 18 of February and only earn Is. 6d. all day and at 7 o'clock his the evening I was just going up Wimbledon when the prisoner knocked for me and ask me if I would come up Wandsworth with him. I said 'I don't mind where I go,' so we went and when I got has far has the porn shop with him he showed me a watch and ask me to porn it for him. I said, 'How much shall I get on it? He said, 'Try and get 12s. on it.' I said, 'Let me have a look at it first before I take it him,' and he showed me inside and out of the watch and it was the right time by it when I took it him. I stopped his the shop for about ten minutes before the pawnbroker ask what he could do for me. I said,' Let me have 12s. on this, and then he look at it and took it in the front shop and came back again and said he could not give me 12s. on it has it his a old fashon watch. I said,' All right,' and he gave it to me back and then I walked out and meet the prisoner opposite Looking in the Boot Shop window and I told him they would not give me any-think on it and I gave it to him back</p>

               <p>and he said, 'Come on,' and has we was walking down the road about 100 yards from the porn shop we got stopped by a young gentleman and he ask me to come to the station and I went and he told a pleaceman to bring the other Chap and when we got to the station searched us both and found nothink on us. Then he told the sargent he would charge us with walking about him a suppisus manner and for standing outside of the porn shop examining the Stock for the purpose of committing a bug<lb/>larie and then he said he would go back to the porn shop and see about it, but I never see him come back to the station no more that night, and after we had been setting down for about two hours we was searched again by a nuttier gentleman and he found on the other prisoner some watches and rings and then they put us his a Cell Next to one another and I said, 'Ginger, where did you get them from?' He said, 'I found them.' I said, 'Where?' He said, 'On Wimbledon Common.' I said, 'When?' He said, "On Thursday when I was up there goffing.' I said, "That all right.' He said, 'I am going to ring the bell,' and then I laved down and went to sleep for about two hours and then I heard a cell door bang and somebody call out, 'Charley.' I said, 'Hallow.' He said, 'I have had a blow out.' I said 'What of.' He said, 'Bread and Cheese and Beer.' I said, 'I have been to sleep and had Nothink.' He said, 'Charlie, they have took my feet and finger Marks.' I said, 'That to see if you have done anythink.' He said, 'I no that,' and then we both went to sleep for a Little wile and then we was fetched out again his front of a lot of pleaceman to see if they New us, and then we went back to hour Cell again and about a hour after we had a wash, and after that we had a cup of coffee and two little slices of bread and butter to last us all day up till 6 o'clock and then we got the same again; and then on Monday morning we came to Wimbledon pleace station and they tried us for Buglarie and I don't no no more than a dead Man about it so I hope, please God, you will do your Best for me, just for my poor old Mother's sake.

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Strathholme Street, Streatham, and am manageress of the Kent County Laundry, Limited, at Peckham—on February 17th I was on duty till 9.15 p.m. and returned on Saturday about 7.45 or 7.50 a.m.—I found that the door, which had been bolted from the inside, had been opened—I examined it and found a pane of glass had been cut out, also a front frame from the laundry door and a cash box was missing, which contained 3s. 10d. and 1s. 10d. in coppers in a little paper bag—I wrote to Detective Hay, asking him to come and see me.</p>

About 11.30 a.m. on January 22nd I was on duty in New Kent Road in plain clothes when I saw the prosecutor—I saw three men drag him from the footway down a side passage and as I came level with the passage I saw one man holding him from behind, and the other two on each side—one of them had his hand on his throat, and each of them had a hand in his pockets—I caught hold of one of the men, and dragged him away on to the footpath—I struggled for a few seconds with him when he <hi rend="italic">back-heeled</hi> me—he said, "Let me go, guv'nor; I have done nothing"—I said, "You will come with me; I am a police officer"—the other two men then closed on me, and I was thrown to the ground—I retained my hold on my man all the time, and managed to get on my feet again, when he kicked me on the right leg and right ankle, and the two of us fell to the ground the second time—while on the ground I was kicked twice on the left side of my face by the two other men, who were standing up—that dazed me and they pulled me away, and all three escaped—in this passage-there is a fair light from incandescent gas lamps, of which we were in the centre of about three or four; they were twenty yards away I should say—I took the prosecutor to the station—he had un<lb/>doubtedly been drinking, but I was somewhat misled as to his condition by his being a cripple—particulars wore obtained from him, and he was allowed to go—the prisoner is the man I had got hold of, and the next time I saw him was about 2 a.m. on February 11th, when he was standing in a row with eight or nine other men at the police station—I picked him out without hesitation—I spoke to three or four in order to hear their voices—I asked the prisoner how long it would take me to walk to London Bridge, and he made some sort of reply; it was merely to enable me to hear his voice, and I recognised it decidedly—I asked to look at his hands, because when I was on the ground for the second time and being kicked I shouted for help, and the prisoner put his hand over my mouth—to prevent myself being suffocated I bit one of his fingers which had got into my mouth, and I looked to see if there were any marks—there was a mark, but it was of more recent date, and would not be the one caused by my teeth.</p>

Watson, and Reed, men who were not friends of his, but whom he knew by sight, that the policeman only after hesitating some time identified him, and that when his mother said, "I have had enough trouble with you," she was speaking to the policemen and referring to their coming in the middle of the night.</hi>
