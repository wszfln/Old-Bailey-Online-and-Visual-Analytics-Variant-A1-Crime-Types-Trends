On the 31st of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my bar, the candles had been lit sometime-three men came into the tap-room and called for three quarterns of gin, the prisoner Harding was one of them - I served them; they afterwards called for a glass of gin and water, and while it was making Harding was walking to and fro in the passage by the bar door, the stairs came into the passage, he could see every thing. I went up stairs and tried my own room door, and am positive that I found it locked; I went into another room that was not locked, but could see no person there - I did not fasten that door. I then heard a whistle, and some person called "Rover," and said,"D-n the dog." I came down for a candle, waited in the passage to watch, and saw the prisoner, Hooker, come down stairs; I met him in the passage, and asked him if he had been up, he said he had, as he had made a mistake, and thought it was the Horse and Dolphin; I told him he should not have gone up; three more men then rushed out of the tap-room and knocked me down, they gave me a violent blow on my head-the prisoner, Harding, was one of them; Hooker joined them and I pulled him over me, and tore a piece of his coat off - He got away - I followed him into Great Suffolk-street, where he was stopped. I never lost sight of him. I returned, went up stairs, and found the back room door broken open, which I had locked myself an hour before-it was not the room that I went to before; I had the key in my pocket at the time; there were marks of a chisel on the side of the door-the stairs that I saw Hooper come down leads to that room-it was the nearest to the stairs, there is no other key to the door-it was forced open. I missed nothing. As I returned from the office, about two hours afterwards, I picked up some skeleton keys, with a wrench and a picklock, in a bag; it was in the direction that he had run, and in the very place where he turned round in Great Suffolk-street, which is not a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. It was about a quarter before seven o'clock when they came in, I looked at the clock. I suspected them from seeing them watching about. I did not try the door the first time that I went up, I came down on hearing them call "Rover;" I waited in the passage, and saw Hooker come down stairs; he said he supposed he had made a mistake, for he had come to meet a friend at the Horse and Dolphin. At the Office he said he came to see a friend who lodged there. I laid hold of him, but they rushed out and rescued him; I then followed him into the street, and asked him to come back, he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was you gone to Bow-street - A. About an hour and a half. I followed Hooker very close.</p>
               <p>Q. If he dropped the bag you must have seen him - A. No; when he got to Suffolk-street I did not pursue him so close, as I knew he could not escape. I am positive the room was locked an hour before; I had the key then.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. I was in the tap-room and saw the men come in-my brother left me in the tap-room when he went out; the three men went out, the prisoner, Harding, was one of them. Hooker came down stairs, and my brother called out immediately. I followed close into Great Suffolk-street, and stopped the prisoner, Hooker, at the corner of Little Suffolk-street; he said he would knock any person down that came near him-he struck me twice - I gave him up to the constable. After taking him into the tap-room, while I was holding him, Harding was brought in. He is the same man that was in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a servant out of place. I never saw the prisoners before; they came into the tap-room between six and seven o'clock. Harding was with the other two - He did not sit down, but kept walking about the passage, and looking up stairs.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CLAYTON. I am a boot-closer. On the 31st of October I was coming up Whitcomb-street, and heard the cry of stop thief! Harding was before the mob - I stopped him - He was running in a direction from Jackson's house; I brought him back, with the constable's assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He made no resistance. He asked what was the matter, I told him I did not know. The constable came up and took him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM POWEL. I was in the tap-room, on the 31st of October, when the search was made, a dark-lanthorn was found under a seat with a piece of wax candle in it; I had seen the prisoners sitting in that settle when they were handcuffed - I was not in the house before.</p>

               <p>HOOKER'S Defence. An acquaintance of mine, of the name of Williams, lodged in Whitechapel, but had removed; they directed me to the Horse and Dolphin, the first public-house in Whitcomb-street; I went up and knocked at the first-floor door, but nobody answered-as I came down I met Jackson, he asked me to come back, which I did, and he collared me.</p>
               <p>HARDING'S Defence. Jackson has spoken falsely to say I knocked him down; I was knocked down myself, and ran after the men, when I was taken. I was calling for my dog which I had lost.</p>

On the 25th of November I was in the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030005"/>minding it, the candles were burning in the shop; I saw the prisoner, William West, break a window with his hand, it was whole before. The prisoner, Robert West, came and took a pair of shoes out, I immediately opened the door, ran out and called stop thief! they were taken directly and brought into the shop - I knew the shoes to be my father's. I took William West myself, he was walking, I collared him-Evans came up and secured him. I am sure I saw him break the window, it was a quarter before six o'clock. I went to see the time directly as they were brought back, it wanted ten minutes to six.</p>

               <p>JOHN WALKER, I am a labourer. On the 6th of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners coming down the road, each with a bundle, about a quarter of a mile from the house; I was with another man, but he would not assist me in taking them. As I returned I met Smith again, and took his bundle from him, it was wet - He said he was going to get it mangled; as we were going on with him we met Spyers, without his bundle, and took him; he had a bundle of dry linen when we first met him. We went down to a boat, and found a quantity of other linen.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw the bundle taken from Smith-the water was dropping from it-it was dirty; he said he found it in a hedge in the New Cut - He afterwards said he was going to take it to the mangler's. They denied knowing each other several times, and afterwards said they were going together to see who the things belonged to. I found another bundle of linen in the boat. I had seen the prisoners together about that boat, in company, for several days before.</p>

I never took my eyes off him till I took him - I saw him strike the prosecutor. I uncovered my lanthorn, when the prisoner said, "watchman, what is the matter?" I went up and pretended to raise the prosecutor up; the prisoner was by his side, I seized him while he was asking me what was the matter. I told him he was the man who knocked the prosecutor down; he said, "me!" I said, "yes, I saw you do it." He made no answer. Chibnall came to my assistance, and said he saw him throw something into the water; I saw him take a case of razors out of the kennel, we then took him to the watch-house.

I returned about twenty minutes after ten o'clock at night, put the key in the door, and found it fastened inside. I got in through the next house, and found the back door open - I had left it bolted-the bolts were drawn. I found two drawers by the door, which had been taken from a chest in my bedroom.

               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer of Whitechapel. On Monday evening, the 17th of November, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners standing at the corner of Wentworth-street, Brick-lane - I knew them before. Harmer saw me, and rather retreated; I thought I saw something in his hand, I ran after and secured him; I found the watch-chain, three seals, and a key, in his hand; Freeman was with me, and secured Rowter. While I was searching Harmer, I saw a watch on the place where Rowter had been sitting, immediately as he got up; Freeman searched him, and found two 1l. notes on him.</p>

             came into the shop together, about nine o'clock in the morning; they asked to look at some cheap silk handkerchiefs; I reached a bundle out of the window-

I missed one handkerchief, told Mr. Boswell immediately followed them, and came up with them - I found them talking to Charles Gogerly - They parted. I overtook Charles Gogerly, and saw him take two handkerchiefs from his hat. He tried to throw them down an area-this was before I took him; I picked them up, and secured him; I found our shop-mark on them, and gave him in charge to the officer; they are worth 7s. 6d., the selling price is 10s.; they were two of those I had shown to

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. John Hilton, who lives in Lime-street. The hydrometer was sent to him to pack with other things going to the West Indies-the prisoner was also a warehouseman there. I packed it in a puncheon that was going there; it went to the West India Docks on the 25th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It came to us from Mr. Bates's, in the Poultry. I did not open it before I packed it; it was packed with great care. There were three or four tied up together, and put in the middle of the puncheon.</p>
               <p>Q. For all you know, it was in the same state as when it came - A.Certainly. The prisoner saw me pack it up. It appeared to be in the same state as when I packed them-it could not be taken out after it was put in the puncheon. When the robbery was discovered the puncheon was fetched from the Docks; one of the hoops was disturbed.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS JACOBS. I am a broker, and live in Raven-row, Spitalfields. On the 24th of October the prisoner came to my house, shewed me the hydrometer, and asked 1l. for it, I gave him 18s. for it - I put it out; several persons offered me 14s. and 12s. for it. On the Monday, I sold it to a man who keeps a public-house in Bishopsgate-street, I believe his name is Sterley. I am sure the prisoner is the man who sold it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was between one and three or four o'clock; I never bought one before. I was asked concerning it about eight days after.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not tell the magistrate that it was between three and five o'clock - A. I might. I am no judge of hydrometers. I have dealt with the man whom sold it to once or twice before, not more. I never delivered any goods at his house.</p>
               <p>Q.On your oath, have you not - A. I never was at his house till to-day, nor did not know where it was before. I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIBBS. I keep the Mail-Coach public-house, in Camomile-street. I bought the hydrometer of Jacobs, for 1l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he ever been at your house - A. Yes, he brought some chairs to my house himself, and has drank there. As I passed his house he called me in, and asked if I wanted such a thing? I had only got 19s. 6d. - he said he would call for the other 6d.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH STERNRY. I am shopman to Mr. Bates. The hydrometer is the same I sent to Mr. Hilton's to be packed up on the 15th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I sent four paper parcels, which contained the materials of one hydrometer. Gibbs sent it to me afterwards to ask for an explanation of it. I got information, and went to Jacobs's shop with Gibbs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man till he was brought to our house. I was sent to fetch the puncheon back, and observed the hoops had been moved. If it had been in that state when it went to the Docks they would not have received it. I opened it, and every person said it had been opened at the bottom-every thing was right at the top.</p>

Brown came round on my right side and the other on my left. As I passed between them I felt Thomas's hand in my waistcoat pocket. As soon as I got clear of them, I put my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket-book, which contained a 5l., a 2l., and three 1l. notes. I turned round, and saw 
               <persName id="t18171203-13-person164">Thomas</persName>
             a few yards before me; I ran up to him-he took to his heels as hard as he could, and crossed Broad-street - I called out Stop thief! he was stopped; I came up in half a minute - I never lost sight of him. Several people came round him; one of them gave me my pocket-book; the other prisoner was taken and brought up, and the constable took them both. I am positive he is one of them - I saw them both walking together before they came up to me.</p>

            . I am a bank-porter. I saw the prisoners running, and Mr. Whitmore following them. I saw Thomas drop the pocket-book and run on. When they came to the corner of the street Thomas was stopped. While they were taking him to the Mansion-house, Brown was standing in the street and was secured.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SCOTT. I was in Threadneedle-street about a quarter of an hour before this happened, and saw the prisoners in company together. Brown stepped up to a gentleman, and attempted his pocket, which was rather open-the gentleman turned into a coffee-house. When I returned, I found Thomas in custody, and saw Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030009"/>standing at the corner of Throgmorton-street; I pointed him out, and the officer took him. I am sure he is the boy.</p>

He denied having it, and inquired what woman it was that stood by him while he was looking at them, as if to throw suspicion on her. I told him she could not have it, as she was not looking at them. Mr. James desired the prisoner to give him the property-he still denied it. Mr. James told me to watch him; he dropped it in the back shop while I was engaged.

I felt some person pull the tail of my coat, I put my hand down, missed my handkerchief, turned round, and found the prisoner at my elbow, in great confusion, putting the handkerchief under his waistcoat. I collared him - He said I had mistaken the person. I took him into a shop to search him. As I was going in at the door, he took it out and threw it on the pavement-he begged for mercy.</p>

I said, No. I looked at my window, and found a pane of glass that had been cracked was pulled out, and some purses taken out.

In a short time he got a knife-both his hands were up to his neck, as I thought, to disengage my hand from him. I felt him cutting my fingers with a knife; I screamed out, Murder! and that he had cut me with a knife. Caton said,"He has no knife" - I said I saw it in his hand. I took my hand from his collar, being afraid; he struck me on the nose and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife was it - A. A clasp knife. Caton ran after him. I got surgical assistance at the watchhouse. My fingers bled very much, and my nose bled for two days. I gave information, and they were taken about five nights after.</p>
               <p>MR. JOSEPH BURGESS. I am the workhouse apothecary. Two days after this took place, the prosecutor applied to me; a piece had evidently been cut from the fourth finger of his left hand - I saw him several times. It is in a fair way of doing well.</p>

Next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I found my house broken open and robbed. I examined my premises, and found a covered cart, which was usually placed in the mews (which was at the back of my finishing shop), drawn up immediately under the door; above the door there were marks of the footsteps of one person; the windows of the finishing shop(which is immediately opposite the mews door looking into the back-yard), were open, which led me to suppose they had got over the roof of the finishing shop-the lock of the mews door was forced inside, and the bolts drawn. On a bench in the finishing shop, I found some bags of copper. I think they must have got in by getting over the roof of the finishing shop. By getting on the cart a person may lay hold of the water-pipe, and so get on the roof, then over two roofs, and drop down to a window, which looks into the finishing shop. I found this window open-it had been painted the day before. There were the footsteps of one person coming in; they would then be in the finishing shop. When he got in he must have forced the locks, drawn the bolts, and let the others in. I found three bags and a pile of copper on the bench, which had been left in the store-room the night before-the bags were not mine, the copper was. The store-room, where it was taken from, is part of my dwelling-house; the only way to the finishing shop is through my own yard. The store-room door was locked as usual. There were marks about, which shewed me the way they had gone. They must have dropped from the finishing shop into the yard, and got into the house by the sky-light, which has no fastening. On a sand-heap, under that skylight, there was the impression of two knees of a person who had worn corderoy breeches. Immediately opposite the sand-heap is the door of the time-keeper's room, where some things had been disturbed-the keys of the store-keeper's room bung there; they could be got at, and the doors opened. The lock of the time-keeper's room, which is part of the dwelling-house, had been forced open and shut again. I missed my umbrella and several things of Mr. Cox's, who lodge with me. I apprehended Dunn, and he made some discoveries to me.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK COX, ESQ. I occupy the first-floor in Mr. Phillips's house. I was not at home at the time of the robbery - I came home the next day, and missed all my clothes; five coats, one great coat, three pair of boots, and several silver spoons, a silver mug, a tea-caddy, and several other things.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phillips. I got up at half-past seven o'clock, found the house broken open, and alarmed Mr. Phillips.</p>
               <p>HENRY DUNN. I lived ten weeks with Mr. Phillips. I left him on Saturday evening, and went under the Piazzas in Covent-garden, to Bellshaw's public-house, expecting to meet the prisoners. They were not there. I came out, and waited under the Piazzas a minute or two, and saw them come from New-street. Summers said he had been looking for me, and asked, is all right? I said, I believe it is. He asked if I had any money - I said I had. He said he had been nippered three times, at Chelsea, that day. I went into Bellshaw's, and gave them a pint of beer-it was about half-past seven. We then went to Summers's house, in Charles-street, Drury-lane. They asked me to lend them some money. I went down to the parlour, which is a cook-shop, and got 3s. worth of victuals, and took it to them. We left there about ten o'clock, and returned to Bellshaw's, where we met a man named Shannon; he asked me what screws (which means a skeleton key) would do, and shewed me one; I said I thought it was too small; he said, never mind, he would try it; it was to open the door with. We had been talking about entering the prosecutor's house on the Thursday before; it was about eleven o'clock in the day. I was with Summers at Shannon's, in Vine-street, Chandos-street, and we staid there from half-past nine in the morning till nine at night; and the next day I was with Summers from eleven to one o'clock, in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at Bellshaw's on the Saturday evening? - A. I and Summers went to a person in Vine-street, at an old iron-shop, to get a bag to put the property in; we got six sacks and a dark lanthorn there; the largest sack would hold about a bushel and a half; we hid them in Covent-garden, and went to Bellshaw's again; it was about half-past ten; we staid there drinking till about a quarter after twelve. Shannon said, it is a quarter after twelve, will you go? we all went. Summers and Knight walked together, and I and Shannon; we went to the back part of Mr. Phillips's house, up the mews. Shannon asked me which was the way to get in; I directed him to get up the spout; he climbed up the stable door, but could not get up; we got a cart from the mews, and lifted him up; he got on the roof, and came through and opened the door leading from the finishing room; he forced the lock back; we all three went in. Shannon took the dark lanthorn, and Summers looked round, and saw some ornaments; I told him there was some copper below; he asked how we were to get out; he got down into the yard by the water-butt, and let us out of the door into the yard; we walked along; he asked how we were to get down; he got down by the sky-light in the yard into the foundery; I followed him down; I directed him into the window of the time-keeper's room, and followed him; he got in, and forced a lock back; we then got into the passage of the kitchen; I shewed him the metal-room; he tried his skeleton key, it would not open the door; he returned into the time-keeper's room to look for something to force it; on looking round, he saw the keys hanging up, and said, here is a screw; he tried it; it was the key of the door; we went in, and let Summers and Knight in through the kitchen, out of the yard; we left Summers in possession of the door to whistle if any body came; we three went into the store-room, and filled four sacks with each ten pieces of copper; Knight tied them up; they carried these sacks into the finishing shop; while we were filling them, Shannon asked me what was up stairs; I told him I did not know; he asked if any body lodged there besides my master, and if he was worth property; he said he would go and try; he and Summers went up, and brought down an umbrella, a tea caddy, and a pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030012"/>pantaloons; he ran across the yard to me; I said I should be off, that the gentleman must be in his bed-room; he asked for a sack - We emptied the largest, and gave it to him; he and Knight went up, and came down with it full - I did not know what was in it till it was emptied at Mr. Woolf's, in Bell-yard-there was six or seven coats, about eight pair of pantaloons, eight waistcoats, a great coat, stockings and drawers, a tea-caddy, and an umbrella. Shannon and Knight fetched a coach; we took the clothes away, and left the copper. The coach passed by three doors; Shannon came and said, bring it out - I said I would not carry any thing; Shannon saw the watchman speaking to the coachman; Knight took the sack, and threw it into the coach with the umbrella and things. I got on the coach-box in Drury-lane - We drove to Phillips's, in Wych-street, and then took it to Woolf's, in Bell-yard, Templebar; we got there about two o'clock-he was up ready to receive us; we got 6l. for the clothes. I had known Summers six months, and Knight about four days.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the account which Dunn had given appear to be true as to the manner in which the robbery was committed? - A. Perfectly so; it corresponds with the observations which I made.</p>
               <p>SUMMERS'S Defence. Dunn came to my father's on Thursday morning, and asked me to rob his master's house; I said I did not like to do any thing of the kind; he said he would bring the copper out, and I should take it away; I refused; he asked me again on Friday - I refused; I met him and Knight at Bellshaw's on Saturday night; he asked me again - I refused to have any thing to do in it, and left there about a quarter before ten; he said he could get others to go; I did not see him again till Tuesday evening, when we were taken.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT'S Defence. I was coming through the Piazzas; I went to drink with him; he asked me to rob his master - I refused, and left him; on Tuesday night I met him again.</p>

               <p>JOHN GAY. I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 6th of November I saw the prisoner, and another man, under Shillcock's window with a bag; when he saw me he stood before it to bide it; I saw him stoop down to take it up-the other man lifted it on his shoulder. I asked him what he had got - He said he did not know, but was carrying it for a man; I followed him to Cowcross, and there stopped him - He tried to get away, and threw some skeleton keys out of his pocket; he pretended to be drunk-the bag contained rice, which Shillcock claimed.</p>

            . I am between thirteen and fourteen years old. I have known the prisoner since Bow Fair last year - I do not know his trade. On the 9th of November last I met him in Whitechapel, about six o'clock in the evening, by appointment - I was to meet him and James Bennet at the prosecutor's. The prisoner said, when we got to Keys's we were to go in and take the notes out of the till. Bennet went in with Munroe's hat on, and brought out a pocket-book, which the prisoner took away from him, and took it to his house-we all went there; when we got there we divided it-his house was in George-street - They both told the money out. The prisoner, I, Bennet, and Munroe-Munroe is a boy who was with us at Key's shop. We were together when the money was divided.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he divide it - A.We each had some. The prisoner took my money away, and bought me some clothes with it. The next morning he gave me some notes and a 3s. piece for my share - I do not know how many. There was some gold, which the prisoner had. There were two 7s. pieces, a half-guinea, and three guineas. The prisoner threw the pocket-book away in the backfield near Wentworth-street, by a sugar-baker's. He stood at the door, and said he would knock the gentleman down if he came out. About an hour after he gave me the money he took it away again. He made me stay with him that night. The next day he took me out about seven o'clock in the morning; he ordered a coach from a public-house in the Whitechapel-road, by Great Garden-street, and we went near Black Lion-yard, where he bought me a fustian jacket and breeches, a small striped waistcoat, and a hat; he paid for them, and bought himself a velvet jacket and breeches, and a striped waistcoat like mine-he paid for them in notes. We then went and bought a great coat for each of us, and a pair of stockings and a shirt for me, by Whitechapel watch-house-he paid for them in notes. We then went down Whitechapel-road, and bought two silk handkerchiefs, which he paid for in silver, and afterwards went back and changed a note for another. We went to a batter's in Whitechapel-road, and bought a hat for each of us - He gave 18s. for the two, and changed a note for them.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you take the coach - A. About one o'clock, after we bought the things. I do not know where I was taken to - We went to some of his relations; his mother went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Dolphin public-house, in Whitechapel-road - A. I know it by name, and was there in the course of that Monday, between one and two o'clock. The prisoner's relations lived in Black Lion-yard. We went to the Dolphin to have something to drink-it is near Black Lion-yard; he went first, and I followed him. He gave me a 3s. piece there. We were taken up on that night. I never got any of the money from him. I have been confined ever since. There was some reading at the end of the pocket-book - I should know it again if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not at home in bed when you brought me the money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known him - A.Ever since Bow Fair, which, I believe, was this summer, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not have the money all night, and give it to me in the morning - A. No; you took it away from me in the morning.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop in Whitechapel-road, next door to the corner of Black Lion-yard. On Monday, the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030015"/>the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, alone, and bought a jacket for 18s., and a shirt for 5s. He went away, and returned again in half an hour with Duproy, the last witness, and bought him a fustian jacket and trowsers and a waistcoat - I believe Duproy has got jacket and trowsers on now - He paid me 16s., in silver, for them. I am sure he is the man - I knew him before.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel-road. On the 10th of November I remember seeing the prisoner at my house between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, with a boy, whom I believe to be Duproy. He asked to see some silk handkerchiefs, asked the price, and went out; he returned again, bought two, and two pieces of ribbon to tie round their hats. The prisoner paid for them in half-crown pieces. In about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, he returned again, and bought another silk handkerchief cut off, and offered me a 1l. note. I told him I did not think I had change - He said I had taken some money of him, and could not want much to make up the change. When he gave me the note I asked his name and address; he gave the name of Johnston, Thomas-street, Whitechapel-road. I said, I did not know Thomas-street, Whitechapel-road - He then said, Thomas-street, Brick-lane, opposite Bacon-street-there is no such a street. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MOREHOUSE. I live in Whitechapel-road. I know the prisoner. On Monday morning, the 10th of November, he came to my house with a boy. The prisoner asked for a hat for the boy; I tried one on, and charged him 8s. for it. He came back again and had one for himself, which I charged 10s. for - He offered 17s. for the two, which I took - He produced a 1l. note; he gave me the name of William Seymour to put on it.</p>
               <p>HARRIET STEVENTON. I live at the Dolphin public-house, in Whitechapel-road. I knew the prisoner and Duproy. The prisoner came to my house alone, at seven o'clock in the morning of the 10th of November, and asked for change for a 1l. note - I refused it, not having it. Between ten and eleven o'clock he came again with his father - I believe he wanted change for a sovereign, I gave it to him. In the course of that morning I saw him in company with Duproy, and saw some money pass between them. I did not pay any attention to it, being busy. I did not know what money it was.</p>

             HICKMANN. I am a sugar-baker, and live in George-street, near Wentworth-street. On the morning of the 10th of November, about ten o'clock, I went with the officer from Mr. Key's, and found a small box. On the Sunday night I found a pocket-book about the middle of the gateway leading to my sugar-house, which is about half a mile from Mr. Key's house (looks at it)-that is it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did she say whether he struck her - A.She said he struck her on her left arm - He made no answer, he must have heard her; she gave that as a reason for striking him with the tongs - I did not notice her arm - I noticed two places on his head and one on his thigh; I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of them in liquor - A. Both, I believe; it was about ten o'clock - She showed me her arm, but I did not notice it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONST. I am a constable. I was called in about ten o'clock, and found the deceased sitting in a chair with both his hands pressed to his left side, and bending towards it; the prisoner stood in the room, with her clothes very much deranged, as if from scuffling-his shirt was torn to ribbons; the whole of the room was strewed with pieces of his clothes, and all the glass and crockery about the room, and two panes of glass, were broken. I asked him what had been the matter - He said his wife had been shamefully ill-using him, and had struck him on the head with a hammer until the head of it had flown off, and then she had recourse to the tongs - She went to the opposite side of the room - He said," what, are you hiding the tongs? why do you not give them to him?" - She turned round, and gave them to me; he said they were bent with giving him the blow in the ribs - She denied that, and said they had been bent with her trying to open them with her hand; they were bent-the head of the hammer was in one part of the room, and the handle in the other. The deceased denied giving her any provocation whatever for striking him - He repeatedly observed, "you have done for me at last!" She persisted in saying he did strike her, and pulled her gown up to show me her left arm-there was no mark whatever on it - I particularly observed it. I asked him if he had struck her in the scuffle - He said he had not used any other violence but what was necessary to preserve his life. Whenever he denied using violence she as strongly asserted that he had. I examined the body of the deceased, and observed his ribs were broken, which I considered fatal; the contusion on the side was about half the size of an hen's egg; he told me to take her away - She said, "Tom, you will not let me be locked up, will you?" and then told me it would be of no use to take her, as she knew he would not appear against her. At last he consented to let her remain, and said he would forgive her if she promised not to use him so again; I was going away - He said, "for God's sake don't leave me, or she will murder me;" I asked him why he did not give her in charge if he was afraid of his life? - he made some observations as to her cruelty; she said it served him right, he should not have aggravated her. I took her into custody ten days after, on the Coroner's warrant; her arm was then black all round, as if it had been grasped by a man's hand; it was the same arm that she had shewn me before, and in the same place where she said she was hurt.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say how he hurt his side - A. She said he fell against a box or table; she then said she was going to take the things out of his hand when he was going to strike her, and he said so to. He said she struck him with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030017"/>the tongs while he lay on the ground, and that she knocked him down with a hammer - She denied every assertion that he made.</p>
               <p>Q.Would the head of the hammer have given such a blow as would have laid him on the ground - A. Yes. I saw the deceased after he was dead, but saw little or no appearance of the tremendous bruise which I saw at first on his side. I should not have thought either of them to be in liquor.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell; the deceased was in my employ. On the Tuesday morning after he had received the injury, he came to the workshop, there was a great alteration in his countenance - He held his hand to his left side, and had a great difficulty in standing or speaking. I saw the prisoner the morning that he died, there appeared a large bruise on her left arm, about five inches round, she said the deceased gave it her with the bellows-it appeared to have been a violent bruise. The deceased said he had been fighting with his wife, and his landlady was the cause of it - He appeared unwilling to enter into particulars. On the Wednesday or Thursday after he received the blow he was at very laborious work for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM ERASMUS HARDY. I am clerk of the papers in Newgate. On the 6th of November the prisoner was brought in, I observed her left arm a few days after, it was black nearly from her elbow to the shoulder, it appeared the effect of a severe blow, and not of a grasp; I should have judged that she had received material violence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STREATING re-examined. When I saw the prisoner's arm it appeared to be more likely to be the effect of a blow than a grasp of the hand.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS SPENCER. I am a surgeon, and live at Islington. On the 4th of November I examined the body of the deceased, the seventh and eighth ribs, on the left side, were fractured, one was united-there were no external marks of violence-the contusion had disappeared; there was no appearance of inflammation either external or internal, on that side of the body. No mortification had taken place. From what I saw that would not have occasioned death without some other causes; the fracture would occasion immediate pain, but without immediate danger. I found the right lung had been in a deseased state for months, or even for years-it must have been above a month. This deceased part had been recently attacked with inflammation, and that inflammation had terminated in an abscess on the root of the lungs, and an effusion of a large quantity of blood in the cavity of the chest, which occasions death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that the blood in the cavity of the chest would have occasioned death - A. I cannot judge what occasioned the inflammation; it might have been occasioned by a variety of causes, such as cold or drinking; or the injury might, possibly, indirectly occasion it.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, which was most likely to have caused death - A. I think drinking more likely to have produced it than the injury; but external cold was the most probable cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider it as a matter of serious doubt in your mind whether the blows were the cause of his death - A. I do think other causes as likely; a slight cold, in addition to the deceased state in which he was, would be the most likely to have caused it. From his situation I think he could not have lived long if he had not received an injury. The laborious exercise of his trade would increase his previous indisposition. If had received a fall it might have inflamed his lungs - A cold might inflame them more.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STREATING re-examined. He worked laboriously on the Wednesday, which put him in a violent perspiration, but I do not recollect whether he went out in a perspiration. About six or eight weeks before this he fell down some stairs, and was laid up for six or eight days.</p>

I jumped over the counter, he ran out with the watch, I called out stop thief! and pursued him; he and another man ran on the pavement for some yards-the other man turned up a court; I still pursued the prisoner, he ran against a man at the corner of a turning, and I immediately seized him - I never lost sight of him.

On the 9th of November I went to bed at nine o'clock, and left every thing safe; between twelve and one o'clock I heard a noise like the breaking of a wall - I got up and went to bed again, leaving a candle burning; in a few minutes two persons burst into my room - They came in at a door which I had fastened with a small stick, it joined the privy; one of them laid hold of my hands, and the other took the candle - I had put my pockets on the floor - He struck them to see what was in them, and pulled them up, he then put the candle out, and I could see no more. They both came to my bed side-the prisoner was one of them; I saw him at the office among several others, and knew him immediately; they remained in my room and the next for nearly two hours-one of them afterwards struck a light. The other man was in the next room, and the prisoner stood over me, with a knife in his hand, and said,"where is your notes, or your life." I said I had none. He kept swearing at me, and said he would take my life if I did not say where my notes were. The other man went to rummage for more. The prisoner clapped his hand on my throat, and almost strangled me. Next morning, I missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday morning last, about eleven o'clock, at his room in Peartree-court - I knew him before. I asked him if he had been in possession of any goods for a person in Cooper's-gardens?(this related to another circumstace). I asked him to walk there with me, and shew me the woman. He got up and went with me, Gleed, Warwick, and another man, to the prosecutrix's house. I asked her if there was any person whom she knew? she immediately said the prisoner was the man. We took him into custody, and conveyed him to the watch-house. I told him I should search him. He began to be very violent-at last he was overcome. I took a watch out of his fob; he immediately said,</p>
               <p>"That is the old woman's, and a man gave it to me."</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Armstrong - He has spoken correctly. I went to the prisoner's room, and found some tea and sugar, and a chissel, in a bason on the shelf-the sugar was in the cupboard. I also found a dark lanthorn. The chissel looked as if it had been used for breaking down a wall; I compared it with the place where they had broken down the wall of the house, and it fitted it. There was a hole in the wall of the prosecutrix's house, large enough to admit two persons.</p>
               <p>HENRY IZARD HUGHES. I keep the Star and Garter, in Shoreditch. The morning that the prisoner was apprehended, I saw him and another man at my house about six o'clock, they had some gin. The prisoner produced two crown pieces, which I bought of him, and two of the other man.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 7th of November I saw the prisoner come out of Cheapside, and go up to Mr. Walter's door. I heard the key rattle in the door, and thought it was Mr. Walters opening his own door; it was twenty minutes after twelve o'clock. I said, "Your key does not seem to act, Sir" - He said, "Yes, it will." I asked him if he wanted a light? he said, No. I was just opposite. I went to my lanthorn, got a light, went over to him and said, "Lay hold of the light, and let me try." I could not open it. The candle went out, I went to get another-at that moment the prisoner opened the door and went in - I suspected all was not right. As he was shuting the door, I put my elbow before the door and prevented its being shut. I went in; the prisoner was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030019"/>bottom of the stairs. I said, "Do you live here?" He said, "Yes." I said, I did not think he did, and asked how long he had lived there? - he said, two days. I asked him what part of the house he occupied? - he made no answer for some time; he at last said, "Watchman, I beg your pardon, I have made a mistake in the door." I asked him where he lived? I took him out of that to several other doors-the key would not fit any; I then took him to the watch-house. He afterwards said, he lived at No. 23, Garlick-hill, which was some distance from Bow-lane. Two other keys were found on him. He would not tell where he lived at first. He did not appear the least intoxicated till I called the patrol - He then appeared to sham intoxication.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 23d of November, about six o'clock, I was in the kitchen on the first-floor, and heard a noise on the stairs; I went to the staircase, and found the prisoner about five or six stairs from the kitchen, without his hat and coat. The prisoner was the man, as far as I can judge from his appearance-he had a jacket on. I gave the alarm of Stop thief! directly, ran out at the street - door, and asked the neighbours to surround the next house, which was empty. The prisoner was taken about seventeen or eighteen yards from the house. He had ran up stairs, and made his escape. I had a candle, and was within a yard or two of him when he was taken-his dress and appearance corresponded. I can with certainty say he is the man.</p>
               <p>HANNAH WALKER. I am servant to the prosecutors. I sleep in the garret. I shut the window that evening, about a quarter of an hour before-it was then dark - I had no candle with me. There was a glass on the table close to the window. After the prisoner was taken, I found the window open, and the glass overturned. It had been dark sometime before I shut it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS DUTTON. I rent a house in Queenhithe, in the parish of St. Michael. The prisoner is quite a stranger to me. I was sitting in my counting-house, at the back of the warehouse-there were three reams of paper put about two yards from the door to be taken away by a cart, with other goods. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner took them up, and ran out of the door with them; I pursued him, and lost sight of him only while he turned the corner - He saw me, and dropped the paper - I saw him drop it; I still pursued - He ran as hard as he could; he was stopped in my presence - He was never out of my sight except while turning the corner; I gave him in charge, and sent Bowyer for the paper - He brought it to me-it is the same that the prisoner dropped; it is worth 4l. 10s., it cost me more.</p>

               <p>JAMES ROGERS. I am a pork-butcher, and live at No. 4, Red Lion passage, in the county of Middlesex. On the 5th of last November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop to purchase a lion of pork, which came to 3s. 2d.; he paid me 3s. in silver; before he paid me the 3s., he laid a 1l. note on the counter-while it was on the counter, a neighbour came in, and said he wanted a pound's worth of change, which I gave him, telling him I could spare five or six if he wanted it. During this time, the prisoner took up the 1l. note, and gave me 3s. in silver; he had not produced the 3s. before. After the neighbour was gone, he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030021"/>his master was a builder, and frequently wanted silver to pay his men. He then went away; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he came again to the shop, in company with another man; Mean, my shopman, was in the shop with me; the prisoner said he had brought some notes, and would thank me for some silver for them, for Mr. Dawson, a builder, in Drake-street. I asked him who it was for, and he said so. Drake-street leads into Red Lion-square. He gave me five 1l. notes - I took and endorsed them, "Dawson, builder, Drake-street; "they appeared clean - I took them, and gave him 5l. worth of silver for them; he put his hand into his pocket, and said,"You may as well give me the other pound," and produced another 1l. note. I endorsed it as before, and gave him the change for it. While he was talking to me, the other man was buying something of my shopman. They then went away; the prisoner was dressed in a flannel jacket. Next morning I discovered that the notes were forged, and informed Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to a public-house in Field-lane? - A. Yes, to the Thatched House, about eight or ten days after, with Joshua Armstrong, and another officer, and saw the prisoner there with five or six other persons in the same place; I knew him immediately, and pointed him out; he was not dressed then as he is now; (looking at six notes)-these are the notes he paid me-they have my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it me or the other man that said he came from Mr. Dawson's - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If that was said by the other person, was it said in the prisoner's presence, so that he must have heard it - A. Yes. The prisoner himself produced the notes, he pulled the first five out of a canvas bag, and the other out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. REYNOLDS. Q. The first time that the prisoner came he came alone - A. Yes, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MEAN. I am shopman to Mr. Rogers. On the 5th of November I remember two persons coming to the shop, I was not there the first time-one of them had on a flannel jacket, and the other a black coat and waistcoat. When they came in, the man in the black coat asked me for some pork, the person in the flannel jacket asked for nothing; he was talking to my master - I saw my master give him some change for some notes, I do not know how much; I heard the man in the flannel jacket ask for another pound, which he had - I saw him lay one note down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the man who spoke to you say any thing to the other - A. No, they took no notice of each other at all; he said nothing except talking to me about the pork; they both went out together; I have been to Drake-street, Red Lion-square-there is about ten houses in the street, I enquired at three of them, and could not find a Mr. Dawson there.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BANKS. I am a tax-gatherer, and live in New Smith-street, Red Lion-square, and have resided in the parish for the last six years; I know every house in Drake-street-there are eleven in all; I know the names of every inhabitant-there is no such person as Dawson living there, there is no builder-there is a Mr. Durston, a blindmaker.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 18th of November, I went to the Thatched House, in Field-lane, with Gleed and Mr. Rogers; the prisoner was in the tap-room, with other persons; Mr. Rogers pointed him out as the man; I took him into custody, and asked him where he lived, he refused to tell me; I afterwards found that he lived at No. 5, Falcon-court, Shoe-lane, Holborn, opposite St. Andrew's church. In searching his lodgings I found a flannel jacket, which I showed him - I told him where I found it, and asked him if it was his-he said it was - He came willingly with me.</p>
               <p>JAMES ROGERS re-examined. I should think it is the same jacket which he had on - I am sure he mentioned the name of Dawson, it could not be Durston; I asked the question twice, the name was repeated twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it repeated each time so that if the prisoner was not the person that spoke he must have heard it-A. It was. I do not recollect the other man speaking to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other man say any thing to the prisoner-A. Yes, the other man hesitated about taking the other pound's worth of silver, and said he did not think it would be wanted-the prisoner said they might as well have it.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes in the Bank of England. - (Examining the notes) - They are all six forged; the paper is not bank paper, the plate is not the bank plate, the water-mark is not the bank watermark, nor the signatures the bank signatures; they are all off the same plate-the signatures appear to be of the same hand-writing, though of different names. I went to every house in Drake-street - I could not find any such person having lived there, either as lodger or housekeeper, for a great while before. The names at the bottom of the notes are the names of the signing clerks of the Bank, but not their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG re-examined. I searched the prisoner, and found six good notes on him, but no bad ones.</p>
               <p>(Note No. 25,876, dated August 13, 1817, read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of November I was in the same public-house that I was taken in; the man whom Rogers describes came in about four o'clock; I had seen him once or twice before at that house - He said he had got a book in Holborn, which had 40l. in it, and said if I would go out with him, and pass the notes, he would put a pound note in my pocket, as he was afraid they would be stopped. I immediately went with him; when we came to the end of Brook-street, he said that was the place where he got the book, for a horse and cart had fallen down; I told him I would change the notes, as I was going to buy a piece of pork; I bought the pork, and gave 3s. for it; I heard the gentleman say he had plenty of change, and I came out and told the man of it; I said I would not go in without him - We went in, he gave me the notes, and said if they asked him where he lived, he shoul say his name was Dawson, and that he lived in Drake-street; when I came out I gave him the silver - I did not know they were forged, but thought they were stolen.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WINKFIELD. I keep the Long-acre Vine Vaults, in Long-acre, in the county of Middlesex. On the 29th of October last, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Newman, came to my house in company with a man, whom I do not recollect - She asked for a quartern of liquor, which was fourpence, I served her; she asked me if I could change her a 1l. note - I told her I could, she produced one, and I gave her the change - I observed on the face of the note, "Mrs. Hughes, 6, Grub-street." I took the note, and she and the man went out immediately, together; Plank, the officer, came in directly to me, I shewed him the note which I had taken of them; in consequence of what he said I gave him the note, after endorsing my name on it. I had never parted with it (looks at it), that is the note she gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I had never seen her before. I will positively swear she is the person - I particularly noticed her dress and her person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the note when you received it - A. I put it in my till, there was more money there - I had noticed the name of Hughes on it. I am certain it is the same note.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The people are served at your bar - A. Yes. The female prisoner and the man came in and went out as companions.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I have known the prisoners ever since the 29th of October; on that day I saw them together in Bunhill-row - They went into a liquor shop-it was Tuesday; they then went into a house in Whitecross-street, and came out together - I saw them drink at the bar there; I then followed them into another liquor shop on Holborn-hill, they drank there also; they then went into two private houses in St. Gile's, the woman only went into the private houses, the man waited outside for her, and joined her when she came out. I then followed them to Winkfield's door, the woman looked at the name over the door, and both went in together; I looked through the window, and saw them both standing together at the bar, they came out and turned towards Drury-lane, I immediately went into Winkfield's - I had been in sight of the prisoners for about an hour and a half, and have not the least doubt of their being the persons. There was a disturbance in Holborn, where there is a gas light, they stopped there, which enabled me to notice them.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into Winkfield's - A. Yes, and gave him directions; I then came out, and found the prisoners about thirty yards off; I followed them to Smithfield, and then lost them. Winkfield produced a note, I desired him to mark it, which I saw him do - I had it in my hand (looks at it), it is the same that I saw in his possession; the prisoners walked arm-in-arm together, except where a crowd separated them. When I took them I returned to Winkfield's, he produced a note to me, I cannot say whether it is the same that he shewed me at first; he gave it to me, and I put my endorsement on it when I received it of him; it has my endorsement on it now. I had never seen the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again - A.On Saturday, the 1st of November, I saw them together in Bunhill-row,

             was with me, we followed them to the same liquor shop in Whitecross-street; from there to another liquor shop on Holborn-hill-they had something to drink; from there I followed them to St. Giles's, until they came opposite the shop of Mr. Bartlett, a shoemaker, at the corner of Denmark-street; they spoke together-the woman crossed over and went into the shop, the man crossed also and placed himself at the window, on the High-street side of the shop, the woman went out of the shop into a room - I was in the street, watching Mansfield, he immediately shifted his place, and went to the Denmark-street side of the shop, which commanded a view of the back room where the woman was sitting, I immediately took him into custody, and Jeffries took him away. I went into the shop and said something to Mr. Bartlett - I saw the woman sitting in a chair, trying some shoes on-she approved of them; I was in the shop, Mr. Bartlett came from her and gave me a 1l. note - I did not see her give it to him - He marked it, and returned it to me; I immediately took her into custody, and slightly searched her, I only found some change upon her; I asked her where she got the note which she had given for change; she said she was an unfortunate woman, and she had received it that morning from a gentleman in a coach. I asked her where she lived, she said, at Westminster, but she would not say where there, as her father laid dead, and her mother was in a great deal of trouble. I asked her if she had been in company with a man at the door of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030023"/>the shop, she said she had not-it was about eight o'clock in the evening, or rather later. I took her to the watchhouse, and there searched her particularly, and found a key upon her, which she said was the key of the street-door where she lived. I asked her what part of Westminster she lived at, she said she would not tell; I asked her if she had given that address at the shoemaker's, she said she had not. Mansfield was in the same place, but not in the same room; I found a similar key on him to the one she had given me - He said it was the key of the house where he lived; he was asked where that was, he said he would not tell, as his wife was near the time of her lying-in, and he would not alarm her. About 22s. in good silver, was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him originally in Bonhill-row, did you see him come out of any house - A. I had seen him come out of a coal-shed, at No. 52, Bunhill-row; I have seen him carry coals out from there. I went with Foy and Jeffries to No. 52, we took the two keys there, they both fitted and opened the street - door, we went up stairs to the first-floor back room-Mrs. Goodman keeps the house-she gave us the key of the room, and I opened the door, we went in and searched, and on the top of the looking glass, which hung against the wainscot, we found a bladder, which contained twenty-eight 2l. notes - I marked them, and gave them to Foy; we also found some letters and wearing apparel there; and in Mrs. Goodman's room, below, we found a jacket, which I had seen Mansfield wear. I was present at the second examination of the prisoners, with Jeffries; as we were going to the office, Newman asked me what things I had taken out of her room, I told her there was two or three gowns, and some letters. She asked me if I had seen her marriage certificate - I told her there was one. She said there some duplicates with a pocket-book, and a 3s. piece in it; I told her I saw them there, and believed Foy had them; she said she hoped we would return them - I told her we would.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing shewn to Mansfield - A. At the third examination some things were produced that we had taken from the room, Newman claimed the gowns, and he claimed the jacket, and gave it to his mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know them before. I saw them in the evening; I followed them for sometime - I did not wish them to know that I was following them; I avoided their noticing me, and did not go very near to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take them into custody after they went to Winkfield's - A. I was not sure that the note was a forgery, and could not take them myself, any person might be looking into Mr. Bartlett's shop, to see the shoes. I did not know Newman to be an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the female prisoner say that the other prisoner was innocent - A. She told him they could not touch him as he never uttered me - He shook his head.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN LEES. I am an inspector of bank notes,(looks at the note, No. 27, 810), it is a forged note in every respect, both paper, plate, and signature.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARTLETT. I am a shoemaker, and reside at the corner of Denmark-street. On the 1st of November, in the evening, the prisoner, Newman, came to my shop, she went into the ladies' room, and asked for a pair of half-boots-while my wife was serving her, Plank came in and gave me a caution; I went into the room, she gave my wife a 1l. note, my wife asked her name, she gave the name of"Brown, Brownlow-street;" which I wrote on the note - I heard her say so, and wrote it in her presence (looking at it), that is the note I saw her give to my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Plank called me aside. She was giving my wife the note when I went into the room after seeing him.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Penny, who keeps a wine-vaults, at No. 123, Drury-lane. I know the prisoner, Newman. On the 13th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came to the shop, in company with a woman whom I did not know. They came to the bar together, and had two glasses of liquor. One gave the order. Newman paid for it with a 1l. note; she asked me to change it. I gave her 17s. in silver, and asked her name-the liquor came to 4d.; I gave her the rest in copper. I generally give 5s. in copper. She gave me the name of "Mrs. Brown, King-street." I said,"King-street, Golden-square?" - She said "No, King-street, here"-which I concluded was Drury-lane. I marked the note (looking at one) that is it-it is marked"13th of the 10th month, Mrs. Brown, King-street." They went away together. I do not know who took the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had seen her six or seven years before. We do not change without giving copper.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SOUL. I keep the Bull's Head, in Carnaby-market. I know the prisoner, Newman. On the 25th of October, I saw her in my parlour - I did not see her come in-it was about nine o'clock in the evening; she asked for a quartern and a half of gin, which came to 6d., and a pot of beer-she gave me a 1l. note to pay for it. There were other people drinking with her; while she was in the house Jeffries came in, and gave me some information. She gave me a 1l. note - I took it over to the butcher to borrow the change, Jeffries having desired me to do so. I came back and found her still in the parlour. I brought the note back to her, desiring her to write her name on it - She did so. She had given me her address before, at No. 10, Silver-street. I do not know whether she gave me any name. She wrote on the note, "Mrs. Brown, No. 5, Pulteney-street." I gave it to Jeffries, after writing my own name on it (looks at it)-this is it. I made no observation to her about giving me another address.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I know the prisoners. The first time that I saw them was on the 25th of October, in Bunhill-row together, at a little after seven o'clock in the evening. I followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030024"/>them down Chiswell-street. The man sometimes walked before the woman, and sometimes the woman before the man. When they came to Holborn-hill she took his arm. They went into a wine-vaults opposite St. Andrew's church; they came out, and walked arm-in-arm to St. Giles's; they parted, and the woman walked first down Oxford-street and Wardour-street. I followed them into Silver-street, and saw them both go into No. 37 there - They came out in twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, in company with another woman; I then followed all three into Soul's public-house-the man went in first, and the woman stopped on the opposite side; the man came out again, they crossed to him, and all three went in together - I followed them in, and saw them, through a small pane of glass, sitting in the parlour - I told Soul something, and waited at the door; in a short time he came out and shewed me a note; we went to the opposite house, and saw that they had not marked it. I told him to take it back, and get it marked, which he did, and immediately returned to me with it-we both indorsed it (looks at it)-this it; it is No. 29057. I then waited a short time, and the two prisoners and the other woman came out together-the other woman left them at the door, and the prisoners went together into the market; the man then left the woman. She walked into Broad-street, Golden-square, where she waited for about ten minutes, and finding he did not come, she went down Bennet-street; he came soon after, and appeared to be looking for her. After this, I saw Newman talking to two women in Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you see them together that evening - A. About two hours and a half. On Saturday, the 1st of November, I was watching them with Plank, about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw them in Bunhill-row - We followed them into a house together in White-cross-street, it was a public-house at the corner - She had a basket. They came out, and went into a public-house in Holborn; we followed them from there, up Holborn, until they came opposite Mr. Bartlett's. She crossed the way, and went into the shop, leaving the man on the opposite side; he crossed over, and looked in at the window-it is a corner-shop-he went away from that window to the other, which commanded a view of the room where the woman was. Plank and I took him into custody, and conveyed him to the watch-house. On searching him I found 22s. 6d. in silver on him and a latch-key. We asked him his name? he said it was

             re-examined (looks at the notes), No. 16074, uttered to Avis; No. 29057, to Soul, and No. 27815, to Bartlett; all of them are forged in every respect; the four appear to be of two different plates, but the signatures appear to be of the same hand-writing. The twentyeight 2l. notes are all forged, and the signature appears to be the same hand-writing as the other four.</p>

             re-examined. Q, You showed the note to the officer, was that the time that he returned it to you, that you saw the name of "Hughes, Grub-street," on it - A. I observed it the moment I took it of them, before I put it in my till. I have not the least doubt of its being the same - I put it at the top of my till, Plank came in immediately. It is impossible that it could have mixed with any others.</p>

On the 24th of November I went out at nine o'clock in the morning, and returned at twelve. I had left no person in the house but my lodgers. I went up stairs, and found the door of my upper room had been opened, apparently with a key-it was fastened with a padlock. I went down to my other room, and as I went down stairs I saw the prisoner come out of the room(which had been broken open), with a bundle. I called out, "Who is there?" he made no answer. I pursued him down stairs. He threw the bundle down in the passage. I called out, Stop thief! - He was stopped immediately; I collared him - I never lost sight of him. I brought him back to my passage, and asked him how he could think of robbing me? He said, "There is your things, and what more do you want?" I gave him in charge to Turner. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>SARAH SMITHERS. I live in Cock-lane. I know the prisoner, Gray, I have seen him meet the prisoner, Budd, several times. On the 4th of October I saw him come out of Wood-street to the corner of Silver-street, and go into the Cooper's Arms-Gray was there; I had followed him from Cock-lane; I saw them together in the house, and saw Budd pull something out of his pocket, and give it to Gray, it looked like ribbons. I found where Budd lived, and gave his master information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Gray used to frequent Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>MR. MICHAEL WALFORD BOYLE. I am in partnership with Charles Spurden and Fisher Walford. We are wholesale haberdashers, residing in Friday-street; the prisoner Budd had been two years in our service; he had access to the whole of our stock, which is very large. Smithers gave me information on the 30th of October; I sent for Budd, and spoke to him about this; in consequence of what passed, I got a search-warrant, and went to the prisoner Gray's apartments, in Pomberton-row, Gough-square, with Cartwright and Armstrong. While we were searching, Gray came in, and said they were his apartments; we found the articles stated in the indictment there, which, to the best of my belief, are our property. There was no appearance of business in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I will not swear I had not sold them; we do not sell in town-there was a woman in the room.</p>
               <p>DANIEL CARTWRIGHT. I am an officer. I went with the warrant - I have known

             a long time, he is not an haberdasher; we found the bonnet in his cupboard, and the ribbons in the table drawer.</p>

On the 27th of November he came to my house to bespeak my horse and cart; I was to meet him at the Brill, which I did, and agreed to go; next morning he called me up at half-past four o'clock - I got my horse and cart, and followed him to Leadenhall-market. We got there a little before six; he told me to back the cart against the gates, which lead into a yard out of the market. I saw the prisoner, Cane, there giving wood into Bartlett's hand, who put it into my cart-it appeared to be old joists; the yard gates were open. When my cart was loaded, Bartlett told me to drive to Cow-cross; there were two carts, the other was loaded-Wilding had the other cart. Bartlett went on with Wilding, and Cane with me to Cow-cross; I unloaded, and Cane carried it into Chipperfield's yard, in Benjamin-street; we got there about half-past nine. I then drove home. Next day I saw Rice, and told him of it - I took him to Chipperfield's, and shewed him the stuff; we were going along Battle Bridge, and saw Bartlett at a public-house; he saw me, I went in, and found Cane there, Rice secured him, and put him into my cart - He resisted very much - We took him to Somers'-town, where he said he lived; we found it was false; as we were taking him back he jumped out of the cart - We secured him again.</p>

Cane brought out some wood, and gave it to Bartlett; I put it into my cart, it was old beams-both the prisoners assisted in loading it; I drew up on one side the market, while the other cart was loaded; Cane then told me to stay, for it was rather early, and the men had not got to work. We left the market about half-past six. Bartlett told me to go on towards the Bank, he went with me; we went to Cowcross, and had some drink there; Cane said something to Brigsworth; Bartlett told me to go to his house with my load, which I did; he lives ten doors from me; I put the wood in his yard, next day I showed it to Mr. Cogdon.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live in Mr. Poynton's rents, I am one of his tenants. On the 6th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went out, and heard somebody over in the garden - I called Lipscombe; we got over my rails into Mr. Poynton's garden; I heard somebody pulling up plants; as I was going towards one of the beds, I saw two men there; one of them gathered up the roses and ran away; I caught the prisoner stooping down in the act of pulling up the roses-i asked him what he did there? he said he wanted half a dozen to put in his garden; I took him out of the garden, I did not take him into custody, I knew him very well. There appeared to be about seventy-five rose trees torn up and taken away, which must be worth 3s. 15s. The prisoner was secured several days after.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Beetham, who is an attorney, and lives in Cornhill; in April last the the prisoner applied to me to have a power of attorney to transfer some stock in the Bank of England; she said she came from Mr. Twelvetree, of Aldersgate-street, whom I knew to be a client of Mr. Beetham's; she produced two stock receipts - I told her she must apply to a stockbroker, and recommended her to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no more of her for sometime - A. Not in particular. When the stock was sold out my father gave me the money that it was sold for; I paid it to the prisoner, at Mr. Beetham's, it was more than 100l. I paid her the same money that my father gave me. She told me it was given to her by a relation, who she named to be Mrs. Thomas, and said she was going to be married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I found that Mr. Twelvetree had recommended her.</p>
               <p>PETER WOODWARD. I am a stock-broker. In April last the prisoner applied to me to sell out 115l. Navy 5 per Cents, she was introduced to me by my son - I was to take out the power of attorney for it. She said it was some money a relation was going to advance her to go into business-she said the relation's name was Elizabeth Thomas. I asked her the description of it in the Bank books.</p>
               <p>Q.What description did she give you - A. Hendrea, near Bodmin, in Cornwall-she gave me this description verbally, and left the Bank receipts for the stock with me - I returned them to her when the business was done.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS BEVERLY WESTWOOD. I served the prisoner with a notice to produce these stock receipts on Friday last.</p>

             continuing. The two receipts made up 115l. together, Navy 5 per Cents - They corresponded with the description she gave me, except there being no residence mentioned in them. I applied at the Bank and got the forms of the power of attorney (looking at it), this is it. When I got it from the Bank it was all filled up, except the signature, witnesses, and the date; I handed it over to the prisoner, and explained to her the instructions given - She had to send it into the country. Three or four days after I saw her, she returned the power of attorney to me, executed in the form in which it now appears, she gave it to me at my own house, which is in Watling-street, in the City of London; she gave it to me to carry into effect; I went with it to the Bank myself, and acting on it, I sold the stock, transferred it, and obtained themoney. I sold it to John Toyne, of the Stock Exchange. I received the money, made a statement of the transaction, and gave the money to my son to give the prisoner, with the statement which I had made out on a piece of paper. After that I wrote a letter addressed to myself, and delivered it the prisoner - this was a day or two after; she acknowledged receiving the money. I put the paper into her hands, desiring her to carry it to Mrs. Thomas, and tell her to send it to me by post; I supposed she was going to where Mrs. Thomas lived, which she said was at Chard, in Somersetshire. I soon after received the letter by post, in the regular course.</p>

In the beginning of March last, I had occasion to go to Cornwall by the waggon-the prisoner was also a passenger in the waggon; I did not know her before - She is no relation of mine. We both went from London, as far as Hminster, in Somersetshire; we were four days and nights together; during that time she began talking about her property. She said she had 400l. left her by her grandfather, who was in the Bank, and she had been to London to receive her dividend - I said I had a trifle in the Bank. She said she was going to be married, and wanted a servant. I was out of a situation and engaged with her as a servant-she was to be married on the 6th of April; I was to go into Cornwall to my mother's, and return as quick as possible. She said, she lived with her uncle, Farmer Baker, at the New London Road, Dorset-she wrote the direction herself. She went by the name of

He went with me to Mr. Twelvetree's, in Aldersgate-street - he asked Mr. Twelvetree to recommend him to a broker, which he did. He told me there would be no harm, and if I would do it he would give me 25l. - I did it. He went back with me to the country with the power of attorney. I received the money of the young man, and went back to the country the same day, and delivered the money to him. In a few days, he pretended that he had his house broken open, and left me. I had no part of the money. His name is Phillip Goddard, of Chard.</p>

             GOUGH. I am twenty-one years of age. I was living in Cottage-place until about a month ago; I had lived there two years and a half. I know the prisoners; I had known Buttery for about a week before I was taken up; I only knew M'Namara by seeing him pass my door. I went to lodge in Buttery's house; I lived there with a woman named Kitty Humble, about a week before; I was taken up a day or two after I was in my room; I have two children, and was in great distress. Buttery asked me to carry a letter to an attorney, and said he would give me a few shillings for my trouble; I said I would take it - He said it would be doing him a great service; I asked him why Kitty could not go? he said on account of her being Irish; I said I would go - He went with me; I had a child in my arms, he carried it for me; I wished to leave it at home, he said if it was too heavy for me he would carry it: we went as far as the end of St. Paul's Church-yard, by Ludgate-hill, and there met M'Namara; Buttery spoke to him, I do not know what he said; I stood by the side of Buttery; I did not expect to meet M'Namara; he gave Buttery a paper which he took out of his pocket, and Buttery gave it to me; we all three walked on, they walked first; Buttery went to Mr. Maynard's with me, M'Namara waited outside; Buttery took the paper from me, and gave it to him. Mr. Maynard asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030031"/>me if I knew what sum of money it was? I told him I had not seen the paper; I do not recollect his asking me where I lived; he asked me if I knew any thing of Mr. Mann; before I could answer, Buttery said, "I knew him very well, for I shipped him;" we were in the passage, Mr. Maynard went into a room; I do not remember any body telling Mr. Maynard where I lived, but they named the ship that he said he shipped him in, it was the Barkworth East Indiaman; we came out, Mr. Maynard told me to follow him; I turned round and asked Buttery where I was going? he told me to go on, and I should not be detained a moment; Mr. Maynard took me to another gentleman, and gave me a book; the gentleman said something, and told me to kiss the book, which I did; my child cried, so I did not hear what he said; I heard him call over the name of Mann. Buttery went with me as far as Newgate-street. When we came out, we found M'Namara standing across the road; they both went away together, and left me in Newgate-street; they talked together, I do not know what they said. I saw Buttery again about nine o'clock next morning, and asked him how he knew that the man belonging to the money was dead? he said he was sure of it, as M'Namara and him had both visited the India house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass about the money - A. When Mr. Maynard asked what the sum was, Buttery said it was under 20l. Next day we were sitting by the fire; I said"What was the sum? 120l. I understood Mr. Maynard;" he said no, it was about 16 or 17l. I asked him what he did with it? he said him and three more were to share it between them, and said he would give me something for my trouble. My father lived in Middle-row; I never went by the name of

            . I am a solicitor. I first saw the prisoner, M'Namara, on the 1st of November; I saw him again the beginning of the ensuing week at the Compter. In consequence of a message that was sent to me, I went to him, with Mr. Lawford; he said he wanted to speak to us; we agreed to see him at six o'clock that evening. At that time Mr. Lawford, Mr. Adams, Kerridge, and myself, went to him; before M'Namara was suffered to speak a word, I told him that nothing he could say would be of any use to him, that we had a very strong case against him, and it could not be of any possible service to him to disclose any thing to us; but if he wanted to say any thing we were there to hear it. Mr. Lawford told him that what he said would most probably be used in evidence against him; he said he knew that, but it was a duty that he owed, for that he was an honest man until these people drew him into it; I asked him what people? he began with Buttery, who was then in custody, but I do not think he knew it. He said that Buttery and another person were concerned, and gave me directions where to find them. Among other transactions that he mentioned, he said that Buttery had got a woman to go as Ann Wilson to get the wages of a person of the name of Mann, a seaman on board the Barkquit; I asked him if he meant the Barkworth, and he said he did. Two or three days after I took the original will, and some others, to the Compter; I neither threatended nor promissed him; I put the wills before him, and asked him whose hand-writing they were? as I laid them before him, he said the whole of the will of

I saw him again in two or three days; he then said the body of the will was his own hand-writing, but the signature was Buttery's, and that Buttery had given him 10s. to fill it up. I afterwards went and inspected the wills at the Commons, myself, and found reason to disbelieve what he had said. A few days after I received a note from Buttery, and went to him in consequence of it, with Mr. Kerridge. M'Namara was called out first; I told him I had received a note from Buttery, and was going to see him. I then repeated my cautions to M'Namara as I had done before, and asked him if he had any thing further to say? he then threw himself in a chair, and said, "Well, then, I did sign the will." He then left us. Buttery was called out; I read his note to him, and asked him if it was his, he said it was; I told him we had a very strong case against him, and that it was of no use his saying any thing; he said he knew that, but it would be a relief to his mind;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030032"/>he gave me an account of several things; with regard to this will, he said that he had gone to M'Namara, and signed his name to it; that it was too dark to fill the will up, but it was agreed between them, him and M'Namara, that M'Namara should fill it up in the morning, and bring it to St. Paul's Church-yard, and that he and the woman that was called

I searched Buttery's premises in Murphy's house, in Baker's-rents, Rosemary-lane, who was his landlord; I broke the door open, and in the pocket of a blue jacket I found a pocket-book, containing a ticket with the name of "J.Buttery, Greenwich," and a memorandum with the name of"Ann Wilson, Cottage-place, White Lion-street," on it.</p>

The apartment that Kerridge searched the prisoner Buttery hired of me; it was his apartment at the time it was searched; he had the key of it, while he was in possession. I did not know Gough till she was in custody; Buttery did not sleep in this apartment; he used to work there, and went to another lodging to sleep.</p>

               <p>In the early part of the cause, MR. ALLEY contended that after the probate of the will was produced under the seal of the Ecclesiastical Court, the Counsel for the Prosecution could not legally produce evidence to prove the will a forgery.</p>

            . I live in Upper King-street, Bloomsbury. I know the prisoners, I used to play with them. About half-past ten o'clock on the Saturday before last, I saw Reed coming down Swan-yard, in the Strand, alone; he asked where I was going, I told him I was going home; he said he was going the market way, and would go as far as that with me. We met Jones with his sister's pye-stall; he asked me to take it home for him, which I did. When I came out I found him and Reed waiting for me; they asked me if I would mind a bundle for them; Jones spoke, Reed heard it; I said I did not much like it-before this Jones offered me 3d., and Reed 2d. I agreed to do it; they took me to the corner of Exeter-street, Catharine-street; Reed gave 
               <persName id="t18171203-69-person576">Jones</persName>
             a penny, and he, Jones, went to fetch the bundle - He was not gone above three minutes; they asked me to go and get them mangled in Vere-street; I went and got them mangled at a chandler's-shop; Reed waited at the door, and when they were done he gave me two-pence halfpenny to pay for them. He told me to carry them, they asked me to go to Mr. Carr's with them, which I did-Reed went in by himself; I was carrying the bundle, Reed opened it just before we got there, and took the gown out. Jones was standing by, Reed took it into Carr's; when he came out he told Jones he had got 4s.; Jones asked to see the ticket, he shewed it to him. He took a hat out of pledge at Carr's. I went with them to another pawnbroker's, in Bridges-street; Reed took the bundle from me there; we waited at the door until he came out; he then said he must go home; Reed told me to go and ask a woman at a greenshop to let me leave the bundle; I said, "What should I ask that for?" he said, "Never mind, go." I went and left it there. I afterwards went to the watch-house to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030033"/>prisoners; Jones asked me to go and sell the bundle, I said I would not. Mousey, who was there, said if I would go and get the bundle he would sell it; he got it, and sold it in Baldwin's-gardens. When we got to the green-shop, I saw the contents of the bundle; there were some shifts, childrens' pinafores, and a child's plaid dress.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAN. I apprehended the prisoners and a boy, named Wright, that night; Bindon was introduced to them about half an hour afterwards - We awoke him out of his sleep, and took him to the watch-house. I did not tell him what it was for, his father might have told him. I put the three together, and he pointed out the prisoners particularly, and said they were the two boys who knocked him down, and took his bundle from him. I asked him if he knew any thing of the other boy? he said, No - They denied it. When I apprehended Reed, I found a hat in his mother's house; he said it was not his, and that he knew nothing about it; he afterwards said he found it. I found four shillings and three-pence halfpenny on him, and the duplicate of another hat.</p>
               <p>REED. Q.Did I say where I found it - A. No. I told him I wanted him for a robbery, and if he would go to the watch-house he should be cleared if he was not the person.</p>

On the 3rd of November I saw the prisoner in the court, taking part of the pavement up, and asked him what he was doing? he said the New River Company had sent him to take up the leaden pipes, and put brass ferrules to them, to make them fix snug in the iron pipes. I remembered his having been employed to lay down the pipes, which made me not suspect him. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw him cutting the pipe into small pieces about a foot long-it was part of the pipe that ran under the pavement into my brother's house.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Hunt. On the 3d of November I saw the prisoner taking up the pipe. He asked me to let him see the pipe inside the house-he took about seven feet from the outside-it ran against the wall inside the house, and was fastened to it by holdfasts. He went to work in the court again. In the evening I missed the pipe-it was cut off close to the wall; nine feet was taken from the inside - He said he was going to put cross-ferrules to it. I had seen him at work when the iron pipes were laid down, which induced me to admit him into the house.</p>

               <p>MR. JAMES TREACHER. I am inspector of the New River Company's works-the prisoner never worked for the Company. The iron pipes were laid down by contract, and he was employed by the contractor. The pipe is worth 1l.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Barker. On the 4th of November, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the boy alarmed me; I went into the shop, and found the prisoner secreted in one of the boxes. He said, he came for a night's lodging. I pulled him out, and found the eye-glass and his shoes, by his side, and a quantity of silver and halfpence in his pocket. He said his mother had sent him on errand with the money. I asked him how much there was? he said, 15s. 6d. I said, there was a great deal more. He said, he meant 22s. 6d., which was not correct. I do not know exactly how much there was.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WOOLSTENHOME. I am shopman to Messrs. Barker. The apprentice called me up. I found part of the flap of the box up, and saw the prisoner in the corner of it - He had undone part of the door - He had taken a screw out. I told him to strip himself - I found a watch in his trowsers; he tried to hide it behind the ladder. I saw the reading-glass and snuff-box on the floor; his shoes were lying close by his side. He must have got in at eight o'clock, just as the doors were closed, and laid along the floor.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS TILLARD. I am an officer. I was sent for, and questioned the prisoner how he got the property - He pointed to the till, and said he got the money out of it, and the snuff-box, glass, and watch, out of the window.</p>

On the 21st of November, the prisoner came to the stables (I knew him before) - He wanted a saddle-horse to go to kew. I shewed him several, none would suit-at last, I shewed him a tall bay gelding. It was about half-past ten o'clock in the morning-it was to be saddled, and taken to Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road, by eleven o'clock. A shoe being loose, I was obliged to get it shod, which made it rather later than that time. When it was shod, I was taking it to Charlotte-street, and met the prisoner just as I had passed the Circus gate; he asked what made me so late? I told him what occasioned the delay. He wanted the horse - I asked him for the money, which is a customary thing - I asked him for 10s. He took some silver out of his pocket, and said he had but 10s, and would give me 9s., as he must have 1s. left to pay the turnpikes. He said, very probably he might not return until the next day, and if he did not he was to pay me 10s. more for that day, and 1s. that he owed me. Between three and four o'clock I had occasion to take two horses for sale to Smithfield. I had not been there long before Price, who was with me, told me that he saw a young man riding the horse up and down the market. I went up to the young man - He jumped off the horse as soon as he found what my business was, and said he would shew me the gentleman who had hired him to sell the horse. He took me to the prisoner, who had hired the horse. I asked him what he was about? he made no answer. After a short time I sent for a constable, and had him taken up. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I never saw him before. I did not know his name until he was taken to the Compter. He was to have it for one or two days - He gave me 9s. He might have had it all that day and the next.</p>

            . I am a hackney coach-driver. I was in the stable-yard at the Obelisk. Simpson asked me to go to Charlotte-street with him. He met the prisoner by the Obelisk gate - He asked the nearest way to Kew; I directed him to go towards Vauxhall-bridge - He was on the horse at the time. I am sure the prisoner is the man. In the afternoon I went with Simpson to Smithfield; as I stood on the side, I saw the horse go by with a young man on it; it was without a saddle. I am sure it is the same gelding that was let to the prisoner. I told Simpson there was the horse that the gentleman had hired to go to Kew. I was on a horse at the time-Simpson followed me. I looked at the horse before he came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner never attempted to go away. I heard him say something about selling the horse - He said the saddle was in the stable.</p>

            . I work at Dixon's Repository, in Barbican. I was not at work on the 21st of November, but was standing in the yard; the prisoner came up to me about two o'clock, and asked me if I could get a customer for a horse which he had no further occason for? I told him I did not know until I saw what kind of a horse it was. I asked him if he had it with him? he said, No; but it was not far off. I asked where? he said, "in Little Britain" - I went there with him to see it; it was standing at Robson's yard, at that place. He asked the hostler to let me see it, the hostler shewed it to me; the prisoner was in the stable with him, and shewed it to me. I examined it, and brought it to the door - I saw it was an old horse. I told him if he would let me take it to Smithfield market (it being market-day), that was the most<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030035"/>likely place to sell it. He said, he would much rather I would bring a customer to the stable than to take it out. I told him, people would not be at the trouble to come to the stable to see it, horses being so very plentiful. He at last agreed that I should take it to Smithfield; and said, if I got a customer I should have 5s. for my trouble. He came with me into Smithfield, and said, he did not like to be stopping there till I got a customer for it, but if I would name any place, he would go and wait there till I found one. I told him the King's Head was the most genteel place. He went as if he was going there - I do not know whether he did. I got on the horse, and walked it once up and down, when one of the witnesses came up and looked very hard at it while I was on its back. I asked him if he would buy it? he asked if it was my own? I told him it was. He asked if I had bought it? I told him I was authorized by a gentleman to sell it, and it was mine while in my possession. He left me for a minute or two, and then brought Simpson to look at it. I told the young man directly that I would shew him the gentleman who employed me to sell it. One seized me, and the other seized the bridle. I went over, as if I was going to the King's Head, and saw the prisoner walking on the pavement outside the house. I told the young man that was the gentleman who employed me to sell it, and pointed to the prisoner. The young man said he was the person to whom he let the horse to go to Kew that day, and said he would send for an officer. The prisoner pulled out 4s. or 5s., and offered it to him not to send for one. An officer was sent for, and took the prisoner to the Compter. Simpson asked him for the saddle; he said it was at the stable. I took Simpson to the stable where I got the horse from, the saddle was not there-it could not be found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was an old bay gelding, worth about five or six guineas.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired it from the prosecutor, of whom I have had horses before to go to the country, to settle some business in my way. I met the witness, and asked him what it was worth, and I would give him something for his trouble. He seemed anxious for me to tell him to sell it. I wanted to know what it was worth. He rode it about to try it, when the young man came up. I declare I never intended to sell it, I only wanted to know what it would fetch, to tell my friends, as I was going to sell one in the country.</p>

I went out of town for two months, and returned on the 29th of October - I had occasionally lodged there for three years-when I went away I left my boxes in her care. I desired her to take particular care of one of the boxes, which contained linen, and was put in a closet at the top of the house, for safety; she frequently told me that her landlord would not wait for her rent more than ten days. I said if she was in any difficulty she was to let me know, and I would assist her in the payment of her rent, and on no account to suffer the landlord to seize; she said there was no danger of that. When I returned home I asked her if I could have my apartment, she said, Yes. I enquired how she got on, she said, very well. Next morning to my surprise, the constable and the landlord, came and charged her with something, which raised my suspicion; I enquired about my box of plate and linen; she said she had moved it to friend's house for safety. In about half an hour I told her I had found a friend who would let me move my things to his house, which I wished immediately to do; she said I could not have the box of plate and linen, as the person had been put to bed in the house, and it was in her room. I said I must have it. In about half an hour I sent for her son - He is about fourteen years of age-to shew me the house, and told him to bring it down-it appeared, in his hands, very light, as if it was empty. I fetched the key, and found all the plate and linen gone. We took it to his mother's house, and told her it was empty; she said she knew it, but it was all safe. I asked her how that could be, when she gave me a paper with sixteen duplicates. The next morning she desired I would give her that day to redeem them, as she had contrived to get two or three beds out of the house. I asked her if she had taken any thing else, she said she had taken twenty-five books - She gave me three duplicates of them, but said she could not find the rest; she said the box being heavy, the lid had burst open in moving it. The prisoner, Campbell, said that was the truth. On examining the duplicates I found Campbell had pledged some of the things, and Bostock the others. I got two officers and searched her, and found a large bunch of keys upon her; they asked her to shew them the key she opened the box with, which she reluctantly did. They found above sixty duplicates upon her, some of which related to my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. I thought her an honest character. I found she had received 20l. for my things. A gentleman who lodged in the house owed her 40l.</p>

Corbin asked to look at some lace - She went up the shop. While I was showing it the young man said that the other prisoner had stolen a shawl - I took it out of her pocket. Corbin said she was positive it was no such thing, as she was her servant, and had lived seven months with her. I sent for a constable-an officer secured Cotelin, Corbin made her escape. I asked her to walk in till the officer came-she spoke some French to the other woman, and went out. I could not detain her; she did not look at the lace.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN BALDWIN. I am shopman to Mr. Birt. The prisoners came into the shop; Corbin asked for some lace, and Cotelin stepped towards the window - I saw her take a shawl, and put it in her pocket. I told Mr. Birt, who detained her. Corbin said Cotelin had lived some months with her, and was an honest woman. Corbin made her escape out of the shop; she was desired to stop; I went for an officer-as I went out, I saw her walking about; she went up to the door, and spoke some French to Cotelin. When I returned she was gone.</p>

My rooms are over the coach-house and stable - I heard somebody go down my stairs and come up again; they then got a light, and looked at the clock - I saw all this from the yard; they went into my sleeping-room, and then into another room. I saw them in the sleeping-room two or three times; I then gave the alarm; they opened one of my kitchen doors, and ran out - I secured the two prisoners. They looked out at the door above the stable, and ran down - I secured them, and sent for Limbrick, the officer. I examined my premises, and found them in great confusion. My wife had the key of the street - door, she was out - I found they had got in at the stable-door, and up the rack; the stable-door was not locked, I do not know whether it was latched or not. They had forced the kitchen door open-it had been bolted inside before; one of the staples was forced-an instrument was found, with which, I suppose, they did it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. He went out in the morning; about a quarter before six in the evening a knock came at the door, and a person asked if Mrs. Catley lived there? I said, Yes; they said they had melancholy news to tell me, that my husband had fallen off the coach-box, the axle-tree was broke, and he was much hurt, and was taken to St. Bartholemew's hospital. I went up stairs, got my things, and came out. I found another man at the door, who began talking to me about it. I asked him if he was going back to the hospital; he said his mother was a nurse there, and I was to tell her he would be there as early as possible in the morning. When I got to the hospital I found my husband was not there. I returned home as quick as possible. When I got to Union-buildings I saw my husband, he said he was robbed; it was neither of the persons who came to tell me of the accident. When I went out I bolted the kitchen door inside; it was then about a quarter past six, it was quite dark; I had lit a candle, and left it on the stairs. I found a bundle tied up, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, which I had left safe in the drawers when I went out-the kitchen door was forced open.</p>

I found a chissel in Chandler's pocket - I left them in Reid's custody, and went back and found Mrs. Catley there, and the bundle tied up, with a great many things strewed about the rooms; all the drawers were turned out, the kitchen door was broken open, and the staple forced off-the chissel fitted the marks exactly; a candle was close to the bundle, the wick quite soft, as if it was just out.</p>

The prisoner was there, and asked me to drink with him - I refused - He called for my beer himself. About half-past nine o'clock I got up to go to my sister's, in Bainbridge-street, which comes into George street. The prisoner said to a young woman that sat between him and me, "Is that man going home?" - They appeared to be strangers to each other. I pulled out my watch to see what time it was, and got up to go; he and another man followed me out. There are two doors to go out, and while I was opening the first door they passed before me; about twenty or thirty yards from the door they turned back to meet me; the other man pushed me violently against the wall with his elbow, and at that instant the prisoner snatched my watch out of my fob in a moment - He drew it through my hand; I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have robbed me of my watch;" he ran off, the other man came behind me, and pulled my arm and coat; I got away from him, and followed the prisoner up Buckeridge-street; he turned to the left into Carrier's-street, I lost him. I told the watchman, and described the prisoner to him - He had a blue jacket and trowsers on, and a sore mouth. I went home, and was fetched to the watch-house in about an hour, where I saw the prisoner, and knew him to be the man immediately. He was then disguised, he had a smock frock over his blue jacket, and white trowsers-his mouth was sore. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. I was quite sober - I am not used to London-there was a boy, with a violin, in the room.</p>

            . I live in Church-lane, George-street. I am an unfortunate girl. I was in the street, and met the prisoner, and went into the Black Horse to drink with him; I only knew him by sight - We had two pints of beer. The prosecutor came in, and called for a pint of beer, they did not hear him; the prisoner called again for it - He sat over it about an hour; I sat between them. About half-past nine o'clock, the prosecutor went out-the prisoner asked me if that man was gone? I told him he was; he and another young man immediately followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030039"/>him out. I did not know the other man - They had been whispering together about five minutes; the prisoner paid when the liquor was brought. I remained in the public-house about an hour, with some other women. The watchman, patrol, and prosecutor came in about an hour after; he said he had been robbed of his watch by the man who sat by me; they asked if he said any thing to me after the prosecutor went out? I told them that he asked if he was gone, and I said, Yes; I understood he was in custody; I did not see the prisoner again, but I saw him at the office the next morning. He then had a white smock frock and white trowsers on, over his blue jacket and trowsers. When he was setting with me he had a blue jacket and waistcoat, and blue trowsers on. I knew him directly - I have known him by seeing him pass for five or six weeks, but had nothing to do with him; he had a sore mouth that night; I did not observe it before - I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave this account before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN WYATT. I am a patrol of St. Giles's. I received information from some girls, went into George-street, and told the watchman; as we were returning we met the prisoner in the street, and took him to the watchhouse-it was about half an hour after; he was dressed in a smock-frock and trowsers-nothing was found on him - He had a sore lip. The prosecutor came into the watchhouse, and immediately swore to his being the man.</p>

Nothing but the greatest necessity could induce me to come forward to prosecute him. On the 11th of November a stranger came to my house to inquire for a person; he went out, leaving the street - door open-it was about eight o'clock-my daughter went up stairs to fetch something, and found the street - door open; she came down, and said that she suspected that a person was hid in the room behind the bed, as she had seen the curtains move. Two young men, who were in the house, went up, but could find nothing, and concluded that it must have been the wind, as the windows were open. I went all over the house, but could find no person - We were all satisfied, and went to bed. Next morning, about ten o'clock, my daughter went up to the same room for two pieces of poplin and a piece of cotton, and missed them, and two rings from the table. I went up with my wife, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I suspected my son, and got an officer to look for him, but could not find him. We got information, and went to a room between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and found him in bed with another young man in a room - We charged him with the robbery, and desired him to get up. Hackham, the officer, found two duplicates in the room, one of which related to the pearl necklace, and the other to the eight yards of poplin.</p>

I asked him why he did not bring the case with them? he said it was broken, and they would not be left above a day or two with us, and would not hurt. Next morning a person came and claimed them.

               <p>EMMA POTTER. I live with my mother, in Vere-street, Clare-market-my mother sends me on errands; I go to school by myself. My mother sent me for some rolls-when I went out at the door the prisoner was on the opposite side of the way - I crossed over, and went up the street; she followed me up the street and took hold of my hand, then she loosed it, and I went into the baker's. She then took me up in her arms and carried me - She put me down, to walk, in Lincoln's Inn-fields. We went down Portugal-street - she walked me about the Temple. I went through dark passages, and when I had almost got to Blackfriars Bridge, Mr. Gibson took me away from her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you when she first spoke to you - A. She said she would buy me some biscuits, and make me some doll's things.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you not surprised at her taking you by the arm - A. Yes; I said nothing. I am sure the prisoner is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030042"/>woman. I had an old coat and bonnet on-she did not take any thing from me. She did not say where she was going to take me. I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She walked by me, and took hold of my arm. I expected to get the doll's things.</p>
               <p>JAMES GIBSON. I am a cooper, and live in Redcross-street, Borough. I was passing through Temple-bar on the 4th of November, about ten minutes after nine o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner holding the child by the wrist, and walking down Fleet-street - the child resisted as much as possible. She appeared to me to have been crying bitterly. I followed her to the archway, leading to the Temple - She dragged the child down there as far as the Piazza-the child resisted very much, and was very unwilling to go with her. She took it through a passage, down two or three steps, and conversed with it. I heard her say she would buy it some biscuits. She came out of the passage, and turned round to the Piazza again - She went down the passage again, through the steps towards the gardens, and attempted to go through, but it was stopped up; she returned, crossed over, and came on the parade. I followed her into Tudor-street (there is a passage which leads from William-street into Tudor-street)-the child resisted very much there. She had a basket and a napkin in her hand, the napkin fell out on the pavement. I crossed over, and attampted to take the child from the prisoner - She was unwilling to let me have it. I asked her what she was going to do with it? the prisoner said, "D-n you, Sir, what is it to you? she is my niece; she has been disorderly and disobedient, and I shall do what I think proper with her."The child still resisted very much, until it got to the corner of William-street, leading to Blackfriars-bridge. I told a person who was passing that I thought she had stolen the child; with his assistance, I took the child away while he held her. I told her I would give her in charge - She said there was no occasion for that, as she was its aunt, and would go to the parents with me. I asked the child where its friends lived? she said, they lived at No. 15, Vere-street, Clare-market. The prisoner said the child was correct, and she would go with me to its friends. I told her, if she would I should feel satisfied, and if not, I should give her in charge. She was willing to come with me. We returned the same road she came. Just as we came to the passage, with the steps, she attempted to run away. I told her I certainly would see the child to its friends. Mr. Hodson, a solicitor, passing at the time, said he would send an officer, he sent Hutchins - I gave him the child to take home. The prisoner stopped with me until he returned, and said he had found its mother almost distracted. He took her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. No person interfered with me until Hutchins came. I was going into the Borough, and followed her.</p>

               <p>CALEB LUDFORD. I am a watchman. On the 26th of October I was going into a garden to feed a horse, and saw three boys standing by the shop, about a quarter before six o'clock at night; as I returned I saw them again. I went into the garden, and told the people to watch them; while I was talking, I heard the tiles rattle - I ran out, and caught the prisoner, Thompson, coming out of the shop without his hat - I took him to Bailey's. I am sure he is the man, I knew him before. Lecase got away - I am sure he is one of them - He spoke to me as I passed the first time.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COOPER. Mr Bailey and I carried the lead into Mr. Bailey's house-next morning I took Lecase - He denied being there. I found the lead in the gutter, rolled up ready to be taken away.</p>

On Monday, the 17th, I sent Skilling to Pimlico, and Nowland to Lambeth-Camfield remained at home. I told him I was going out, and to have an eye about the premises; I went to the hay-loft, which is over the stable, to watch him; in a short time I saw him take a scraper, and draw out one of the boards from my cutting room-he took a cake of soap, and put the board in its place again, and laid the soap on the hay-loft stairs, and covered it over with hay; he went into the factory, I came down, and put a farthing in the cake, to mark it-there was a mark in it before. He walked up and down the factory for a few minutes-Skilling came in and gave Camfield the money he had received; he then drew out the board again, and handed Skilling three cakes of soap, one by one, Skilling put one cake in his breeches, and the other two between his waistcoat and shirt, and asked Camfield if it made any appearance, he said it did not; he went away, returned in about five minutes, and took three more cakes out; before Skilling returned Camfield took a piece and put it into his own breeches-it was then nine o'clock. Nowland returned from Lambeth, Camfield told him there was a cake of soap laid for him on the stairs-Nowland took it, and put it in his breeches, and all three went to breakfast; I went to Gilmore, who was waiting with me, he stopped Nowland, and took the cake of soap out of his breeches. I gave him in charge. Gillmore brought Camfield in and took a cake out of his breeches. He then went for Skilling, and brought him back - We found no soap on, but made him shew his linen-it was stained with yellow soap.</p>

I took him and Frith into custody; after that, I received information from Bluet, at Tothill-fields; I went to the watch-house to Jarman, and told him I understood he had a 20l. note about him, and asked him to give it to me. He said, he hoped G-d might strike him dead if he had. I said I was sure he had. He declared solemnly that he knew nothing of the 20l. note which was detained in Oxford-street, and that he went there with Bluet to buy a waistcoat accidentally. I found the 20l. concealed in the lining of his hat (No. 13,014). I asked him what he said now? he said he did not know how it came there. I told him I had information of another 20l. note, which was changed on Saturday morning, and asked him where he had changed it? he said he knew nothing of it, for he never received it. I found he had changed it at Mr. Emery's, the Coach and Horses, in Oxford-street - it was No. 13, 016.</p>

             - She said her husband gave it to her. I also found a letter on her from Bluet, directed to Duke's-court. We afterwards took Jarman into custody.</p>
               <p>JOHN EMERY. I keep a public-house in York-street, Westminster. On the 22d of November, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Jarman, came and asked me to give him change for a 20l. note. I asked him if it was his own? he said it was for a friend, who was waiting for it. I gave him nineteen 1l. notes and 20s. in silver, and indorsed his name on it-it was No. 13, 016.</p>

            . After these notes were produced, I asked Thompson what she did with the other? she said she only took three.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAGULY. I am servant to Mr. Dobree, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Oxford-street. On the 22d of November Bluet, and the prisoner, Jarman, came to our shop. Bluet bought a silver watch for 2l. 16s. - Jarman approved of it. Bluet handed me a 20l. note. Jarman told him his father would be angry with him if he gave more than 3l., and said Bluet lived in the neighbourhood. I asked Bluet for his address, he gave me the name of"Burt, Swallow-street." He said he was the son of Mr. Burt, the builder. I pretended to go out for change, and went to Mr. Burt. I returned, and questioned him about it; he then said, he said Bird. I went to Bird in consequence of what he said, and detained him. The note was No. 13,015.</p>

            . I am a constable. A man told me he had information from Ann Frith, where I could find 17l. of the money. I went to No. 78, Peter-street, and found 18l. sewed up in a white gown, which belongs to Thompson.</p>
               <p>HENRY BLUET. I am a bricklayer. On the night of the 21st the prisoner, Thompson, brought me three 20l. notes, which I did not think honestly come by - I formerly lived with her. I gave them to Ann Frith, she took them to Jarman, whom she formerly lived with. Next morning, Frith took me to Jarman's, where the money was produced. Jarman went out and changed one. She took me with her to Oxford-street, and persuaded me to go into Dobrec's to buy the watch. I tendered one of the notes there which Jarman put into my hand, and was detained.</p>

            . I live on Ludgate-hill. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030046"/>16th of November I was in Tower-street, where the prisoner was selling oranges. He offered me four for 6d., then five, at last he said I should have eight - I agreed to take them, and told him I would give him a 1s. 6d. piece, if he would give me 1s.; he said he had no shilling. I gave him 1s., he said he would give me 6d. He turned his back to me; I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and take out a 1s., and put it into his mouth - He gave me the 1s., out of his mouth, and said he had no 6d. - it was a bad 1s., I told him so, and gave it back to him. I gave him 1s. 6d. - he did not return my 1s.; he gave me 2s., one was good, and the other bad. I told him of it, and said I thought he had more bad money about him, and I would have him taken up - He ran away. This was about one o'clock. He gave me a good 1s., and wanted the bad one back, I would not return it. I ran after him, but could not catch him. About three o'clock I saw him in Watling-street; he saw me and ran away. I pursued, and called out, Stop thief! Mr. Hendry came up and secured him. Some money was picked up.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HENDRY. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody - He was running. He took some money out of his pocket and threw it down-it was 1s., a 1s. 6d. piece, and a 6d. - the shilling was bad. I searched him, and found another bad shilling on him.</p>

I called the watchman; we went next door, and found the prisoner. My money was found between the bed and the sacking. There was a Dorking 1l. note, and 15s. in silver. No person but the prisoner was in the room - She denied it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READY. I am a watchman. About one o'clock in the morning I saw the prosecutor. He said he had been robbed at No. 1-the prisoner lodges at No. 2 - I went there, and found her in bed, concealed under the clothes, and between the bed and the sacking I found the money, tied up in her pocket - She claimed the pocket. I took her to the watch-house. Roffey was sober.</p>

On the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the pattens hung in the shop, the four prisoners came in; Pinnion bought a pair of boots, which came to 7s., she paid for them and went out, I immediately missed the pattens and upper-leathers; I got the officer, and about eleven o'clock the next morning I saw them at the office. The prisoner, Ellis, stood with his back to the pattens, and Bowen was close to the leather.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I found the prisoners at the Paviour's Arms, public-house, three doors from Mr. Clarke s house, and secured them. When I went into the tap-room they called out, "here is a ding," which is a signal to throw any thing away. Bowen threw the leathers down, and Franks the pattens. The others came to the office voluntarily, the next morning.</p>

I observed that Mathews had a handkerchief with something in it, under his arm; I asked him what it was, he gave it me with the boots, and said they were his.

He had a bundle, which he threw down, and said, "What will you give me for this?" My wife opened it, and said she would not have it, it would not do for her; he was going away, he had got to the door, and asked if he might leave it till the morning; thinking he might lose it, she gave him leave; he never returned.

Woodroff immediately demanded 2l. of him, or he said he would take the basket back - He put his hand on the basket - I told him to touch it at his peril, as it was mine, and I should keep it; he said he had had a troublesome job, and had got no money - I gave him 1s.</p>

            . I live in Rose-street, St. Luke's. I went with Mrs. Hanmore, to whom the property belonged, to Bow-street. While we were there, a man, named Barnet, brought a bundle, which the prosecutor paid him 2l. for. I went to him, and asked him if he could bring the remainder of the things? he said they were to be got if he had money to fetch them. I told him I would pay him; he went away, and returned in a few minutes, and said, if I would pay the money that they were sold for, he could get them. I went to a house in Drury-lane with him, and told Wilkinson to follow me privately; when we got near the house I told him to wait outside. Barnet introduced me to the prisoner Farthing; it was at a public-house-he was sitting in the back room there; Barnet said, "This is the gentleman that belongs to the shirts;" Farthing then said, he supposed I did not mean to prosecute Bozier; I had not mentioned Bozier's name, I told him two of the shirts belonged to me, and I did not want to be waiting about any longer; he asked me which two were mine? he did not produce any; I told him they were marked E.S.; he asked if it was my intention to return the money they were sold for? I told him I would; he went out with Barnet, and returned in ten minutes, and told me his wife was out, and he could not get them; I said I would wait, if she would return soon; he said he had got but two of them, but an acquaintance, who was a bricklayer, had got the other two. He then said, "I will depend on your word, and if you will take my word, you shall have them to night; and if the two which I have got are not yours, I will get the other two from the person in the evening." I told him if he could not produce them, I should like to have the worth of them, and gave him the address of the owner, in the Strand. He pulled out two 1l. notes, and asked if that would satisfy me as a deposit, that he would produce the two shirts in the evening? I said it would. Just as I got my fingers on the notes he changed his mind, and said he would put them into the hands of the landlady. As he gave them to her he said, whatever the shirts cost, she was to return him the 2l., and pay him for them, which I agreed to. I went out, and gave him in charge to Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He never produced any.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILKINSON. I am a toll-collector. I went with Gallery and Barnet to the Black Dog, in Drury-lane, Farthing asked Gallery if he belonged to the shirts; he said he could get the four shirts for him by paying what had been paid for them; Gallery said he would pay him for them if he would get them. Farthing went out with Barnet-he returned in about ten minutes, and said his wife was out, or he would have got two of the shirts, but the other two he could not get before eight o'clock in the evening, as a bricklayer had got them. Gallery wished to wait while he went back again; Farthing said he would leave 2l.; he pulled out two 1l. notes, and was going to give them to Gallery, but drew them back, and said he would give them to the landlady; he said, he expected when he brought the shirts, he should have the money that was paid for them. I went and told Wilson that the man was there who had the shirts; he went and took him.</p>

            . On the 24th of November Rice gave me information. I went to the Black Dog - I went to the corner of the street, and saw Farthing standing against the door. Wilkinson said he was the man who had left the 2l. I went into the house, and asked the landlady for the money; she said she should know the man who had left it-I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030050"/>brought Farthing in - She said he was the man.

               <p>FARTHING'S Defence. Bozier and another man came to a public-house, in Wild-street, where I live, with a basket and bundle, and some women. On the Monday two men came, and asked if I knew the prisoner? I said I did not; but a man had been to the house with a bundle, and went to Drury-lane to fetch the man; I said I would go and send my wife to see for him - I returned, and said she was not at home, but I could find the man at eight o'clock, and get them.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On the 20th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in Seymour-place; I was informed that thieves were in the house, I ran out, and found the prisoner, Kelly, in the custody of the watchman; I went to the house top, and apprehended the prisoner, Long, coming through the trapdoor, off the roof. He said, "I am one of them, do not hurt me;" the gutters were all ripped up, and part taken away. I found an axe within two yards of the place where I took him. The only way to the roof was getting up the rafters.</p>
               <p>JOHN YOUNG. The prisoners were catching birds in Bryanstone-square, I told them to go away-they would not. When I returned from dinner, I went to Seymour-place, and nailed a rail up, about two o'clock the door was broken open, the staple of the lock drawn, and taken away, no person had been in the ground but the prisoners. The same night I was going along Seymour-place, and the watchman took Kelly.</p>

A little boy told me there was some persons in the house; I found it surrounded by a crowd; I went for my lanthorn, and returned to the house, and found the prisoner, Kelly, quite bloody; he said he came there to ease himself, and somebody had thrown a stone at him, and cut his face. I found the lead cut, in the house-as I returned I found Long was taken; I found an axe there, the head of which was bloody. It is an unfinished house.</p>

I had a gold watch, worth 20l., two seals, worth 4l., and a reading-glass. As soon as I got home I missed them. The ring of the chain had been fastened to the button of my waistcoat. I found the button undone-it must have been taken with great violence. I saw the watch again on the Tuesday after in possession of Creswell, the officer. I saw a man, whom I believe to be Leonard Phillips, near the prisoner, Harriet Phillips; immediately as she left me she went to him.</p>

I told her I could not tell the value without weighing the case. I suspected it had been improperly come by-it was worth 12l. or 15l. I made an excuse that I did not know the value of it, and would go to a neighbour's. She waited in the shop. I got an officer - I detained her till he came, and secured her. I asked how she got it? she said it was in pledge for 1l., and she took it out of pledge, in Barbican, that morning, for a girl of the town.</p>

I went up, and asked

He beckoned to the prisoner - They had some conversation together for a minute - They ran after the two gentlemen, whom I did not know. The boy (who has escaped) drew the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner, who was covering him. He crossed over to the other, and turned towards Covent-garden. I watched to see if they would come back together, which they did, and went towards Drury-lane. I could not go after the gentleman - They laughed together. I saw the prisoner shove something down his coat sleeve; I laid hold of both of them, the other made his escape. I held the prisoner - I was not able to call the gentleman. I took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's coat sleeve.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HARTLAND. I am a private watchman. On the 23rd of November I was in St. James's-market, about half-past six in the morning; I saw the prisoner come out of No. 19, which was uninhabited, with some lead on his shoulder-it was not Sneezum's house; I could not follow him. In about five minutes he returned, and went into the same house; he staid there two or three minutes, and then came out with another load of lead on his shoulder; I seized him, and made him put it down in the passage of No. 19. As I took him to the watch-house he tried to get my stick from me, but could not; he pulled something out of his pocket, and cut me on the head, which bled a great deal; he got from me, I never lost sight of him; Hawskby took him again. I went to the house where the lead was put, and was present when it was compared with the roof of No. 17-it fitted it.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMITHERS. I am a watchman of St. James's parish. I was coming off my beat, a little before seven o'clock on the morning of November 30th, saw the prisoner at the top of Eagle-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief; Hartland was pursuing him-Hawksby laid hold of him-they came to the ground together - He knocked Hawksby down; I went up, and took him; Hartland was about twelve yards from him-his temples bled very much; the blood ran down his cheeks.</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Deboos. I was at the house of call in Castle-court, with Jarvis - I put the goods in the cart - They were in a white bag - I walked home. Between five and six o'clock I saw Jarvis, in Fort-street, the bag was then gone; another bag was cut by somebody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. It was ten minutes after five o'clock, on the 6th of November-it must have been lost between five and six o'clock; the cart got to Fort-street before me.</p>

            , as we are silk-dyers. On the 6th of November, fifty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchief were coming to our house. I endeavoured to trace the property. On the 24th of November I received information, and went to Mrs. Phelps, a silk-dresser, in Osborne-street - she finishes silk after it is dyed. I saw four or five pieces of gauze, and two pieces of handkerchief, which I had reason to believe were part of the goods sent to me by Messrs. Fulton - I expected to receive fifty pieces of gauze, and two pieces of handkerchiefs, from Fulton's - I went to Messrs. Fulton on the day of the robbery, and he gave me ten pieces of the same sort - I compared them - I Judge them to be of the same manufacture; I took Mr. Fulton to see them. On the 25th of November I made enquiry, which led me to the prisoner, Sherwin's, house; I saw him, and told him I had come to make inquiry respecting some gauze which he had dyed, and sent to Mrs. Phillips - He is a dyer; I asked him if he knew of whom he had them? he said he had them from a stranger, whom he did not know; he delivered me an invoice which he had received of the man; I asked him what day it was delivered to him? he said he believed about the 12th of November; the invoice corresponds with the number lost-there is only a quarter of a yard difference in measure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the invoice in a business-like form - A. Certainly not; it ought to have the name to it. It only says-(reads)"50 pieces, 534 yards, 2 pieces of handkerchiefs, 24 yards." In the course of the transaction, I observed thirty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchief at Phillips's, being a deficiency of twenty pieces of gauze. Sherwin having given me this account on that night, the 25th of November, his wife observed, in his presence, that she wished we had been there half an hour sooner, for that the person who brought the goods had been there, and that she expected to see him again about eleven o'clock next morning. My brother, and Armstrong, the officer, accompanied me. I desired Sherwin, that if the person came next morning, to detain him, and send for me; I did not say I should be there. I left that night, and next morning Armstrong, and myself, went there, a little after eleven o'clock, and asked Sherwin's permission to wait there; we staid till after four o'clock, and no person came; about four o'clock he received a two-penny post letter. After reading it, he handed it to me-(reads)-"Mr. Sherwin-In consequence of the hurry of business, I am under the necessity of immediately leaving town for Coventry, and will be obliged to you to get the remainder of the gauzes done, and sent to me, directed to X.Y.Z., to be left at the Craven Arms, Coventry." He having shewn me the letter, I consulted Armstrong, and desired Sherwin to write an answer; he declined answering it himself; an answer was wrote by another person, and read to him; he went for a friend of his to write it-the purport of it was, that he would not deliver the goods for any person but the one they had come from, and that, on the delivery, he expected the money to be paid; it was signed with Sherwin's name, and directed to X.Y.Z., Craven Arms, Coventry. I told Sherwin if he heard from him to let me know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He said he believed he received them on the 12th. He was a silk-dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common for one dyer to send things to another when there is a particular hurry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself said you would have taken the goods coming in the same way - A. No - We always have names delivered with the invoices.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I saw them at Mrs. Phillips's, and believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Is it in the course of business to take fifty pieces at a time without having the customer's name - A. Certainly not; the bill which should have come to me with the goods was signed Fulton and Co.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Sherwin declined answering the letter - A. Yes; and gave as a reason, that the person whom he sent for was in the habit of doing his writing.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Watling-street, and am a wholesale dealer in gauzes and muslins. On the 6th of November a quantity of articles were sent from my house to Messrs. Deboos; a bill was sent with them, with our names to it, dated November 6th. I went with Mr. Deboos to Phillips's house, on the 24th or 25th of November, and saw thirty pieces of black-striped gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs - They had been dyed after they left my house. I have not a doubt of their being my property, and part of the goods I sent to Messrs. Deboos.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I had not sent any goods elsewhere-Sherwin was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. I have the thirty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs, which were delivered to me at the office by Mr. Robinson. I was at Sherwin's with Mr. Deboos, on the 24th or 25th of November.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030056"/>WILLIAM ROBINSON. I am servant to Harriet Phelps, who is a silk-dyer, and live in Ormond-place, Whitechapel. I gave Armstrong the gauze on the 2d of December - They were brought to me by the prisoner, Sherwin's, wife; sixteen pieces of the gauze were brought on or about the 17th of November. When I fetched them down to dress, I suspected they might be part of the silk Mr. Deboos had lost; I immediately gave him notice of it; he came, and saw them; I had only sixteen pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs. We settled that if any more came I should let him know. Next day, about five o'clock, Sherwin's wife brought the remainder, making in all thirty pieces. I informed Mr. Deboos; he, and Mr. Fulton, came and examined them; before that, I had received ten pieces from Mrs. Sherwin, of the same kind exactly, which were returned on the 21st of November, and would make forty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs. I returned them as I dressed them; his wife brought them, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. FULTON re-examined. The dyer does not get the goods dressed - We send them to be dressed ourselves.</p>
               <p>MR. DEBOOS re-examined. It is not customary for the dyer to get them dressed; I never knew an instance of the kind, not even in goods that are sent from the country.</p>

            , JUN. I was in the service of the prisoner Brown, who is a silk-weaver; my mother lives in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields; I live in Brown's house, No. 6, George-street, Bethnal-green. On the 26th of November last he gave me a bag, which he said contained worsted, to take to my mother; I took it, and left it by her bedside; I did not know what was in it. I left it there; my mother was in the room at the time. He told me to leave it there, and call for it by-and-by.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have lived one year with him. I used frequently to carry things to the dyers. My mother was taken up after I took the bag there; I saw her before she was taken up, at my brother's, in Air-street, but I did not tell her I had put it there. I told her I was going to take some worsted to the dyer's and would leave it there, and call for it by-and-by.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you say one word before the magistrate about the bag containing worsted; did you not say your master told you to take it to the dyer's, without saying what it contained - A. I do not recollect it; I swear that he said it was worsted - He never mentioned any dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by telling the magistrate that you meant to take it to Walker's, as you knew he was your master's dyer - A. I know I said so, but my master said nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell your mother you would get her out of the mess, and get Brown in - A. No. I am positive he said the bag contained worsted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You lived with Brown until the 26th of November - A. Yes; he went out of town for a week to see his brother, about three-months before this. If he had gone to Coventry I must have known it.</p>
               <p>FRANCES PAYTON, SEN. I am the mother of the last witness - I am a widow; she lived servant with the prisoner Brown. On the Wednesday before the Friday that I was taken up, about twelve o'clock, she came to my room with a bag-about half-past nine o'clock at night, I found it by my bedside; my other daughter came in, I shewed her the bag; she brought Mrs. Gable into the room - We opened it; it contained twenty pieces of black and striped gauze. Next morning the prisoner, Brown, called at my house about nine o'clock, and asked if Fanny had brought any thing to our house. I told him she had not, but I had found a bag behind my bed. Mrs. Gable came out, and said there were gauzes in the bag. Brown said she seemed to know more about it than he did, for he had it as worsted. Nothing more passed. I had orders from a man whom I had seen at Brown's more than once, to take it from my room. I had orders from Brown himself to take the bag from my house to Bishopsgate-street; I did so about half-past twelve o'clock on Thursday, the day after they were left. I met Brown in the street, and gave him the bag. I was apprehended for stealing them and discharged, and told all I knew about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you tell the magistrate one word about meeting Brown in Bishopsgate-street - A. Yes; and that he took the bag from me; my daughter told me she was going to Walker's, the dyer, with the worsted, and that her master ordered her. I did not find the bag until I went to bed at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate another person came for the bag, and not Brown - A. I was so alarmed that I hardly knew what I said; I am sure he took it from me in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

            , between ten and eleven o'clock, and was shown the bag, which contained twenty pieces of striped silk gauze. I was in the room next morning, and saw Brown come in about half-past nine o'clock - I knew him before; he asked for the bag of worsted which Fanny had left. She said, she did not know that Fanny had left any bag, but there was a bag, and she did not know to whom it belonged-Brown had got the bag on a chair when I went in. I told him, if it was worsted there was no such thing there, and he had no right to take it away without an officer. He said, I seemed to know more about what was in the bag than he did, and he would go and fetch the man who gave it to him. He left it there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Before he left, did you tell him what you thought about it - A. Yes, I told him I thought they were stolen goods. He said, he would find the man who gave it to him. He asked Payton who else had seen the bag? she said the neighbours in the next room had. I said my husband and son had seen it. He asked how old my son was? I told him he was twenty-six years old. The same day I saw Mrs. Payton take the bag away.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Wells-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner, Brown, is my brother-in-law. On the 6th of November, when the Princess Charlotte died, at twelve o'clock that day I saw him at his house in George-street, Bethnal-green, which is three or four minutes' walk from my house. George-street is about ten minutes' walk from Fort-street; if a person walks fast they may go there in less than ten minutes. I saw him again about a quarter after four o'clock, he came to my house alone, and waited there till a quarter before six; he was in my house all the while - He was never out of my sight long enough to go to Fort-street and back again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. He came about a quarter after four o'clock - I looked at the clock soon after he went away, it was six by my clock.

            . I live with Thomas Picard. The prisoner, Brown, came there about four o'clock, or a quarter after, on the day that the Princess died, and staid till about five minutes after six. I do not think he was out of the house between those times. The first time that I knew it would be of consequence to know the time was the Monday after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. The house is about five minutes' walk from Fort-street. There were only my uncle, the apprentice, and myself at tea-Brown drank tea with us. After tea I went to Mrs. Lamthois's room. Brown gave me some silk to look at. I have never heard the time that the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to this moment, you never heard the time - A. I have heard it was between five and six o'clock; but there were so many stories about it, I paid no attention to them. I heard of it the day he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long after this day did you hear of his being taken - A. I do not know - I should think it more than a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BROWN. Q. Do you remember that there was a newspaper on the table at tea, and you read it - A. Yes, I believe it was the Daily Advertiser-it was the morning paper of the day before.</p>
               <p>ABIAH BUTFOY. I am a gold and silver lace weaver, and live in Mr. Picard's house. I was at work in my room on the 6th of November, the prisoner, Brown, came there, the first time, about twelve o'clock; he went away, and came again at four o'clock, and staid there about an hour and a half. I saw him talking in Mrs. Lamthois's room - I do not know when he left the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure I saw him there at twelve o'clock that day, at Mr. Picard's house. He could not have been anywhere else at twelve o'clock. I think that he left it about half-past five. When he came at twelve o'clock, he was talking with Thomas Picard about the death of the Princess. Brown was taken up four or five days after.</p>
               <p>ELIZA LAMTHOIS. I have an apartment in Thomas Picard's house. The prisoner, Brown, married my sister, and was in the habit of frequently coming to the house. On the 6th of November he was there about four o'clock - He had been there about two o'clock before. Picard went out about twelve o'clock, saying he was going to Brown's. The prisoner, Brown, first came at two o'clock; Butfoy was at home.

               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I live in Welclose-square. I formerly kept the <placeName id="t18171203-156-crimeloc849">Crown and Thistle, public-house, Manor-row, Tower-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18171203-156-crimeloc849" type="placeName"

On the 11th of October, I moved from there and left the several things in the house, which I saw safe on the 1st of November. On the 4th of November, I had information, went there, and found the articles stated in the indictment gone. I went into the yard, and traced the copper, by the soot, over into the prisoner's yard, which is next door. They had entered by the back of the house-the goods were taken from the back-door-the soot had fallen from the copper. I got a warrant, and went to the prisoner's house, about four o'clock, and found all the things there. The copper, funnel, and cask, were in the chimney-place of his medicine shop, and covered with a board; the rest of the things were in his cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The prisoner was not present when I searched.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I went with Martin, he has spoken correctly. The cellar-door was shut, and a chair put against it.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CAIMES. I live next door to the prisoner; there is only a wooden partition, half an inch thick, between our two houses-there are holes in the partition which enable me to see through. On the 3d of November, about a quarter after nine o'clock at night, I heard a bustle in the prisoner's house; I looked through a hole, and saw something very large and black brought in in a hurry, and put in the chimney-place in the shop. I heard the prisoner call out to shut up the shop, which was done in a great hurry. About ten o'clock I had occasion to go to the door; a man went and tapped at the door, the prisoner and his wife came and asked who was there; the prisoner said he must go and get a pint of beer, and come in presently; the man said he had no money; the door opened, and, I believe, somebody gave him some - He went away, and did not return until ten o'clock. I was disturbed again about four o'clock in the morning-the noise appeared to be at the back of the house.</p>

About half-past six o'clock the prisoner came down stairs, and went into the yard; he went through the room where the things were-he did not return - He must have got over the wall. I went out to seek him, about half-past nine, at the Two Brewers, public-house; he said he knew nothing of them. Nobody but himself could have been there. I saw them safe just before he left.</p>
