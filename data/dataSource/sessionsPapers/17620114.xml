            . On St. Thomas's Day, in the morning, there was a fire in Thames-street. I, living near it, was obliged to move my goods. I sent for Mr. Wright to assist me. I, in the hurry, throw'd many things down stairs, and they were carried away to Mr. Wright's house; but I cannot tell by whom. When I had taken them back again, I missed several things. I mentioned it to Mr. Wright. The prisoner was his <rs id="t17620114-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">servant</rs>

So they sent for me; and I went, and found one cap, a blue and white handkerchief, and a pair of sleeves of mine. She down on her knees, and declared, she knew nothing of them, as she should answer it to God. A friend of mine said, if she would discover were the rest of the things were, she should get free.</p>

            . On St. Thomas's Day, in the morning. I was called out of bed when the fire was at Mr. Pain's, the Sugar Baker's, who lives over-against the prosecutrix. There were a parcel of things tied up; and the prosecutrix was running about like a mad woman. I took some things from her, and put them up in some bedding (it was a parcel of clean linen), and gave it to a porter to carry to my house, and walked behind him home. They were carried back again on the Tuesday following. The prisoner was servant to me. There were some words betwixt her and my wife, and she was going away. She desired my wife to look into her bundle. She did, and thought some of them did not belong to her. So Mrs. Townley was sent for; who found two caps, two pair of sleeves, a muslin handkerchief, and a blue and white one; which she owned as her property. Some were found upon her, and the rest were in her bundle. The prisoner at first said she found the things upon the stairs, and at the dining-room door, in my house. I asked her, how she could be so cruel as to steal things that were saved out of the flames, seeing our house might be in the same condition in a few minutes? She down on her knees, and denied knowing any thing of the matter; but when she found she was detected, she told where the rest of the things were; and they were found accordingly in her sister's room in Plumptree-court.</p>

               <p>Edward Hickin. I let the prisoner at the bar a ready-furnished lodging about a year and a half ago. The things mentioned in the indictment were part of the furniture. I missed them all out of the lodging-room, but never heard of them again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to miss them?</p>
               <p>Hickin. The prisoner's wife was such a drunken extravagant woman I thought she spent more than her husband could bring in. So I went into the room on the 11th of November, and found they were gone. Then the prisoner and she went away. He came again on the 12th, and wanted to make a debt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not offer you, before I went away, that, if my wife would not tell where she had pawned the goods, I would make you satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Hickin. He did; but then I thought I should be never the nearer; for his wife spent his money as fast as he could get it, and it was impossible for him to get out of debt, or pay me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two people to his character; who had known him 15 years, and gave him the character of an industrious honest man.</p>

They were asked into the cabbin, and drank a mug or two of slip; I left them in the cabbin, and went upon deck to take the marks and numbers of the tobacco. Nothing material happened that day.

I happened to go and fit upon a chest at the steerage; somebody knocked at the hatch; Wright was at the opposite hatch. He said, Take hold, Pitt. He took hold and lifted up one end of the hatch, that is, one half of it; up started Mr. Scott, with some hands of tobacco in his hands, holding them by his sides. I said, Scott, what is all this? what are you going to do now? He turned about, and said, D - n you, don't you think the men that brought you coals must not have a bit of tobacco. I said, I do not like these proceedings; I went to take the marks, and left Scott and Wright in the steerage. After the labourers had left work,

I went out and called Scott, but he did not answer. He and Wright came on board about 11 o'clock; they went to bed. I made up my bed in the boatswain's cabbin, there I found two slips of tobacco. The next morning the mate found the fore-hatch was broke open; I was called up; there was upwards of 40 pounds weight of tobacco missing; I taxed Mr. Scott pretty much with it; he said he knew nothing of the matter, and went on shore, and

             came on board. Scott at last did own to me, that he and Wright did carry a little tobacco on shore, and sold it; and said, Hold your tongue, Wright has got six shillings for you. I said, I know nothing of your affairs, I have no business with it. Scott said to Wright. Have you got any silver? Wright said, Yes, he believed he had: Because, said he, give Pitt six shillings. I said to them, If you have done any thing of this sort, be it to yourselves; I am surprized you should run the hazard of my bread and your own too?</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Pitt. This was on Saturday the 19th. Scott was taken up by a Warrant, and examined about some Indico. On the Tuesday morning two little boys, that were come from the Foundling Hospital, were in bed, one was telling the other what he had heard. Mr. Wright sprang out of bed, and came to me, and said, Pitt, what did you hear the boys say? They said, the captain and officer had been talking of taking up one other officer out of the ship. I said I can't tell what you must do, I would not be in your case for 500 l. He said, I have a good mind to go home. About two or three hours after, he seemed to be very uneasy, and said, One thing vexed him more than all the rest, and that was, that Scott saw him take the money for the tobacco. I said, You li e intirely under Scott's lash, and it will certainly come upon you. I asked him who bought the tobacco of him? He said, Darby Kerwick (I never saw the man). I said, As soon as he is taken, he will declare against you. He said, Kerwick is far enough out of the way.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wright say he had taken any tobacco out of the ship.</p>
               <p>Pitt. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether Mr. Pitt did not know of my going from the ship that day about four o'clock?</p>
               <p>Pitt. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went on shore about four, with the captain's servant and boy, and never returned till between seven and eight the next morning; and when I returned, they told me the hatches had been broke open; they never were locked but one night before that.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. When I came on board, I saw nobody but the evidence Mr. Pitt. I said, Where are your partners? Said he, There are Wright and Scott on the deck, and one is on board the lighter. Then he went on the deck, and called Scott. Then I asked for a light, and looked at the hatches, and saw them bolted, locked, and secure. I said, Keep a good look-out, for I am afraid something will happen. Then I went about my business.</p>

About a week or a little more after, I was sent for to justice Welch's; there was the boy, and my watch produced to me; it was delivered to Mr. Clarage.</p>

I visited him once a day, and was with him the night he died. That very night there was a discovery made by my brother, in regard to one of the ostlers purchasing a quantity of silver buttons of the boy at the bar. I examined the boy; he stood it out with great resolution, but at last confessed to me he had stole the silver buttons. Then I taxed him with the watch; he strenuously denied knowing any thing of it. He was as pretty behaved a boy as ever I knew, and was reputed as honest; he was much esteemed by a society that belonged to my father's house. After my father was buried, I took him to justice Welch's: Mr. Welch examined him a great while; he strenuously denied knowing any thing of the watch. Mr. Welch, having much business to do, desired me to take him into the yard, and see what I could do with him. There the prisoner, to my great surprize, told me he had it then in his pocket, with two handkerchiefs over it, where it was found. Then I went in and told the justice. Then we went to work to find out who put him on to do this. He never would confess any thing of that sort, The ostler who bought the buttons of him is absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the boy at the bar?</p>
               <p>Clarage. He is about 11 years age. I have a great regard for him on the account of his tender age: He was a very quite, pretty, active boy, but there are many aggravating circumstances in this affair?</p>
               <p>Court. Who set you on to do this wicked action? It will be better for you to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Nobody set me on.</p>

The prisoner lodged in my house about 10 months; he came in on the 3 d of November, about one o'clock in the day, and went up into his own room; my wife and I were coming to the other end of the town, but my wife returned back again a little before four o'clock, and I returned between seven and eight. She found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140006"/> window open. She told me somebody had been getting in at the window, and my money was gone; that was 13 guineas in a purse which lay in a chest in my bed-chamber; there were a pair of silver buckles lying on the purse, that were not taken away; nor my watch, that lay on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your purse last?</p>
               <p>Featherby. I had seen it there about 9 o'clock that morning: my bed chamber is up one pair of stairs; I left the prisoner alone in the house when we went out, he could let himself out. He came home about 9 o'clock. I asked him if he had taken my purse and money? He denied it. I turned him out of my lodging directly; I took him before justice Fielding; then we were to have another hearing. When we went there again, he still denied it. Mr. Fielding said I could not make plain proof against him, and he advised me to let him go. I did; on the 28th of November I was going up stairs, I imagined he might have hid the money somewhere in the house, as he had left his cloaths here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave his cloaths behind him?</p>
               <p>Featherby. I don't know; he owed me sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did he leave?</p>
               <p>Featherby. Two frocks, a pair of breeches, five or six pair of shoes, and a gun; they were in the garret where he lay. I searched his frock, and found a hole in the pocket, and in the corner of the bottom of the lining I found my purse which my money was in [Producing a green silk purse.] This is it. Then I went to Hicks's Hall, and shewed it before the grand jury. They asked me what I knew it by? I said, by a bit of hatband that I had tied upon it about a year ago. I got a certificate of his indictment, and took him up again; and took him before Mr. Fielding, and he committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner you had found the purse in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No, I did not; he was threatening to kill me, and I don't know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak of it to him since?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your money?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No, not a farthing. When I told him I suspected him by his not taking the watch and buckles; he said, They can be sworn to, and money cannot.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your chest locked?</p>
               <p>Featherby. I think it was, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your room-door locked?</p>
               <p>Featherby. There is no lock upon the door?</p>
               <p>Q. If a person could go in at that window which was found open, is there a way up to your bed-chamber?</p>
               <p>Featherby. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner go out of the house without going out at the window?</p>
               <p>Featherby. We locked the door, and he could let himself out.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he have taken these things away, had he paid the 16 shillings?</p>
               <p>Featherby. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first declared that you had been robbed, did not you declare you had no suspicion of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No, never in my life. I told all the neighbours that he must have it, and nobody else; nobody would go in at that window at that time of the day?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come to your house for his cloaths before the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Featherby. He did; and I said to my wife, It is to no purpose to keep his cloaths, and bid her fetch down his great coat and hat, and what he wanted, and gave him them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for the other things?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No, he asked for his working cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any-body with you when you found the purse?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner ever heard that you found the purse in the lining of his coat, before this minute?</p>
               <p>Featherby. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner has not been in your house, where he has had an opportunity of taking money?</p>
               <p>Featherby. He has, but we were generally in the house.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ever since he was born. The prosecutrix beat, cut, and haggled him; then he took a copy of a writ against her. I told him she would get the better of him; then she took a warrant for him, my husband and other neighbours bailed him. In less than seven days after that, she got another man to take another warrant against him, but he had no money to see a lawyer. When he was in gaol, a poor man went with a bit of victuals to him; she took that man up, and swore a robbery against him. I believe the prisoner is as honest a lad as ever was; he lodged with me three weeks, I have trusted him with pounds; he has been come from Ireland but about three years.</p>

There was a great company of lodgers there, they made game of him; he laid hold of the fire-shovel, and was running after some of them; and some of them took hold of the shovel, and took it out of his hand. The prosecutrix desired him to go about his business, and not to make a disturbance. He took up the scraping shovel, and a man took it out of his hand, he did not take it out of the house; I do not think Ann<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140008"/> Hardy was present at the time.

            . The prisoner lived in the garret. My wife gave her leave to warm herself by the fire. She missed a pair of stays, and could suspect nobody else. She asked her if she had taken them. She confessed she had, and had pawned them; but could not tell where. We found, by enquiry, she had pawned them, and that she had taken them out and sold them. The woman was subpaena'd by a wrong name, and is not here. After we had found them, the prisoner owned she had sold them for seven shillings, She likewise confessed the same before the justice.</p>

            . I am book keeper to Mrs. Foster at the George-inn on Snow-hill, and the waggons that came in there. On the 31st Dec. between the hours of twelve and one in the day. One of our porters came to me in the house, and asked me if I had delivered a truss that was in the yard for Honeybone and Biggs at Blanford in Doisetshire: It was 15 yards of blue duffel cloath, sewed up together. Then he said has Gibbs [that is another porter] been here? I said, no. Then he said, the truss is stole. There is a person in a blue surtout coat, and a snuff-coloured or brown coat under it, with a cut wig, and his hat cock'd up, has got it under his arm, and is turned on the left hand up Snow-hill. I ran towards Newgate, but happened to go the wrong way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the truss taken from?</p>
               <p>Pitt. It was under a shed, what we call a warehouse; it is a place where we flow goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your warehouse under lock and key?</p>
               <p>Pitt. We have four other warehouses under lock and key; but this is not, only by night, when the gates are shut. I was called back, when the two prisoners were in custody. I went and saw them at the Bull-head, at the corner of St. John's-street, in Smithfield. The constable was charged with them, and the goods were in the same room. Lacy, the porter that gave me the first account that the truss was taken away, came to the alehouse door. I asked him, if he should know the man again if he saw him. He said, yes. He came up to Nathan, and clap'd his stick to his stick, and said, you are the man that I saw with the truss under your arm. Nathan said he did not know the place. At the Bull-head, they said they did not know one another; but before my lord mayor, when he asked Nathan his name, Moses immediately said, it is

            . This truss of cloth was in Mrs. Foster's warehouse the last day of the old year, in a place in the yard where we stow goods, it is a shed. My fellow servant went to dinner, and I to the barber's in the passage, within two doors of our gate. As I was coming out again, I met the prisoner Nathan in the passage, with the truss under his arm. I looked very hard at him. He turned about two or three times between that and the end of the passage. I began to suspect him. I observed him to turn up Snow-hill. I made haste into the house, and asked Mr. Pitt, if he had delivered that truss to any body. He said, no. I described the man, and desired him to run as hard as he could towards Newgate after him; then I told Mr. Gibbs of it, and desired him run towards Smithfield. I was lame at that time to with the rheumatism in my feet, and could not run. I went as far as the cock alehouse on Snow-hill, and Gibbs soon came back, and said he had secured the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140009"/> man. I went to the Bull-head, at the corner of St. John's-street; the house was full of people. I went to Nathan, and said, that is the young man I saw with the truss. He said, I do not know you, nor the place neither. They were taken to the mansion-house. The defence they made before my lord mayor was, that a person dropt the truss, and they pick'd it up to keep it for the right owner.</p>

            . This day fortnight, I went for a pot of beer to the tap-house. I saw the two prisoners in the yard, at the George on Snow-hill. Nathan was stooping down to rub his shoes on some straw, the other had got an old cloath's bag under his arm. Presently after, Lacy called me, and said, have you delivered the truss to any body? I said, no. Then he said it was stole; he had just met a man with a blue surtout coat, and a snuff-coloured coat under it, with it, and that he had sent Mr. Pitt after him towards Newgate, and he bid me go towards Smithfield. I went up Cow-lane; and having seen them before, I looked round, and saw them much about the Hen and Chickens in Smithfield. I watched them till they turned the corner beyond Cloth-fair, till they came to Long-lane. When they passed that, I crossed the fields and made up to them; they we at the second coach that stood at the corner. Jacob had got the truss in the old cloaths bag, and had put it into the hackney coach, and was going to get in. I said hold of the bag with my right hand, and him with my left; he loosed my hold, and went away. Then I laid hold of Nathan with my left hand, and called out, stop thief. Nathan was soon taken near the Boar's-head tavern; then we took them and the truss into the Bull-head at the corner of St. John's-street. I went for a constable, and gave him charge of them. I asked them, when I first took them, what they had to do with that truss? Nathan said, he knew nothing of it, and said he did not belong to the other man. Before the lord mayor, they said there was a person coming by them as they were going through the yard, and as the man ran he dropt the truss, and they pick'd it up. [The truss produced in court, and deposed to by three witnesses].</p>

               <p>The George-yard is a thoroughfare. As I was going through there came a man running down as fast as he could; whether he was afraid of any thing I cannot tell: he dropt the bundle, and I took it up. This man [pointing to Lacy] looked at me. I was going to advertise it. I did not say, I did not know that man [ pointing to Jacob]. When the man came, he said he had paid 10 l. for things lost out of the inn-yard; and came in making a noise.</p>

I shewed her a drawer full. She took one piece, and concealed it under her apron in her left hand. She saw my colour change I suppose; then she offered me an orange, and shook me by the hand. Then she took up two pieces more, one of which she concealed in the palm of her hand, and dropt it out of her right hand into her left. Then she said she did not like the ribbons, and went to go out of the shop. I threw myself upon the counter, and took hold of her, and pull'd her in, and said, what are you going to do with these pieces of ribbon. She said she thought no harm; we were made to forgive and be forgiven. Presently her mistress came in, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140010"/> we were only humming her.

He was sent to the marshalsea, and the next morning examined before the board. Some of them had read an advertisement, and said the prisoner answered the description in it of a person that had robbed Governor Pownall of a dressing-box. Then the prisoner told me, he would tell where the box was. I went with him; he took me to the Ship, and there it was produced.

               <p>I had been at Clare-market. I was coming home, and met a woman in Peter-street at a door, with a candle in her hand. I was very much in liquor. She desired me to hold the candle while she went up stairs. I did, and I staid several minutes there. She desired me to hold the things in my lap; but, she not coming again according to her promise I went to her lodgings, and came down stairs again with the shirt in my lap to see if I could find the woman that owned the things. The men laid hold of me, and said I had been robbing them. I said I was not guilty of any such thing. I delivered up the things directly. I never was up in the room in my life.</p>

I put it into my pocket, and washed my hands, and, going down stairs, I was called in by my master.

            . On the 29th of December I was asleep, I cannot tell where, and my silver buckles were in my shoes, and the other in my bricks when I went to sleep, and when I awaked they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a house?</p>
               <p>Koren. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bedfellow?</p>
               <p>Koren. A girl met me, and we went into a house, and went to-bed together; I put my bricks under the pillow, and when I awaked, they were lying by the fire-side; I did not find my buckles, so I go away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your bedfellow?</p>
               <p>Koren. She was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Koren. No.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody by virtue of a warrant from Justice Berry. The buckles were delivered to me. The prosecutor told me he delivered the watch to her to keep for him [The buckles produced in court, and deposed to.] She had sold the buckles to a silversmith, and the prosecutor's landlady went and redeemed them again; her name is Mayfield.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayfield. The prosecutor had been about a week from Norway, he told me he lost his way coming home, and he gave his watch to a woman to keep for him; and he had been lying with a girl; and when he came home, he had no buckles in his shoes and breeches, this was on the 30th of December. He lodged at my house at the Black Boy and Star, New Gravel Lane. I went and found the prisoner (she had delivered him his watch again). I taxed her with taking his buckles. She said she did not take them, but she could go and fetch them. I went with her to the silversmith, where she had sold them for 13 s. and I gave him 15 s. for them again; he lives at the corner of Tower-hill; then I delivered them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayfield. She lives in Church-lane; I do not think she is the owner of the house, neither do I believe she took the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayfield. Because there were many bad people in the house when I went in; and she said she was sent by one

            . The prisoner came in at our house 9 at night; he had a pint of beer, and three halfpeny worth of bread and cheese was all he had. He went away between four and five in the morning, and never paid for his beer and bread and cheese. I saw him go out, but a chairman told me he had got something under his coat. I went out, and took him about six or seven yards from the door. with the tankard upon him [Produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he carry the tankard?</p>
               <p>Davis. He had his hand through the folds of his coat, and the tankard under the coat in his hand. I asked him why he went away with the tankard in that manner? he said, he was going to fetch some water; he would not deliver it to me till I called Stop thief, then assistance came.</p>

I came from Ireland, and have not been here long; I am but 35 years of age.</p>

I sat on that side next to Bedford-house; he rather presented it at first towards my kinsman, but he did to us all by turns; he said, Your money, your watches, quick, quick, gentlemen, or I'll blow your brains out. I gave him half a guinea and 18 d. He said, More money, your watches, your money, or I'll blow your brains out. I said, You fool, you cannot kill the whole company, you fright the women; here is mine, and gave him my watch; my kinsman gave him 4 s. 6 d. or 5 s. 6 d. and my wife threw a few half-pence into his hand; my watch was a metal watch, with a gold dial-plate, in a shagreen case, it wound up in the dial-plate; then he went off.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Kidgell. There was a foulness or a mist gathered that evening, it was very hazy. As he went off, I saw him padding along the road: I sent a description of my watch to Sir John Fielding, and so I came by the knowledge of it again; the prisoner was taken up on another account.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are your wife and kinsman?</p>
               <p>Kidgell. My wife is sick in bed, and my kinsman could not swear to the prisoner when he saw him at justice Fielding's.</p>

Before the justice, Mr. Carr produced the watch, and gave the same account as now. I heard Sir John ask the prisoner if he knew Mr. Carr? he said, he did. Sir John asked him, if Mr. Carr ever had a watch of him? he answered, No. Said Sir John, No! did you never sell him one? he said, No. Did you never give him one? No. Then Mr. Carr was called into the room, and said, he had that watch of Mr. Harris. Then Sir John said to Harris, Why do you deny it? Harris turned it off, and said, you never asked me if I lent it him. Sir John asked him how he came by that watch? he said, he took it in part of payment for a suit of cloaths, of one James, that was gone abroad.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell the plain honest truth, how he came to cut his hair off?</p>
               <p>Tremlet. He was in my shop to have his hair dressed; he told me he was lately got into business for himself. I told him I thought it did not look creditable to a tradesman to wear his own hair, it looked like a gentleman's servant. He said, he should have no objection to cut off his hair, in case a person that cut it off wanted any thing in his way. I said, I had as lieve have part in cloaths, was I do make him some wigs, as not; and on that condition I cut off his hair, and made him two wigs, and he made me a suit of cloaths, and I paid him the balance. I never had any acquaintance with him before, I had seen him at a relation's house of his.</p>

               <p>Last August a gentleman, an acquaintance of mine, met me going to Chelsea; he desired me to steplin at the Cannon, just beyond Buckingham Gate, and drink a glass of wine. I did. He asked me what business I was? I said, A taylor, and I land at Mr. Clackston's. Said he, I want a sut of cloaths, and was going abroad. I told him I was just beginning for myself. He called upon me and I measured him for a coat and waistcoat, the waistcoat trimmed with silver. I made them; he called and put them on, and liked them very well. They came to 8 l. 10 s. He said, I am very sorry I have been disappointed of a bill I was to have received. I said, I am verry sorry, because I do not know much of you. Said he, I have brought two watches, and I'll leave them with you till I pay you the remainder of the money. He had the cloaths on his back, and I was obliged to take them for my security. Some time after that I saw those two watches advertised as stolen on the highway. I went to Mr. Carr, and told him. I had received two watches of a gentleman, and would leave one of them with him, because I was going into the country. He said, if he liked it, he would pay me for it, I said, If you liked it, you shall have it at the same price I gave for it. I said, As for the man I had it of, he would never come again; I had seen him advertised, and I thought him to be a villain; when I came to town, the first day I saw Mr. Carr, he said, you know I have a watch of yours? I said, how does it go? said he, Very well. Said I, Do you chuse to have it? if not, you will do it no harm to keep it in your pocket. I said, If the man comes, I do intend to stop him, for I saw the watch advertised.</p>

               <p>Q. to Carr. Did he declare any thing to you at that time about this watch being advertised?</p>
               <p>Carr. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention that he had two watches?</p>

               <p>Vincent Durand. About the 12th of August, I was returning from Sadler's Wells in a little light cart. I was going home to Hamersmith, and had my wife and two other women with me.

               <p>Q. How many horses had you in the cart?</p>
               <p>Durand. But one. I drove him. The man presented a pistol to me with a very bright barrel. I gave him upwards of 10 s. He swore d - m you. you have more, and demanded my watch. I gave him a silver watch, with a black shagreen case, and a black leather string.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was he?</p>
               <p>Durand. I cannot say. I think he had a blue coat on, and his own hair, which looked to be of a dark colour, and seemed to be tied up behind. The moon shone in my face. I went to Mr. Fielding the next day, and described the watch. He sent for me the other day, and gave me orders to go to a pawnbroker's in St.Martin's-lane: there I saw the watch. I was at Mr. Fielding's; but not present when the prisoner was charged with this robbery.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; I have known the prisoner seven or eight months. I live in St. Martin's-lane. On Saturday morning, the 15th of August, about nine o'clock, the prisoner at the bar brought this silver watch, and pawned it with me. He asked a guinea and half: I lent him 27 s. on it. He said he had it from a man who was going abroad, in part of payment for cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he then his own hair or a wig?</p>
               <p>Hance. He had his own dark-brown hair. [The watch produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor, and what he was robb'd of the 12th of August, having had it about thirty years].</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch advertised?</p>
               <p>Hance. I was told it was advertised on the 14th of August; but that was after I had taken it in. I was present at the justice's when the watch was shewn to the prisoner. He said, that he neither knew it nor me. Sir John asked me, if I knew the prisoner. I said I did, and pick'd him out from others. I had seen him several times before he pawned the watch; he was a customer.</p>

            . I came from Margate in Kent, on the 28th of August last, in my own chaise. I got to Westminster-bridge about eight in the evening; my last stage was from Dartford. I had a trunk behind the chaise, in which was a gown and cassock, my licence for orders, an India bond for 100 l. it was No B, 17, 393. there would have been two years interest due upon it next March; there were five or six bank notes, two of 20 l. one of 30 l. one of 25 l. and one of 50 l. - 145 l. in the whole, that of 30 l. was dated the 21st of June 1760, No 114, payable to myself; that of 25 l. the 14th of January 1761, No 406; there was another dated the 14th of February 1761, No B. 241; there was another, No 457, payable to myself, for 20 l. that is paid in the bank; this was delivered to me by a secretary of the bank; a fifth was for 20 l. payable to myself, but I do not know the number of that:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140016"/> there were also two lottery tickets; one No 30,098. and the other 30,066, each for this year; a gold case of a watch, a gold ring set with diamonds, a snuff-box, a pair of silver spurs, seven new Holland shirts which had never been worn.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the trunk fastened to the chaise?</p>
               <p>Hughes. It was fastened with four leather straps; one at each end, and two round it, and an iron chain with a padlock on it, and the trunk locked; besides it was very well fastened behind the chaise. I am pretty certain it was not taken away till I came over Westminster-bridge. I came from Dartford by five in the morning; I saw the trunk there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any servant on horseback by you?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No; whenever I travel, and suspect any body, I look out, and bid people get away when they come behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular after you came over Westminster-bridge?</p>
               <p>Hughes. When I came to Parliament-street, I thought the chaise went heavier. I went on to the Nag's head in Swallow-street; when I came there, I found my trunk was gone. I called upon Sir

            . I never saw him but three times; the first time was at the Red Lion in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I live in Goodmans-fields; I am a vintner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him in Moorfields?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He sent for me; and I went by appointment to buy a ring of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner send for you, and you had never seen him before?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Mr. Swift sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He is a Whitechapel officer; I am security for him. He said a person of his acquaintance, a farmer in the country, had got a ring to sell, and it would about fit me. So I went and bought it: I gave him eight guineas for it [Produced in court]. I am no judge of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, and what I lost with the trunk at the time I mentioned. I was going to put this ring on my finger when it was produced at Justice Fielding's after I had to it, and I found it was made less; but I know this is the very ring.</p>
               <p>Lewis. The next time I saw the prisoner was at Mr. Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came the ring?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He appeared like a credable man, and I did not ask him any questions at all. I bid him shew me the ring, he did, and asked eight guineas for it; which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at Mr. Fielding's, when he was asked whether he knew you?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I was. He denied his knowing me. The ring was produced and given to Mr. Hughes just before he came in. He denied selling it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the justice, in his hearing, that you bought the ring of him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, I said nothing to him; but I had swore that before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to the prisoner you bought the ring of him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes, I did; and he denied seeing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you put him in mind of the Red-lion in Moorfields?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What sign do you keep.</p>
               <p>Lewis. I keep the Shakespear's-head, a tavern in Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to deal in rings?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that Swift's christian name?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It is Richard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any objections to your going to meet the prisoner, and say, why could he not come to your house?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Mr. Swift said, he was come to Smithfield, and could come no farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it to sell again?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I bought it for wear, and wore it upon my finger in common till I was sent for by Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew it to any body?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I shewed it to my friends, and told them what I gave for it.</p>

            . The beginning of November last was the first time that I ever saw the prisoner; that was at Kitts Inn beyond Barnet, at the sign of the Crown; it was on a Sunday, I think the Sunday before my lord mayor's day. I heard he had a good horse to sell, both to run and draw. I went down to look at him. After some conversation, he said, I understand you are a broker. I said, I am. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140017"/> said, I have got some lottery tickets to sell of the last drawing. I agreed to give ten guineas a piece for them. I think that was the 7th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a stock-broker?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. I am a house-broker. They were tickets of the lottery then undrawn. There were some other blanks. He produced an East India bond for 100 l. and wanted me to buy it. I told him it did not suit me at that time to buy it; but I would dispose of it for him in the best manner I could. [The bond produced and delivered in, and compared with the bond laid in the indictment: they agree]. I sold the two tickets at Coilins's office for 11 l. each. I was examined before Sir

            ; but cannot tell the day of the month. I gave the same account as now.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you were first applied to?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. I was a prisoner in the King's-bench for debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a visit paid you by the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. Yes, and much frighted I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you had been examined?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. That was the very next day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform him that you had given Evidence against him?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid him for the India bond?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. No, I did not. He had a note of mine for 15 l. He bid me, for God's sake, not to tell who I brought the tickets from, and that he would make me any satisfaction I desired. I did not know the ill consequence of it. I went immediately to a gentleman, who was a prisoner at the time, and told him of it, and asked his advice. White said, he would not have had his house searched upon any consideration. I dare say he would have given me 50 l. not to make any discovery. He did make me a present of a plain tortoise-shell snuff-box with a gold rim.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. What sort of a snuff-box did you lose?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a plain tortoise-shell snuff-box, finished in gold.</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. There was a lip to it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That answers to mine.</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. The prisoner offered me a note of 15 l. and to burn that which I gave him, if I wo uld say nothing of the affair. I told him I was very busy, and made soms excuses, and he shook me by the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him at any time besides at the Crown at Kitts Inn, and at the prison?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. I saw him at my own house. He never saw me nor I him, till we met at Kitts Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times was your house?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business there?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. He came to take houshould goods for the 15 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know your name?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call you by your name?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. He called me by no other name?</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy the horse?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he trust you that very evening with the India bond at Kitts Inn.</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to him you would deposit a bond in his hands, if he was afraid of trusting you?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. No, I did not. I do not remember that I had an India bond to give him. I paid him a 15 l. note that night in part of the two tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that he came to your house for houshold goods for the 15 l. note.</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. It was about a week after. The note was given for six days after date. He came to know if I had parted with the India bond. I said, I had not, and shewed it to him; and he was well satisfied, and left it in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the 15 l. note paid yet?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you propose any thing to him about your wanting a pair of horses?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. I wanted a pair of horses for a gentleman, a captain of a West India man. He uses the Jerusalem Coffee-house: he desired me to buy him a pair, because I had a parrot out of his ship, and I had a rendezvous at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go alone to Kitts Inn?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. No, I had a friend along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he?</p>
               <p>Stotesbury. He was Mr. White's acquaintance.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the Crown at Kitts Inn. I have known Mr. White about a year and three quarters. He did live next door to me: he lives now in our parish, the parish of South Mims. He has lived in our parish ever since last Midsummer was twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Stotesbury at your house with the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. I believe I did, on a Sunday, the very day before my lord mayor's day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140018"/>Q. Did you hear any part of their conversation?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. Nothing, but about buying horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any notes?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. No, I did not attend particularly to their discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came with Stotesbury?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. I think I have learned since, that it was Swift; they came in and had a glass of brandy, and asked for Mr. White. I said, he does not live near me now, he lives farther in the parish. Swift asked the boy to go for him, and said, he recommended this gentleman to buy a horse of White; Stotesbury smoked a pipe, and asked many questions concerning this horse of Mr. White's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see Stotesbury and the prisoner together before?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see a note pass between them?</p>
               <p>Hargrave, I heard something mentioned about a note, but I cannot tell particularly; Stotesbury said, he had an order to buy a pair of grey horses for a gentleman, if this pleased, and he would have a black boy to drive them, and that would be a very great oddity; he said a merchant in the city would make him a present of a black boy. I believe Mr. White told me, a fortnight after he had sent the horses up, Dunstable fair was a little after, I believe he bought them there. He said to me, Did you see them? I said no. Said he, I have not got the money for them. I said, Were they Brown's? he said yes. Mr. White told me some time after that, that Stotesbury gave him a 10 l. note in part of payment, for he would not buy a pair of horses for him, or any-body else, without something in hand; perhaps he may return them upon my hands again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time these people were at your house, were they in any room where business of a private nature might be transacted?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. There is a door opens into the kitchen; it is a large parlour, and they were close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us have that account again, concerning a pair of grey horses?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. Stotesbury said, If the horses pleased he would have a pair of grey horses for his own use, and a merchant in the city would make him a present of a black boy to drive them, and that would be a great oddity: He said, he had got the very best gown of the livery of the city of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did White tell you he would not trust him with any horses without the money?</p>
               <p>Hargrave. He did, a fortnight afterwards, saying. he might lose 10 l. by them if they were returned upon his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any mention made of an India Bond of 100 l.</p>
               <p>Hargrave. No, I never did; I never saw an India Bond in my life, so I do not know what it is.</p>

               <p>Everill. The receipt tells the time; he asked me what day of the month it was, and I went to the calendar to see it was the 28th of August, between four and five in the afternoon, I am sure it was on that day.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Everill. It was on a Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he mounted at that time?</p>
               <p>Everill. He had got a very poor one, besides that black mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write the whole of the receipt?</p>
               <p>Everill. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him very well?</p>
               <p>Everill. No farther than this [ Pointing to him]; that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you buy an almanack every year?</p>
               <p>Everill. I do, and nail it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What day is your market held on?</p>
               <p>Everill. It is on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe this receipt was wrote on a Friday?</p>
               <p>Everill. Because I recollect our market was on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you first desired to recollect this circumstance?</p>
               <p>Everill. I have a subpoena, or I should not have been here; it is all chance work that I recollect this. I wish I had not heard any thing of it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see White between that time and now?</p>
               <p>Everill. I cannot say that; I don't know that I ever spoke to him since the 28th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. If you was to look into the almanack, which way do you look, to find the day of the month?</p>
               <p>Everill. I must be very blind indeed, if I could not tell the Sunday; that is my method of finding it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other transaction that week, that led you to take notice of the day of the month?</p>
               <p>Everill. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you did not reckon the 28th for the 21st, for that is of a Friday?</p>
               <p>Everill. I am pretty sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This ink looks very fresh.</p>
               <p>Everill. It has been wrote ever since that day.</p>
               <p>Counsel. It looks as fresh as if it had not been wrote five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you served with the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Everill. At Potton; I was from home, there was a bit of paper and a shilling left for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person that brought it, bring any note?</p>
               <p>Everill. No, he only left a bit of paper and a shilling, that is all I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never a letter sent you by White?</p>
               <p>Everill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor by his attorney?</p>
               <p>Everill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor by any friend in his behalf?</p>
               <p>Everill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no message from White touching this trial?</p>
               <p>Everill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how you came to bring that receipt with you?</p>
               <p>Everill. Because I looked for the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know what White was charged with?</p>
               <p>Everill. Because I had a subpoena to appear on the behalf of White, this being the only transaction that ever I had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time that White was charged with stealing a trunk.</p>
               <p>Everill. I believe I saw it in the papers - I did not see it, but I heard it read.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>Everill. It may be a fornight or three weeks ago?</p>
               <p>Q. Who read it?</p>
               <p>Everill. The landlady of the house, named Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remark on it at that time?</p>
               <p>Everill. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you recollect you heard read?</p>

               <p>Everill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever asked by any-body to-day, whether you had brought your receipt with you?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Can you read and write?</p>
               <p>Everill. Just to do my own business; I can write a little; it must be very plain, if I can read writeing.</p>
               <p>Counsel, I'll write a word, to see if you can read it [He writes on paper]. Tell me what it is.</p>
               <p>Everill. This is the 16th of September.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I see you can read writing; but this is very providential, your bringing this receipt, nobody ever mentioning it to you, and you never seeing him before in your life; do you buy and sell horses often?</p>
               <p>Everill. Now-and then I buy and sell a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you buy a horse, do not you ask your friends to come and give their opinions?</p>
               <p>Everill. I trust my own opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come alone?</p>
               <p>Everill. There was a tall young man came with him when I bought the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call him brother?</p>
               <p>Everill. I did not hear him call him brother.</p>

               <p>Everill. We had a mug of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any friend on your behalf?</p>
               <p>Everill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house did you buy the mare?</p>
               <p>Everill. At my quarters at the Swan at Biggles-wade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the landlord by at the time?</p>
               <p>Everill. He was backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Counsel. The prisoner had a great deal of faith to trust you 6 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Everill. I suppose he might ask my character; every-body knew me there, and here too; I can bring a gentleman in town that I dealt with ever since the year 1738.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether he had inquired into your character?</p>
               <p>Everill. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he not bring the money home with him?</p>

               <p>Hicken. Mr. White said, if he bought him by candlelight, perhaps he would turn him upon his hands by daylight. Stotesbury offered him a note of hand, and he refused it, being short of cash. Then Stotesbury pulled out a paper, and said, White, can you change me a bond of 100 l.? Said White, I am a poor man, I cannot do it, and refused it; the paper was doubled up in his hand; he said my lord mayor's day was the next day, and he had as good a gown to put on as any liveryman in London; I was quartered in that house, and there all the time he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they there together?</p>
               <p>Hicken. I dare say they were together upwards of two hours, or thereabouts.</p>

Mr. Bullock, a gold watch, which I put into my wife's muff, and secured it in the trunk. The coachman hurried us very much; and, when we got to Stains, my portmanteau and two cloakbags were missing; I left my wife and sister to go by themselves, and returned to Sir

On the 23d of November, about half an hour after four, Brian and one Pallister came in loaded with some things; I heard both their voices; they staid above about three or four minutes, and went out again, and came in again exactly at five, with a box or trunk; I heard it strike against the cieling; at six they went down, and went out again; they came in again about two the next morning; I went up to wait on them as usual about eleven; there were Brian, Pallister, and one Duplex, they had got some silver buckles; they went out about eleven, and the next morning, about 3, I went up to wait on them; next morn. about eleven there came a Jew, he staid about half an hour, and went down with a great bundle on his back, tied about his head; then they call'd to me to bring them a candle, this was betwixt one and two in the day; there was no fire in their room, but that candle; then Pallister and Duplex went down, with each of them things in a handkerchief. Briant bid me light a fire; in ranking the ashes about, I saw a great many paper ashes; I found a paper with two corners burnt, and a card, with a direction on it for the Rev.

I, being summoned to attend the wardmote, weighed my stock of silver, which was 25 ounces odd penyweights. I did not come home till eleven at night. The next morning I weighed it again, and there were four ounces deficient. What I missed was cuttings and filings of buckles. My children observed to me he had been melting, and I had given him no orders to melt. I went to the chandler's shop, and found he had had some pearl ashes, we can't melt the silver in a body without them. Then I had recourse to an assay-maker, and there I found there had been an assay made in his name. Then I went to the refiner, and found he had bought an assay of silver from the prisoner, which was 23 ounces odd penyweights, for which he received 6 l 5 s. 4 d. Then I went to Mr. Curry, where the prisoner had worked, to give him a caution that he did not serve him the same. He told me he also missed a quantity. I got a warrant, and took up the prisoner. He gave no satisfactory account before my lord mayor how he came by the silver, and he was committed. He was searched, and in every one of his pockets were the remains of filings. He hardly worked one day in six or seven, yet never wanted money.</p>

He was searched, and his pockets turned insides out, and silver filings appeared on every one of them, both waistcoat and breeches.</p>
