On the 28th of October I was in the House; the deceased went down to draw me half a Pint of Twopenny; while he was gone for the Beer, his Wife went backward; whilst she was gone backward, he brought the half Pint of Twopenny; I was standing with my Back to the Fire; the deceased, he went backward also, and in about four or five Minutes Time, I heard the Cry of Murder; it was a Woman's Voice, and I thought it to be the Prisoner at the Bar: There was a Man that was in Company with me, that I believe to be fuddled , he started up immediately at the Cry of Murder !</p>
               <p>Q. Is that Man here?</p>
               <p>Marlow. No, my Lord; when the deceased had been gone backward about the Space of four or five Minutes, he came back in his Shirt; he came towards me, and went up three or four Stairs, and put his Hand upon the Banister, he turns his Face round to me, and says, my Wife has stabbed, killed, or murdered me, one of these three things he said, but which I can't positively say. He turned to me, and showed me his Back , the upper Part of his Back was all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Wound?</p>
               <p>Marlow. No, my Lord, he being at some Distance from me, he turned his Back again, and went up Stairs. I was in a great Surprize; I drank the remaining Part of my half Pint of Twopenny, and came out of the House ; when I came away, coming out of Doors, not seeing the deceased's Wife, nor knowing which way she came by me, I thought she might be backward; but when I had gone about five or six Yards from the Door, I saw the deceased's Wife, the Prisoner, I heard her cry out, That she had murdered or stabbed her Husband.</p>

               <p>Q. To what Purpose did she make that Exclamation?</p>
               <p>Marlow. I suppose she went to call a Surgeon. I was reading the News-paper, and she might get by me. I did not think she was gone out of the House , I thought she had been with the Man that went up on the crying of Murder . When I came out, I saw several Women with her, up in Arms as it were.</p>

            . Give an Account of this Matter.</p>
               <p>Gowry. Upon the 28th of October, between twelve and one o'Clock in the Afternoon, this Prisoner at the Bar called me, and told me she had stabbed and murdered her Husband, and desired I would come to his Assistance; when I came there, I found him standing upon the Floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he above Stairs or below?</p>
               <p>Gowry . I found him below Stairs, standing upon the Floor with a Knife in his Hand, and he told me that was the Knife that his Wife stabbed him with, he desired me that I would take care of it; immediately he went up Stairs, and desired me to come after him, which I did; when I came there, I examined the Wound slightly, and found it was very dangerous. I stopped the bleeding, in order to get a proper Surgeon to my Assistance .</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the Wound.</p>
               <p>Gowry. The Wound was under the Right-Shoulder, between the 5th and 6th Rib.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep was the Wound?</p>
               <p>Gowry. I could not justly tell then, but it appeared since about five Inches .</p>
               <p>Q. What have you further to say?</p>
               <p>Gowry. I have nothing further, but I went for a Surgeon to my Assistance, but when I came back, I did not do any thing.</p>
               <p>- Harrison , Surgeon. My Lord, I was called to this Place by Mr Gowry, in Whitechapel; when I came, I found the Wound as it has been described. I suppose the Wound must have been made with a Sort of a Butcher's Knife, of a short, sharp, broad Point; I discovered at the first, that the Wound had penetrated the Thorax.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the Man die?</p>
               <p>Harrison . Two Days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose that the Wound was the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Harrison. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>- Green. I was desired to inspect the Body of the deceased; upon viewing the Body, there was a Wound just under the Right-Shoulder, between the fifth and sixth Rib, entirely close to the Back-bone; upon opening the Body, the Cavity, that Part of the Thorax, was quite full of Blood, as if forced into it by a Syringe .</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you are of Opinion this Wound was the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, now is your Time to enter upon your Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Two Men came in, and they drank several Pints of Twopenny, and several Drams : At length one of them began to be pretty much in Liquor; upon which my Husband said, Is Dinner ready? I went to take it up; it was in the Wash-house, which went down three Steps, my Husband went to draw some Twopenny, and my Husband saw the other Man talk to me, and he said to him, What Business have you to talk to my Wife? and he struck the Man; I had a Knife and Fork in my Hand, and they in struggling threw me down, and fell upon me, and he said, O Lord, I am killed! With that I went out of Doors to get a Surgeon to dress him, and to see what ailed him.</p>
               <p>Court. Repeat what you said of the Knife and Fork in your Hand?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taking up a Piece of Beef and Cabbage for Dinner; while the Man was talking with me, my Husband came up out of the Cellar, and he asked the man, What Business he had to talk to his Wife? With that he struck the Man, and the Place being narrow, in the Struggle I fell, he fell down, and the Knife fell into his Back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that Man that your Husband struggled with?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not know, Sir; I thought he would have been here, I did expect him; he said he would be here.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not ask him?</p>
               <p>Marlow . My Lord, I was frightened that such an Accident should happen while I was in the House, so I drank my Twopenny, and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other Man there?</p>
               <p>Marlow. The Man she speaks of went into the House along with me.</p>

I goes down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160004"/> directly to the House; when I came, I asked how Harry did, the Prisoner said, you may go up and see ; when I went up, he was lying like a Man dead, groaning . I asked whether he thought he should recover, he told me he could not tell; so with that he looked at his Wife, and he says, if it was not for you, we might have been in our Beds, as we ought to have been; so he, looking at his Wife, says, you have done a fine Thing to laugh at.</p>

               <p>Boswell . I cannot tell. I did not look at her Face; with that the Prisoner at the Bar went down Stairs, and her Mother in-Law desired me to follow her, that she might not do any Damage to herself. I followed her, and found her by the Fire-side in the Fore room, and said, Nanny, What do you sit here for? I said, Nanny , How could you be so barbarous to butcher one that you liked so well? Why, says she, it was through a Woman that came into the House, that told me he had been along with some fresh Women that came into this Neighbourhood. I says to her, Who was that Woman that came and told you so? She said it was wooden-legged Peg ; I said wooden-legged Peg says the same of you, and cannot you forgive him, as well as he forgives you; with that she made no Reply, but went up Stairs where the deceased lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow her?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Nothing farther. I went the Night following to see him, and the House was open, and the Prisoner at the Bar as usual serving of Customers; I went in and asked her how her Husband did, she gave me a Candle, and said I might go up and see; I asked him how he did, he said he hoped he was better; that is all that I know.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the Words that passed between them?</p>
               <p>Latham . She believed she should die for him; when she threw the Knife and Fork at him, he was obliged to screen himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there some Heat and Anger when the Knife and Fork was thrown?</p>
               <p>Latham. My Lord, I cannot tell the beginning of all of it; there was a Cooper came in, and they went to play a Game at Mississippi , and she got a little in Liquor, but her Husband pacified her. After she had thrown the Knife and Fork, he persuaded her to go to Bed; he went up with her to put her to Bed, at Night she came down in good Order, and very loving seemingly, as they ought to be.</p>

             . What have you to say in the Behalf of the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Hurst . I had been out about some Business: when I came Home, I heard a great Misfortune had happened between Mr Boswell and his Wife. I heard she had done Mischief to her Husband; when I came into the House, I saw the Prisoner at the Bar ; I shook my Head at her, and said nothing when I came in, but saw her crying and ringing her Hands about the Room. I could not speak to her at that Time, neither did I go up and see the Man at that Time, till Mr Green and Mr Gowry came. I then went up, and held the Bason while he was bleeding : when Mr Green came down, she asked after her Husband, then he asked for his Fee, upon that the Prisoner took a Guinea out of her Pocket, and gave it to him; and when I came down, the Prisoner was standing at the Foot of the Stairs, ringing her Hands, and asked me how her Husband did, I told her I had not spoke to him yet; I told her I would have her go up, she said she would not: I shook my Head at her, then I went up and asked him how he did; he said, as well as he could expect: I said, Mr Boswell 'tis a sad thing to see such Differences between your Wife and you, be reconciled to your Wife, and see her; says he, let her come up, I owe her no ill Will, 'tis as much my Fault as her's.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said it was as much his Fault as his Wife's, did he give an Account of what happened ?</p>
               <p>Hurst . No, my Lord, he desired I would go down and look to the House, while she came up, which she did, but what they said, I cannot tell. I came the next Morning, and asked her how her Husband did, she desired me to go up; she asked for a Nurse that might be a careful Woman of him, but the Person that was recommended, asked too much Money, he said they could not afford it.</p>

She said she sold a pretty many, but what she sold was in Gentlemens Families; she said her Sister kept a Shop the Bottom of St Martin's-Lane, she said if we used her well, she would be a very good Customer. She desired I would bring the Silk Handkerchiefs the next Day to her Sister's House, and if I could get her the same of them Silk Handkerchiefs, she would have a Piece. I said to the Boy, Has not this Woman stole something. I do not like her leaning over so. I asked for the Chints Lawn, so we missed it. The next Day I said I would take the two Handkerchiefs to the Place where she said her Sister lived; I went, and asked the Gentlewoman if her Sister was within, so she said she did not know what I meant; then I went back and told my Brother, that I thought it was a Bite.</p>

If I am never so old, I am as willing as those that are young, so we went up Stairs, and had a Pint of Hot; I was fatigued in walking; sitting down , I happened to fall asleep, the mean time she picked my Pocket, and went out and locked me in.</p>
               <p>Court . You say you fell asleep?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she picked your Pocket then?</p>
               <p>Davis . She owned it before the Justice, I think it was Justice Jones .</p>

               <p>Davis. She owned I gave her half a Crown, and half a Crown more she picked out of my Pocket.</p>

               <p>Davis. I lost one Guinea, and 3 l. 7 s. in Silver.</p>

Please your Lordship , I was in my Lodgings, this Man comes in about eight o'Clock at Night; I was at Home by the Fire-side, he said can I have a Dram, I said we sell none, but if you will give me one, I will tell you where you may, so I did; we had a Quartern of Gin: he said I am very much in Liquor, I would freely give Half a Crown to lay down; I said I would speak to my Landlord, which I did, and the Maid brought a Candle for him; he goes up and sets himself down at the feet of the Bed, then he gave the Maid Six-pence to get a Pint of Hot, with that she locked him in, and shut me out, and he never walked, as they said, till three o'Clock in the Morning.

               <p>Walker. I was in my Room a little before 12 o'Clock. I live at the Mermaid-Inn; I was in my Room with another young Man with me; I was about to send some Money and two Rings into the Country: as the other young Man and I was together, this

I went down, and there was Company in the House, and I told my Friends of it; they said they were very sorry; they said they would be searched, and they said if any Body was a Bed they should be searched; for they said it is a Friend that has your Money; there was the Prisoner and another in Bed; one of them throws out his Breeches to me, I searched his Pockets; so when we came to

I found Half a Crown in his Pocket; I searched his Fob, and found 10 Guineas and an Half, and two Half Crowns, and 3 s. and two Gold Rings.</p>

               <p>The Defence the Prisoner made, that he did it out of a Jest. This, together with the good Character he bore, induced the Jury not to find him guilty.</p>

Clark and Saunders being at my House that same Night, I enquired after Saunders, but could not find him: Some Time afterwards, I saw an Advertisment that the Silver Spoons and Salts were stopped at Mr Lloyd's in Smithfield; I went to Mr Lloyd's, and desired to see the Plate that was stopped, after a little Examination, he gave me a Sight of the Plate; Mr Lloyd did not know the Persons that left the Goods at his House, but he remembered Sparks , Saunders, and Howse so particularly, that he described them to me. Afterwards Mr Lloyd , at my Desire, went with me into the Country to do what we could in order to apprehend these People; while we were in the Country, Saunders was gone, and Sparks was stopped on the Highway upon Suspicion, and was carried before the Justice of Peace; Sparks was sent to New-Prison. The next Day Howse was taken up, and sent to New-Prison; after they were carried into Prison, they were willing to make Discoveries; I asked Sparks whether he knew of the Remainder of the Plate. Sparks said you must ask Howse; then Howse said, you must go and ask

I asked him what he would have an Ounce, he asked me 5 s. which was about the Mark; then he pulled out a Salt, which gave me a Suspicion: Says I, young Man, as you are a Butcher, I suppose you are known here; we never buy any thing of Persons we do not know. I went with him to the Lock and Key; coming into a Room, Sparks says to a Person, You know me, don't you? I said to the Person, Sir, this is a serious Matter, you will be cautious, this is about some Plate being stopped; the Person then said, he did not know him. While they were talking, two other Men came up. I cannot say that Howse was one of them.

I told Mr Dugard , I believed I could describe them, if he had any loose Men his Way, which I did; he begged of me that I would assist him to go down in the Country, and he would send for two Horses; I told him I would.

               <p>Q. Did you stop him?</p>
               <p>King. He was gone three or four Yards, I followed him, and took these two Books out of his Pocket.</p>

               <p>King. He fell on his Knees, and desired me to be favourable to him, but at Guild-hall he denied them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Them three Books were my own, I went into that Gentleman's Shop with an Intent to sell them, I knocked three or four Times, could find nobody, and came out again from the Shop; he came about three-score Yards after me, and took them from me, and swears these Books were his.</p>

I did not like the Looks of the Men, therefore I had the Curiosity to see if they had any thing: the Things wrapped up were opposite to Brown , I declared I would see what was in it; upon that, Saverey got up and gave me a Blow; however, I held them both as long as I could; being sturdy Men, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160016"/> could not manage them both; upon that the Girl came up,

               <p>4th Count. For feloniously altering a Receipt, or Acquittance , to defraud the Governor and Company.</p>
               <p>The feloniously uttering and publishing such Receipt or Acquittance , knowing that the same had been altered, forged , and counterfeited by Persons unknown, with Intent to defraud the Governor and Company . This Count is framed Mutatis mutandis in Manner of the 4th.</p>

               <p>UPON reading the Indictment, the Council for the Prisoner objected , that an Intention to defraud a Body Corporate, was not within the Meaning of the Act of Parliament of the Seventh of His Present Majesty, which declares it Felony, falsely to make, forge, or counterfeit, any Acquittance or Receipt, for Payment of Money; or knowingly to utter or publish the same, with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever: That the South-Sea Company cannot fall under the general Description of the Word Person, mentioned in this Act. [Which Point was reserved to the Prisoner, in Case he had been found guilty. And then the Council for the King proceeded.] That the Prisoner was now called upon to answer for his Life for an Offence of a dangerous Tendency, an Offence that the Law has made capital, the forging of a Dividend-Warrant in order to defraud the South-Sea Company .</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was one of the Clerks of the South-Sea House, in an Office called the Pay-Office, and they make their Payments in Consequence of Warrants brought to them for that Purpose; these Warrants are brought by the Proprietors, or Persons for them, into the Treasury, the Method of which is as follows: The Cashier in a Morning pays into the Hands of the Pay-Clerks a certain Sum of Money; if in the Evening they bring Warrants importing the Sum delivered to them, he ballances the Account that Day with proper Vouchers; if they do not bring Warrants to the Amount of the Sum received, they are to return so much of the Money as has not been applied in Payments.</p>
               <p>The Fact for which the Prisoner is charged, is the altering of a Dividend-Warrant, by adding the Letter y to the Word Eight, to make it Eighty, and by the Addition of a Cypher to the Sum 8 l. to make it 80 l. and the Addition of a Cypher to 400 l. to make it 4000 l. which Alterations are an uniform Multiplication by 10.</p>
               <p>The Fact laid in the Indictment is so long ago as February was a Twelve-month, and the Discovery was made no longer ago than October last. In the Month of February, 1744. Mr

            , whose Name is mentioned in the Warrant, being intitled to the Sum of 400 l. South-Sea Annuities, applied about the first of that Month, the Dividend-Warrants being then payable, in order to receive his Dividend, he went to the proper Office in order to make his Claim.</p>
               <p>When the Accounts are stated, how much is due to every Proprietor; then Warrants are made out, and these Warrants are numbered, importing to be payable for Dividends upon New South-Sea Annuities , viz.</p>
               <p>L.</p>

               <p>and there is a Blank left in the printed Paper, to be filled up with the Name and Figures; so that when any of the Properietors apply for a Warrant, in order to receive their Dividend, there is an Alphabet ready to have Recourse to Names, upon which Mr Derisley having applied, he thought it proper to go to the Pay Office; at the Time he received the Warrant, he signed his Name on the Back of it; upon the Receipt of the Money, as is usually done; the Money he applied for was 8 l. which he received, and left the Warrant in the Office, and heard no more of it, till he was applied to, to unravel this Affair; being called upon to give an Account of this Transaction; to the best of his Knowledge, he thinks it to be the First of February, which Warrant was not brought in to the Cashier's Office, till the 11th of February, then it was brought in, in the same Manner as the Clerks usually bring in their Warrants as Vouchers, which Warrants were bundled together, and the Number and Value wrote upon the Outside; and the Clerk generally writes his Name at Length, or the initial Letters of his Name upon it; and the Prisoner at the Bar, on the 11th of February aforesaid, thought sit, upon the Bundle he carried in, to write his Name at Length, importing it to contain One Hundred fifty five Warrants, the Cashier not checking it immediately, they put the Sum, that is the Amount of that Bundle, which was

               <p>Under these Circumstances, 'tis apprehended that there is all the Proof that can be of an Attempt to defraud the South-Sea Company , by which Warrant , if it had stood unimpeached, the Prisoner would have gained to himself Seventy-two Pounds.</p>

               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Hayne. In the Transfer Office.</p>

               <p>Hayne. It was from this Book, or a Copy from another.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that Warrant was made from that Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. This Warrant before you, is it of your writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Is it as you wrote it, or has there been an Alteration made in it?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I am satisfied there is an Alteration .</p>
               <p>Q. How was it when you wrote it?</p>
               <p>Hayne . It was Eight for the Interest, and the Principal 400 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Be so good as to read it as you wrote it.</p>
               <p>Hayne. Rowland Rogers, Esq; Pay to Wm Derisley the Sum of Eight Pounds on 400 l. Stock. It is now Eighty by the Addition of the y.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you sure that the y is not of your writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne . It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it stand as you first wrote it, the Sum of 400 l.?</p>
               <p>Hayne. No, it is now 4000.</p>
               <p>Council. How was 400 expressed?</p>
               <p>Hayne. First it was expressed in Figures, 400 l. there is the Mark of Pounds, an L.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it now?</p>
               <p>Hayne. It is the same with the Addition of an o; what was before 400, is now 4000.</p>
               <p>Council. Give me Leave to ask you again, first, Is the Figures 400 your own Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, the 400; but with regard to the last Cypher, that makes it 4000, I take it not, because it does not stand in Course with the rest.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you any other Reason, with regard to the Figures 4000 l or what Reason have you with regard to the Letter y added to the Eight, of being sure, or being of an Opinion, that the y and Cypher is not your Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Sir, the y is quite different to what I write , and crowded more than I should have cared to have done in a Warrant.</p>
               <p>Council. Now with Regard to the additional o, that follows in the Sum 400, What Reason have you besides what you gave? You said the last o was out of the Line; What Reason have you besides being out of the Line?</p>
               <p>Hayne. The Manner of the o is different.</p>
               <p>Council. Now I would add, whether you have taken any Notice of the Figures in the Margin?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I can't be quite so positive as to the o in the Margin, as the o in the 400.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you know whose Hand-writing was the Figure of 8?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Mine, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council So then you not only filled up the Warrant, but put in the Figures?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir, we have examined this Warrant after it was wrote, three several Times; Mr Fowler and I both examined it and signed it.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you positive you examined the Import of the Warrant before you signed it?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. What did you examine it by?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I believe by this Book.</p>
               <p>Council. What Reason have you to take it to be this Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Because this is the Book by which we pay.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose Custody is this Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. 'Tis in the Custody of him that belongs to the Book, and takes Care of the Key.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you one of the Officers?</p>
               <p>Hayne. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you sure that Book has not been altered since?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Sir, 'tis plain here's no Alteration in it.</p>
               <p>Council. Why do you say that the Book to pay by is part of the Book to pay by?</p>
               <p>Hayne. This Book takes in all in D.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you generally examine by this Book that you call the Pay-Book?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I rarely miss.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you any other Reason?</p>
               <p>Hayne. 'Tis my general Practice; and I look upon it to be safest for the Company.</p>
               <p>Council. So then by the Form of the Letter y, and the Form of that last Cypher, you think 'tis not your Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Council. What Reason have you to think that the o in the Margin is not your writing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160024"/>Hayne . I compared those Sums together from this Book, and had it been 80, it would not have agreed with this book.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of making Figures in the Margin?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I look upon it to be more ready for the Payment of Interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever make the Sum in the Margin different from the Body of the Warrant?</p>
               <p>Hayne. We write in the Body of the Warrant the Words at Length, and the Margin in Figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make out a Warrant of Eight Pounds for Mr Derisley ?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you tell at what Time of the Year you make out these Warrants?</p>
               <p>Hayne. We fill them up half yearly.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you recollect between the Time of shutting and opening the Books, that that Warrant was not, or could not be, actually taken out?</p>
               <p>Q. After you have wrote it, to whom do you deliver it?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I generally examine the last Examination but very little before delivering our Warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other Officer to whom you deliver them?</p>
               <p>Hayne. There is one Fenboulhet under me.</p>
               <p>Council Can you recollect after you had compleated that Warrant to be delivered into the Hands of the Clerk, who that Clerk was to whom it was delivered?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I can't say to whom it was delivered.</p>
               <p>Council. Nor you don't know where it was during all that Time?</p>
               <p>Hayne. It was in our Custody all that Time.</p>
               <p>Council. Did any Body keep the Key of that Box where it was?</p>
               <p>Hayne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Had any other Clerks recourse to that Box?</p>
               <p>Hayne. There were two of them, but I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Council. So that after you had delivered it out you cannot tell? Had it any Date after you had delivered it out?</p>
               <p>Hayne. No.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you ever heard that such Things have been done, that Warrants have been altered?</p>
               <p>Hayne . I might before have heard, but not with my Certainty.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you know Mr Shuttleworth ? Did you never hear that he has done such a Thing?</p>
               <p>Hayne. I heard such a Report, but I never heard all the Particulars.</p>

               <p>Derisley. My own Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what Occasion did you write your Name upon the Back of that Warrant?</p>
               <p>Derisley. In order to receive the Dividend; now 'tis a Warrant for 80 l. when I had it, it was for 8 l. only; I received the Sum of Eight Pounds of the Clerk, and I left the Warrant with the Person that paid me. I can't remember the Clerk that I received it of.</p>
               <p>Council. You have been a Proprietor some Time; Do you always sign your Name in the Book?</p>
               <p>Derisley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you at the Time you signed that Receipt, compare the Warrant with the Book?</p>
               <p>Derisley. I read the Book I signed, and read the Warrant I signed, and the Warrant and the Book corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. How much Stock had you at that Time?</p>
               <p>Derisley. Four hundred Pounds, which is the only Sum I ever had in that Company.</p>
               <p>Court. You have been often there I suppose? Did you always receive of the same Person?</p>
               <p>Derisley. We generally go to the Person that is most at Leisure; we don't enquire for any particular Person.</p>

            . You are concerned, I think, in the South-Sea House?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I was Deputy-Cashier long before I was made Cashier.</p>
               <p>Council. Now you are Cashier?</p>
               <p>Woolley. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Sir, Give my Lord and the Jury an Account whether you know the Prisoner at the Bar. Was he ever employed by the South-Sea Company as one of the Pay-Clerks?</p>
               <p>Woolley. Yes, for twenty Years past.</p>
               <p>Council. Now, Sir, with Regard to keeping your Accounts with these Pay-Clerks.</p>
               <p>Woolley. Every Morning 'tis my Business to issue out Bank-Notes and Money to the Clerks, to enable them to answer the Demands that might be made in the Office, by the coming in of the Dividend Warrants. When the Business of the Day is over, then we call upon them for the Notes, they have left; then the y proceed to make up their Accounts; and the Method is, they sort the Warrants, when that is done, they list these Warrants in the Pay-Book, to see what the Total amounts to, then they bring them to me, then I give them Credit, and allow them in the Account, the Sums wrote upon the Back of their Bundle of Warrants, signed by the Pay-Clerk, or with the initial Letters of their Names; first they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160025"/> give the Name and Date, then the No. and Dividend, and then paid so many Warrants amounting to so much Money .</p>
               <p>Council. Is that the Method?</p>
               <p>Woolley . Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. That being the usual Way, Do you ever give Credit without Warrants being thus described?</p>
               <p>Woolley . No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Now that Bundle you have in your Hand; there seems to be upon that Bundle the Endorsement of the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Woolley. The whole of that Endorsement, the 11th of February, &amp;c. except what is by the Examiner, is of Mr Pelling's Writing.</p>
               <p>Council. Now inform my Lord and the Jury, whether you received this Bundle or that Bundle, with another Paper enclosed.</p>
               <p>Woolley. My Lord, we have an Office belonging to the Treasury called the Examiners-Office; the Business of these Clerks is to check the Accounts that the Pay-Clerk makes of the Warrants; upon the 11th of February, 1744. I gave credit to the Prisoner at the Bar, to 155 Warrants of New Annuities 23, the Sum of

            2806. 12 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Council. After you gave this Credit, I suppose you had this Bundle in your Custody?</p>
               <p>Woolley. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. But it laid in Order for the examining Clerk, to examine it for the Purposes you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>Woolley. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. In this Office of your's, Do you know whether it continued or not continued till the Examiner took it?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I have no Reason to think it was not there, there are several hundred Warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any missing?</p>
               <p>Woolley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make a Memorandum when the Clerk takes them away?</p>
               <p>Woolley . No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Council. How many Pay-Clerks were they? What were their Names?</p>
               <p>Woolley. Mr Gosling, Uther , Heister, and Mr Pelling. This Bundle was about ten Days before the Clerk had entered them.</p>
               <p>Council Is it usual to lay so long?</p>
               <p>Woolley. No, Sir, they should not.</p>
               <p>Council. I am afraid it is but too common a thing for Clerks to exchange each others Places, and lend Warrants one to another.</p>
               <p>Woolley. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. From the 11th of February, can you tell how long it might lie in your Office?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I cannot tell .</p>
               <p>Council. Then it might be near a Month; nor you cannot tell to what Examiner you delivered them to?</p>
               <p>Woolley. After the Bundle has been past by the Examiners, they are kept in a Room under the Care of one Mr Gostling .</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say, whether this Receipt was in the Bundle?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you one Question, Who makes your fire for you?</p>
               <p>Woolley. There is a Man on Purpose that comes every Morning in the Winter to make a Fire.</p>
               <p>Council. So that, during all that Time he is in your Office, he goes backward and forward, and he may let in whom he please?</p>
               <p>Woolley. He should not.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask, whether any body could not come backward and forward, whether you could have any Check upon him? What Time is he there?</p>
               <p>Woolley. About eight o'Clock, and I am there about nine myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever miss any thing out of your Office?</p>

               <p>Woolley. No, I never missed any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Mr Pelling first charged with this Fact?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I think in October.</p>
               <p>Council. Was he not examined by a Committee of Directors? Was he at Liberty all this Time?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Times was he examined?</p>
               <p>Woolley. He was before the Committee, and examined for some other Fraud; and as this Fraud was found out, they sent and took him up.</p>
               <p>Mr North . This might be nine or ten Days.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose there is an Opportunity of going into your Office before the Papers are carried away, and another Clerk of the Office that actually gave in the Receipt, might take out the Receipt out of Mr Pelling's Bundle. What was Mr Shuttleworth?</p>
               <p>Q. to North. What became of the Prisoner after his former Examination?</p>
               <p>North. To the best of my Remembrance he said he was ill, and went down to his House in the Country; I think some Holiday intervened, and there was a Day appointed for him to come to the House: The Committee apprehended he was sled, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160026"/> sent for, and they brought him up to Town; his Commitment was the 13th of November.</p>

            . Did you at any Time find any thing wrong with regard to that Warrant?</p>
               <p>Hassel . On the 31st of October I made the Discovery of this Fraud.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the Warrant when you found it out?</p>
               <p>Hassel. I laid it by carefully, till it was laid before the Committee, and upon Tuesday the 4th of November, it was laid before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first Discovery of this Warrant of Derisley's ?</p>
               <p>Hassel. Yes; there was a Warrant also found out in the Name of one Hill, and then Alderman Baker issued out Warrants for apprehending three or four others; Tew, Rouse, and Clark were taken into Custody, but the Prisoner was in the Country at that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it Mr Alderman Baker issued out his Warrant for the Prisoner upon this particular Affair?</p>
               <p>Hassel. As to the particular Time, I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all three of them charged with Facts?</p>
               <p>Hassel. No, Sir, it was only on Suspicion, nothing was proved.</p>

               <p>Court. Will you look upon this Warrant? Did that Warrant upon any Occasion come into your Hand?</p>
               <p>Rouse. It came into my Hand in this Bundle.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you understand it was in this Bundle?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Because I copied them in that Book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive it from?</p>
               <p>Rouse . I received it from Mr Woolley; looking to the Book, I found it was fetched from Mr Woolley by Mr Tew . When they are brought into our Office, they are put into a Glass Case; these 155 Warrants are divided into two Parcels, I entered of the Bundle from A to K.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received this from Mr Woolley.</p>

               <p>Rouse. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what Time?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I cannot say at what Time; as soon as I was out of Business, I took this Book to do.</p>
               <p>Council. Are all Warrants from A to K in that Book?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes, and the rest in the other Book. I have examined every one of these Warrants, and I found it there last Week.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you be certain, that particular Warrant of Mr Derisley's was there?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I found it in the Bundle, and entered it into the Book; I cast up all from A to K, and Clark cast up his Part from L to Z; so we cast up the whole to make up Mr Pelling's Account.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does your Part amount to?</p>
               <p>Rouse. From A to K, 69 Warrants they come to 1463 l. 10 s. 9 d.</p>
               <p>Council. Are all the rest of the Warrants truly entered?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know upon what Day you made these Entries?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you recollect how long this Warrant lay in your Office?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Sir, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Council. How many People have Access to your Office?</p>
               <p>Rouse. There were only four of us.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you admit other Clerks in occasionally?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I have seen Mr Heister and Pelling in the Office upon different Accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Memorandum what Day you received these Bundles?</p>
               <p>Rouse. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. Then, according to Accounts, I have heard Examiners have been guilty of these Frauds.</p>
               <p>Rouse. There have been those Things done.</p>
               <p>Council If the Clerk gives in a Number of Warrants to the Deputy-Cashier as Vouchers, and when the Number is short, Who comes to makes it up? Is it that Clerk that gave it in to the Cashier?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Supposing that Mr Pelling had delivered in a Bundle that did not contain so many as is marked on the Back-side, Whose Business is it to bring in the Receipt to make it?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Mr Pelling's. Whosoever is the Person that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160027"/> finds out an Error, informs the Persons whose Warrants they are.</p>
               <p>Council. If this Bundle had been deficient, would you have told Mr Pelling, Sir.</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes; Mr Heister was ill in the Country, and he wanted a Warrant of 30 l. I asked Mr Pelling what I should do for it; accordingly Mr Pelling gave me a Warrant of 30 l. which I entered in the Book; after that, I acquainted Mr Heister with it, and he gave me a 30 l. Warrant in the Room thereof, which I gave to Mr Pelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the Prisoner desired you at any Time to do any thing to these Books?</p>
               <p>Rouse. On the 14th Day of October, he and I were both attending upon the Committee, expecting to be called in, and finding the Committee was broke up, he speaks to me, says he, I want to drink a Glass of Wine with you; we went to the Nags-head in Leaden hall street; when I came there, he said, I have got a Thing to beg of you to do for me; then, says he, you must keep it a Secret: Upon which I asked what it was, he told me there was an Entry in the New Annuities, No 22, in Page 80, or odd, to alter from an 80, to an 8; I says, how can that be, when I am out of the Office to do any thing; he said he could help me to the doing of it, I told him I would do nothing at all, and the Reason why that I lost my Place of 50 l. a Year, was by doing what little I had done for him; he told me in Answer to that, in case that I did not do it, I must expect to hear of his Death.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed after this?</p>
               <p>Rouse. We parted directly, he said he would have me to consider of it, and he would see me again at the next Committee-Meeting. I for some Time had received of him 12 l. 10 s. for my Quarter, I gave him a Note for it when I received my Money, that he should stop it; upon our being taken up, he gave me my 12 l. 10 s. Receipt up, I got him to give me the Money before Quarter-day, and I gave him a Receipt for it, and he gave me up the Receipt afterwards without any Money.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he tell you why he gave up the Receipt?</p>
               <p>Rouse. He gave up the Receipt as a Gift, as I had done him Services, I suppose that was the Design. When the Committee met afterwards, he came to me again, and said, Mr Rouse, as it will be of no Service to you to keep the 12 l. 10 s. Receipt, I desire you will give me another Receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Rouse . The Day after our meeting, I had anti-dated it to August, it was due at Michaelmas .</p>
               <p>Q. When was your Meeting?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Our Meeting was the 28th of October; when he found I would not do him that Service he wanted, the Thursday after the Court ended, he desired me to give it him back again, and said it would be paid in to the Company as so much Money.</p>
               <p>Council. What Time was it you gave the other Receipt?</p>
               <p>Rouse. The Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by?</p>
               <p>Rouse. No-body by, it was in the Office where we were attending the Committee.</p>
               <p>Council. But at the first Time you told him you could not do him the important Piece of Service he wanted, was he taken up the 14th of October?</p>
               <p>Rouse. We were only then suspended.</p>
               <p>Council. After he had tempted you to do the thing you apprehended to be wrong, he still appeared at the South Sea House?</p>
               <p>Rouse. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. At the Time he gave up the Receipt, I ask you, when you refused serving him, whether he asked for the Receipt?</p>
               <p>Rouse . He desired me to consider of it.</p>
               <p>Council. Are you discharged from the Company's Service?</p>
               <p>Rouse. I have never been there, nor the Gentlemen never sent to me but upon these Affairs.</p>
               <p>[The Warrant that Mr Rouse referred to, that the Prisoner desired him to alter, was not the Warrant he was indicted for forging or uttering.]</p>
               <p>Fleetwood Clark . This Bundle of Mr Pelling's that I think was delivered into the Examiner's Office, and Part of the Entry made from A to K, and the other Part from L to Z, there is Part of the Entry by my own Hand, and the other Part was entered by Mr Rouse .</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Amount of Mr Pelling's Parcel?</p>
               <p>Clark. The Amount of the whole is thus: 155 Warrants, 2806 l. 12 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I ask you again, Are you certain with respect to the Number of these Entries?</p>
               <p>Hassel I have examined these Entries in the Journal, Warrant by Warrant, and the Sums from A to K, 69 Warrants, 1463 l. 10 s. 9 d. from L to Z, 86 Warrants, 1343 l. 1 s. 9 d. the Total, 155 Warrants, 2806 l. 12 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fleetwood Clark. At what Time did you belong to the Examiners-Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. About four Years, till I was suspended in December last.</p>
               <p>Council. How long may Warrants lie in your Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. Two or three Days, sometimes more, sometimes less.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160028"/>Council. Have any other People any Recourse to your Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. They sometimes do come in, the Warrants are locked up in a Glass Case .</p>
               <p>Council. Have any body Access to your Office?</p>
               <p>Clark. Mr Heister has borrowed the Key upon some Occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. For what Purpose has he borrowed the Key?</p>
               <p>Clark. It may be to charge a Warrant, or to that Purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him do it? Have you seen him make use of it, and take out a Warrant?</p>
               <p>Clark. I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you, Mr Clark, upon what you have said, if a Man had put a Warrant into his own Bundle, whether he might not, within the Compass of two Years, get it back again entirely?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, Sir, and I believe he might have got it out during his Suspension, he was employed in examining the Warrants.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. So he had Liberty from the Committee to examine his own Warrants after he was under Suspension.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. I want to know why it should be Matter of Wonder to you, when it should be in the Presence of other Clerks, the Man is charged with something of Fraud in his Office, why is it not natural for the Company to give him that Liberty to make up his Accounts?</p>
               <p>Clark. Mr Pelling and Rouse both did look over the Warrants, there were People in the Office at the same time, and he has gone out with a Warrant into the Treasury to Mr Woolley.</p>
               <p>Council. Was Mr Pelling so closely watched, that he could not have taken a particular Receipt or the whole Bundle?</p>
               <p>Clark. He might have taken away the Bundle, if there had been twenty in the Office.</p>
               <p>Council. Before this Suspension, these Receipts must have been in the Glass a Year or a Year and a Half.</p>
               <p>Clark. They are put afterwards into little Cupboards.</p>
               <p>Council. Has it been usual to have Keys to look into those? Who is the Person entrusted with this Key?</p>
               <p>Clark. Four Men, called the Examiners of that Office.</p>
               <p>Council. Suppose it be asked to lend that Key, has it been done?</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Council to Woolley. Do you understand any particular Person at this Time did watch over the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Woolley. There was always some Body there.</p>
               <p>Council. That you cannot say, as you was not always there - Mr Woolley, I wou'd venture to ask, you are a Man of Candour, Do you think if a Person had a Mind to have got a Warrant away, he could not have done it?</p>
               <p>Woolley. I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pelling . Prisoner, What do you say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Pelling. I have not, my Lord, the least Remembrance, either of Mr Derisley, the Gentleman to whom the Warrant was payable, or of the Warrant itself. What Evidence therefore of Innocence can your Lordship expect from me of a Fact I am thus totally ignorant of: of the Forgery of a Warrant which is not so much as proved to have been, because it never was, in my Custody. - I have had the Honour, my Lord, to serve the Trustees of the forseited Estates of the late Directors, and the present South Sea Company, for upwards of 25 Years; and in that Station I every Year paid many thousand Warrants; but other Gentlemen, my Lord, served in the same Station: By what Hands this Warrant was paid, or by what Hands it was altered, is a Question I cannot, and is in their Power only to say; but this, my Lord, I can with Truth say, that if the Care of the Gentlemen entrusted with my Warrants had been equal to my Innocence, neither your Lordship, or the Gentlemen of the Jury, had been troubled with this Trial.</p>

               <p>Rone. In my House, Sir, he appeared publickly; the Constable, after he had executed the Warrant, he left him while he went to Barnes and dined; he only said to me, Mr Rone, take care of Mr Pelling against I come; and I did not take any Charge of him, I left him, and the Constable did not return till three in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Council. Then Mr Pelling might have went off?</p>
               <p>Rone. Yes.</p>

               <p>Harvey. He has past Accounts of mine, and he has always behaved very well, and I have never found him wrong in any thing.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you believe that he would be guilty of Forgery?</p>
               <p>Harvey. I never heard any thing like it of him, by his general Character in the Neighbourhood. I live at Comb, and he has past several Accounts for me; and he has been a Tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. I dare say there's no Person in the whole of your Acquaintance, that you think will be guilty of Forgery?</p>
               <p>Rosomon Saunders. He has lived about five and twenty Years in our Neighbourhood, and bears a very just honest Character. I am left in Trust for some Part in the South-Sea, and he has always done very fair by me.</p>
               <p>- Belcher . I have known him 30 Years, I always took him to be a very honest Gentleman, and he always bore the Character of such a one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any Dealings with him?</p>
               <p>Belcher . The Gentleman had the greatest Part of a House of mine in Broad street, and the Reason of his leaving me was because the House smoaked; he took the House of me four Years ago last Michaelmas .</p>

               <p>Gilling . There was a Man asleep fuddled , the 9th of December, on Monday Morning, between three and four o'Clock, and my Brother came over to me to come to his Assistance; he said there was a Man drunk, and I wanted to get him up; the Man had lost his Hat; I saw this Boy come along with the Cushion, and he went to the drunken Man, and took the Handkerchief that was by him, so I took the Cushion away along with the Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Gilling. It was underneath the Cushion.</p>

I went to him, and he said there was a Woman came to him, and would have had him to have owned the Cushion that was taken away; upon this I desired Florence to give Notice of it among the Chair-men, that I might find out who it belonged to, so on Tuesday Morning they came to my House.</p>

             . What have you to say upon this Occasion?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We had some Reason to suspect my Servant not to be good, from the Things I missed in the Wash, which I knew could go by no other Hand; I said to her, Nanny , you have been very wicked, I must search my Neighbours Houses, and I shall search your Acquaintance first, and consider what Trouble you will bring this Woman in as well as yourself; she down'd upon her Knees, and wished her Hands might never be clenched, if she knew any thing of it; when she saw I had my Cloak on that I would go, she said to me, Madam, Forgive me, forgive me; she owned the taking of the Candles, she confessed the taking of nothing but the Candles; as to the Brass Cocks and Iron Heaters, and China Saucer, they were found in the Box, which she sent for to a Neighbour's; she confessed the Candles to be mine.</p>
               <p>Sarah Hall. I was at Mrs Holmes's, she sent to me, and said she had a Warrant to search a Neighbour's House; she said, Nanny , you will bring the Woman into Trouble as well as yourself; then she down'd upon her Knees, and said the Candles were her Mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Box was opened, did Mrs Holmes own the Things that were in her Box?</p>
               <p>Hall. Mrs Holmes owned the Cock and Heaters.</p>

The Prisoner lived with my Uncle; after his Confinement , he sent for me; and when I came to the Goal, he came to me in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160034"/> Yard, crying most bitterly, saying he should never be able to look any Body in the Face: he said he was the Person that had done the Fact.</p>

               <p>Q. What Fact?</p>
               <p>Marymack . That he had taken these Goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else?</p>
               <p>Marymack. He came with an Intent to rob the House; he said he held up both his Hands and said, Good God! how can I do such a Thing? There was nothing forced back, Door nor Shutter; I asked him how it was he got in at the Door, he told me he was backward in the Yard when the Man went to draw some Beer, and he slipped in and went up into the Chamber where no-body lay; I said afterwards to him, I suppose you have sold these Things, or pawned them; he said, no, they should be produced in Court. He has desired I should say what I could of him; he is an active young Man, he is no Swearer nor Drunkard; I don't know that I ever heard him swear an Oath, nor I never heard any thing amiss of him. <rs id="t17470116-37-verdict157" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. What Shop does she keep?</p>
               <p>Barnes . A Hosier's Shop; the Prisoner came into the Shop with another Woman along with her, they asked for a Pair of Worsted Stockings with long Clocks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you show any Stockings?</p>
               <p>Barnes . I pulled out several Papers, but could not find any that would do.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was this?</p>
               <p>Barnes . Between one and two the 24th of December; when Mrs Taylor came, she pulled down several Papers, but there were none that she wanted; her Accomplice, she pitched upon a Couple of Pair, she said she would have a Couple of Pair if Mrs Taylor and she could agree; the Prisoner at the Bar I took particular Notice of her, she took up first one Pair, then another; I did not mind her Accomplice cheapening Stockings, but I see her double two Pair up, and put them under her right Arm, she had a Cloak on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she agree for any Price for them?</p>
               <p>Barnes . She did not ask any Price at all, I said nothing to her; after she had got them, she came close to the other Woman, Well, says she, if the Gentlewoman cannot take your Money, we must have them elsewhere; we must have two Pair of Stockings and a Silk Handkerchief to carry on board a Ship to Night; upon which the other Woman took no Notice of what she said, but stood talking with Mrs Taylor, I let her go I believe an hundred Yards, I kept within a Yard of her, I says, I believe you have got something that is not your own, you have got two Pair of Stockings; says the Prisoner at the Bar, then take them, I took one Pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that to be Mrs Taylor's Property?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I believe them to be Mrs Taylor's Property. I brought her back to the Door, and she dropped the other there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken that one Pair before the other Woman came up to you?</p>
               <p>Barnes . Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say?</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in her Defence said the other Woman that was with her in the Shop cheapening Stockings, came up to her in the Street, and she asked her whether she had got them, and she told her, yes, with that Barnes, the Evidence, took them out of her Hand.</p>

            , the Owner of this Coat, left this Coat at my House the last Day of the last Month; I live at the Sign of the George at Ilford, it was wrapped up in a clean Table cloth, I saw it given to the Waggoner that it might be left safe ; afterwards I saw the Prisoner get into the Waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Coat was delivered?</p>
               <p>Peen . I am sure it was; I gave him a special Charge of it, because it was a new one, and the Waggoner throwed the Tilt on and went off; the Waggon went off the First Day of this Month at Night, about Six o'Clock, from my House. On the Fifth, the Waggoner came to me, to desire to know if I could swear to the Coat; I said I was sure I could, because I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Peen. In the Country. I says to the Prisoner, Don't you remember being at the George at Ilford such a Night? Do you know me? he said no: Don't you remember I went to the Waggoner and desire him to be careful of this Coat? and he said he did: I said he was sadly to blame he did not pull off the Coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Coat was it?</p>
               <p>Peen. James Seuter's .</p>

               <p>Peen . I know nothing of the Watch; when it was asked what was o'Clock, he pulled out a Watch seeing the Fellow very indifferently dressed, we wondered to see such a Fellow pull out a Watch.</p>

               <p>Broadstreet . I will tell you how it was, Pulling was a Tenant of mine, and I could not see him on a Sunday; Sir, said he, I am poor, and you are very severe; says he, it is my Brother's Badge, and he said this Woman was his Sister-in-Law, which I find since is not; he told me for five Pounds it could not be left any Time, but it must be released in two or three Days following; they did not come, and began to be uneasy how he came by it. On the Sunday following three Persons at Night came to enquire for this Pulling , I told them I believed that he was not at Home, but I desired to know their Business ; I was very inquisitive to know their Business; I can tell you this, if it is a Piece of Plate, I have such a thing in my Custody for 9 s. they said, Sir, that is the very thing we want, it belongs to a Man that is will lose his Place if he has it not; I said there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160037"/> was 9 s. upon it, but if I was satisfied of the Truth of what they told me, I would let them have it; accordingly this Man, Burding , brought his Staff, and it fitted, and my Wife delivered it to them. This is all I know of the Affair, I gave 2 s. upon it , and set off 7 s. I have known Pulling six Years, I never knew that he was charged with a Felony, or any thing of that Kind; I have known him to keep two or three People at work, and he has lately been reduced.</p>

               <p>Jennings . A dead one.</p>

               <p>Sweedland. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to lay to his Charge?</p>
               <p>Sweedland . On Christmas-Eve, about Eleven o'Clock, I saw him take the Goose, the Property of my Master I followed him, and I took the Goose; he said, Here take the Goose, I said that would not do; I called my Master, and he sent him to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any Instrument that he took it with?</p>
               <p>Sweedland . He took it with his Hands, and was got about two Doors before I took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q Had he the Goose in his Hand, or did he fling it down?</p>
               <p>Sweedland . He had it in his Hand; he said take it; but I said that would not do; and my Master immediately came.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was going Home late at Night, and there was three Geese laid upon the Board; their Heads laid over the Board; I was very fuddled, and the Goose tumbled down; and I took up the Goose, and the young Man came up to me, and he followed me two or three Doors, busseting me with the Goose; his Master came out, and said what was the Matter; he said this Man had stole a Goose.</p>

               <p>Presgrove. I missed the Saw, when I came Home; I enquired of my Wife, when I came Home; the Man that was at work there, he said that Williams had been there, and he had a Suspicion he had taken it away; so I went to William's House, and I saw the Saw, and I said it was mine; he afterwards pawned it in Chiswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing further to say? Did you carry him before a Justice of the Peace?</p>
               <p>Presgrove. He made an Excuse that I lent him the Saw before the Justice, but he afterwards denied it; he used me very ill; when I went to take the Saw away, he would have stabbed me.</p>

My Lord, some Months ago I happened to meet the Prosecutor, I asked him if he could recommend me to some honest Journeyman Carpenter, the Prosecutor recommended to me the Prisoner at the Bar; I employed him about three Months making up Clothes Presses, the Fellow always behaved very honestly; I believe I had some hundred Pounds Worth of Work done in my House afterwards.

               <p>Holding. Yes, and during the Time they worked for me, the Prosecutor found the Prisoner Tools: When I huffed the Prosecutor for being so long about it, I said, if you do not go on better, I must contract with somebody else; with that he went about his Business, and when I spoke to Williams, the Prisoner, he said I cannot work if he does not find me Tools, and I believe he did frequently lend him Tools; and if he did take it out of the Shop, it was common.</p>

               <p>Quincey. This Fellow, the Prisoner, has worked for me four or five Years at a Time; he sent me a Letter, that a Fellow had swore a Saw against him. I think he is a very honest Fellow, I know nothing of the Fact.</p>
