                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Missing Letter branch of the General Post Office at St. Martin's Place—in consequence of the loss of letters I made up a packet on 17th May, and enclosed in it two marked sovereigns and addressed it to Miss Mary Roberts, care of Miss Liddell, The Avenue, Tonbridge, Kent—I securely fastened it and posted it about 12.30 in the pillar letter-box, Adam Street, Strand—it would go from there to St. Martin's Place Office about 12.45—I went with Mr. Stanley to St. Martin's Place Office, and saw the prisoner Rout leave the office about 2.45—I received a communication, went to the Bull's Head Inn, 28, St. Martin's Lane, about 2.55, and obtained a half-sovereign there, which was one ofthose I had marked—I shortly afterwards saw Rout, had a conversation with him, went to the Bull's Head again, and obtained the other marked half-sovereign—I then went back to the Post Office, saw Titchener, and said "Rout has just confessed to stealing a packet containing two half-sovereigns; has he given you any money?"—he said "No"—I said "What money have you about you?"—he produced two half-crowns four shillings, four threepenny pieces, four sixpences, and two pence, which he said was part of some money he had withdrawn from the bank—I said "Rout states that he gave you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver, and</p>

               <p>that you knew that it was the change of one of the half-sovereigns he had stolen from the packet"—he said "Rout came to me and said 'Here is something,' and I saw it was a packet broken open, and I said 'Shall I seal it?' Bout said 'No,' and went away, and after a short time came back with the contents, two half-sovereigns, and said 'I will change them and give you half,' and shortly afterwards Rout came to me and gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver, and said 'This will makeup for yesterday'"—I said "You were seen out yesterday driving in two traps; I expect you found it rather expensive"—he said "Yes"—I said "About what did it cost you?"—he said "About 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each"—I said "When you received the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver from Bout you knew it was the change for one of the half-sovereigns he had stolen from the packet?"—he said "Yes"—I then brought Titchener in, and told them they would be charged with stealing the packet, and asked if they had anything to say—Titchener said "No," Bout said that he had told me all he knew about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Messrs. Coutts' bank, 59, Strand—Mr. Henry Dudley Ryder is one of the partners—on May 1, soon after 3 pm., the prisoner came in and handed me a letter in a closed envelope addressed to Messrs. Coutts—I got a partner to open it; this is it: ("20, Charles Street, Berkeley Square, May 1, 1882. Gentle-men,—Please let bearer have small cheque book 50, and charge the same to my account.—Fortescue.") Lord Fortescue has an account with us, and I saw that it was not his signature; I compared it with other signatures of his, and showed it to one of the partners, and then questioned the prisoner; he said that he was told to bring it and wait for an answer, and was given 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for so doing—I asked where he brought it from; he said the Athenaeum Club, from a man named Sawyer—I asked him whether he brought it from the inside of the Club—he said "From the Athenæum Club"—that is nearly a mile off—I detained him; we got him to write his name; he wrote "Richard Wilkins"—he first gave his address at a place which I can't remember; he then said he was not quite sure, and that he had made a mistake, and said that it was 53 or 54, St. John's Street, Clerkenwell—I wrote that down; he after<lb/>wards wrote another address, but not before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This "Richard Wilkins" is his writing; the address is mine—I do not know Bevington Street, Hoxton, or whether there is a St. John's Road there—I can't say that this signature "Fortescue" is like the body or signature of this letter; I do not see any resemblance—the prisoner was interrupted in giving me his address, as one of the partners was questioning him, and I wrote it down—that was about 3.30; he was in the office till 4.15—I asked him whether he was acquainted with the contents of the letter; he said, "I don't know"—Mr. Majoribanks opened it, and gave it back to me—I then said, "Do you know the contents of this letter?" and he said, "No;" I did not say, "You will have to wait until a detective officer comes," nor did I hear that said—Mr. Shannon, the managing clerk, had charge of the matter.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner there on the afternoon of May 1st; Mr. Phillips showed mo this letter, and I said to the prisoner, "Do you know the man from whom you received this?"—he said, "I know nothing of him; but I saw him come out of prison this morning, and we went together to a stationer's near Leicester Square, Culleton's, and we tried to get some paper; we failed, and then went back to another stationer's in the neighbourhood called Chapman's, where we got some;" he then entered into a lot of details as to their wandering about from one place to another and then he said that they went to a-public-house near Cold bath Fields prison, where the other man wrote this letter—Inspector Moore was gent for, and the prisoner was given in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner must have come in a little before 3 o'clock, and he was brought to Bow Street at a quarter to 6; he was only about 10 minutes going from the bank to Bow Street; he was allowed to remain seated in the bank room, as he could not give a satisfactory account of himself; we first of all had to communicate with Lord Fortescue, and we had to consider the matter—this is nothing like Lord Fortescue's signature or writing—the prisoner did not ask to be allowed to go out, and point out to a policeman the person who had given him the letter; we had our own policeman in uniform on the premises—he did not say that the man was waiting outside—our policeman saw what was going on, but he had nothing to do with it—I told the prisoner he would have to wait till the detective came; he did not say that if a policeman was not called the man who gave him the letter would have plenty of time to escape; I did not hear the word "escape"—he did not say, "He has got the paper, ink, and envelopes on him"—I do not know that the prisoner has been admitted to bail or that he has just surrendered—he did not say to me, "He has appointed to meet a turnkey outside Cold bath Fields prison at 6 o'clock, and we can see him there"—he said that Truman was the name of the man who gave him the letter, and that he saw Truman at Cold bath Fields that morning when he came but of prison.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 1st May I was called to Courts' Bank about 5 o'clock, and found the prisoner detained there—I said "I am an inspector of police, and am going to accompany you at 7 p.m. to the Athenaeum Club, Pall Mall, to see Mr. Sawyer respecting a letter"—he said "I said nothing about Mr. Sawyer or the Athenaeum at 7"—I asked his name and address; he said "Richard Henry Wilkins, 63, Bevington Street, Hoxton;" I found that correct—I asked Mr. Phil-lips to repeat the statement the prisoner had made in his presence; be did so, and the prisoner said "No, what I said was the gentleman was waiting outside"—I said "What gentleman, Mr. Sawyer?"—he said "No, Mr. Truman; as I told the gentleman, I met him this morning at 9 a.m. outside Cold bath Fields, and had some beer, and then walked to Leicester Square; he bought some note-paper, and then wished to know where Messrs. Coutts' Bank was; I could not tell him, but we found out, and then returned to the City Road, where we were joined by Fred Oliver; he fetched a penny bottle of ink, and we all went to a beer-shop; Truman wrote the note, and asked me to take it to the bank, and, if anybody asked me where he came from, I was to say Mr. Sawyer or Mr. Brooks; we then all returned to the Strand, and I did so; I did not know what it was about"—I told him he would be</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector D</hi>). On 2nd May I was in the Edgware Road about a quarter past 5 in the morning by myself—I saw the prisoners there and followed them for some distance till I got to Earl Street, along which they turned—going along there some little distance to a little opening I stepped up quietly to Ford and asked him to step into the side street—when we got there I asked him what he had about him—he refused to let me see; but I caught hold of his coat and found these two long spoons—I then took him there and I called a constable to take Brandon—he was close by the side of Ford when I took him into this side street—they had walked side by side for about 250 yards—I did not have an opportunity of speaking to Brandon—I left him at the little side street and got the other constable to look after him—I have here eight spoons, six forks, two table knives, a pair of drawing compasses, a pen, and about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze—all these were in the possession of Ford—Brandon was brought into the Molyneaux station, Edgware Road, about 10 minutes after I arrived there, by the constable whom I had sent after him—I told Brandon he would be charged with the other one with unlawful possession, and he said he knew nothing about them—he said "I was with him on saturday at the boat-race, I left him last night about 10 o'clock at a coffee-stall; I was on my way to Watford when I met him at a coffee-stall; he asked me to return with him"—he was searched, he had nothing that was identified as part of the property—he had 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some photographs, and a certificate of good character from Glasgow—the photographs had nothing to do with this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found nothing on Brandon which was claimed by the people who lost the property—the certificate was from the Howe Machine Company in Glasgow—he came from Glasgow on the Sunday previous to the boat-race, and I have been told that he met Ford on his arrival and was with him all Sunday and Monday—it is perpectly true that he was with him on the Hanlan and Trickett boat-race day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have made inquires to see if his statements are correct I have seen his brother, at whose house he met Ford on the Sunday—he said the prisoner arrived from Glasgow on the Sunday morning; that he knew Ford and asked him to dinner because he was in poor circumstances, and that he came on Sunday and his brother came too, and they met and both slept at his house together—they went out on the Monday together and he expected them both on the Monday night—the certificate from the machine company, dated 22nd April this year, stated that the bearer had been in the employment two years, and had been a steady, industrious workman—communications have been made with the police at Glasgow and that document is found to be genuine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Station Terrace, Kilburn Rise, and am assistant to my mother, Elizabeth Esther Wood, who keeps a grocer's shop there—on 1st May the shop was closed about 9 o'clock; the boy put the shutters up and I closed the windows and the door and locked it—the shop is in the front towards Station Terrace—there is no road or entrance at the back, but a small garden with a rather low wall, on the other side of which is a railway embankment—you can only get into the house from the back by coming over the wall—on 1st May I went to bed about 11 o'clock I think, leaving everything in the shop and house safe it far as I knew—I was not disturbed—I got up on the 2nd about half-past or a quarter to 8—when I came downstairs nothing was disturbed in the shop; but in the parlour at he back everything was in confusion—the cash box was broken open, there had been nothing in it the night before—there had been 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze and copper in that room—I saw it there myself; we missed that, but nothing else from that room—the windows there were all right—the door of the back room on the basement had been forced, and somebody had got in at the window, which was left open, the sash being drawn up—I saw that window was fastened the night before—a little piece of glass had been taken out of the pane next the division, so that anyone could put in their band from the outside and draw back the catch—the catch was taken off the inside of the door of the back room; that door had been closed and locked the night before—nothing was taken from that room, but from the front kitchen is the basement we missed the spoons and forks which were found on the prisoner—my mother lost six forks, eight spoons, some drawing instruments, a pair of scissors, and two table knives—these are the things—I never saw the prisoner until I saw him before the Magistrate on 9th May.</p>

I am a warder lately stationed at Wormwood Scrubs Prison—the prisoner was under my charge there on 1st April, in the large hall with 32 other convicts—he was under a sentence of penal servitude; I reported him to the governor on 1st April for a breach of discipline, talking while at work on 31st March—I took him to the governor at 10 o'clock, and the governor reprimanded him but gave him no punishment—the men were engaged at basket work, and at 10.351 gave orders to them to stop work, and they put their tools away all but the prisoner—among their tools each convict had a beating iron like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it weighs 3lb.—I was armed with a sword—a convict, Julian Ames, was at my side and the prisoner was on my left front—I turned my head to the right to speak to soother convict and felt a blow at the back of my head—I had a cap on—I fell to the ground insensible, and when I became conscious I found myself bleeding from my head and supported by two convicts—this beating iron was on the ground by my side—the prisoner was facing me—he said "You are not going to report me for nothing"—the chief warder came in, and I was assisted from the hall by two warders and examined by the medical officer of the prison—I was confined to the house for three weeks, and am still suffering and not able to resume duty—nothing had taken place between me and the prisoner except what I have stated—there was also some injury to my head and cap, but that might have been caused in the fall.</p>

I execute warrants for enforcing the payment of rates due to St. Mary Abbots, Kensington—Kealey occupied 144, Portobello Road, Notting Hill, as a corn chandler—I have known him about nine months—on 7th December I issued a summons to show cause why he should not be taken to prison, and on the 10th December a warrant was obtained to be executed after 28 days—it was put into my hands about 12th January, 1882; I went to the shop and found it open—between 12th and 31st of January I called thereabout five times with the warrant to take him into custody—on 31st January, between 1 and 2, I met him in High Street, Notting Hill, about half a mile from his shop; I told him I held a warrant of commitment for the rate, and should take him to Holloway Prison—he said "Very well, I have no money," or words to that effect—I kept him in custody till I handed him over to the officers at Holloway Prison—he had no opportunity of going to Mr. Ruce to swear an affidavit—he said nothing about that, or applying to the County Court—I do not know Nash.</p>

On Saturday morning, 22nd April, I was on duty in Warwick Street, Pimlico, about 1.15 am—I saw the prisoners near West's the draper's, walking towards Vauxhall Bridge Road from West's—I know them by sight pretty well—I saw them at 10 minutes to 3 the same morning at the same place, and coming in the same direction, about 30 yards from West's—I said "What do you mean by loitering about, this time in the morning?"—the third man who is not in custody said "I was at the theatre last night and was locked out"—another one said "I was not locked out but I was keeping him company"—I said "Is your name Pope?"—he said "No"—I said "I am not satisfied with your being about my beat this time in the morning"—when I came to West's I found four holes bored through the panel of the door—this centre-bit corresponds with the holes—I took the measurement—I called up Kistruck, who was in charge of the premises—I had passed West's about 20 minutes to 3, and I saw the prisoners at 10 minutes to 3, and I passed again at 3 o'clock—the place was all right before—I worked in Denbigh Street, which would make it about 10 minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach builder of 79, Pentonville Road—on the 28th April, about 11.40 p.m, I was in Cromer Street, when I saw the constable Knight in plain clothes—I was speaking to him, and while talking to him the prisoner and another man came up to me, and the prisoner knocked me down by a terrific blow—it smashed in my hat, and when I was down he jumped on me—I had a great coat on, and he tore</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My hat was not knocked exactly over my eyes—it was a heavy blow, and it rested on my nose—the two men were together, but the prisoner knocked me down—the other man must have done nothing—I saw the prisoner as plainly as I see you—this was just a few doors up Gray's Inn Road—it is not a small street; it is a public thoroughfare with shops, and there were lights, so I could see him—it was quite the reverse of being dark—I never saw the prisoner before—I afterwards saw him in a public-house with the constable and another gentleman—I cannot say whether he was surprised at the charge—I have been under medical treatment ever since—I am 82 years old—I was nearly killed.</p>

I was in Cromer Street at the time in question talking to the prosecutor, when the prisoner deliberately came up in company with another man and struck him a blow on the head with his fist—they both fell together, and were grappling together with each other on the ground—I went to the prosecutor's assistance and got the prisoner off, and he went away—about half an hour afterwards I got the assistance of a uniform man, and went to a public-house with the prosecutor and apprehended the prisoner—he did not say anything when I apprehended him—I charged him—I knew him before—I am quite sure he is one of the two men—I did not see anything taken from the prosecutor—the other man never touched him—the prisoner is the man that grappled with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner came up with a rush—he did not stand before he rushed at him—there was no woman there—the man did not appear to be drunk—the other man closed behind with the prisoner—they both ran away—I never saw the other man touch the prosecutor—it was near 12 o'clock—Cromer Street is a dark street; the nearest light is about 12 yards off—when I charged the prisoner he said "It was the other man"—he used some such words as "Iam quite innocent; they have mistaken the man," I cannot positively say the words—he said "You have got the wrong man"—the prisoner was standing with about a dozen others in a public-house talking together—he made no resistance—I have no doubt about his being the man—when he was searched at the station 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher of 153, High Street, Brentford—Rickard worked for me for 12 months, 12 months ago—on Thursday night, 4th May, I went to bed about 11 o'clock, having gone round the house, closed all the doors, and seen everything right as usual—the back door would not lock, but it shut so that it could not be opened from the outside without something to wrench it open—I keep my day's takings in the parlour at the back of the shop—I put it in a bowl and a bag in a drawer in my writing desk which is not locked, the key is in it—it was all silver, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this canvas bag and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a bowl, both in the drawer—I did not hear anything that night; I came down at a quarter to 6 the next morning and found the back door open—I looked at the drawer, and the bowl and bag were gone and three 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packets of half-pence also—another bowl which stood there with some loose halfpence was not gone—I kept them all in the same drawer—no one can get in through this back door unless they get over the back wall 7 feet high, and they would have to get through a stable at the back of that—the stable is closed, but the next door people take in boat horses, and as these horses sometimes go out early in the morning, people might come through the stable and over the wall—from the back door you would have to come up one flight of stairs to the parlour—Rickards had been in my employ on these premises for 12 months—a kitchen chair had been taken into the garden and was against the wall for them to get over with—there were foot-prints—I had seen the money safe at 10.0 the night before—I sent information to the police at 7 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective T</hi>). On Friday, 5th May, I received information and began making inquiries—I went to Mr. Holton's and examined the premises and satisfied myself how the entry had been effected—there is a stable at the rear of an adjoining house, and it was by passing through that and the yard, and mounting a 7-feet wall, getting into the area of the prosecutor's premises and in by the kitchen door—I noticed several foot impressions in the loose mould where flowers were growing, they were apparently shoeless, there were no boot marks—there were different footmarks, some were larger than others—the drawer in which the money had been was pointed out to me—at 10 o'clock on the same night, the 5th, I met the prisoners together in the Lower Butts, Brentford, which is about 300 yards from the prosecutor's place, they were going in the direction of the Town Hall—I stopped Rickard, who knew me, and said "Where have you slept last night, Rickard?"—he said "At Hanwell, along with Chuter"—I turned to Chuter and said "Is Rickard stating the correctness? Be very careful in your replies, I want to know whether Rickard's statement is correct"—he hesitated and said "No, he did not sleep with me at Hanwell"—I said "Did you sleep there?"—he said "No"—I then took hold of Rickard and told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of burglary and entering his late master's house the previous night and stealing 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15«. in silver and bronze—he said "I am b—if I will go with you, Chuter come along with me "—I looked round and Chuter had disappeared—I had seen Chuter before, but I knew nothing of his previous career—I had a scuffle with Rickard and threw him several times, I took him towards the station—on the way, when within about 100 yards of it, opposite Mr. Skinner's nursery, he pulled his hand out of his trouser pocket, put it over the top of a wall, and pulled it down again—he was on my right, nearer the wall; I had hold of him by the left arm—I turned round, turning him round facing the spot where I saw him place his hand, and there I saw this canvas bag, which then contained 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—it was loose then—I have tied it up, it contains 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now—I took possession of it and said "How do you account for this, Rickard?"—he said "Chuter is as bad as me, he has got as much "—I brought him to the station and handed him to the inspector with the bag of money, telling him I was going in search of Chuter—I went in search of Chuter the same night to various public-houses in town at first, and from there to his sister's at Paradise Place, Brentford, where he was lodging—I did not see him there, and went to 23, in the Slips at Hanwell, arriving there about 1.30 a.m—I knocked and was kept waiting for a considerable time—then the prisoner's mother and father opened a window at the top—I eventually gained admission</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">James Ayden's Defence.</hi> I was requested by Arthur to receive letters for him addressed under an assumed name, and I did so, and handed them to him not knowing their contents or anything connected with them until about a week before my arrest, when he told me to open them, and if anything appeared to require an answer I was to take them to him, it not I was to see him in the evening. I opened about a dozen letters, and some here turned to me to take care of, and those were the letters found in my possession. I was handed one or two post-office orders, for which I obtained cash in a fair and legitimate manner. There was nothing in the letters I opened to induce me to come to the conclusion that they related to any fraudulent transactions. I understood my friend was engaged in selling tricycles on commission, and I supposed the correspondence related <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the business. I deny that Brasher cashed the order for me. He is mistaken in my identity. I was placed with men in labourers' and bricklayers' clothes, so that it was impossible to properly identify me.</p>

Ponson by Esq Private Secretary to Her Majesty, St. James's Palace, London"—I opened the envelope and found in it this letter, beginning "Madame," and also this slip of paper in pencil inside—after looking through them I forwarded them to the Home Office. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Sir,—Will you oblige by showing Her Majesty the enclosed? I may say that if you do not credit or comply with it now you may do so when you receive a message to say Prince——is assassinated. Have captured assassins. "—" Madame—I am a Roman Catholic priest, and I have fifty men in the parish' who have been evicted by landlords. These men had banded them<lb/>selves together for your destruction, as they blame you for being the cause of their misery. They, however, promise to leave the country for America on receipt of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per man to defray expenses for selves and families. This amount must be in the hands of my dupe, through whom you receive this, in three weeks from now, or they will commence operations against your life. I know this is treason; that is why I shall make use of a person of standing and character in England for the dupe to transmit your reply to me in Ireland. I strongly advise you to send me the money, as the men are desperate enough, and they will make a series of attempts against your life and those of your sons and daughters, which must succeed in more than one respect. Assuredly you will not hesitate to send what will be but a moiety out of each pocket if all the members of the Royal family subscribe amongst themselves for the required amount, rather than endanger so many precious lives. Ask Prince Leopold how he would like to have a buílet put through him on his wedding day (of which I wish him many happy returns), and die a lingering death, like Garfield. I may add, if no notice is taken of this, I shall absolve them of all their misdeeds, instead, as now, of holding them in check by threats of excommunication—(Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">A WELL-WISHER</hi>.

Young," also this other document marked "Y," and these 12 original telegrams, and the telegram book—looking at the letter alone without seeing anything else, it would be difficult to say whether there has been an attempt, to disguise the writing—it is not in the same angle as the writing in the document "EH"—I have compared the documents and am dearly of opinion without any doubt whatever that they are all of the same handwriting—I came to that conclusion very rapidly.

I am chief constable at Donoaster—on 28th April I went to the superintendent's office, where the prisoner was employed, and asked him if his name was Albert Young he said, "Yes "—I showed him the letter, the subject of this indictment, and told him he was charged with writing it and sending it to Sir H. Ponsonby, Her Majesty's Secretarv, and threatening the life of the Queen and Royal Family—he said, "I never wrote that letter; I never did such a thing "—I took him in custody, and brought him up to London.</p>

I had not then arranged with Mr. Fenton what amount I would claim—Inspector Skilman, of Dalston Junction, brought Mr. Fenton to me—I knew the defendant's age at the station—I know nothing about changing an ordinary charge punishable by a 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., fine, into an indictable offence—it was not suggested to me that as the defendant was under age we could get something from his brother—I have been here since Monday—I have been about three or four times in a public-house drinking—I think Mr. Denny was drinking with me once, and he may have twice, and Mr. Fenton once—I did not leave the pathway at Chingford on the right side, and cross to the grass land without looking to see if there was any horse near—my daughter did not run against the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Hanover Road, Leyton, and let horses in Epping Forest—on Sunday, 7th May, I saw the defendant and his friend, on horseback on the left side of the road going to the hotel—I was on the same side, leaning against a tree—I noticed Mr. King and his daughter—I saw a struggle in the road—the horse was going at the rate of four or five miles an hour—I have been used to horses all my life, and am a very good judge of pace—the old gentleman ran on one side and ran back again; his daughter ran at the horse; they both ran in the horse's way, if they had not he would have cleared them—if they had gone straight the horse would not have touched them—from what I saw, it was impossible for the defendant to have avoided the accident, because they ran in his way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at New Hall, near Chertsey, and am a labourer—I remember Sunday, 19th March—I was near the Victoria Inn, Wood Lane; the prisoner was with me—we left the Victoria about two minutes before 3 o'clock, and went down the river bank by the canal side; there is a river and a canal there—we went down the canal bank—we got to some land which always went with Mr. Lindsay's farm, and after we got</p>

               <p>over the bridge I stopped back to do a job, and the prisoner went on 10 yards in front of me; he then pulled a lucifer out of his pocket and struck it, and put it down to the heath—there 13 a common there—as soon as he had left the heath he ran away over the lock-gates—I tried to put the tire out, but I could not do it—I saw nothing more of the pri-soner till the next Tuesday morning, this being on Sunday—he then said "That fire did flare, did not it?"—I said "The greater fool you to do it; you might have got me into trouble"—he said nothing more till 19th April, when I was going down the road and saw him again between the Queen Victoria and New Hall Road, whenhe pitched into me—he said "What business had you to split upon me about that fire?"—I said "I told the truth and nothing but the truth"—he struck me three times, and I got away from him, and went round the other way home—I did not strikehim; he struck me about the head, and I stood still and did nothing; I was not going to getmyself into trouble—there was no other fire burning on the Sunday—I first mentioned the fire on the Monday morning, when I went to work for Mr. Terry, the landlord of the Vic-toria—he is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know the date of my first examination before the Magistrate—I have told you all about it now, and I can't say any more—it was in April that I first gave evidence to the police—it was not on 3rd May that I first gave evidence in Court as regards this matter—it was in April when the prisoner came to me—it was in May when I went to Chertsey—it would be 8th April when the policeman came to me; that was some time before the row between me and the prisoner—I often saw the prisoner between the 8th and 19th; we were always being in com-pany—I was not in his company when he pitched into me.</p>

I saw him often and was in his company, but did not speakto him—I never spoke to him till the night he pitched into me—I mean to say that between the 8th and 19th I saw him constantly, but never spoke to him—where I saw him was working on the railroad—I was working on the side of the railroad, and so was he—the policeman came to me there—I saw him very often between the 8th and 19th—I cannot tell how often—it was on the 19th that he pitched into me—I never told anything between the 8th and the 19th I told the policeman when he came to me, that would be the 8th April, I should say—I told him about the fire whenhe asked me about it, that was on the 8th—the policeman's name is Robert West—when the prisoner pitched into me on the 19th I did not hit him in return, I stood there and received it because I was obliged to, as I would not have any <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was never hit before—I stood there till I got away—he hit me three blows—on the day when the fire took place I had drank two pints of beer at the Victoria—I was there about an hour; I was none the worse for it—I do not recollect lying under a tree, nor near a bridge.</p>

I am agent to the trustees of Mr. Lindsay's will—they have some ground at Woodham—I have been to see the ground since 19th March—thatwas on the Friday after the 19th—I saw that a fire had taken place recently—it was on the trustees' ground—it is enclosed by the canal bank, but there is no hedge; it is private property—there are no rights of sale; it belongs solely to the landlord—between six and seven acres were burnt.</p>
