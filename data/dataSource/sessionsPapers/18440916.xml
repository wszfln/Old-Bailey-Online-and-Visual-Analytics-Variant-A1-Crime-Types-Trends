                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, and live in Church-street, Hackney, and have done so thirteen years. On the 16th of July I was in Silver-street, Falcon-square—I had been to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and felt faint—I went into an eating-house there, and called for a penny-worth of pud<lb/>ding—the prisoner served me—it was very dirty, and I said I did not like it—he snatched it from my hand, and said, "If you do not go out of the shop, I will kick you out"—he ran round, and kicked me in the bladder—I had said the pudding was bad, and asked him to give it me back, to give to some poor person in the street—I had paid him for it—he knocked me into the street, and kicked me in different parts of my body—I went across to the shop of Mr. Oram, to ask for a policeman—I had been there a minute, and the prisoner rushed in, and thrust a fork right through my nose—I did not know he was coming—this was while I was asking for a pencil to take down his name—he ran the fork into my face, and said, "Smell, you b----"—he made a hole in my nose—I had given him no provocation—my nose bled pro<lb/>fusely—I could not see—I was led to a chemist's shop—they gave me a draught, and dressed my nose—the policeman took the prisoner to the station, having seen him do it—I kept my bed for more than a week, but did not go to any medical man, as I had been under Mr. Lloyd, at the hospital, for an inward complaint, and had been to see him when this happened—I had not kept my bed before.</p>

I had a warrant, which I produce, given to me by Mr. Colchester, with which, on the 6th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to the house where the prisoners lived, in Colchester-terrace, Old Brompton (I had been there a week before, to reason with them, to see if I could not persuade them to leave the house quietly without using other means—I was not able to do so, all I got from them was abusive lan<lb/>guage) a female was entering the house with some bread, and I went in after her—Johnson was with me—immediately the gate was open I went up to the street-door—Johnson stopped at the outer gate to prevent their locking it—there is a front garden to the house—the door was opened to let the female in, and I pushed in behind her—directly we got in the two prisoners came up from below with two very thick sticks, something like broom handles—I showed them my warrant, and told them I had a warrant to distrain upon their goods for Mr. Colchester, for rent—they said they knew that I had been about the premises a long time trying to get in, and now I had got in they</p>

About nine o'clock, on the morning of the 6th of Sept., I saw Spicer at the corner of the Green, in Marlborough-road—I saw his hat, it was bent on one side, it appeared as if it had been struck by a weapon—he seemed to be very much flurried—there was blood on his arm, and on the side of his coat—I afterwards went to the prisoner's house, to watch if the goods should be moved—while waiting there I saw both the prisoners at the front window, and at different windows of the house—I saw them come to the window several times during the day with a kind of small-sword, sticks, and different things—I saw something like this bar—I spoke to them about seven o'clock that evening, and said, "You are a set of cowardly rascals, to strike such a little fellow as that, so many of you"—William replied, "Not so many of us; it was only us two;" putting his hand on David's shoulder—some person behind said, "<hi rend="italic">Tut</hi>, hold your tongue, you fool"—they said they would serve me worse than that if I came there—Wheeler was with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant, and live at No. 15, Gloucester-grove, opposite No. 2, Colchester-terrace. On Friday morning, the 6th of Sept., at ten minutes to eight o'clock, I went to answer our bell, and saw a man stand<lb/>ing at the end of our gate, about twelve feet from our house—my curiosity was rather excited—I walked to the gate, to ask him his business, and as I did so, he walked round the corner, crossed the road to No. 2, and shook the railing—as he did so, a smaller man appeared at No. 1—I should know them both again—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Spicer and Johnson</hi>)—they are the men—about a minute after Johnson's shaking the railing he got over, and at the same time Spicer got over No. 1, passed the kitchen window of No. 1, and <hi rend="italic">perched</hi> him<lb/>self up at No. 2—there is a party-wall and railing between the houses—I saw these men get over, and as they got over, the door of No. 2 opened about the space of a quarter of a yard—Spicer was then <hi rend="italic">perched</hi> up on the railings of No. 2—as soon as the door was opened, he jumped down on the threshold of No. 2, and endeavoured, with his back against the door and his right hand against the partition, to force his way in—his left hand and leg was inside the door—his foot and arm seemed to be inside—I do not know who had opened the door—I think there was a chain up, which prevented the door from opening any further, but I think there was sufficient room for Spicer to pass through, for he seemed to slip through—I saw Johnson on the threshold of the door, holding on by the knocker, and calling, "Murder"—he held the door, and completely jammed Spicer in it—I saw Spicer get in by some means, and Johnson pulled the door to—he took up a stick and his own hat, apparently, and came across the railing screaming "Murder" all the way—he asked some man to help him, but he would not, and he ran round Gloucester-grove West, screaming, "Murder"—the policeman came a different way,</p>

               <p>and in three or four minutes, (by the time I had shut my door, and got up to the drawing-room window,) William Rogers appeared on the steps, and said, "If you want your man, you will find him at No. 4"—and as he spoke the words, out came Spicer from No. 4—he did not stop for the landlady's opening the gate, but leaped across, and said, "I will give that man in charge"—he came over the back walls, and came running out, I should say in three minutes after he had got in—if I said four I should be on the outside—it excited great laughter, for he was no sooner in the house than he was out again at the back—Wil<lb/>liam Rogers sung out, "Don't come here again"—he threw the stick and hat over the railings, and said, "Put on your hat, or you will get cold; and if any man comes let Mr. Colchester come"—Johnson was not in the house at all.</p>

               <p>the 30th of Aug., about eight o'clock, I received information of the loss of these sheep, in consequence of which, I with another policeman, took the two prisoners into custody—I took Grainge leaning against the back gate of his own premises, at Harefield, about a quarter of a mile from where the mutton was found—I took Foy in the road, about 200 yards from Grainge's house—I noticed on the right shoulder of Grainge's jacket marks of fresh blood, and observed some cliver-seeds on his jacket—I found a dog fastened up in his house, and a basket hung against the wall, with about a quarter of a pound of mutton suet, and some pieces of mutton, which had been recently cut off the loin, about half a pound—I afterwards had two loins of mutton delivered to me by young Mr. Trumper—I compared the mutton found in the bag with the loins, and they corresponded with both loins—I went next day to the field near the ditch, and found the dog I had found in Grainge's house lying on this smock frock, at the spot where the loins of mutton had been found—I went there on Saturday evening about six o'clock, which was the next day—I also found a piece of breast of mutton laying about five yards from the dog, weighing about nine pounds.</p>

I closed my house exactly at twelve o'clock—I went to bed about twenty-five minutes to one—before I went to bed I looked into the bar and tap-room—I went down into the cellars to turn off the gas—I saw no person either in the bar, tap-room, or cellar—there are a pair of glass folding-doors at the foot of the stairs, inclosing the tap-room and bar from the other parts of the house—I locked those doors before I went to bed—I took the key with me—I did not leave any person up in the house after me—I came down next morning about two minutes past eight—I found the glass doors locked—I unlocked them myself—I saw a chair which was in the bar over night, in front of a door which leads out into the street—I went to the doors, tried them, and found them unbolted—they were fast the night before—I found all the doors in the bar open, and some cupboard-doors—I missed 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the till—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of farthings wrapped up in brown paper, with "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>of it—the articles stated were among them—the prisoner George was my servant for about two months until a fortnight before the time—he gave me warning himself—I went to his house with a policeman, that day or the next in Rose-buildings, Fetter-lane—he lives with his mother—he has no father—I had missed things on the Sunday before—at his mother's house I found a waistcoat which was in my wardrobe when I went out on the Wednesday morning, to the best of my belief, but I am not sure, not having counted over my waistcoats—on my dressing-table I found this piece of iron—on com<lb/>paring it with the chambers below, it was evidently the bell-pull of the cham<lb/>bers of Messrs. Strangeway's and Walter's—an attempt had been made to force my dressing-case, and in doing so a pair of scissors of mine were broken—they were with my razors—the lock was not forced—I was obliged to force it my<lb/>self, afterwards, and found the pieces of scissors in the dressing-case—I went a second time to the mother's house in Rose's-buildings, and watched the prisoner George in—I said to him that his brother was in custody, and that I wished to clear his character, and I thought he would have no objection to allow me to examine his chest, or rather to confront him with a witness I had, who saw him in the Inn, carrying out my washing-box, in which the articles were taken—that person was Mary Graham, one of my neighbour's servants—after taking him to her, we took him to his master, Mr. Nettleshed's chambers, No. 15, Clifford's-inn—he had a desk there—I asked Mr. Nettleshed's per<lb/>mission to examine it—Mr. Nettleshed himself went to his desk in his pre<lb/>sence—we examined it, and in it found a bundle tied up in a pocket-handker<lb/>chief, in which were some towels and a table-cloth—I think that table-cloth was not marked, but we found that some one had marked it in the name of "S. Axtell"—we examined the desk more minutely, and concealed between some steel pens, in a box, we found a pearl pin, which I can identify—I had that pin on my person the morning before—I had a deal-box in my chambers which I send every fortnight to Richmond with my linen to be washed—it was in the chambers when I left on Wednesday morning—that was gone, to<lb/>gether with the key, which was hanging up in the corner—I can identify this pin by its being loose.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father in the law, at No. 10, Clifford's Inn; I know the prisoner John, by now and then meeting him in Inn—I have seen George with him. On the 4th of Sept. George came to me, about half-past twelve o'clock, and said his brother asked me whether I would mind a box—I asked him how large it was—he showed me the size—I said, "Very well, I will"—about five minutes afterwards John came up to me, and asked me the same question—I consented to mind it—he said he would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—George brought the box about half-past two, with a young man, who I supposed to be a porter, and he gave the man some halfpence, but I do not recollect how much—the box was left with me—I saw no more of John till seven in the evening, when he was outside the window—I went out to him, and asked if he was ready to take the box—he said, "No," he would rather I should keep it till the morning, but he would give me the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "No, I will have it in the morning"—he said, "You had better take it now," he threw down a shilling, and asked me to get change—he asked me to let him look over the box—he did so, and gave me a shirt, some collars, drawers, a nightcap, and a coloured cotton handkerchief—I thought, he being kind enough to give me these things, I would not take the sixpence, so I gave him the shilling back—he put it into his pocket again—he put a few things into a bundle, and took them away (I saw no more of him till Tuesday, when he was at Guildhall)—I said, "Who gave you those things"—he said he had a cousin at sea, and his aunt made him a present of some of them, and some</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor, and live in Dolphin-place, Holborn. On the 17th of Aug. the prisoner and Jane Forfy came to my room, which is on the first floor—the prisoner struck her, because she would not go home with him when he desired her—I told him he ought to be ashamed to ill-use her in that manner—he then struck me in the mouth, and knocked me down—I had given him no provocation—I got up, took him by the collar of his coat, and wanted to put him out of doors—I half opened it—he put his foot to the door, closed it, and turned into the room again—he dropped on the floor, and picked up a pair of button-hole scissors—in wanting to get away from me he fell on the floor—I did not knock him down—he ran at me with the scissors, and stabbed me on the forehead, breast, arm, and groin—I still insisted on getting him out—I got him to the door several times, but could not get him out—he had the scissors in his hand all the time—I wrenched them out of his hands—he then fell on the floor, and picked up the large pair of shears, and stabbed me with them in the back, in two or three places, and on the left side—having so many stabs, and the blood pouring from the wounds, I was</p>

               <p>so exhausted that I fell on the floor quite senseless—I had been drinking with the prisoner previously—I had had a drink out of a pot of beer, and there was a quartern of rum came in, which was divided between the prisoner, Forfy, and myself—that was all—I went to King's College Hospital on the Sunday, and was there eight or ten days.</p>

On Saturday night, the 17th of Aug., about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of Dolphin-place, saying, "Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do?"—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "Oh, dear! a man has been knocking me about"—his hands were covered with blood—I asked him to show me where the man was that had been knocking him about—he went into Dolphin-place—directly he got in sight of No. 2, he pointed up his finger, and said, "That is where the man is that has been knocking me about"—he directly turned round, and said, "Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do? I must go home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> "—about ten minutes after he was gone away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I went down my beat, went into Dolphin-place, and heard loud cries, "The man is stabbed"—I went into No. 2, and saw the prosecutor lying in his own blood—he was quite insensible—a surgeon was there at the time, and three or four women—the room appeared all overflowing with blood, a yard or more each side of him.</p>

I was in Aldgate about nine o'clock on Friday night, the 23rd—I saw Savage following the prosecutor round the corner of Mr. Moses's new buildings—he went up on tiptoe, got hold of his pocket, went back, and joined M'Carthy and Fitzgerald—I saw him speak to them, but did not hear him—they all three then went on, I sup<lb/>pose three or four yards—M'Carthy then rose the tail of his right-hand pocket up, and took the handkerchief out—I cannot say with which hand he rose it up—the gentleman turned round, and they had a scuffle—I crossed over—he threw the handkerchief down—Fitzgerald picked it up, and clapped it between her legs—I took it from her—Savage immediately ran away—I am sure I saw him go up and feel the gentleman's pocket with one of his hands—it was the same pocket—I had seen the three prisoners together before.</p>

I had 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in sovereigns and half<lb/>sovereigns, which I kept at the back of a drawer in the sitting-room in a beaded purse, which was in a velvet bag—I did not keep the drawer locked—there was no lock to it—I saw it all safe within a fortnight of losing it—on the 13th of Sept., at a quarter to nine o'clock, on going to my drawer I missed the bag, purse, and money—I told the prisoner of my loss—she said she was very sorry for it—I sent for a policeman—I asked her if she had bought any clothes, or spent any money—she gave me some information, then went down stairs, and brought up a dirty cotton bag soiled as if it had fallen into the privy—she said, "See what I have found in the water-closet"—the police<lb/>man took it out of her hand—she said there was money in it—it contained 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, all my money but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was not my bag I found, it was Mrs. Fairbrother's bag—the policeman searched the water-closet, and found my beaded purse covered over with a half hand<lb/>kerchief—it is a pan water-closet—the handkerchief did not belong to me—the prisoner was in my room at times, and I trusted her with the key of it—Mr. or Mrs. Fairbrother might have gone to my room, but nobody else except the prisoner—nobody had suggested that it might be thrown down the privy—I had said all I could for her to endeavour to try and find the purse, and offered 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; if it was found—I did not discover that she had been spending much money—there were several new things in her box, but not of any value—Mrs. Fairbrother is not here—I asked the prisoner if she had these things given to her, or had bought them—she said she gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them a few days before, that her father had bought them for her, and afterwards that he gave her part of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at Southgate, in the parish of Edmonton. About a fortnight before the 2nd of Sept., the prisoners came to the coach stables close to my shop—they came and asked me if there was any conveyance going a Potter's-bar—(I had never seen them berfore)—I said there would be none before five o'clock—they said that would be too long to wait, and asked if there was any public-house where they could get a pot of beer—I said, "Yes," and they said they would walk down the street with me—we went to my sister's who keeps a beer-shop—I remained there my dinner hour, and then went back—we went into the Cherry Tree, and had a quartern of gin—they then bid me good morning, and we parted—on the 2nd of Sept. I saw them again—I saw Taylor first, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, in a horse and cart, opposite my shop, with Mr. Collins, a rat-catcher, who lives at Enfield—I asked Collins about some bricks—they stopped—they afterwards went down the street—I did not see Taylor again till after eight, when he came into my sister's house, which is opposite my house—my shop is a quarter of a mile from my house—Bacon was not there—T ylor came in, called for half-a-pint of beer, and, seeing me there, he said he might as well make it a pint—we had a pint of beer, and, then crossed over to my house—there was a fair at Southgate on that day—my wife and I had before dinner arranged to go to the fair—she was not at home when Taylor and I went over—she was gone to the—I went down to clean myself—I fastened up the house when I left—the shutters were not up—I locked the door, and secured all the places—I quitted the house at a wuarter past eight o'clock—I and Taylor then went to the fair—my mother went with us from the beer—shop—I met Bacon at Consby's beer-shop, close to the fair—(I had seen him before at Consby's that same evening)—he proceeded to the fair with</p>

               <p>us, and there we joined my wife—we went into Pickard's booth—there was dancing going on there—I paid for the prisoners to go in—they said they would settle when we got in—I wanted Bacon to dance with my wife while I went to look after a friend—he wanted me to stop, and then said he would go with me—he did not dance—I heard no conversation between Bacon and Taylor—they left the booth between nine and ten—Taylor left first, and Bacon, I should say, half an hour after—Taylor said nothing to me when he went away—I saw nothing of them afterwards—when I left my house that night, I had in a little box within a trunk a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, fifteen sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns—there were also four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes in another part of the box, and a metal watch hanging by the fire-place in the parlour—we returned home at near twelve o'clock, and missed the property stated in the indictment—the watch had a paper or lining inside, by which I should know it—my watch-maker had given the watch to me between eight and nine that morning—it had been to be repaired—the lining has since been produced to me, and I am certain it is the same—we found everything up stairs all thrown about, and strewed all over the place—I found this screw, belonging to the parlour window, on the floor—it fastened the window from the inside, but the point of it just comes through, so that a person outside, by pressing it, could <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it in—the window was opened, so that anyone could get in—the lock of the door was not disturbed—the entry must have been made by the window.</p>

I left my house, about six o'clock, to go to the fair at Southgate—I left my husband's metal watch on a small brass bracket under the mantel-shelf—we had a large linen chest up stairs, by the bedside, in which was this little box, which contained a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, fifteen sovereigns, and four half<lb/>sovereigns, a piece of paper, and a sixpence—that was all safe when I left the house—I fastened up the house, and gave the key to my husband—I left no one inside—I went out with my little boy—the prisoners and my husband after<lb/>wards joined me at the fair about seven o'clock—we went into a booth—my hus<lb/>band paid for the prisoners—they said they would pay us again—my husband wanted to come out of the booth to see some friends, and he said to Bacon, "Take charge of my wife, and stand up in the dance"—Bacon said, "Oh, no, you had better, as the dance is commencing, stand up with your wife your<lb/>self"—Bacon refused—the moment we got up to dance Bacon disappeared—Taylor left first—they had both left within half an hour after nine o'clock—before they went Bacon was sitting beside my husband—Taylor never sat down at all, but seemed fidgetty—Bacon got up, and whispered very close in Taylor's ear—Bacon, noticing me, looked rather hard, and said, "I merely asked him if he had been playing a trick with my snuff-box"—Taylor said, "Oh, no, it is all right, all right;" and a few minutes after that Taylor dis<lb/>appeared—I saw no more of them that evening—we left the booth at eleven o'clock—on going home. I found the parlour window drawn back, and the</p>

I went with one of my neighbours to a public-house at the corner of Hungerford-street—the prisoner came and sat alongside me—he chucked me under the chin, and several ways meddled with me that I did not like—I told him to keep his hands off me—he was a stranger to me—I had a pint of beer before me—he said, "Old girl, I shall drink"—I told him he should not—on that he called me a b—b—I told him I was not so—he said I was, and a wh—as well—I directly took up the pot the beer was in, and said I would throw the beer over him—I threw it over him—he directly took up the pot, and struck me with it—I got the blow on my arm, and then again he struck me with it across the head—I cannot tell whether my arm was up or down when he struck me—my head bled very much—he struck me twice, but only once on the head, that I know of—he had attempted to strike me with his hands before, and the gentlemen in the place tried to hinder him from striking me—he attempted to strike me several times with one hand, and the pot in the other—when be struck me with the pot, the men stood before him, and tried to prevent him—I came outside, and first went to a doctor, and then to the hospital—I have remained ill ever since, and am very ill now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith and jeweller, at No. 18, Poultry, in the parish of St. Mildred the Virgin. I have two partners—the prisoner Edwin was in our service about four years, and left about nine months since—Wil<lb/>liam was between three and four years in our service, and was so still on the 7th of Sept. last—he was a sort of under-shopman—it was his duty to attend to the shop in the daytime, and of an evening, to see that no one entered the premises—he slept behind the shop, in a sort of lobby connected with the shop—he was placed there to have personal charge of the shop in the night—our property was kept in cases—I have seen some articles produced by the officer—they were usually kept in a glass case on the counter—we kept watches in the same place as the chains, pins, and brooches—the cases were secured by a lock—he was not intrusted with the key of those cases at night—either myself or brother, whichever was stopping latest, locked up the cases, and put the keys into an iron safe—that was at the close of business in the evening—we locked up the place, and took away the keys—William was directed on no account to let any one in to sleep on the premises—here are three watches, Nos. 29084, 29114, and 29088—they are the property of myself and partners, and have never been sold—on Monday, the 9th of Sept., in consequence of information I had of a loss, I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol—I there saw Edwin Hart ridge in custody—after I had seen him I re<lb/>turned with the officers to my shop—I found William Hartridge in the counting-house—Inspector Waller asked him if he knew where his brother was—he said he did not—I then gave him in charge—he burst into tears, and made a statement to me—he did not make any statement about the watch that was pawned in Aug., or about anything that happened before that time—the watches produced were purchased of Mr. Stauffer—on examining my stock, I found they were missing—I had missed neck-chains prior to this, prior to my being aware that the watches were gone—I missed a neck-chain about the first week in July—shortly before that time I had seen that neck<lb/>chain in the possession of William Hartridge—it had been purchased of a gentleman named Taylor—I had taken it out of the window, for the purpose of having it washed, and gave it to William—I have seen two breaat-pins, with stones in them—they are my property, and have my private mark on them—there are two brooches—to the best of my belief they are ours—these have not our mark—we have such in our stock—I cannot say whether any are missing.</p>

I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol, and there saw Edwin Hartridge in custody—on my return to the shop I found William in the counting-house—the inspector asked him if he knew where his brother was—he said he did not know—William went home every Sunday morning, and returned at seven in the evening—I gave him in charge—he then bunt out crying—he said he knew his brother Edwin had been keeping very bad com<lb/>pany lately; that he had allowed him to sleep with him on Friday evening; that he awoke at six o'clock on Saturday morning, and found him behind our counter; that he then went and said to him, looking at the case, "I know you have taken some watches from this case;" he said, "No, I hate not;" he said, "I know you have; you know Mr. Sarl has missed several things lately, and we get blamed for it when you take them;" he then said, "If you don't give up the watches I shall give you in charge;" that his brother denied having any; that he then, as his brother was going out of the door, took him by the coat, and took a gold watch and a silver watch out of his pocket, and kept them in his possession until my coming to town, and that after I had unlocked the case he put them back again—I then said, "How could your brother get at the case?"—he said, "O, Sir, he can do it with a pair of shop scissors"—I said, "What, open this case with a pair of scissors? show me how"—he tried to do it, but could not—there was no mark on the case as if scissors had been applied to it—he then went with the policeman—it is a very unusual thing to have a fire in the room next the shop early in the morning in Sept.—the shop is dark when the shutters are up—it was the business of the witness Batson to come at seven o'clock in the morning—there would not be light enough to see the means of getting at the property as late as seven, without the light of the fire, or a candle.</p>

Mr. William Bent is one of them, and there are others—they are governors of the poor—the prisoner was employed by them as collector of the poor-rates—he has been so for many years—I have the poor-rate book here for the year 1843—the rate is made annually, and col<lb/>lected in three instalments—it was the regular course of business to give the prisoner a copy of the rate for the purpose of his carrying it in his pocket to go about to collect the rate—that was done with respect to the rate for 1843—I saw him with the book in his possession, and there were always blank printed forms of receipts given him to give to the parties who paid the rates—it was his duty to pay the money he received to the bankers—here is the printed account of the rules and regulations—it is printed in the head of the book which is given him to collect with—I have here the book in which it was his custom to enter the sums he received in the course of each week—the week ending on the 4th of May last, is the last account which he rendered to me—here is the account of what he charged himself with having received in the preceding week—it was his duty to render that account to me every week, and he did so every week; and upon my checking it with his account, it was his custom to pay the money into the bankers'; and then it was his duty to bring me the receipt from the bankers', to show that he had paid it in—on the week ending the 4th of May, he charges himself with having re<lb/>ceived 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought that account to me on Monday the 6th of May—he did not bring me a receipt showing that he had paid this amount into the banker's—in consequence of that, I went in pursuance of directions, and saw the prisoner at his house on Tuesday, the 7th of May—I asked him the reason this money had not been paid in—he hesitated some time, and then said he had not paid it in—I then said, "Is that all, is there nothing else; there are some large amounts outstanding; have any of these been re<lb/>ceived?"—he said, "They have"—he came to me on the following evening, and dictated to me a list of the sums in which he was a defaulter—the sums which he had received, and not accounted for—they amounted to 538<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that included the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

About eleven o'clock on that Saturday night, I was on duty in Swan-lane—I saw Kelly at the corner of the Anglesea public-house—the prisoner and the prosecutor were together at the bottom of the place, about twenty yards off—I walked down the place, and Kelly ran down and said, "Jane, Jane, the policeman is coming"—and then Kelly and the prisoner came up the place arm in arm, and the prosecutor in the middle of them—after they passed me I heard a cry of police—I went up—the prosecutor said he had lost a purse, two sovereigns, and two half-crowns—I asked the prisoner where the money and the purse was—she said she knew nothing about it—I seized her right hand and said, "What have you got?"—she said, "Nothing"—I opened her hand and found a sovereign and a shilling—I heard something fall—I looked down and found one sove<lb/>reign which she was trying to conceal with the gravel—I took it up and asked for a light, searched, but did not find the purse—it was afterwards brought to me by Lawrence—this is the purse.</p>

I brought some pigs from Ireland—I was at Leighton Buzzard, in Bedfordshire, this day three weeks—I had twenty-five pigs there—I saw the prisoner there—I sold two or three pigs to several persons—the prisoner came over to me, he sat down by me, and asked me if I was going to Ireland—I told him if I could sell all these pigs I would go that evening; and another man came and said what had I got—I said, "Eight pigs"—I said I wanted 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; for them—that man offered me 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and the prisoner said be would give me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the man that bid me 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; said, "You shall have them," and he walked away—the prisoner did not want them, and I sold them to the other man on the Wednesday—the prisoner told me he should like to go with me to Ireland—I said if he would come with me I would do all in my power for him—we then had something to drink—we slept on Tuesday night at a public-house in Leighton Buzzard—the prisoner and I slept in the same house, but not the same room—the man who bought the pigs paid me 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes; one sovereign, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—t ey were country notes—on the Wednesday morning I sent the ostler with the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes, and the one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note over to the bank to get them changed for Bank of England notes—he brought me back two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Bank of England notes—I took out my purse, which contained some sovereigns and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes—I put these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note into it, and put my purse into my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I went down to the rail-road to get home, and met the prisoner again—he asked me if I was going—I said, "Yes, I am"—he said, "You are time enough, you had better come</p>

On the 24th of Aug., I arose about half-past five o'clock—I looked out of my window and saw the prisoner on a building under my window—I saw him roll up the lead and throw it into the yard—as soon as I could get my shoes and stockings on I went down and heard something very heavy roll down the kitchen stairs—I came down and told Mr. M'Carthy—t e prisoner came into the passage and said he would make it all right—he said he had been running after the man—I know the prisoner, and I know he is the person who was rolling up the lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-five years of age, and am the son of the prisoner, by his first wife—she died about fourteen years ago—at the time of her death I was living with my father—I have two sisters living—I remember my father marrying Emeline Jarman, six or seven years ago—I was living in the house at the time—my father kept a green-grocer's shop-—Emeline was more than sixteen years old—she lived with my father for eighteen months after her marriage—I have seen a person named Shep<lb/>herd come there of a night—I believe there were proceedings taken by my father against Shepherd, for criminal conversation with his wife—I was not a witness on that trial—there was a trial, which came on at Guildhall in 1838—I did not go backwards and forwards, knowing that case was going on—I did not see the attorney—it was known in our family that there were proceedings against a person named Shepherd, and that was about 1838—I was living with my father in that year—in 1839 I used to go backwards and forwards to my father's—I know it was reported in our family that Emeline Jarman was dead—I do not know how the report came there.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an attorney since 1801. In 1838 I was in<lb/>structed by a lady to defend an action for one Shepherd—that lady if not here—I do not know whether the prisoner was the plaintiff in that action or not—the action went to the ground, because, I believe, they could bring no proof of any kind of malice, and there was an agreement that the case should be withdrawn—both the counsel abandoned the case—they could not make out the case of malice, and the plaintiff could not sustain his action—I know nothing about the record—I have known the prisoner about three years, and have been his attorney several times—I have found him in all his dealings just and honest—I know that this prosecution is brought to prevent his getting possession of some estate in Angel-gardens—I have been told by the parties, if he would give that up, they would withdraw this prosecution.</p>

On the 24th of July the prisoner came to my shop—he asked me for the porter who removed a glass for him before—I told him he was below, and was a tenant of mine—(he had removed a glass for him eight days before)—the porter went with the prisoner, and came back to me in about twenty minutes, to ask me if I would assist him—I went with him to a house—I did not know that Mrs. Dyke lived at the house I went to—I did not make any inquiries—I went with the porter to the house, and the prisoner was there—I assisted the porter in removing one large chair and two small ones, a sofa, a fender, fire-irons, and two small pictures—we took them to Mr. Knapp's, a pawn<lb/>broker, in the Edgware-road—the prisoner went with me, and carried the two small pictures himself—none of us went into the shop—I cannot say whether the pawnbroker's man came to the door or not, as I was on the other side of the pavement, where I had just put down the sofa to wipe myself—Mr. Knapp declined to take the sofa, but agreed to take the other things—I then went with the sofa and the prisoner to Mr. Hawkins', a broker, where he offered it for sale—he asked the prisoner whose it was, and he said his aunt's—I heard him say that, and I thought he was authorized by his aunt to sell those things—I do not know how much Mr. Hawkins gave him for the sofa—(the prisoner never paid me for this job, I did it all for nothing)—Mr. Hawkins asked him if there were any other things, and he said there was a chair or two; we went back, and got the large chair, and two small ones—he sold them to Mr. Hawkins, but I was outside—I did not go in—the prisoner then said, "Go and get a drop of beer at the corner of Steven-street, I shall want you again in a short time"—we went, but he did not come, and we went back to the aunt's house, but he was not there—I had left my hat and rope in the aunt's house, and there they are now, I suppose—when we first went to the aunt's house we went into the parlour—we heard a female voice up stairs, and thought it was the aunt; and when he was going to sell the things, he went back to her, as he said, to know if she would take the money—he came back, and said it was too little, but she supposed she must take it—we never received a farthing.</p>

I bought the sofa of the prisoner I believe, but I cannot swear to him—it was a lad about his age—it was brought by him and two men whom I have seen about—I should not have bought it unless those men had been with him—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the sofa, an easy chair, and two other chairs—I repaired the sofa, and sold that some time ago for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not recollect whether either of the men said anything—the prisoner appeared to be master in the case, and said he was selling the things for his aunt.</p>

Henry Oliver is my brother, and Mary Oliver is my mother—I was made acquainted by the prosecutor's own words of the way in which he was living—I went to remonstrate with him several times—he said on one occasion, "I owe your mother a grudge for what she has said of me, and I am determined to be revenged of her"—he had turned my brother out of doors all the Saturday night—my mother had upbraided him for bringing home two women, Mrs. Bagley and Mrs. Dow, in the boy's sight, and he said the women were in the house that Sunday that I went there with my father—I took a pair of trowsers to my mother to be mended, and there was some silver in the pocket of them, and this silver that is pro<lb/>duced has all the appearance of it—it is a sort of thing that I use in my business—I gave my mother silver like this out of the pocket of my trow<lb/>sers instead of money—I have seen my brother with an eye-glass like this—it was broken when I saw him with it—it is an imitation of tortoise-shell I believe.</p>

I know the prisoner—on Friday, the 23rd of Aug., I saw him and another man—they took their meals at my house that day, and I saw them sawing timber near my house—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the other man who spoke to me, but one of them, in the presence of the other, asked me if I wanted to buy some chips—I asked where they were, and whom they belonged to, and they said to themselves—I said I would go and look at them—I went into the yard and looked at them, and purchased them—they were chips, which are the refuse of the cuttings—on the Saturday they came again to my tap-room, and had three pots of beer, and said they had some more chips—I went out, and saw them cutting timber—I said, "These are the chips you mean?"—they said, "Yes"—I said they had had rather more beer than the chips were worth—(it is a natural conclusion that the chips are their perquisites)—there was a piece of elm timber lying by the side, and they said if I would give them another pot I should have that slab—I took my basket of chips in, and asked Hagger, who was standing by, to bring the slab into my stable, which he did—I went into my stable the next morning, and saw four other slabs beside the one I had bought of them, and two ends of trees, which I believe to be two elbows—the policeman took them.</p>

I was employed by Mr. Lyne Stephens, to sell a house full of furniture, in Roehampton-lane—I sold them on the 21st—I got possession of the house in which the furniture was on the 14th of Aug.—I know the prisoners—Mead was generally in my employment, and the others occasionally, only for this sale—I placed them all in the house to take care of the furniture—Mead was put in on the 14th of August, and Pond and Henry on the 19th—I paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—in consequence of something I heard on the day of the sale, I went to the Sun public-house, on the morning after the sale—I had missed a mattress—I saw two hall lamps at the Sun—in consequence of something the landlord told me, I went to Rollins, a broker in the neighbour<lb/>hood, and there saw two sets of fire-iron, and part of another set on the floor—I took them up—he went with me to the place where the sale was held—we met Henry on the road—I had the fire-irons in my hand, and said, "Henry, do you know anything of these?"—he said, "I do not"—I said, "Well," come back with me to the sale "—he did so, and Rollins also—when we got to the house, the other two prisoners were there—I brought Rollins into their presence, and said, "Rollins, which of these did you buy the fire-irons and the lamps of?"—he said they were all together—I said, "You have no au<lb/>thority to buy these;" and said I should give them into custody for stealing them—he said he had bought them that same morning, that he had paid 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, that he gave part of the money to Mead and part to Pond, and they were all present when he paid the money—he said he paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to each of the two—the prisoners made no answer to that—I sent another man I had there for a policeman, who came and took them into custody—there were two sets of fire-irons, and part of another set, produced—the table was not pro<lb/>duced then—it was afterwards, before the Magistrate—it had been sold by Rollins to some one in the village—I cannot identify any of these goods as belonging to the furniture in the house—I do not think I can identify the</p>

               <p>table—I was at the house on the morning of the 21st, about half-past eleven o'clock—the sale commenced at half-past twelve—I found a shade on the premises that fitted these lamps now produced—they are the lamps I saw at the Sun, which Rollins said he had bought from the prisoners—I had sold the shades the day before in a lot, to a lady named Sowster—I afterwards pro<lb/>cured one of the shades from the lady who bought them—it is here—this is the shade I sold—it has been off the premises—to the best of my belief it is the same shade I sold to Mrs. Sowster—she is not here—it is the property of Mr. Stephens—I could not find the lamps they belonged to—the table is here—I had seen a similar table the day previous—I cannot take on myself to swear to it—it is like it—I missed a table of a similar description—there were a good many tables sold, but not many like that—there was no property in the house that the prisoners had a right to sell—there was no pro<lb/>perty in the house but what belonged to me or Mr. Stephens—they had no means of having property, or any right to sell any in that house—my orders were, that nothing should be delivered from the house till I or the clerk arrived—nothing had been delivered by my orders before that time.</p>

About two o'clock on Thursday morning, the 29th of Aug., I saw the prisoner on board a coal-barge, near Battersea Church—there were no other coal<lb/>barges there—he was taking coals off the top of the barge, and putting them into a bag—I took him into custody, and asked him if he was the owner of the coals—he said he was not there for the purpose of stealing coals, but to fasten a rope on to the head of the barge—there was a full moon, and it was a very light morning.</p>

I was walking near the Five Bells, in the Kent-road, about two o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner, and asked her the nearest way across the Creek-bridge to my residence—I understood there was a very near way—she said she would come and show me the way—I said I did not require it—she walked on, and before we got many yards she appeared very ill, and staggered about—I supported her, and instantly felt her hand in my pocket—I missed my purse and charged her with it—she used abusive language, and said if I had lost my purse I should find it on the ground, which I did, but I found two half-sovereigns were missing—she endeavoured to make her escape, and I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am female searcher at the station at Greenwich. On the morning of the 27th of Aug. I searched the prisoner—I asked her if she had the money she was accused of—she said no, she had not, neither had she seen it—I proceeded to search her, and saw her hand was closed—I asked what she had in her hand, she said, "Nothing;" and then she said it was the key of her door—I said I must see it—she was putting her hand to her mouth—I caught her hand, and found one half-sovereign in it, and another was found on the floor.</p>

I was so frightened, when he said I stole them, that I denied having them; be then said he could not go to the station-house, but the policeman made him; when we got to the station-house, he wished to abandon the charge; but the inspector did not let him. The reason I did not own to having the two half-sovereigns was, because he said I had stole it: had he told the truth, I should have given it up to the policeman. It is quite false to say I sham'd ill, or said I would show him the way; it was him that asked me to go down the lane, as he knows the way very well. I hope, as I am innocent of stealing the two half-sovereigns, you will mercifully take all circumstances into your consideration."</p>

               <p>On the 11th of Sept. I saw the prisoner on the Common—I heard him say, "God help the poor man; from dust I came, to dust I go; here goes. Amen"—he then threw himself into some water—I gave informa<lb/>tion—he was got out—the surgeon came, and he was Drought to life again.</p>

                  </hi>. I heard cries, and found the prisoner in the water out of his depth—he sunk three times—his head was below the water—I got him out, and he was rubbed, and restored—when he came to he said he wished I had let him remain in the water—he said he would do it again—he had lost his board and bag of nuts.</p>

I assisted in taking the prisoner out, and getting him restored—I asked him the reason of his doing this act—he said he had lost his board at Camberwell-fair by having the string cut from his neck, which caused him to do it.</p>
