Whereas on and previous to 26th day of February, 1836, certain deeds and documents belonging to the defendant, relating to a brewery and premises in Holland-street, North Brixton, were in the hands and possession of the said plaintiff, who was then the solicitor of the defendant, and on that day the same were deposited with William Ewing, Esq., manager of the Bloomsbury branch of the London and Westminster Bank, as security for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., lent and advanced by the said Bank to the defendant, on the guarantee or security of the said plaintiff: And whereas the said defendant, being indebted to the plaintiff for monies lent and advanced, and for professional business done, did, on 9th September, 1836, execute to the plaintiff a warrant of attorney for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the said debt; but the said defendant being then in treaty with one Mr. Allen for a partnership, it was agreed that the said warrant of attroney should not be stamped or filed for some time afterwards, to prevent the said Mr. Allen discovering that the said defendant was in debt, or that the said brewery and premises were encumbered; and in a few days afterwards the said plaintiff proceeded to Paris, and did not return to London till about the 29th day of the said month of September: And whereas, in the month of October, 1836, the said warrant of attorney was stamped, and judgment entered up thereon, and in the month of December following execution is<lb/>sued, under which the said leasehold premises were sold, the said William Mosson Kearns having long previously been called on and compelled pay the said bankers the said 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest, so lent and advanced to the said defendant as aforesaid: And whereas proceedings in this honourable Court were afterwards instituted by the said defendant to invalidate the said warrant of attorney, on the ground that some person had, without his authority, altered the date of the said warrant of attorney from the 9th to the 19th of the said month of September, 1836; whereupon the said plain<lb/>tiff for the first time discovered, and did not deny, that the date had been altered by some person: And whereas, since the said proceeding in the said Court, the said defendant hath stated that he executed two warrants of at<lb/>torney pending the said negotiations with the said Mr. Allen, which state<lb/>ment induced the said plaintiff to make further and searching inquiries as to what took place in the office of the said plaintiff during his said absence in Paris, as hereinbefore mentioned, and it hath been discovered, to the</p>

               <p>satisfaction of both parties, that a clerk in the office of the said plaintiff, in<lb/>stead of preparing a second warrant of attorney, as supposed by the said defendant, had, to save expense, altered the date of the said first and only warrant of attorney to the 19th day of September, and got the same again executed, and which he, on or about the 6th of October, got duly stamped and filed after the negotiation with the said Mr. Allen had terminated, and which said alteration was made without any willful intention, but in the spirit of the said original understanding and agreement for delaying the stamping and filing of the said warrant of attorney: And whereas the said discovery last mentioned has led to an amicable adjustment of all disputes between the said parties, and the said defendant doth hereby agree to cause his life to be insured in the Asylum Insurance Office to collaterally secure the due payment of the debt due from him to the said plaintiff; and the said plaintiff doth agree to obtain and deposit the deeds of the said brewery with Mr. Riccards, the attorney of the said defendant, who is to receive the rents from the 25th of March instant. And lastly, it is agreed that a cer<lb/>tain action of replevin of Bye v. Bower and Crook, now pending, under a distress levied on the said brewery and premises, by or in the name of one Samuel Bower, but at the instance of the said Samuel Twaites, shall be discontinued, and all proceedings under the said levy or distress shall henceforth cease and determine.

Twaites told me on Saturday night I was to attend here—MR. Twaites has repeatedly told me he was going to indict the prisoner for forgery—I should say it is since I made my affidavit that he told me so—I do not know where he told me so—very likely at my own house in Vauxhall-road—my husband has not been in town lately—I have written to him—I never said a word about this indictment—I do not know that my husband owes the prisoner any money—MR. Kearns should first say how much he has had of my husband—he does not owe Mr. Kearns 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that he owes him as many shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Albert David Bottomley, a tailor, in Gracechurch-street. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 18th of September, I saw a pair of trowsers gradually moving off a nail inside the door-way—I immediately went out, and saw the prisoner with them in his hand, about three yards from me—he threw them over to me—I kept run<lb/>ning after him, and caught him in the middle of the road—the policeman took him from me—I am sure he is the person—here are the trowsers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The gentleman accused me of stealing the trowsers; I said, "You are mistaken, I am not the person."</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Jesse pim, a linen-draper, in Barbican. The prisoners came to the shop, between four and five o'clock, on the 22nd of September, and bought half a yard of brown holland—I did not serve them—they went out—I missed a piece of print, and sus<lb/>pected them, I went after them—they had got round the corner of Barbican to Aldersgate-street, and were running together—I overtook Collins, and took from under her apron this piece of print—I gave her to the policeman, pursued Ashman, and just before I overtook her, she threw this other print down Aldersgate-buildings—I overtook and gave her to the policeman—when I got home I found two pieces were missing—these are both my master's.</p>

On the 15th of September about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming up the steps on the eastern side of London-bridge, and at the top of the steps I felt a pull at my pocket—I turned, and found the prisoner behind me, and my hand kerchief dropped almost between his legs—I called, "Police," and seized him by the waistcoat, but he tore it open, got out of my hands, and ran away with a companion as hard as he could—I lost sight of them for the or four minutes—when I came to Arthur-street, I saw him maltreating one of the witnesses—I recognized him, and gave him into custody—I swear positively he is the person—this is my handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

The prisoner was in my custody two or three months back, for debt—he requested me to release him—I asked him on what security, and he tendered me a bill of exchange—I told him I would not take it unless Mr. Clotty would put his name to it, knowing Mr. Clotty to be a friend of his—some hours afterwards he produced the bill, with Mr. Croat's name in it—I took it with the understanding that he was to redeem it again in a short time, and I released him—I afterwards showed it to Mr. Clotty—it is not here—I do not know where it is—I gave it to a person named Thompson, who paid me the money a few days after I received the bill—I do not know whether the prisoner had then been charged with knowing the bill to be forged—it was not due when it was paid—I had seen the prisoner on passing his window, between the time the bill was given me, and its being paid, but I had no conversation with him.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 15th of September, I left my house about half-past five o'clock—I left no one in the house—the front door was fastened by a padlock—I returned about eleven o'clock, and en<lb/>tered at the back door, which was padlocked as I had left it—I found the back window had been opened by breaking one square of glass about four inches from the button which fastened it—a person could reach in and un<lb/>do the button, and open the window—I examined, but missed nothing then—on Thursday night I missed seven half-crowns and six shillings, which I had seen safe on the Monday night in the top room, in a pot in the mid<lb/>dle of the room—there are only two rooms to the house—I had not looked into the pot between the Monday and Thursday—I have never seen the money again, having no mark on any of it—I examined the window on the Thursday in consequence of missing the money, and found soot from the top of the window to the bottom, at the edge, and on the window-sill and sash—the mark on the sill was as if a foot or knee had been put on it—the prisoner is a sweep, and lived about five yards from my house, facing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Queen's-terrace, Queen's-row, Dalston, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney. On Saturday, 20th of September, I went to bed a little after eleven o'clock, I bolted the door, the windows were all fastened and every thing safe—next morning I was called up about a quarter past three o'clock, by the policeman—on going into the back kitchen, I found every thing in disorder—the dresser drawers were ran<lb/>sacked, and the panel of the window shutter cut open sufficient to admit an arm through—a pane of glass had been broken previously to admit a fin<lb/>ger to undo the hasp—I went into the parlour—the sideboard cupboard had things taken out and put in the centre of the room—some plated candle-sticks had the paper which they had been in, torn off—two mustard spoons and five tea-spoons were gone from the kitchen—a leg of mutton was taken from the safe—I missed some whiskey from a decanter in the parlour, and found about a quarter of an ounce of gunpowder on the mantle-piece, screwed up like snuff—on the kitchen table a coffee-pot stood, which had been cut to see if it was silver, it had been taken off the dresser, and a metal milk jug had the handle torn off to see if it was silver—I went with the constable to Richmond-road, outside my garden, and found the prisoner in custody—he had my servant's umbrella in his possession at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Smith and Fenn, whalebone-manufacturers, Aldersgate-street, and have been to five years and a half—Ford was in their employ, and had been very nearly six years. One morning, six or seven months ago, he came and asked where my master was—I said, "Up at breakfast"—he said, "We might have a dexen or two of bone*"—I asked what he was going to do with them—he said he could find sale for it—some time after he said the same again—about the middle of that day he asked roe to go with him, and at night I went with him to Cottrell's, in Lon<lb/>don-wall—Cottrell was in bed—we went to a public-house to have a pint of beer, and Cottrell came in—Ford asked if he would come down for some bone in the morning—Cottrell said he would, and he came in the morning about ten minutes after seven o'clock—I gave him between five and six dozen of bone—on Friday morning, the 2nd of October, Cottrell come there, and Ford gave him some bone, that evening I and Ford went to Cottrell's, he gave Ford 2Z. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said if we had got any more bone he could get rid of it—Ford told him to come the next morning; the Saturday, and he came about twenty minutes past eight o'clock—my master was up stairs—Ford, John Merison, and I were on the premises when he came—I told Merison to go down, and wash his master's basin because we wanted to get him out of the way—he went down the ware-house—when he was gone I gave Cottrell between four and five dozen of bone—Ford was at that time in the warehouse—I was in the shop—Cottrell went off with the bone I gave him—Ford was about thirty yards from me—he could see plainly what was going on—on that evening when Ford came back from his tea he gave me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that was my share—he did not say any thing else—I had had no other dealings with Ford—there was no transaction between the Friday evening when we got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the Saturday evening when I received the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was taken into custody, and admitted to give evidence, and have now come from the computer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Burgess, a pawn-broker in High-street, Kingsland. On the 17th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came to the shop-door together—Glover asked the price of a handkerchief hanging in the doorway which they were both looking at it—he then asked me if I had not something particular to show them—I showed him two other handkerchiefs in the shop—while I was doing that he was placing a handkerchief round his neck, I suppose to attract my attention—Shore pulled down the handkerchief, which they had been looking at the door, and walked away—I pursued and brought him back—he tried to get rid of the handkerchief in the door-way—he said he knew nothing of Glover, but when they got out of the door, Glover told him not to go on so fast.</p>

"Old candlesticks and different things"—he said he had been emptying a privy, and found them—I asked who he worked for—he said, "Hayward, in Camden-town"—I asked him to come to the lamp that I might see what it was—he wanted me to go to a cellar down the next turning, where he was going to shoot it—I said I could see by the light of the gas to satisfy me—I took out one part, looked at it, and I then told them they must go to the station-house—I took the bag, and they ran off, one way, and the other the other—they had been close together before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Upper Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 17th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the Grosvenor Arms public-house, in Grosvenor-street—the prisoner came into the room, with other persons—I never saw him before—I had known Thomas Croft for about a month previous to this—I had seen him daily—he came in soon after the prisoner—the prisoner raised</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on the 19th of September—he was admitted on the 17th—he had a fracture of both bones of the right leg—the larger bone had protruded through the skin—there was a wound of about an inch in extent on the fore part of the leg, from the protrusion of the bone—I attended him till the 11th of October, when he died in consequence of the accident—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found he died with abscesses on the liver and lungs, arising from the fracture of the leg—I judge of that from many cases I have seen before of the same kind, in which the matter is taken up from the leg to the liver and lungs—I have no doubt whatever that the injury of the leg was the original cause of death—the fracture might have been produced by many causes—there was no disease of the bone to cause it to give way suddenly, only the bones of old persons give way more easily than others—there was a good deal of external bruising around the fracture, about the middle of the leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Camden Town. On Tuesday, the 29th of September, I was called in to see Metcalf at the York and Albany tavern, at half-past ten o'clock in the evening—I found him in bed, and found a wound two inches below the navel, half-an-inch long—it had separated the skin, and gone into the body—it is a part in which a wound might produce dangerous consequences—I did not probe it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a knife</hi>)—this knife might have inflicted the wound—I at<lb/>tended Mm until the Sunday—it is a very dangerous part of the body, but the wound itself was not dangerous—if the whole blade of the knife had entered the body, it would have been still more dangerous.</p>

I apprehended the pri<lb/>soner on the 29th of September, at the Bedford Arms public-house, Cam<lb/>den Town—I told him I wanted him—he came out with me into the street—I then said, "I want that knife"—he said, "What knife? I have no knife"—I put my band into his right-hand breeches pocket and found this knife—I found a stain of blood on the blade afterwards—I said, "This is a pretty thing to stick into a fellow"—he said, "He had no business to interfere with me then, I would stick any man that interfered with me"—I said in going along it was a very serious affair, the man might die—he said he might die and be d—d—he was quite drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields. I have been separated from him three years, and have only seen him once since, which was on the 20th of May, two years ago, at the burial of my child—when we were together we lived in Cartwright-street, Rosemary-lane—I left him and went to lodge in Prescot-street—last Monday evening three weeks he came up to my room—I was quite alone and was doing nothing, as it was the first day of our new year, which is a holiday—the door was just on the close—he pushed it open, came in, and stood before me, with his coat open, and his hands under his coat—I had two lights burning on the table—he said, "I want some victuals," and not having seen him so long I was rather startled at seeing him—I said, "How can you come on such a night as this, to ask me for victuals, when neither I nor my family have had a dry crust from you these three years?"—he then took a knife and held it towards me—I took my right-hand and grasped the blade, and he tried to draw it from me, but I firmly held it—he then rushed on me with another knife, which he had also under his coat, and knocked down the lights, and I was in the dark—he cut me on the chin with that knife—I was still holding the other knife fast—my right-hand was cut and bled very much, with holding the knife—I saw the second knife coming towards me before I was cut on the chin—I still held the first knife in my hand and screamed loudly—MRS. Holland came to my assistance with a light, and then Mepham came—they caught hold of him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190054"/>
               <p>and brought him out on the landing-place—I was so frightened, I believe I still held the first knife in my hand when the other was taken from him, and I said, "O my God, are there two knives?"—he still had one knife grasped in his hand when I said that—I had never seen either of the knives before—there were none on the table when he came in—there was a cloth on the table; in honour to our holidays and sabbaths, we never keep a table uncovered—I struggled with him before any one came in, I think for about a quarter of an hour, or very likely not so much, but it appeared to me a great age—I had had tea about six o'clock—this was after that—my daughter had tea with me—she is, I believe, thirty years of age—she was not with me when this happened—she had left about a quarter of an hour, to go on a message into the next street—there had been no quarrel between me and the prisoner since I saw him two years ago—I never met with him and never spoke to him—I had never sent any messages to him, or received any—he never resented my leaving him—we had lived middling happy before I left him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said, "How do you know I have got any?"—I said "Because I know you have had some of my money given to you"—you said, "Before I give you any victuals I will stick that knife into your guts." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never used such a word in ray life—the young man that courted my daughter, never came at unseasonable hours in the night, for you would not allow the door to be opened after eleven o'clock—he never kept us up till three o'clock in the morning—he never came later than eleven o'clock—he brought her home one night at eleven o'clock—you said, "If you come at this hour again I will charge the police with you"—he is a very respectable young man—you applied to the High-Priest for a divorce, but he would not give it you.</p>

Moss was crying "Murder, murder; don't let him go," and I detained him on the landing till the police came—she complained of being cut in the chin and in the hand—the prisoner said, "Give me in charge," two or three times—he did not give any explana<lb/>tion of what had taken place—MRS. Moss did not say in his presence how it had happened—I saw another knife, either in Mrs. Moss's hand or Mrs. Holland's—they were small table-knives—the prisoner stood with his back towards me when I first saw him, and his arm raised, and the knife above his head—he was close to the prosecutrix—they had hold of one another.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown public-house in Henry-street, Portland-town—the prisoner was my pot-man. On Friday morning, the 18th of September, I came down stairs a little before six o'clock—I placed two bags on the bar parlour table—one contained five or six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some gold; and the other contained silver—I then opened my house—I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after I had done so—he did not sleep in the house—he came and opened the tap-room door, then went and opened the back yard door—he then went into the kitchen, I believe, for the knives—there is an entrance out of the kitchen into the bar-parlour, the door of which was open, and he could see the bags from the position in which he was—he then came and ordered some gin for the men who were at work in the sewer—I put some gin into a bottle—he then ordered half a pint of rum—I washed a bottle to put the rum into, and while doing that, the prisoner went towards the kitchen again—he was gone about a minute—I could not see whether he went into the kitchen or not that time, I had seen him go in before, when he went for the knives—I saw him in the kitchen—I was in the bar-parlour at the time, and the bags were then on the bar-parlour table—he could see the bags from the kitchen—when he went towards the kitchen the second time, I had not sent him there—I was at the counter at that time, washing the bottles, and was not in a position to see whether he went into the kitchen—he had time between that and his return, to go into the bar-parlour—when he came back he told me to put another half-pint of rum into the bottle, and make it up to a pint—I did so, and placed the bottles on the counter at the bar—he then said, "I want half a quartern of brandy for myself, for I have been ill all night, and I am all of a shake now"—he appeared to be so, but when I saw him first in the morning, I did not perceive any thing the matter with him—he appeared to be as usual—while serving him with the brandy, I heard footsteps, and saw a man go out of the street door leading to the bar—the prisoner was at that time in front of the bar, drinking the brandy—I said, "Who is that man? I saw no one come in"—he said, "I don't know who it is, I saw nobody come in"—he then went out with the bottles</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190057"/>
               <p>and liquor—I shortly afterwards returned into the bar-parlour, and found the bags and money gone—I informed some policemen—I did not make any charge against the prisoner that day—he came back in about half an hour, to the best of my belief—I said, the man who had gone out had robbed me of my money, and asked him if he knew any thing about it—he said "No"—I asked him nothing more about it till next day—he said he knew no<lb/>thing of it—I then gave him in charge, and said, "William, I give you in charge on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery"—he said very well, he was willing to go—the policeman was there at the time—on Tuesday evening, the 23rd of September, John Burnham came to me, in conse<lb/>quence of which, I sent for sergeant Taylor—Burnham then produced a bag containing 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—the bag was dirty, and bad earth on it—it was not one in which my money had been—the money was counted over by Taylor, returned into the bag again, and given to Burnham—Taylor followed Burnham out, and in two or three minutes I also followed them to the parlour of the New Inn—I there saw the pri<lb/>soner, Burnham, Taylor, and Newton, the landlord, and the same bag of gold was on the table—when I went in, the prisoner made an attempt to escape out of the door—I stood at the door, and prevented him, and said, "Let us have none of your nonsense, or I will <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> you"—there was up<lb/>wards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns in one of the bags I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I have known the prisoner about twenty years. On the morning of the 22nd of September I saw him, about half-past eight o'clock, going up Henry-street, Portland-town—he was alone—I told him there was a man taken up on suspicion of Mr. Scotch<lb/>man's robbery, and I and my brother were going down to the office to see if we knew him—he said he would go with us—he went with us with his entire own will, and we looked at the man—he saw the man in custody, and he said that was not the man, he was not big enough—he went away immedi<lb/>ately—I and my brother stopped at the office, and heard the man's examina<lb/>tion, and then returned home—after dinner I was going up Henry-street to<lb/>wards Mr. Scotchman's again, and met a man—in consequence of what he said to me I went to the Swiss tavern, and saw Bates—I told him I had come there, as he had sent for me by that man—he asked me, what news—I told him, "Very bad"—I then asked him to come outside, and I said, <hi rend="italic">"Billy,</hi> what made you go away so soon from the office without telling us?"—he said, because he could not stop, for that young man that he had seen at the office was one out of the two—he said that young man was standing at the bar having a pint of beer, while there was another taking the bag with 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver in it—I asked him what had become of the other—he said, "That is my business"—I said, "Billy, this will all be found out, for you are con<lb/>cerned in it"—he said, "I know I am, but it can't be found out, for I had none of the silver, and nobody saw me take the other; there is nobody can <hi rend="italic">come</hi> it on me; and what I have got I have put away, so as I can get a little at a time, as I want it"—I asked him what had become of the notes and cheques—he said he had burnt them—we than went inside, and he gave me a sovereign to pay for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of brandy and a pot of half-and-half—it came to 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I returned him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then went across the fields to Hampstead, and in coming home he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get some steak, and told me to get them cooked—I did so—there was a mistake made in the house, too, and he did not come to the house that I got them cooked at—I went outside, but could not see him—I saw his brother, and by his direction I went to another public-house, the New Inn, where he was sit<lb/>ting up in a room by himself—I told him I thought it was very foolish of him sitting there spending his money, and being in a house that he was not in the habit of using—his brother said he thought it was very foolish of him too—I and the prisoner then came away, and went into the fields—I asked him where he was going—he said he did not know where to go—we went across the fields to Chalk-farm, and there we had a small glass of brandy each, and he had a loaf or biscuit and cheese—we then came out again—I said, "Billy, this will all be found out, and you will get tran<lb/>sported"—I then asked him how much of the money he had got—he said he had got about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I thought the best thing would</p>

               <p>be to tell me where it was, or give it to me, that I might take it to Mr. Scotchman, for I thought he would rather have that than transport him—he burst into tears, and said, "Oh, my dear children!"—we then went across the fields home, and into his garden—he stooped down, and took a bag out of the earth with his hands—I could not see whether it was covered, at it was dark—we then went into the brick-field—I told him to count it to me, so that he might not say he gave me more than I gave Mr. Scotchman—he counted it over to me, to the amount of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, end half-sovereigns—I told him if Mr. Scotchman would not consent to take it I would return back to him with it—he then proposed where we should meet after I had been to Mr. Scotchman—I said, "At the New Inn"—that was where I went to him when he was alone—I went to Mr. Scotchman with the money, and saw him—I told him something—he fetched Taylor, the policeman, and I produced the bag in their presence—Taylor counted it, and it was put into the bag again—I took possession of it by Taylor's in<lb/>struction, and went to Bates at the parlour of the New Inn—I went in alone—Taylor had followed me, and was standing just outside—when I went in I gave Bates the bag again, and told him Mr. Scotchman said he would not have any thing to do with it—I called for a pint of beer, and, in the meantime, in came Taylor—Bates dropped the bag on the floor—Taylor; picked it up, and took Bates into custody—I was examined next morning at Marylebone office, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

I had a watch belonging to William Whitten—it was left by a per<lb/>son named Carter, who has since changed her name—I was at home on the 18th of September—the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a watch, in the name of Smith—on looking over my watches I told him I had not one in that name—on asking him several questions, as to the colour of the ribbon and other things, he said it was a great misfortune he was deaf, and then he said, perhaps it was left in the name of Carter, who was his brother-in-law, and having a watch in that name, I asked him if that one was it—he said it was, it belonged to his brother-in-law—he took it away—he said he should have another to repair in a day or two, and he would bring it—there was nothing to pay for this, as it was merely to be regulated—he was dressed in a drab coat then, and when in custody he had a pilot coat on—I am sure he is the man—the watch is lost.</p>

On Saturday night, the 10th of October, a little before twelve o'clock, I was crossing the road from the Alsop Arms public-house, at the corner of Upper Gloucester-street, New-road, near Dorset-square—as I crossed, a bunch of turnips were thrown against me—I did not see who did it—there were three or four men stand<lb/>ing together, and it appeared to come from them—I threw it back again, and the prisoner threw it back to me again—I am confident it was the pri<lb/>soner—it was a very moonlight night—I knew him before—I was in the act of throwing them again, and he ran in and cut me in the side, and said, "There you b——, take that"—I felt the blood running from my side, and felt what I thought was a blow at first, and put my hand to my side directly I felt the blood running—I did not see any thing in the pri<lb/>soner's hand—there was no one but him within two or three yards of me—I ran for assistance, and met Mr. Farrow eight or nine yards from where it happened, and William Neil, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver—I said I was cut in my side, and wished they would take me somewhere where I could have something done to it—they took me to the infirmary—my side was examined there—I found a large cut in my side—I had done nothing to the prisoner before he struck me but throw the turnips at him.</p>

On the morning of the 30th of September, a little after seven o'clock, I was sweeping the front of my master's door—I saw Mr. Downes's porter take down two shutters from his window and take them into the side passage—I then saw the prisoner pass him very quick, and I saw him enter the shop—he remained inside about one minute, and I saw him come out—he had nothing in his hand when he went in—he came out with a little glass box under his left arm, and went right across the road—he looked round, and I pointed to him—he ran straight across the road, through a passage called Pierpont-row—I followed, and lost sight of him in the passage while he turned the corner—I ran through the passage, down Charlton-crescent, and there saw him running with the same glass case under his arm——I kept running—Henry Gulleford was running rather before me—I lost sight of him again in turning the corner, and saw him again in the field without his coat and cap—he had not the glass case then—I had not seen him throw it away—he was run<lb/>ning across the fields—I hallooed out "Stop thief," and he called out that he had only broken a window—some men at work there told him to jump over the wall—he did so, and kept running on—I jumped over the wall after him, and just as he got under the canal-bridge some labouring men stopped him close by the canal on the towing-path—he was brought back to Downes's shop—I saw Gulleford pick up the pieces of the glass case just by the railings of the river—they were carried back to the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clock-maker, and live at No. 2, Goswell-place, Goswell-road, in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell—it is my dwelling-house. I employed the prisoner to assist me in moving from No. 17, Wynyatt-street to that house, on Michaelmas-day—in the afternoon I was lying down in the front room second floor, being rather tired, and noticed him come into the room rather gently—I was not asleep, and asked what he wanted—he made no answer—I asked him again—he made no answer—I considered my wife had sent him for something, supposing he was putting the things to rights below—I happened to close my eye——I opened them again in about a minute, and saw him going out of the room—when I laid down between two and three o'clock, I had in my pockets seven sovereigns and four half-crowns—I had left my trowsers on the side of the bed—when I got up between half-past four and five o'clock, I im<lb/>mediately saw that my trowsers were not where I had left them, and found my money was gone—nobody had been into the room but the prisoner and my wife—she came about four o'clock, and asked me to come down to tea, and it was before her I examined my pocket—the prisoner was gone when I came down—I afterwards found him in custody.</p>

The prisoners were in their em<lb/>ploy, Lillywhite as engineer, and Marable as labourer—Elliott and Co. were in the habit of buying large quantities of coals from the ships—they are Llangannan coals, not the sort used in private families—it was usual to lighter them to the wharf of Dalton and Co., and for them to cart them to the brewery, but they had no property in the coals. In May last 210 tons of coals were delivered at the brewery—I received the delivery tickets for them—it was the usual course for me to receive them from Marable—it was his duty to take them from the carman, and deliver them to me—Lillywhite had nothing to do with the coals—on Tuesday, the 22nd of September, after the prisoners were in custody, I went with the policeman to Lilly white's house in Hensdon-street, at a quarter to five o'clock, I saw some Llangannan coals in the cellar there, with some New-castle coals—the Llangannan coals were at the bottom of the cellar, and the others were spread over them, for the purpose, I should say, of con<lb/>cealing them—there were about two tons of Llangannan, and one ton of Newcastle—in consequence of suspicion, the police were on the premises of Elliott and Co. about three days before this, but up to the time of the prisoners being taken, no charge had been made against them—the police had not been communicating with them,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a news-agent, and live in Chapel-place, Coram-street. On the 18th of September, at seven o'clock in the morning, I was in a field adjoining Hornsey-wood—there was a fight between the pri<lb/>soner and Thomas Foy, (I understand was his name)—I was there at the beginning—they were stripped, and fought twenty-two rounds—at the</p>

               <p>last round, the deceased got off his second's knee, approached towards the prisoner, and sparred up to him with the intention of striking, but tottered and fell before he struck the blow—no blow had been struck on either side in that round—in the round previous to that he rose as usual, and was not struck at all—he came up with the intention of fighting, and fell down—I did not observe whether he fell against any thing—he was not struck, he seemed to be more pushed against by the prisoner on pur<lb/>pose to avoid striking him—they had struck each other in the rounds be<lb/>fore that—I saw the deceased struck once by the prisoner, but it was not what I should call a knock-down blow, as he seemed to be falling before—I thought at the time, that blow was struck on the face, but I was not close enough to see—there was not the slightest unfairness in the prisoner's man<lb/>ner of fighting—he seemed to wish to avoid fighting altogether—after the deceased fell the last time, he was placed in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and carried home—I did not see him afterwards—I had seen them together on one occasion before at a house, where the deceased quarrelled with the prisoner, but I did not see them quarrelling—I was at the Hunter's Arms, Compton-street, about a week before—there was a quarrel between them there, but I do not know what about—the deceased had other falls in the fight besides what I have mentioned—they seemed to struggle during the fight, and when they fell they fell together.</p>

I was in the field near Hornsey-wood, on the 18th of September, and saw the fight from beginning to end, between the prisoner and Thomas Foy—I believe his real name was Thomas Barks—it appeared a fair fight—they exchanged very few blows in the early rounds—I saw them fall on the ground while fighting—the deceased fell undermost several times—they did not appear particularly severe falls—I cannot recollect seeing any knock-down blow—I did not see any marks on the deceased's face—about the seventeenth round, as near as I can recollect, the deceased went back and fell on a bank on the ground without being struck—he fell on the back of his head on a hard piece of clay, or something—they fought about twenty-two rounds—after the fall very little was done—he came up to the four or five rounds, and fell without being struck, I believe—I did not see any blow struck by the prisoner after the deceased fell—at the last round he rose from his second's knee, put himself in the attitude of fight<lb/>ing, and fell down without being struck—he was taken home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw him on Saturday morning at his lodging in Brighton-street, St. Pan<lb/>cras—he was then dead—I went there with the Coroner's Jury—the body I saw there was the body of the man who fought with the prisoner.</p>

On the night of the 17th of Sep<lb/>tember I was on duty, watching the house next to Inman's, and saw the prisoner and a short man together several times while I was there—I saw them just against the shutters of Inman's house between seven and eight o'clock—I walked round, suspecting they were watching me, and saw them—I came round again, and missed the prisoner—I saw the short man standing by himself, just against Inman's place—I crossed and looked at him, and went away—he followed me—a few minutes after I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I ran in a different direction to where I heard the cry—I came to the corner of Hope-street, and saw a number of people singing out "Stop thief," and the prisoner and a short man running from Inman's house, towards Hackney way—I laid hold of the short man first, and put him on the ground—somebody hallooed out, "That is not the man who <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bundle away, it was the other man"—I then pursued the prisoner, and took him in Hackney-road, running as hard as he could—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190110"/>
               <p>he was right out of breath, and could not speak—a person said, "That is the man that robbed the house"—he said he was not guilty—I took him back to the house, searched him, and found on him a silk handkerchief, one shilling, two sorts of lucifer matches, and a knife—some Lucifer matches were given to me by Mr. Inman—I also found two lucifer matches in the bundle of things—the matches found on him and those given me by Mr. Inman were of the same description, (but some of them were partly burnt,) and the same with what were found in the bundle—MR. Inman produced the bundle—I have had it ever since—these things were in it then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever mentioned finding two matches in the bundle before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were two hearings before the Justice when the witnesses were sworn and gave evidence—I was at both of them—Thomas Inman was examined more than once on oath—I am quite certain of it—as far as I can judge, it was from half to three-quarters of an hour between the time of my first observing the prisoner and the other to the cry of "Stop thief"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my signa<lb/>ture—I swear that I mentioned about the matches in the bundle—my evi<lb/>dence was read over to me—I was asked if it was correct—I signed it—I think I mentioned about the matches in the bundle on both examinations, but I cannot say, but the last I will swear to, the day it was read over to me—I told the clerk of it in the private room, whether he put it down I do not exactly know, but I thought what he took down was right—it does not seem to be put down—I was not conversing with the witnesses before the Magistrate on this subject—I had some conversation certainly—MR. Hunt, the prisoner's solicitor, reprimanded me for it, the Magistrate did not—Mr. Hunt spoke to the Magistrate on the subject—while a witness was being examined, I interfered, and Mr. Hunt made an observation—I do not think the Magistrate reprobated my interference—I will not swear he did not—I was standing close to the witness at that time—the Magistrate did not order me to go back, that I swear—I did stand back of my own accord, not on account of the Magistrate ordering me back, but when the remark was made by Mr. Hunt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you afterwards reprimanded by the Magistrate when you were found standing behind a door in the passage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not in any passage—I was in the yard—I was not reprimanded by the Magistrate—MR. Hunt said I was standing outside—the Magistrate said something, but did not re<lb/>primand me—I believe I was standing in a place contrary to the Magistrate's order, but I did not know it till Mr. Hunt called the Magistrate's attention to it—I was standing in the yard, but I could not hear any witnesses where I stood—I did not remove from that place after an observation from the Magistrate, for it was after I came into Court—I moved from the yard into the office—I came in as a witness—MR. Hunt said I had been standing outside listening—I was sworn on two occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> These goods were not stolen. The indictment contains the absurd charge of stealing; they might at well charge me with robbing their warehouse.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in the employ of Mr. John Sewell, in the Commercial-road. On the 20th of October I heard a kind of rustling noise, as if something had been taken from the brass railing inside the shop, where we commonly hang clothes—I got up immediately, ran to the door, and saw a person like the prisoner with a dress like the one he has got on, making a kind of fastish trot—I pursued him—he was very busy, tucking something under his coat—I called out, "Stop him"—he seemed to go faster—he went down the first turning into George-street—I followed him, and calling "Stop thief," he ran quicker—I had slippers on, and I lost sight of him—I picked up the trowsers under the railroad arches, where I lost him, in going through a passage—he got through one of the arches—I saw nothing but his back—the prisoner has all the appearance of that person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Vesper, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road. On the evening of the 15th of October I was standing against our wall in Exmouth-street—I saw Gilchrist there with two others—one of them had a stick, and tried to take a gown off the tressel, but did not succeed in getting it, and went and talked to the other two—I then saw Gilchrist come and stand about the door—he afterwards returned, then came and took a dress away, and passed it to one of the others—the two ran away—Miller answers the description of the man that came up the street, but I had not an opportunity of seeing him distinctly—when I saw Gilchrist take the dress I walked directly after him, and collared him—he asked me what I wanted with him—I said that was an after job—he tried to knock me down—we both fell, and laid on the ground till we were picked up—I had hold of his collar—I was not more than three yards from him when he took the gown—I could not mistake him, and never took my eyes off him—he had got five or six yards from me before I seized him—I dis<lb/>tinctly swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Cox, a plumber and glazier, at Stoke Newington. On Friday, the 16th of October, I went to the street-door to take in some bread—my daughter Sarah, who is a year and a half old, followed me to the door and went down the step—I left her there for about two minutes, and then her necklace was gone off her neck—I saw no person near the door—I went down the street, and saw Walters walking away—Agar and Sugg fetched a policeman, who took Walters into custody—the necklace was three rows of coral, and was clasped securely round her neck.</p>

On the 16th of October, as I was going into my school, oppo<lb/>site Mr. Cox's house, I saw the two prisoners coming up the lane—the child came a little way from the door to play with some more children—Reeves crossed over towards the children, and Walters went a little way farther, and stood still looking over towards the fields—he could not see what Reeves did—Reeves patted the little baby on the back, and pulled the snap of the necklace round to the back, he then unsnapped it and put his hand into his pocket with the necklace, he then went towards Walters, who was waiting for him, tapped him on the shoulder and said something to him, and they walked away together—I told the children what had hap<lb/>pened, and a little girl cried out—Reeves then ran away as fast as he could, and Walters walked quite fast in the same direction—MRS. Cox came out, and I told her.</p>

My birth-day was Wed<lb/>nesday, the 14th of October—I had taken liquor on Tuesday night, and was overcome, but it was more through fatigue and excitement during the day—the last thing I remember, was going to my wine-merchant to order some wine for a party, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—next morning I found myself in bed in a brothel kept by the prisoner Cramer—I had the night before twenty-three sovereigns, to the best of my recollection—I am sure there was more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the morning my money and watch were both missing—I dressed, and went down stairs, and saw a female standing by the fire—Cramer came in shortly after—I asked her name—she said "Mary Cramer"—I asked her what place I was in, where it was, and what was the situation—I did not know the street I was in—I do not remember what she said—I said I should step out for a few minutes, and be back again—I did so, and returned with a policeman, and saw her still there—the policeman told her I had been robbed, and wanted to know what had become of my money and watch, and who the girl was who had brought me there—I believe she denied all knowledge of it—she said she did not know who the girl was—to the best of my belief, she was asked who the girl was that brought me there, but I was in a good deal of confusion at the time—the policeman knows what passed.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of October I was passing from the stable-yard, by the side of my house, and saw the prisoner run<lb/>ning away from the door—he was close to the step when I first saw him—he had a bag of oats on his shoulder—he ran round Manchester-street—I followed him right across the street, behind Zion-house, into a doorway—I went back, and afterwards saw him run again—I stopped him, and brought him back—he said he had bought three pecks of oats at my house—I gave him in charge, and measured the oats, there was 2 1/2 pecks—I had such oats in the first bin from the shop-door—I called the woman down who attended to my shop—she said, in his presence, she had not sold any all the morning—he said he had paid a half-crown and sixpence for them—that is the price of three pecks.</p>

On the 16th of October I was in my shop—I went down stairs and returned in a minute, and saw both the prisoners in the middle of the shop—Bailey was leaning over a bench where there were four bottle<lb/>jacks, and before I had time to notice the other, Bailey ran out of the shop—I missed one bottle-jack off the bench—they were close together in the shop, and both ran out—when Rogers got down the step, he attempted to return, but I had then got up to him and collared him, and he threw a jack from him—I kept him in custody, and Bailey was brought back—I gave them both in charge—this is the jack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Combes, and live at No. 27, Grove-street, Commercial-road. I had a quarrel with the prisoner's wife and a woman named Newman, and in consequence of some violence of which I complained, the case was tried at Hicks's Hall, on the 9th of Oc<lb/>tober—it was settled, by leave of the Court, on the payment of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me—the prisoner went and got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was ordered to remain in court for my protection, as I was afraid to go out after what they said—I reached Home about one o'clock in the day—the prisoner and his wife, and Mrs. Newman lived opposite to me—they came home in a hackney-coach—</p>

               <p>the prisoner came over with his wife and three other women, who had been to the Court as witnesses, and knocked at my door—I opened it—he said, "I want my money"—I said, "What money?"—he said, "I want my money, you have been receiving blood-money in the Court, and I will have it"—I said, "I have not been receiving blood-money, it was for the breaking of my arm"—he said, if I would not give it him he would tear me in pieces—I said my arm had been broken, and I would keep it—he said he would have it, otherwise he would have my life, and he made a great disturbance round the door—I sent for the police to protect me, and when they came I showed them the money I had received—the prisoner did not strike me then—his wife struck me in the passage on the forehead, but nothing to speak of—he said, "Give it her—I am your bail, and I will forfeit your bail if you give her a d——d good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>"—I then went out—the prisoner, his wife, and the three other women followed me, and said, "Are you going to give us the blood-money?"—I said, "I will not give it you—it is not blood-money"—he said, "Mind, you shall retract my money, and if not I will give you in charge for robbery"—he then gave me a blow in my mouth, and made it bleed—I was afraid, and put ray hand into my pocket, and gave him the money—I then went home crying—I got a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and went back to Hicks's Hall, and stated what had passed to the Chairman—it was five or ten minutes to four o'clock when I got there—he said he was very sorry, and told me to go to the Thames Police, and I should have a little recompense made—I asked him if he would be kind enough to give me a note—he said, if my word was doubted he would not only give me a note, but he would go himself, for he saw the money given to me—I went to the Thames Police at ten o'clock next morning—I was too ill to go that day—I believe the prisoner was in liquor at the time—I gave him the money after he had given me one blow—having been laid up some weeks with a broken arm, I was really afraid of being torn to pieces—the words he used to me are not fit for a woman to mention.</p>

I am an officer at the Thames police-court—I have been there thirteen months, but have been an officer upwards of eleven years—I first knew the prosecutrix on the 30th of July, when she came to apply for a warrant about her broken arm. On the Saturday morning after the trial at Clerkenwell, she came to the office before office-hours—I was the first person she applied to—I was waiting at the office-door—I asked what she wanted—she said, "I want a warrant against five different people"—I asked what they had been doing—she said, a woman had struck her in the mouth and stolen her hospital-paper, and a man had got the money from her, by saying they would tear her to pieces, if she did not give the money up—she said nothing about the man having struck her—she said a man had taken the money from her by threats—I was sent with Douglas, a policeman, to make inquiries about the prosecu<lb/>trix—from what I know of her, and from what I have heard, I would not believe her on her oath—she bears a very bad character in the neighbour<lb/>hood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Upper Grove-street. On Friday afternoon, the 9th of this month, about a quarter before three o'clock, I heard a noise in the street—I went down, and saw Mrs. Combes at her door—she beckoned me into her house, and I went—she stood in the door-way—I asked her if the business was settled—she said, "Yes," and she had received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remained with her about ten minutes—nothing occurred to her during that time—I asked how long she had been home—she said, Some time—that she had some pork-chops, and a little gin, and some porter with a woman who was sitting in the room—she said she had shown the people favours, and see how she was served for it—I suppose she meant by showing favours, settling the matter—she said she would have a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and go to the Magistrate, who sat till six o'clock—her mouth was not bleeding at all then—she said nothing about the prisoner—she did not tell me what she was going to the Magistrate for—on the Monday following she came to my house with a policeman, and said, "I want you to go to<lb/>day with me, and say you saw me give the man the money"—I told her I could not say what I knew nothing about—the policeman said, "We can do without you"—I said, "I hope you will, for I know nothing of the business, or any thing of the parties"—she then put her hand up to the policeman, and said, "There is a little boy fourteen years old that I sent the jacket round with, and he will do"—that was all that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. West was in my service as ostler; Cope lives next door but one, and keeps a horse and cart. On the 1st of October I did not authorize West to sell any of my hay or any other thing; he was not justified in doing so—I might have obliged a neighbour with a truss of hay—I have been asked by West whether he might, but that is months or a year ago—if any body came for a truss he should speak to me previously—Mears, the officer, arrived with a truss—my wife called me out of my parlour—there was I, West, Cope, and the officer together—West spoke first—he said, "Sir, I have just sold a truss of hay, and have got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it in my pocket"—I said, "What business could you have to sell a truss of hay?"—he said, "It is to a neighbour; he has paid me the full value"—I said to him, "You know, Robert, it is not long ago since I charged you on no account to borrow, or lend, or sell hay; how durst you do such a thing?"—the officer said Cope had told him he gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it</p>

At a quarter to eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 26th of September, I was in the shop—I put my bag on the counter in the shop, while I went to speak to Mr. Smith in the adjoining sitting room—there was a purse in my bag, containing ten sovereigns, a small key, a shilling, also five sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and a sixpence, wrapped in paper, separate from the other—two pocket-handkerchiefs, three letters, and a memorandum book were also in the bag—I returned in three or four minutes, and the bag was missing—one handkerchief has been found—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it, because I hemmed it myself—as I was going into the shop—I saw Lane very near the shop, and Ivey two or three hundred yards from the door—this was not ten minutes from that time till I missed my bag—they might have come into the shop—Lane looked as though he was looking at my bag.</p>

On the 26th of September I saw Lane at a quarter or ten minutes to eleven o'clock—I am certain it was before eleven—I saw him at his mother's door—he was employed outside her shop, doing something—I do not know what—I know the time, because I took a few rags to Mrs. Lane's, and I went from there to the bacon-shop at the corner of South Molton-street, and the Court-house clock was striking eleven—I know Lane's person perfectly, and am certain it was him I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a paper-hanger in Cross-street, Finsbury. Bartlett came into my employ in July last, as a colour-maker, he had access to these colours. On the 13th of October I missed some chrome yellow—in consequence of information, I went down on the 14th, and I said, "Bart<lb/>lett, I understand you and your friend Brown, last evening, have been carrying my colour away; you have been robbing me"—he seemed very much flurried, and said, "I have taken away 1/2 cwt. only"—I said, "Where have you taken it to?"—he said, "Davies's"—I said, "Where is Davies's"—he would not tell me—he said if I would wait till the even<lb/>ing, he should see Davies, by appointment, and get the money, and pay me—I took him to the station-house, and gave him into custody—I went with Power, the policeman, to Davies's house, and knocked at the door—he calls himself a colour-agent—I said, "Well, Mr. Davies, I have not had the pleasure of seeing you for some time; I have a friend outside wants to speak with you; walk in, my friend will be here in a moment," and the officer came in—I said, "Have you been buying colour?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "Bartlett"—I said, "You know very well that it is my colour"—he said, "No," he did not—he knew Bartlett had a small factory of his own, and he thought it was his—the officer said, "You believe this to be your colour?"—I said, "Yes"—I gave charge of him—Davies said, "I gave him a new hat, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for it"—I saw a quantity of colour there, it was brought away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the value of the whole must be, at least, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a colour-agent, or any body in the trade, must have known it was worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go up into the bed-room—this is some of the colour—beside the yellow chrome there was 7 cwt. of rose-pink—the whole of the colour was not present when I asked Davis what he gave for it, some of it was up stairs—I suppose they brought down 20 or 30 lbs. weight out of the upper room after that—there was 20 or 25 lbs. weight of colour in the back-room, on the floor, for which he said he gave the man the hat, that was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not an opportunity of weighing it—I did not go into the bed-room—he said that which was</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the Globe coffee-house, Union-street, Spitalfields, and am a poulterer. On Saturday evening, the 19th of Sep<lb/>tember, I was at the Angel public-house in the City-road, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I was sober—I had been taken poorly previous to my getting there, and was very ill after I got there—I felt a violent pain in the pit of my stomach—it was a spasmodic attack—I com<lb/>plained of being ill, and Mrs. Allen, the landlady, made me some brandy-and water—it did not do me good—shortly after I was taken very bad—I put my elbow on the window-seat, and leaned, my head on my hand—I</p>

               <p>was very bad—a medical man was sent for, and he attended to me—there was no other person in front of the bar at that time—the landlord and landlady, and her daughter were in the bar—the prisoner came in while the doctor was with me—the doctor gave me a draught, and I had a fomenta<lb/>tion—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was then sent for—the prisoner was very attentive to me dur<lb/>ing my illness, and when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came he offered his services to see me home—MR. Allen said he would be very much obliged to him if he would, or else he would get some other person—I was assisted into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the prisoner got in too—I had received of the landlady that evening two half-crowns and a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paper of halfpence—that was twenty minutes or half an hour before the doctor came—I put the two half-crowns into my left-hand trowsers pocket—I was perfectly sensible during the whole of my illness—while I was ill my body swelled, and the doctor undid the waist-band of my trowsers—while I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> the prisoner put his hand on my chest, and said, "How are you now, John?"—and when I was pass<lb/>ing Finsbury-square, to Sun-street, he put his hand on my chest, and said, "How are you now, John?"—and I felt him take his right-hand from my chest, and place it in my left-hand trowsers pocket—I had two buttons with the two half-crowns in that pocket, and he abstracted the two half-crowns, and left the two buttons—I was very much surprised at the kind<lb/>ness he exhibited, and very much surprised after his kindness to find him put his hand into the pocket, and take the two half-crowns—I put my hand on the outside of my pocket, and thought it was impossible he could do it—I supposed he was either a common pickpocket, or else what we call one of the <hi rend="italic">swell mob</hi>—I did not know who he was—I was sitting on the right-hand side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I put my hand on my pocket I found the two half-crowns were gone—I did not say any thing to the prisoner at that time, thinking if he was what I anticipated he was he would have made his escape by some means or other—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped in Union-street, and I told the driver to drive on further, expecting I should see a policeman—I saw no policeman—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped again, and I told the driver to go on further, and the first policeman he came to to stop—we got on opposite Spitalfields station-house, which, I think, is not more than thirty yards from where I lodge—I got out there, and the prisoner did too—I then put my hand on his shoulder, and told him he had robbed me—he laughed at me—I saw a policeman coming out of the station-house—I called him, and we all went into the station-house together—the prisoner was asked there what money he had—he said, "17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he took that money out—the inspector asked him if that was all—he said it was all he had—he was then searched by the constable, by order of the inspector, and two half-crowns, and some other small things were found in his left-hand trowsers pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take the benefit of the Insolvent Act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.—I was remanded six months by order of the Court, for undue preference to-a cre<lb/>ditor—I did not hear that they used the word "fraudulent"—I was in gaol once before that, I think—no, it was since—I never was more than once—I think not more than twice, to my knowledge.</p>

On the 17th of October, about ten o'clock at night, I went to Mr. Taylor's, a pork-butcher, to market—the shop was pretty full—the prisoner stood on my right-hand, close to me—there was no one on my left, but another person was behind me—I took a half-crown piece from my purse, which was in my right-hand pocket, and contained three half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence—I did not take the purse out of my pocket—I know this money was in my purse secure, and am quite con<lb/>fident I snapped the purse in my pocket—I was leaning over the counter to speak to the person who was serving, and felt a hand at my pocket on my right-side—I felt a hand pressing against my pocket, and one on my shoulder—the prisoner was at this time at my right-side—I felt immedi<lb/>ately in my pocket and missed my purse—my pocket-hole is rather behind me—the person who was behind me was shorter than me, and appeared to be stretching up to look over my shoulder, and she was pressing against me—I immediately declared that I had lost my purse, and some one had taken it—the prisoner then said to her companion, "You had better go outside and point out to the lady which rabbit we will have," and the wo<lb/>man who had been leaning over my shoulder left the shop immediately—she had been near enough to the prisoner to have carried away the purse—they had both been as near to me as they could possibly stand—Mrs. Taylor detained the prisoner in the shop—I have lost my purse and money altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Southampton-row, Rus<lb/>sell-square; I also carry on business in Holborn, in partnership with my brother. I know both the prisoners, one by the name of Wilson, and the other by the name of Lilly—in December last Lilly came into my shop in Southampton-row, and asked if I would purchase a ring—he produced this ring to me—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was a very foggy day—I asked what he wanted for it—he said it cost him, or the person who gave it him, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in India—I immediately gave it him back and said, "It is not worth half the money to us"—he said he was a tailor, that he was in very great distress, and had to make up a payment that morning, or he would not part with it, as it was given him by a particular friend—would I give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said it would not suit me at any thing like the price, it was only valuable to me to break up for the stone and the gold—I at last said, I would give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, which I did—he said he did not like to part with the ring, but would I lend him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would come back and redeem it, but he has never been—I do not think he told me his address—this ring purports to be an Indian ring of rude manufacture, as they make them in India of very pure gold, but clumsily made, and the stones roughly cut—it is made to</p>

               <p>imitate a ring of that description—it has all the appearance that a genuine Indian ring would possess—if the gold was genuine it would realize me from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not more—it is a base composition, made with a peculiar alloy, which stands the test of aquafortis, on being rubbed on a touch-stone—I have not had this assayed, but I hare had some assayed, which I believe to be of the same quality, and that turns out to be about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—therefore this ring would be under 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is intended to represent standard gold, worth 78<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—the things which appear to be stones are two pieces of crystal, called doublets—when a stone is set without foil behind it, it is one criterion of its being a genuine stone, and shows that it is fine—these two pieces of crystal are cut very flat, the horizontal parts are brought together, and the colouring put between them to imitate the real thing—these stones are worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—altogether the ring is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 21st of July last I was in my shop in Hol<lb/>born—the prisoner Wilson dame there and inquired if I bought jewellery—I said, "Yes,"—he produced these twin pins stuck in a piece of paper—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one is now broken—it was cut by direction of Mr. Alderman Pirie, for the purpose of assaying—one of these imitates the opal, the other a ruby—immediately he gave them to me I recognized them to be of the same description as the ring, and of the description also which I had been cautioned against—they are made to represent standard gold, worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce at least—I said, "What do you want for these?"—he said, "They cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked what he wanted—he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Are they gold?" or "What are they?" one or the other—he said, "Yes, they are gold"—I said, "Are they real stones?"—he said, "Yes, they are rail stones"—I laid, "What is your name?"—he said, "Wilson"—I said, "You are a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>" (which is a term in the trade applied to persons who make spurious goods,) "and your name is Walker, you have made these things on purpose to rob me, as some of your gang have before"—he said I was a liar—I told him if he made use of that kind of language I would kick him out of the shop—he said, "Well, you are a liar, and you may try them"—I then took the touch-stone, and was rubbing them sharply upon it, when he came with his clenched fist and threatened violence towards me—I told him that if he made use of any threat in my shop I would knock him down—he opened the door and began calling me a swindler and many other bad names, and said I had robbed him of his pins—I had not then said I should not return them—he eventually went away from my shop, and I kept the pins—I told him I would keep them and show them, and take them before a Magistrate—about five minutes after he was gone, I went out to look where he went to—I went to the corner of Castle-street, which is four doors from my house, and saw him in conversation with the prisoner Lilly—Lilly came up to me and asked why I had stopped the pins—I said, "Because it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>"—he then said if I called him a <hi rend="italic">duffer,</hi> as I had called his friend, he would roll me in the mud—he then said he would <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head—I said, I was sure he would not, but if he annoyed me in the street, I would give him in charge of the police—he dared me to do it—there was an altercation—I said if I bad done wrong I was open to the law, but it was my intention to take the pins to the Magis<lb/>trate—I then walked back to my shop—they followed me—an assembly of people was collected by the noise they made outside my shop-door, which continued about five, seven, or ten minutes—I obtained a policeman on my way from Castle-street to my own door—I said to them, "If you cause</p>

               <p>any disturbance here I will send you off to the Computer"—Lilly said if I did, it would be the worst day's work I had ever done—the noise and dis<lb/>turbance continued till I was obliged to give them in charge—I should say there were from thirty to forty or fifty persons there—there was a mob completely round the house—these pins are of the same description as the ring—I have had them assayed—they can be made for about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the two—the stones are only doublets—the opal is glass, and the ruby a piece of crystal—they are of a base composition, in which there is a small portion of gold—it is made to imitate standard gold—such things are never made in the trade under any circumstances.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PREDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I take it for granted you do not sell any articles in your shop for gold, which are not gold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb/>tainly not—I do not profess to mark things gold which are not gold—I swear that positively—I do not sell any articles for gold which contain less gold than those produced, not for solid gold—these are sold for solid gold—there are many descriptions of gold articles—in the composition of these pins there are four carats, or four 24th parts of gold, and twenty parts of alloy, a composition which is never made up for legitimate trade—these have been assayed by Johnson and Cock, of Hatton-garden—I be<lb/>lieve they are here, subpoenaed on the other side—they have reported the result of the assay—what I know about the pins is from what they have stated, nothing else—there have been three assays made—I can of my own knowledge tell within a trifle what proportion of gold there is in this ring, from rubbing it on a stone, and trying it with aquafortis, although I cannot say to the exact proportion—I was of opinion that there was no portion of gold at all in it, from the fact of its being gilt, but I have con<lb/>vinced myself that there is gold in it, by a trial on the touch-stone, which is the usual way with jewellers—I found that out previous to the assay, and previous to going to Guildhall—I had never seen Wilson before the 21st of July—the mob were laughing and making a noise—they did not attack me, but they made a disturbance—he was representing that I had stolen his pins, and wanted the policemen to take charge of me—the police<lb/>men were not called by him—I called them, because he was threatening violence towards me, because I would not give up the pins—I have known a person named Cullingford within this week—I never told him that I should not have given the prisoners into custody, only I thought they would have brought an action against me, nothing of the sort—I knew it was their intention to have brought an action against me, as they have done against a great many others on similar occasions—supposing these pins to be genuine, they would be worth full 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or from that to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to the value of the stones—I was not going to give any price for them—he asked me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I looked at them to ascertain their value—precious stones vary greatly in price—supposing these to be genuine, I should sell them at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they certainly would not be worth ten gui<lb/>neas—the weight of gold would be comparatively small—the stones would be the valuable part—the gold, supposing it to be solid, would be worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was never in a court of justice as an offender—I was never at Guildhall charged with setting a dog on a person, nor any thing of the sort.</p>

               <p>gilt—I have heard that a seal has been bought at my shop—the gold in that seal I should say is sixteen carats of gold, and eight portions of alloy—(<hi rend="italic">seal produced</hi>)—I call this a gold seal—it has been filed down to the solder, which is used for the setting—this is sold as a filled seal—it is not sold as a solid fine gold seal—it is marked as fine gold, and it is a fine gold seal—it has sixteen proportions of gold to eight of alloy, and these pins have only four to twenty—we cannot tell a real stone without drawing it out of the setting—I never knew pins sold as having diamonds in respectable shops which were not diamonds, nor do I think any respectable man would dare to do such a thing—inferior diamonds and precious stones are not sold for superior ones—when I put a ruby in the window, and call it a ruby, it is one—there are inferior rubies—we frequently put foil under them to throw up the colour, and give them a bright hue—the colour is the quality of the ruby—I do not know what this seal was sold for, but I should consider from 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot say positively—there is no gild<lb/>ing on this seal, nor any colouring—coloured gold articles are sold, but no respectable shop sells common gold articles gilt, as coloured gold—sixteen carats fine gold will colour to come up to the colour of standard gold, and it is constantly done—the colouring is not put on—it is the alloy dis<lb/>charged from the surface by a chemical process—gold inferior to sixteen carats will not come up to colour—the process is this, the article is made red hot, and thrown into a composition of acids, by which the surface of alloy is destroyed, and the gold left, consequently the whole of the sur<lb/>face exhibited to view is pure gold—it may be sometimes done rather under sixteen carats, but it must be a very trifle—I never knew it done under—I have heard of its being done, but it has not turned out so well on melt<lb/>ing—I do not manufacture things myself—I keep workmen who do, and superintend it—I am quite <hi rend="italic">au fait</hi>—the composition I speak of is a secret in the trade, in which those who perform the process pride themselves very much—I employ men who know the secret—the outside part of this seal is gold, not all of it—if the stone was in, all that would then be seen would be gold—the setting is solder—the solder is put in to strengthen the gold—it is a lining for the article—it is considerably thicker than the gold—the solder is a thick plate of metal going all through the article—it is sold at a price accordingly—a solid gold seal of that size would he worth four guineas—it would be impossible for me to tell what quantity of alloy there is in this seal, because it goes through it—I believe there are from twelve to sixteen carats of gold in the seal, not in the strengthening of it—there is solder in the handle—the seal is all composed of one kind of gold, and the strengthening is all composed of solder—I call this a fine gold filled seal—the solder in the handle is put under the gold to strengthen it—a solid gold seal could be made, if you go to the price.</p>

               <p>Birmingham ware—I should say none of these things are made at Bir<lb/>mingham—rings are made there to imitate stones, but certainly not to imi<lb/>tate Indian gold—no ring of this description is made for the trade—the part of this ring which purports to be gold is in the same state as when I received it—it most decidedly represents the standard Indian gold—this is the exact colour of Indian gold—Indian gold is twenty carats fine, or even more than that—it is almost pure, that is, twenty-four carats of gold and no alloy at all in it—I have been a jeweller all my life time—I have not worked with my own hands, but I have constantly been in it from childhood—I took out these stones from the ring, and put them in again myself—I gave 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I have never offered to sell it—I should have broken it up, and had the stones reset and remounted—I should say I have not seen rings in shops marked "real stones" which are not real—I do not think there is any such thing—I sell every thing pertaining to silver and jewel<lb/>lery—the seal and fancy trade has very much altered of late years for the better—gold used for manufacture is better now than it was twenty years ago, when I first knew the trade—gold was of a red colour, and then there was more alloy—it has varied according to fancy or fashion, but has never been under twelve carats fine.</p>

I have known Lilly ever since the latter end of 1834, and Wilson between two and three years—Lilly is a tailor, and Wilson, I believe, has been a gentleman's servant—Lilly has very often employed me to pawn clothes and jewellery for him—the clothes were manufactured by him, and the jewellery by a man named Walker—Lilly told me they were manufactured for the purpose of pledging or selling at a profit—Lilly directed me when I pawned things to give an address as near to the pawnbroker's shop as possible—I was employed by Lilly till about May last—both he and I knew that the jewellery articles were not genuine—he stated so to me—on the first occasion of my pawl<lb/>ing for them, at the latter end of 1839, I met Lilly at Walker's, accident<lb/>ally, and they proposed I should endeavour to pledge a suit of clothes and a ring, which I was to call a ruby, but they told me it was not rubies, but <hi rend="italic">doublets</hi>—in case I was asked if it was rubies, I was to say yes, and that the ring cost six guineas—I was at all times to represent the articles as genuine, and as having cost a great deal of money, in case the question was asked—I should say I was successful in passing off these articles to pawnbrokers in about fifty or sixty instances—the sum I got depended on the article—I generally pledged, not sold—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the highest I got for any article—I always paid the money to Lilly—the six guinea ring Lilly told me cost 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he directed me to get as much as I could on it—that was pawned along with other articles, but I suppose it realised 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had some money for my trouble—I pawned the first suit of clothes and the ring at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lilly was outside the door when I went into the shop, and Walker along with him—I gave the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Lilly—I think he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me, if I was asked what the ring was made of, to say it was rubies, and to call the metal gold—Barker did not ask anything about it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the ring produced by Mr. Simmonds</hi>)—I have seen this ring before, or one similar to it—they were charged 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>for it—this is not the ring I was to pass off as a six guinea one—this is the one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this was in the lot I got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on—when I took the second lot, I was to say I had redeemed the lot on Saturday night, and that was the same, I was bringing back again—it was a facsimile of the first lot, but not the same—after I had succeeded in these things, Lilly said it was well done—I have heard him talk of poor Tomlinson, and say that he stopped some of his goods, and he brought an action against him, and ran it on to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know of Lilly selling pins to Messrs. Bradley, Campbell, Allport, Glanville, and D——I saw them all before he sold them—they were spurious pins—I saw him go into the shops to sell them, and he afterwards told me he had sold them—I never spoke to Wilson about this business.</p>

               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">MANNING</hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Regent-street. About six months ago, or not quite so much, the prisoner Wilson came to my shop with three studs, which he represented to be gold—I did not try them, but from their appearance I should say they were not gold—I said, my young man had bought a pin of a person, who I supposed was the same party, and I asked him where he came from—he said from Lincoln, and that his master had made him a present of them—I said, "If I ever see you in my shop again, I shall charge the police with you"—he left the shop—about a fortnight or three weeks after, he came again in company with a short stout man who I cannot swear to, but he was about the same height as Lilly—Wilson came with his face close to the door, and the other man came up—I saw Wilson's face directly, and followed them close up Regent-street, but when Wilson saw me, they turned down Argyle-street, and I missed them all at once—he put his head into my shop as much as to say, "That is the shop" or something.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">DELLER</hi>. I am a pawnbroker in Long-acre. On the 21st of October, 1839, Lilly pledged a bar of gold at our place for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he repre<lb/>sented it as 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gold—he said he was a jeweller, that he had taken it to a neighbouring pawnbroker's, who had offered him nearly what he asked, and on those representations I lent him the sum he asked—it has not been assayed, but in my judgment it is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—there was about 2 1/2 oz.—about four months after, he came again, and pawned some jewellery—I cannot now ascertain what it was—I said, "You are the party who pawned the bar of gold about four months ago"—he said, "Yes, I am, I shall have it out shortly"—the year expired last Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker in Upper George-street, Bryanstone-square. I know both the prisoners—Wilson brought a suit of clothes to my shop, and put them down to my young man—I was standing alongside—he asked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the coat and trowsers—the young man asked him if he would take 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked him his name and address—I think he said, "Thomas Wilson, No. 40, Nutford-place"—I sent Richardson, my young man, to the house—he returned, and said, in Wilson's presence, that no such person was living or lodging there—Wilson then said, "If you don't like to take them in, give me them back, they are my own property"—I said, "I shall not give them up unless you give a better account of yourself, as you have given a false name and di<lb/>rection"—he then went out—about fire minutes after, Lilly came with Wilson, and said, "D—it, what do you stop my things for? they are mine"—I said, unless they could give a better account of themselves, I should not restore them—on that they both went away—in the course of the day I sent the clothes down to the police-station in Marylebone-lane—Lilly came twice next day, and demanded the property—I said they were at the station-house, and if he went and gave a good account, they would restore them to him—he said he should not do it, and on the fol<lb/>lowing day I was served with a notice of an action—I had examined the clothes—they were <hi rend="italic">duffers,</hi> made up for the express purpose of plunder—I understand jewellery—I should say these stones, in the articles produced, called emerald and rubies, may be manufactured for about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are spurious.</p>

                  </hi>. I hire with my father, John Wallis, a butcher, at Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, in Essex. On the 1st of October I went with a load of wood to Barking, and when I returned my father's pigs were missing—I found the prisoner with them about three miles and a half from my father's, in Little Ilford parish—he was a stranger—I asked if the pigs belonged to him—he said he was minding them for a man who was to give him a pint of beer—I said, I must take him—he said, "What for? Come along with me, and I will show you the man"—I brought him a short distance, and when we got opposite the Rabbits public-house he got into a field and ran—I called to a man who stopped him—he said he ran because I had been beating him with a stick, which I had not.</p>

On the 30th of September I was with it at Deptford—the prisoner came on board to ask if I had any thing to sell—I said, "No"—he asked me two or three times—I then said, "I have got something from the Man<lb/>ritius to take home"—he told me to show it to him, and he would give a good price—I showed him a bottle of Eau de Cologne—he offered me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bottle—I said if he could give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bottle he should have it—he said he was willing to give Ss.—he had no money to pay on board, and so I had better come on shore, and he would give me the money—I let him take it home, and sent my two men with him to receive the money as I could not go myself—he took the things himself—I let him go with them—it was to be paid for afterwards—he said his mother and father would pay the money when he got home—he said he would send back the money by the men—I said, "If he does not give you the money, you can bring it back"—the prisoner heard that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the White Howe, Brixton-road; I know the prisoner by sight. On the 15th of July he came, driv<lb/>ing a horse and cart, to the White Horse at Brixton, about noon—it looked as if it had been driven a long way, it was all in a sweat, but was getting cool—he called for the ostler, I attended to him—he told me to take the horse out, and take the sweat off—I said I would put him into the stable—he said he did not wish him to be in the stable, as he was going to show him to a gentleman—I began to clean him, and another young man finished it—the prisoner said the horse and cart was for sale, and asked what I thought it was worth—I said I could not tell him any thing about it—he said he could sell the lot, he thought, for about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked why he wanted to sell it—he said his master had got two horses,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190190"/>
               <p>but had not work enough to keep two—I have since seen the horse, in the presence of the prosecutor—it is the same horse—the prisoner rode it out of the yard—he asked me to take care of the harness and cart till next day, till he came back—he came back next day, but did not bring the horse—I asked if he had sold it—he said, "Partly sold it"—Bennett was with him—they went into the yard, and began to deal for the cart—Bennett had bought the harness for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they went away together with the cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you lived at the White Horse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between six and seven years—I have lived there six years, with<lb/>out intermission—I was away eleven months five years ago—I lived at Kensington then seven months, and left there and went to Croydon to live—I was all that eleven months in service, and not any where else—I have never been in any sort of trouble—I was called on to identify the pri<lb/>soner, at Park-place, Walworth, about two months after he brought the horse and cart—the only time I saw him was when he brought the horse and cart, and came the next day—he was about three quarters of an hour with me the first day, in the yard all the time, and not in the house at all—the second time he was about three or four hours there, but not in my sight all the time—he was on the premises, and in my sight, between two and three hours—I was backwards and forwards—he had a blue coat on both times—he was dressed different at Walworth—I saw him at the station-house—there were other persons there—he had a brown great<lb/>coat on—he was brought out, and I was asked to look at him—I was asked if he was the man, I said, "Yes," at once—I did not say so the moment I saw him, but five or ten minutes after, at I was not asked before—I did not at first say I doubted whether he was the man, nor that he was not high enough for the man, nor that he was shorter than the man—I had not the least doubt of him—he was brought out, and went under the standard to be measured, and I stood by—as soon as I was asked if he was the man, I said, "Yes"—I never expressed the least doubt of his being the man, I have not the least doubt of him.</p>

               <p>morning, as business would not allow him—I followed the prisoner and the others as far as Edward-street, and then said to them, "If I have any more of this I shall take you down to the station-house," the prisoner then turned round, and struck me with his right-hand in the chest—I fell, and my hat went into the road—I got up, and saw the three going down Edward-street—I saw my brother officer Wheatley at a short distance—I called to him, and told him to go up the next street—I went up another street, and the three parties met me again, and the prisoner knocked me down—I got up and caught hold of him—he tripped me up, and was down on me—I had him and a man named Rooks upon me—the prisoner got up, kicked me in the right eye, and gave me a black eye—I was springing my rattle, which I took out of my pocket, and Richard Bone came out of his house, and came up to me as I was down on my back—the prisoner was alongside of me at the time, and the other men close by, but neither of them on me at that time—Bone said, "Give me your rattle, and I will spring it for you"—he took it and sprung it with both hands—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away from me, and said to Bone, "You old b——, I'll stop you from springing that rattle"—I saw him strike Bone with his right-hand on the left side—Bone had done nothing to him—the prisoner kicked him on the right leg, and then he fell, and when he was down he kicked him on the right leg and then on the left side—Wheatley left me with the other prisoner—the pri<lb/>soner went away from Bone about 100 yards—the other two men were on the spot at the time, one of them scuffling with me and <hi rend="italic">pitching into</hi> me—Wheatley said, "You take care of the other prisoner, while I go and see what has been done to the old gentleman"—I then heard Bone say his leg was broken—the prisoner had then run away from him about 100 yards—I saw Wheatley leave Bone, and go and take the prisoner into custody—Bone was left with Mrs. Holding—I saw two other constables come up while I had Rooks in custody—Wheatley took the prisoner away—Bone was taken on a stretcher to the hospital—no other person kicked him or struck him but the prisoner—he gave him a slight kick on the leg before he fell—the kick on the leg was a severe one, and the one on the side was rather sharpish—the prisoner had low shoes on, not very thick, but not what you would call a light shoe—I saw no other kick given to Bone—I saw Bone afterwards at the hospital—MR. Goodwin, the surgeon, attended him—we left him at the hospital—I saw him after he was dead—he died about a fortnight after—the prisoner was not quite sober—he had been drinking—Bone was sixty-five years of age, and was a private watchman.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it your duty to take me into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The person would not give you in custody or I should—you struck me, and ran up Edward-street—you did not all three cross the road—Bone was about fifteen yards from me when you struck him—I stated so before the Coroner—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being ready agreed with his evidence</hi>)—you did not strike me at the bottom of Edward-street—I did not take out my staff—Wheatley did—I saw you turn down Edward-street—I went about thirty yards down before I met Wheatley—I found you about half way in Robert-street—I was going to lay hold of you, and you knocked me down—I attempted to take you, but you got away from me, and I went to Bone's assistance—you left me while I was down, when I was on my beat, and walked to Bone—Wheatley was with us, and said, "Good God, he is <hi rend="italic">pitching into</hi> the old watchman"—when Wheatley came up he went to Rooks—I took Rooks, and Wheatley took you shortly after—there were more constables than us two afterwards—Wheatley left Bone</p>

               <p>and ran after you—I should say you were with Bone two or three minutes—you struck him on the right side first—I was on my back at that time with Rooks—the first kick you gave seemed a slight one—it was on the left side—the first blow was given on the right-hand, and the second on the right angle, and then he fell—I was in the act of getting up at the time of the last kick—you then left him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 2nd of October, a little after one o'clock, I was on duty, and saw Ross between George-street and Charles-street—he said something to me—I afterwards saw him again in Robert-street, at the corner of Charles-street—he was then standing up, and three persons along with him, two of whom were striking him—the prisoner was one of those who struck—before I got to Ross he was knocked down by the prisoner, and when I got up to him he was down, and two men over him—one on each side—I took hold of Rooks who was nearest to me—the prisoner came round to try to get Rooks from me—I then laid hold of him, and was tripped up, still keeping hold of the prisoner—Ross was in the act of getting' up when the prisoner kicked him, and knocked him down—I then tripped Rooks up, and a scuffle ensued between Ross and Rooks on the ground—Ross had just got his rattle out of his pocket when Bone came up, and said, "Give me your rattle, I will spring it for you"—Bone got the rattle, and ran away some distance with it—I was endeavouring to get Ross off the ground—the prisoner broke from my hold, and I heard him say, "You old b——, I will stop your springing the rattle"—I looked round, and saw him beating Bone, who was then standing up—I said, "Good God, he is beating the old man"—I said to Ross, "You <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to this one"—I left him, and went towards Bone and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner kick him on the leg—he saw me coming behind him, and he jumped on Bone's leg with one foot, and ran on the opposite side of Robert-street—I asked Bone, who was lying down, if he was hurt—he said his leg was broken—I immediately crossed the road after the prisoner—he shifted from there about 100 yards, where I overtook him, and apprehended him—we had a scuffle, and other assistance came from my brother constables—we had a deal of trouble—it took seven of us to take the prisoner and Rooks to the station-house—we sent a stretcher for Bone, and I met them bringing him down Union-street—I went with him part of the way to the hospital—I saw Mr. Goodwin examine him at the hospital, about ten minutes after we got there—I saw no one strike or kick Bone but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at Guy's hospital. Bone was brought there on Friday morning, the 2nd of October, between two and three o'clock—I examined him, and found a compound fracture of the shin bone of the right leg—I examined his left side, where he com<lb/>plained of considerable pain, but no bruise was evident, nor was any bone broken—I found no other injury—he was immediately put to bed, and proper attention paid to him—his leg was laid on a pillow, but I had no<lb/>thing else done to it, except the application of some lotion—he died on the Sunday night week, following the accident—I attended him till three days before he died, when I left town—from the first, the leg assumed a bad appearance—inflammation took place, and it became gangrene in two or three days—when I left him, he was in a very bad state—I scarcely ex<lb/>pected he would live through the night, as mortification had commenced, and he had an attack of pleurisy in the side—he was said to have been kicked two or three days previously—I left him on Friday morning, and returned on Monday afternoon—he was then dead—his body was not ex<lb/>amined—it was the opinion of the surgeons that mortification of the leg caused his death—when I left him, there was no probability of saving his limb or his life—he was not in a state for amputation, which was the only chance of saving his life—nothing had occurred in the hospital to injure him up to the time I left him—he had caught no fever or fresh disease—at the time I left him I thought his life in great danger—there was nothing else dangerous about him but the wound in his leg, and the pleurisy in his side—the leg might be broken either by a kick or a man stamping on it—the pleurisy might be occasioned by a kick in the side, although it produced no external mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright. I had the care of the <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> to repair her—I was on board on Friday evening last, about a quarter to six o'clock, when the people all left—I had that morning received some sheet metal and nails from Moss and Co., and some the day before—I saw them put down in the fore-cabin that evening, and left Wright in charge—I was knocked up next morning, went on board, and saw a police<lb/>man there—I went into the fore-cabin—I did not take any nails out of the vessel—I saw Wright in custody at the station-house, and some new and old nails and new metal, which exactly corresponded with those on board,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190199"/>
               <p>especially the old nails, because they were washed the day before, and left rusty, and they were wet when I saw them—I do not know Cridland or Benbrook—I desired Wright not to leave the ship, or allow any person to come on board.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LUCAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were these nails washed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between three and four o'clock the afternoon before—it was a quarter before seven o'clock next morning that I saw them—they had remained wet all that time—I cannot say they might not have been made wet from being overboard—I am employed to do all the shipwright's work—I order all the things in, and employ the men—the bills are made out to the cap<lb/>tain and owners of the ship—I do not know whether there is any log-book—I believe all the nails came in on Thursday, and the metal on Friday—I think there was 632 sheets—I suppose 450 might have been used, and the remainder was in the fore-cabin—the mate lived on board—he was on board—he is not my officer, but when I have a ship in charge, of course I look after the mate, and tell him what to do—if a mate of mine were to take persons on board I should soon put him out, but I am sorry to say it is too much the practice to do so.</p>
