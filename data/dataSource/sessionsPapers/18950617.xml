                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective B</hi>). I have had some experience in pre<lb/>paring plans—on 12th October I went to 18, Ulster Place, and made a survey of the ground floor—the front-door is a few steps up from the street—just inside the hall door there is a pair of swing-doors—the hall is paved with tiles; on the right hand facing the street is a front room 19 ft. by 13ft.—the staircase is close to the door of that room—I made this plan; it is correct, and to scale; these tracings are correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 136, Maida Vale—I have been a book-maker for many years—I first saw the prisoner about four or five years ago, when he was introduced to me at the Cafe Royal—I met him once after that at Covent Garden early in the morning—I had no conversation with him beyond some passing observation—I know Arthur Cockburn; he attends race meetings—on the night of 30th September last year I met Cockburn at the Criterion—I subsequently went with him to a club in Regent Street—about a quarter of an hour before we left there I saw the prisoner—I did not speak to him, but he and Cockburn were chatting at the bar—Cockburn and I left the club at two or half-past two—the prisoner came out at the same time—Cockburn called up his cab—Taylor said to him "I am going your way; will you give me a lift?"; Cockburn said, "Jump in"—I knew nothing of Ulster Place up to then—I had a parcel of game and fish on the top of the cab—I live next door but one to Cockburn at Maida Vale—when we got near Ulster Place the prisoner invited us in to have a drink; and we three all got out of the cab and went into 18, Ulster Place—we went into the dining-room, and sat down there—we drank Scotch whisky and soda—the prisoner, Cockburn, and myself were there—the prisoner said he was very sorry he had been taken down to Margate, and he did not know they were friends of Cockburn or he</p>

               <p>would never have gone down—they had a chat, and Cockburn said, "I am very glad to hear it," and they shook hands—that was the sort of conversation that took place; it was quiet—after that the prisoner went out of the room—when he came back he brought a friend whom he introduced by the name of Woodward—I had never seen him before, and knew nothing of him—he appeared to be an American by the way he spoke; he was dressed in a suit of pajamas; I could not tell whether he had been in bed or not—Woodward and I had another whisky and soda together—there were then four of us to<lb/>gether in the room—the prisoner went out of the room again for a little time, and then came back again—the card case then came up in conversa<lb/>tion again; I cannot say how it came up—they were all three talking about it—I noticed the prisoner and Woodward were looking very fierce at Cockburn, and in consequence of that I got up and went to the back of Cock burn's chair, and said, "Surely you are not going to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> him," meaning two were not going to set on to one—when I said that I was struck on the left side of the head above the ear, and knocked down almost insensible—I could not say who struck the blow, it was done so very quickly—I got up as soon as I could—I was bleeding—I then saw that Cockburn was lying on the floor on the right hand side of the table, which was in the centre of the room—Woodward was nearest to me on my right, the prisoner was on the right also, but he stood behind Wood<lb/>ward—the prisoner made for me, and I made for him, and Woodward knocked me down again by a blow on the right hand side—I bled as the result of that blow—I was bleeding then from both sides of the head—I should think those were blows with something more than a fist—when I was on the ground the second time as the result of the blow both Woodward and Taylor picked me up and carried me out into the passage—in doing so they had to pass Cockburn, who was lying on the floor—when in the passage Woodward opened the door and pushed me out, and then I heard the chain put up and the door locked—the last I saw of Cockburn was lying on the floor in the dining-room—when I was outside the cabman and the constable came—we tried to get in through the door; I kicked at the door—I did not hear Cockburn's voice while the door was shut—I could not say if the policeman whistled for assistance—the police<lb/>man went into the house through the area—the door was afterwards opened—at that time I heard Cockburn say, "Let me get up"—before the policeman got in I saw a woman come up the area steps—I had not seen any woman while I was in the house—she appeared to be dressed—the cabman who came up was Sutton, who drove Cockburn—I went to the police-station, where I was seen by the divisional-surgeon—I went home—next day I was seen by Mr. Davison, my own doctor—I lost a great deal of blood—I remained in bed four or five days, and after that I suffered for a fortnight or three weeks from the effects of these wounds—I afterwards gave evidence at the Police-court, and the prisoner was com<lb/>mitted for trial at the November Sessions.</p>

               <p>that evening—no betting went on there—Cockburn and the prisoner seemed to be on perfectly good terms at that time, and when we all three went home in a cab—I should think the prisoner had had a drink or so, a reasonable drink—we took some more drink, whisky and soda, in the room—I had two—then the question of cards got up—I could not say who first spoke about them; it came up in ordinary conversation—Taylor said he was very sorry he was taken down, and he did not know they were friends of Cockburn, or he would never have gone down—that was all they talked about—I could not tell you who began it, or how it began—it was ordinary conversation—I think we drank each other's good health first—after that the prisoner left the room—he was dressed in a frock coat and a double-breasted white waistcoat, to the best of my belief—I would not swear he was not in evening dress clothes, but, to the best of my knowledge, he had a frock coat on—I could not say if he had dress shoes on—Woodward was in pyjamas—I did not see anything in the hands of either of them when they came down—the drinks then went on, and I saw something fierce in the looks of the prisoner and Woodward, as if there was going to be a bother—they got angry about arguing the card case—Cockburn, Woodward, and the prisoner argued—I could not exactly say what was said—I understood what was going on; I was getting rather tired of it, and sleepy; I wanted to get home—while the argument was going on I suddenly sprang up—I did not look very fierce—Woodward was next to me—I don't know who struck me—I did not see Cockburn spring up; he was sitting on a chair—I swear he did not spring up at the same time as I did—I was knocked down in a moment—I do not say that Cockburn remained seated when I was knocked down—Cockburn is not a more formidable sort of antagonist when angry than an ordinary man—I don't know how many times he has been convicted of assaults—I never heard, until I was at the Police-court, of his appearing at different Police-courts for having committed violent assaults—he is a strong man—I don't know his weight—it was three weeks after it happened before I was at the races again—the first I went to were at the Alexandra Park, on a Saturday—I and Cockburn drove there together in a cab—I heard nothing said about our staying all night at Ulster Place, and having a game.</p>

On this morning I was in Ulster Place—I saw Saville thrown outside the door; he was lying on his face and hands when I came up to him—the door was closed immediately after he was put outside—I heard a man's voice inside the house say, "Get me my pistol; I will shoot him"—I heard no screams—I went into the area, and the door was opened to us—I went with Cockburn to the station in the cab; I helped to lift him in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 16, Clare Street, and am divisional surgeon of the D Division—I was called to the station to see Cockburn and Saville—I examined Cockburn first—he was in a state of collapse, suffering from a broken jaw, there was a contusion of the right eye, the eyelid was split—the severity of the injuries was such that I applied tem<lb/>porary dressing and had him removed to the hospital on an ambulance—the injury to the jaw might have been caused by a kick—there was an incised wound on the cheek, a cut, it was about one-third of an inch in depth, and about two inches in length—I have been unable to find the notes I made at the time—the wound on the cheek would be caused by something sharp—I examined Saville; his injuries were very severe; he had lost a great quantity of blood from the important wound, which was about four inches long, over the left side of the head above the ear, extend<lb/>ing right down to the bone, and marking the bone—he had another injury on the left forehead, a slighter one, about an inch long—there was a mark on the face as well—the severe wound on the left side must have been caused by a blow with some instrument, it could not have been caused by a fist—it was a direct blow—the injuries to Cockburn were very serious, and dangerous at the time—they had both lost a great deal of blood—it must have been a very violent blow to have caused the fracture of the jaw—I saw the cutlasses—there were marks on the handles I think of both, a kind of smearing—I should say the wounds I saw were not such as would be caused by the cutlasses—the blow on Saville's face was severe, that might have been caused by a fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would have to be a very severe blow by a fist to break the jaw, it would be a very uncommon thing; it was at the strongest part of the jaw, I could not say it would be impossible—a blow with a sharp ring would not account for the wound on Saville's head, it was about four inches long; it could not have been caused by a fall on broken glass—I examined the prisoner hand, there was a cut on the knuckle, a split wound; I should consider it a split of the skin. (<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to examine the prisoner's hand</hi>)—that is the wound—I did not see any inquiry to the tendons at the time, the scar would remain—it did not extend to the bone; there is now only evidence of a breaking of the skin—I should say the bone was not broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On October 1st at the Police-court I noticed the mark on Taylor's hand—I believe I said that it was the sixteenth of an inch deep—he had no other injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCK</hi>. I was house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital at the time of this occurrence—after Cockburn had been taken to the hospital I saw him there—he was suffering from shock—he was a good deal</p>

               <p>collapsed from loss of blood—he was comatose—he had received several severe injuries, and had lost a deal of blood—his jaw was fractured on the right side—that would be the result of considerable violence—the jaw was actually broken; splintered in several places—it had been recently bandaged—I saw several wounds on his forehead—he was under my care for eleven or twelve days as an in-patient—the fracture of the jaw may very possibly have been done by a kick—there was an incised wound on his cheek about 2 1/2 inches long—I do not think that could have been done by a fist, but by an instrument, something sharp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is possible that a fall on a fender might have broken the jaw—I think it very improbable that a blow from a naked fist would have done it—it was about 5a.m. when he was admitted to the hospital—he was comatose—he made some remark which made me think he was not drunk—he had been drinking but as far as I could judge he was not actually drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 203, Maida Vale—I saw Saville on Sunday morning, September 30th, about half past seven, at his house—I was called there to attend him—he was bleeding profusely, and suffering from a severe semi-circular wound on the left side of the scalp, exposing the bone, the skin was hanging to the scalp, clean away from the bone—it was a clean-cut wound—it might have been caused by a sharp blow from a bottle, or soda-water glass—it was about three or three-quarters or four inches long—there was a contused wound on the right temple, evidently done by a blow, a knuckle would not have been firm enough to do it, I think a single knuckle-duster would do it, but probably some sharp instrument; it is difficult to measure a wound like that, but its diameter would be about three-quarters of an inch; it went down to the bone, I could just separate it and see the bone; there was a small bruise on the nose, that was not of very much consequence—there must have been considerable hemorrhage from the wound on the scalp, it was a semi-circular wound—he answered my questions clearly without any hesitation—I think he was in bed three or four days; I attended him for about eight or ten days, and looked in occasionally to see how he was going on—he has now recovered from the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house decorator, of 13, Wyatt Street, Battersea Park Road—on the 13th May I took the 5.30 train to Whitechapel Road, and went to a public-house in Brick Lane to meet a man and pay him some wages—when then the prisoners came in—they came up to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189506170014"/>
               <p>and asked would I stand a drink—I said "No"—I found they were rather rough, so I gave them a drink of ale to get rid of them—I went out to the urinal, leaving my bag of tools there—they followed me out and each took an arm; they took me up some street—Dacey held my arms up and Leary took my money out of my pocket—they kicked me, cut my tongue through, and left me senseless on the ground—I was charged at the Police-court with being in drink, but I was not, I was senseless; I was discharged—I told the police about it—next day I was walking down Brick Lane and saw Leary—I pointed him out to the police and said, "That is the man that robbed me," and I gave him in charge—he said "Don't charge me, old man. I don't know how much money I have taken from you, but I will pawn my clothes and do all I can to repay you"—next day at half-past one I was in Commercial Street, after having charged Leary, and I saw Dacey and pointed him out to a policeman, and said, "That is the other man"—I was in the public-house on the 13th about a quarter of an hour with the prisoners; they must have followed me in—I had two sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and some odd shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a higgler—I live at 2, Crown Court, Pearl Street—I gave evidence before Mr. Cluer at Worship Street a week after 15th May—I was there twice; it was on the second occasion that I was examined as a witness—Dacey's sister asked me to go there—I was with Dacey on Monday, the 13th May, about ten in the morning, in Commer<lb/>cial Tavern—he looked in at the door, and I said, "Hallo, pal, what are you going to have?"—he said, "Half a pint of ale"—he came in, and he re<lb/>mained in my company that day till half-past ten at night, when I left him at his own house, 24 1/2, Great Pearl Street—he was then very drunk—he went into the yard and laid down there, and the woman he lives with found him there; her name is Emily Harvey—while he was in my company that day he did not assault or rob anybody: if he had I should have seen it—I did not see the prosecutor that day—about half-past four we met Mr. Ward and went to Shoreditch, and had a couple of pots of beer, and then went to the house of a friend, Glover, at 40, Buck's Row—he is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sell parsley and sage and onions; that is higgling—I buy the cheapest in Spitalfields Market—I have a stand, and sell things—I went to Worship Street, and gave evidence, and while I was in the witness-box the prosecutor came up behind me and said I had kicked him about, and I had never seen the man; this was in the presence of the magistrate—I have known Dacey from a child; he is a dock labourer—I drank with him all day long in this house on this day—it was about eight when we were at Glover's—he was falling about, he fell over a table, and I helped him up; he broke a lamp-glass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, of 12, Cambridge Buildings, Bethnal Green—I was a Fellowship porter till last year; to be a Fellowship porter you must be respectable, and have the freedom of the City—I have known Dacey five or six years—I was unable to go to Worship Street on either occasion when he was before the magistrate—I heard on the Tuesday night that he was locked up—I had last seen him on Monday, 13th May—on that day I was walking down Commercial Street just before five, and I saw Dacey and Stevens, whom I had seen in the prisoners' company once. or twice, and whom I knew as a higgler—they asked me to accompany them to Shoreditch, and I did so—we went to two different houses and had drink, and I left them at Brady Street, Whitechapel Road, about quarter to eight, and that was the last I saw of Dacey that night—it would not take ordinary people ten minutes to walk from Brady Street to Brick Lane, but they were both worse for liquor, and it would have taken them an hour I should think; they could not travel very fast—I was not the worse for liquor; I did not drink so heavily as they did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 28, Delancy Street, Regent's Park—the prisoner and her husband have occupied a room at my house from 27th April this year—on 18th May the prisoner came there with two children—one of them, the deceased, was a baby about three months and a fortnight old—they had one room and the use of the breakfast-room—on Wednesday morning, the 22nd May, at twelve o'clock, she put her arms round my neck and kissed me, and said, "Agnes, I feel dreadful; I feel that I must drown my two children and myself"—I told her that her troubles were not like mine, that she had a husband to work for her, and I had no one—she appeared to be in a state of great depression—on Sunday night, the 26th, she and her husband were with me in the breakfast-room; we were singing hymns; she was nursing the child—she and her husband and child went to bed about a quarter to twelve that night—I heard nothing during the night—next morning about a quarter to eight her husband came in and spoke to me; he went out and brought the police—I then went up to prisoner and said, "Oh, Lizzie, what have you done?"—she simply stared, and said nothing; she was in her bedroom dressing—I afterwards went into the washhouse and saw the baby in a bath in the sink, and two pieces of rug which were usually in the bedroom.</p>

On the morning of May 27th, while I was on duty in High Street, Camden Town, the prisoner's husband came and spoke to me—I went to 28, Delancy Street—in the back kitchen there I saw the body of a child lying in a bath with its clothes on—there was enough water to cover it—its food bottle was there, and two pieces of rug—I took the child out at once, and found it was dead—I then went into the room where the prisoner was—I told her I should take her into custody for drowning her child—she stared at me, but made no reply—in consequence of the condition in which she was I communicated with the divisional surgeon—he came to the house—before he came I sent the prisoner with two constables to the station.</p>

               <p>afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was suffocation from drowning—I went to the station and saw the prisoner there—I told her I was a medical man, and I asked her if she complained of anything—she then made a statement to me, of which I made notes—she said, "I feel impelled to do bad things, never to do good things. I have no desire to live; I would rather die than anything else. I wanted to do something for which they would hang me. I felt that I must take the child and drown it; I had no control over myself, so I just held the child in the bath and left it there. I have had a dragging pain at the back of my head and a lifting at the top, ever since the furniture has been sold; my temples have been wound up and have been going ever since. I have a dreadful pain at the pit of my stomach. I should like to stab myself there so as to get from that which pains me; my grief has been so great that I cannot cry—ever since baby was born I have been very low-spirited and depressed"—her condition was that of melan<lb/>cholia, a sort of puerperal mania, that very often occurs during lactation.</p>

               <p>Putney Bridge—on Monday, 22nd April, about half-past eight, I went into a urinal in Oxford Market, which is close to Oxford Circus—as I left the urinal, the prisoner Mooney came and caught hold of my arm and asked me if I would give him a drink; he was out of work and hard up—I pulled away from him, and was walking on with this fellow holding my arm, and I could not get away from him—the other two prisoners came up behind me and caught hold of my arm and one of them, I could not say which said, "Now I have got you, you scamp"—I said, "What is it all about; what for?"—they said it was an Oscar Wilde business; that they were detectives, and I had to go to the police-station—Shepherd caught hold of Mooney's arm, and was talking to him, and he also hold of my right arm—Mooney began crying, and offered to pay 5s. to be let free, and Shepherd turned to me and said, "There, you see, he has offered to pay five shillings. What are you going to do?"—I said, "That makes no difference to me; I will not give you a penny, I will go to the station"—Shepherd said, "I will make it pretty hot for you, my lord"—they then turned to Mooney and said, "I am surprised that you should be mixed up with this sort of thing," and the same thing was said to myself—he said, "It is no use your denying it, you know," and then he said to Mooney, "What has been going on?"—"Oh," he said, "I tossed him off"—there is not a word of truth in it—Shepherd asked if we could not come to a settlement—"You are a man of position, and I should not like to mix you up with this sort of thing"—I said, "I prefer going to the station"—all this time we were walking along Castle Street—they had hold of my arm—two gentlemen were passing—I saw that the prisoners were not detectives—Wilton put his fist in my eye, and said, "We will make it hot for you, my lord"—when the gentlemen came up they all ran away together—on May 6th I was fetched to the station in Tottenham Court Road, and there saw about eighteen men, and I picked out Wilton and Mooney first, and then I looked round and picked out the other one—Wilton was afterwards in the hospital—he was brought before the Magistrate, and I was recalled to see him.</p>

I should like to give you a thrashing as well"—the two gentlemen stopped; I explained to them, and they went away—I have not seen them since—I did not notice any<lb/>body else in the urinal—I first described Mooney as a dark boy about seventeen, and wearing a black coat or jacket—I could not describe him fully at that time, but I knew his face again directly I saw him—he had a very boyish appearance, and was shaven—it was outside the urinal that he accosted me—it was a fortnight after that I identified him—hav<lb/>ing a collar makes a great deal of difference in his appearance.</p>

I am a corn dealer at 42, Great Castle Street—the urinal in Oxford Market is opposite my shop—on Tuesday evening, 23rd April, about half-past eight, I was standing at my door, and saw Mr. Francis pass, walking towards Oxford Street; one of the prisoners (Moody, I think) was with him—he had hold of Mr. Francis' arm; they were close to me, only a few yards away—I saw the other two prisoners following close behind; they passed on out of my sight—on Monday, 6th May, about half-past eight in the evening, I went in the Cock public-house in Great Portland Street, and saw the three prisoners there—Shepherd jumped up directly he saw me, and ran out at the door—I went to the door and said to an officer, "That is one; I know him"—I had been in communication with the detectives—I pointed to Shepherd, and an officer arrested him—I then went back to the house with the officer, and pointed out Moody and Wilton—I knew the three prisoners well by sight before the 23rd of April, and a lot more besides—I have frequently seen the three prisoners together—I had spoken to Moody; at least, he spoke to me; I spoke to him with my fist—I had spoken to Shepherd before—I had seen them together, close to my house; I have had to send them away from there for annoyance.</p>

On 26th April this case came to my notice—in consequence of information I kept observation, and on Monday, the 6th March, about half-past eight in the evening, I was with another officer in Oxford Market, and saw Wilton and Moody standing together close by the urinal—I saw Moody go into it five times, each time immediately following a gentleman—I afterwards saw him and Wilton go to the White Hart public-house—they then came back to the urinal, and were joined by three other men in Castle Street, and the five went into Great Portland Street and went into the Cock public-house—at that time I was in communication with Mr. Hawkins—I sent him into the house—Shepherd immediately rushed out, and Hawkins said-in-his hearing, "That is one of them; that is Jack Shepherd"—I immediately arrested</p>

               <p>him, and took him back to the Cock, and Moody and Wilton were there arrested by other police officers—I then said to them, "We are police-officers, and have to arrest you three men on a warrant for demanding money by menaces"—Shepherd said, "You have made a mistake; I have never seen these two men till I met them in the public-house this evening"—I took them to the station, and read the warrant to them—Moody said nothing—Wilton said, "You have made a mistake, but I hope you will give us a fair identification"—later the same evening I brought in eight other men from the street, casual passers-by, as near as possible like the prisoners in age and stature—I told the prisoners to take up their position amongst them, and after that I asked them if they were satisfied with the men among whom they were standing—each one said "Yes"—thereupon the witness Francis was brought in, and in my presence he identified all of them—Wilkin and Moody said, "You have made a mistake, I have never seen you before in my life." Shepherd said, "He has picked us out, and I suppose we shall have to put up with it, the police have given us a fair chance."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Shepherd gave his address at a lodging-house in Percy Street—Wilton gave his as the County Council lodging-house in Drury Lane—Moody's mother lives at 24, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road; that is about ten minutes' or a quarter of an hour's walk from Oxford Market.</p>

He said, "You say you are a police-officer, anyone can say that, show me your authority"—I took him to the inspector.</p>

I live at 33, Ousney Crescent, and am manageress at the Universal Stock Exchange, Cockspur Street, Mr. Mackornick's estab<lb/>lishment—on November 30th, 1894, the prisoner came and wanted to open an account, and did so in Brighton "A's"—he signed this document "Ernest Hamilton," and I witnessed it—it is the terms of business—he produced this card, "Ernest Hamilton, 35, Holland Street, Kensington," and I wrote this purchase order for £1,000 Brighton "A's," and he signed it—I do not think I saw him again till December 8th, when the transaction was closed; £49 odd was then due to him, and he gave me this cheque for £49 9s. 10.l.—it is signed by Mr. McCormack—I received with the cheque this receipt signed "Ernest Hamilton"—I identified him in the Mansion House Justice Room in May, from a number of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said, "I think you have made a mistake;" I said, "I think not"—I saw Miss Giles at the Mansion House on May 2nd—she went there before me—all the men were well dressed, with black coats on, and in the same class of life as himself—I did not go to Cloak Lane before I went to the Mansion House—my attention was called to November 23rd a week or so before May 2nd—I have a great deal to do all day opening and closing accounts—this account was of the ordinary business character—the transaction took place in the open office; other lady clerks were there, there are about twenty in the office—I sent the man the cheque to the address he left—I did say before the Lord Mayor, "I don't think this is the one"—I won't swear it is not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Edward Culver, of 60, Myddelton Street, Clerkenwell—on December 21st, 1894, two men came—the prisoner is one of them—a card with "Ernest Hamilton" on it was produced, and I was asked for some gold chains—the prisoner said he was a dealer, and had a large jewellery establishment up West, and several of his customers required chains—I said that as we did not know him we should require a cash deposit—he said that he was prepared to leave cash for whatever he took away—he was there about a quarter of an hour, and selected seven chains—after he had selected the chains I went out and left him there—some of the chains were sent back next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Culver was at his desk, and I left the clerk Bryant to enter the chains—he is not here, nor was he at the Mansion House—he has not been called at all—I went to Cloak Lane Station on May 2nd, and saw Miss Giles there—I was taken into a room where there were a number of men, and she went in two or three minutes after me—several of the men were of a lower class, but I should not like to say that only two or three were respectably dressed—I picked out the prisoner from those men—I have said, "I heard the prisoner speak in the Court in a low voice; I could scarcely hear him"—the Lord Mayor called my attention to the fact that he had made some application about his property—the only thing to fix my attention on the men was that they were strangers—we do not often have strangers—the cheque was sent by post.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London and County Bank, Richmond, Surrey—in 1892 John Piers Ellisson had an account there—the prisoner is the man—he operated on that account by several cheques (<hi rend="italic">eight cheques produced</hi>)—he signed the book—I have compared it with the signatures to the cheques, and they are identical—the account was closed on May 16, 1894—these paid cheques were in the pocket of the pass-book, which I produce—it is absolutely correct as to the debits and credits.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Inspector</hi>). At the beginning of this year I made inquiries, and went to Nice—I saw the prisoner there with a man not in custody, out whose name I know; I saw him day by day for about a month, and also at Monaco and Monte Carlo—I afterwards saw them in Paris—I communicated with London, and English came over; he walked on one side of the Avenue de 1'Opera, and I on the other on March 1st—when they had passed English, the prisoner stopped and looked, and touched the man with him, and both looked in the direction English was going—the man not in custody touched Small, and both walked away, I followed them up the Rue St. Honore—I did not know their address—I attended at the Gare du Nord on March 9th—I saw the prisoner with some luggage, which I saw registered and put into the train—the initials on it were, "J. S. G."—I got into the train and got out at Calais, and met the prisoner face to face on the platform—I went on to the boat, and when I got to Dover I found he was not on the boat—I communicated with Sager, went to Holborn, and found some luggage un<lb/>claimed with the initials, "J. S. G."—it was removed from there—I was with Wright when the prisoner was arrested at Homerton—I had shaved my beard off before I went to Nice, Monte Carlo, and Paris—Wright addressed the prisoner as Ellisson, he said, "I am going to arrest you on a charge of forging and uttering cheques"; he replied, "It is awkward, very awkward, I am going to meet a 'tart'"—I said, "I have not seen you since you were at Calais"—he said, "You have altered, I saw you at Paris and Monte Carlo"—I said, "You did not appear to like the sea voyage"—he laughed—he was then taken to Cloak Lane station—the initials on his shirt were "J. S. G."</p>

                  </hi>. I have made the study of handwriting a good many years and practice as an expert—I have seen the cheque, signed "J. Piers Ellisson," and the endorsement, "J. Pringle, jun., 40, Clerken<lb/>well Road," on the £100 note, and I believe they were written by the same person—I have seen the two forged cheques and the cheque for £49 9s. 10d., and have compared the endorsement, "Ernest Hamilton," with the signature to the terms of business; it does not appear to be the same, but I cannot give a positive opinion—the real cheque for £49 2s. 10d.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189506170031"/>
               <p>appears to be the same, but it is very easy to imitate, anyone who could use a pen freely could write that hand—on the endorsement to the cheque for £640 I see a similarity between the "E" in Evans and the "E" in Ellisson in the shape of the upper loop and in the middle of the "E"—the £100 note changed at Rheinhardt's has the same kind of writing in the endorsement; there is a strong similarity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not examined by the Lord Mayor—I have not had these documents in my hands before to-day—I have been regularly called in Treasury prosecutions for some years—I have seen the "Ernest Hamilton" in the signature book of the City Bank, and I have had the terms of business, and there is a very strong resemblance between them, such as I think a bank cashier would honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have given time and attention to the subject to-day, I have been looking at documents all day long—there is a capital "J" in Junior, and a capital "J" here, you see, where the "J" commences—the next is the capital "P," the way in which it is finished—then the small "g" in "Pringle" which is made exactly like a "j"; that com<lb/>pared with two "g's" in the name of Gosling, to whom the cheque is made out; it is made like a "j" at the end, with a little bend in the back, and the curve of that stroke corresponds exactly with the "g" in Pringle—the Ernest Hamilton signatures are such a common form of writing as to be easily copied, and are quite different from the fine writing on the Bank of England note—it is a good hand, quite right if two Hamiltons were trying to write alike.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my wife and children at 13 and 15, King Street, Hammersmith, above the shop of Alfred John Palmer—the ground floors of both 13 and 15 form that shop—there is a staircase from our premises down into the shop below—on the 6th June I went to bed' between ten and 10.15, after examining the premises as usual, and found them locked and secure—I came down at 7.25 next morning to open the premises, and I found a cash-box on the floor by the egg counter, open; the tray of it was on the floor—that cash-box was not there the night before—there was some foreign money by the side of it, and a piece of paper, one of our own forms—the cashier's desk had been broken open, and two other cash boxes were lying on the seat broken open; the tray of one was missing—I cannot say what was taken from the cash boxes—in the despatch room I found a large tin box, in which we kept coppers, under the</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Palmer, of 13 and 15, King Street, Hammersmith, and I have charge of the cash—on 6th June, about 5 or 5.15, I left the premises, after locking up £10 to £12 in coppers in 5s. packets or bags in an iron box under the desk—there were packets of farthings—some of the packets of pence may have contained 10s., but the usual amount in a packet is 5s.—in the desk I left three cash-boxes; two contained £5 each in silver and bronze—next morning when I came I found the cash-boxes lying on the floor, and the copper-box was in the despatch room—I missed about £20 in all—some French copper coins and a few loose English pence were left on the floor—I missed a 10-cent. French coin which had been in the cash-box with other foreign coins, a gold scarf pin, a carbuncle pin, an old crown piece of 1820, and two fishmonger's aprons made of dark blue serge—they are used in our business—the crown-piece, dated 1820, and 10-cent. piece are similar to those I lost—these rolls of coppers are similar to the ones stolen—this is a broken packet of halfpence; only one halfpenny remains—some of the coppers were wrapped in brown paper, and some in news<lb/>paper, and some in coloured paper—I changed some coppers for the secre<lb/>tary of some sports at Hammersmith—our coppers were wrapped in similar papers to these—we used no particular paper; we changed coppers for customers.</p>

Although I know all about it I had nothing to do with it. Last Thursday afternoon, Ernest Baker left home about 1.30 p.m., promis<lb/>ing to meet me over the water. I took his little niece Florry with me, but I did not see him. I returned home, and came out again at eight p.m. I met Ernest in Hammersmith about nine p.m. He had no inten<lb/>tion to do anything wrong that night. We were to have a drink in the Hop-poles, then to go home. He had no intention to do anything wrong at all, but was enticed into it by <hi rend="italic">Ginger</hi> Barker, whose right name is Fisher. Barker called Baker out of the bar once or twice. I don't know what they went out for. About a quarter to twelve they called me to the passage to go home. As we left the passage John Connell met us. Barker and Baker and Connell all got into one cab together. I went home in another cab with Albert Goddard. Goddard did not leave the Hop-poles while I was there. When I got home to 165, Warrington Road, Baker and Barker and Connell were in my room; then I saw packets of coppers on my table. They agreed to and did give Albert Goddard 10s. Connell received £4. I don't know what became of the other money. Goddard left soon after. Cornnell left at six a.m. on the 7th. I left home 11.30 a.m., leaving Barker and Baker in my room. Last night I was told that Barker and Baker were punished for breaking into Palmer's Stores. I was obliged to get into my room through the window because Ernest had the key; 35s. was left by him in my room. This (Saturday) morning Goddard came with me to change the money. Some he changed at an off-license beer-house in Peterborough Road, and some in packets at a baker's in the same road. He kept the change, saying he knew that I should be taken, as they had been after me. I went to the Police-court, and was arrested. I don't think Connell arid Goddard were in the job, but they both shared in the money"—the same evening about eleven I saw Connell in King Street opposite the Hop-poles; as soon as he saw me he rushed into the Hop-poles—I went in; in the crowd he turned round once or twice; his face from me—I caught hold of him, and said, "I want you"—I took him to the station—about an hour afterwards Goddard was brought in, and he, Connell and Pain were placed together in the dock—I said to Connell and Goddard, "Now listen to this," and I read Pain's statement; Connell said, "I deny it"—Goddard made no remark—the charge was afterwards read to them; neither said anything—on Connell was found 4s. 7 1/2 d—at the remand before the Magistrate on 12th this statement was re-read—Goddard said, "I admit changing the money at the baker's."</p>

Ginger wanted me to have coppers, but I would not at that time in the morning; it was what they owed me"—on the evening of 8th June I went to the house, 165, Warrington Road, Paddington—the landlord and landlady let me in—the ground floor back room was pointed out to me as having been occupied by Baker and Pain—this key, which was given to me by Markham, as having been found on Barker, opened the door—I found in the room twenty farthings and a Jersey halfpenny—Connell, Goddard, and four other men were placed for identification at the Police-station, and a cabman picked out Connell.</p>

                  </hi>, I am receiving ward attendant at this workhouse—about one p.m. on 6th June I came back from dinner and looked into the receiving ward—I saw the prisoner there, and no one else—I asked him if anyone had come in; he said, "No"—I went to the porter's lodge, just opposite—from that lodge you can see who comes in and leaves the receiv<lb/>ing ward—while there no one went into the ward—I saw the prisoner leave the ward and go round to the right—I asked him where he was going; he made no reply—after that I saw smoke coming out of the receiving ward window—I went in and Raw smoke coming from the top of the cupboard—I got a fire bucket from the back room and called the porter, who got on the table and poured a couple of buckets of water down the skirting—he got the pannikin out; it contained this rag, which I had supplied him with in the morning—the cupboard panelling was charred, and two of the shirts scotched—for the ten minutes before I saw the smoke the prisoner was the only person in the ward—I heard him say when charged, "No one saw me do it"—the prisoner is taller than I am—standing on the table, I could place a pannikin on the top of the skirting.</p>

On May 17th, about one in the day, I went to 104, Haggerston Road, to the first floor front room—the prisoner was not there—the deceased was lying on the bed unconscious, breathing heavily—the left side of her face and chin was very much bruised, and she had a black eye—when I saw her next day I saw bruises on the right side—there were indications of</p>

               <p>paralysis; she never recovered consciousness—the left side was bruised rather behind and over the ear—the ear was cut; that was the result of violence—the bruise under the chin was, I should say, caused by a blow—all the bruises I saw were recent—on the 18th, when I went again, I saw a fresh bruise on the right ear and temple—that was caused by a blow, I should say inflicted within twelve hours—it takes within six or eight hours for a bruise to develop, I should say at least an hour and a half or two hours—she died on Saturday afternoon at five minutes to five—in con<lb/>junction with another surgeon I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found sixty-five bruises on the body—one behind each ear, and two run<lb/>ning at the back of the kidney; one was over the left kidney, which was ruptured; that might have been inflicted with the toe of a boot; it could not have been caused by an ordinary fall, only by a fall from a height or downstairs—I should think it must have been inflicted while lying down on the floor—the bruises behind the ears had resulted in rupture of blood-vessels on the brain—the extent of the bruises behind the right and left ears was rather greater than the surface of the ears, and extended a little before and behind them; and in my opinion that violence on the ears caused the rupture of the blood-vessel and death—on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I found a large clot of blood extending over the brain which in my opinion was caused by either or both of those injuries—that would account for the paralysis I found in the cheek—the injury on the back, possibly caused by a boot and causing the rupture of the kidney, would have been sufficient in itself to cause death—the primary cause of death was the rupture of the blood-vessels on the brain; the rupture of the kidney and shock to the system from it would contribute to the death; I do not say it would accelerate death—none of the sixty-five wounds which I found on the woman were of old standing; there were other wounds apart from the sixty-five, which were of old standing—there was some furniture in the room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector, Scotland Yard</hi>). On 27th April I obtained this search warrant to search 57, Chester Terrace, Eaton Square—on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189506170051"/>
               <p>29th, about three p.m., I saw the prisoner near Sloane Square Station—I said, "Mr. Howard"—he turned round—I said, "You are Mr. Mendel Howard, of 57, Chester Terrace, and you are the occupier of the house"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am Inspector Jarvis, of Scotland Yard; your name has cropped up in connection with certain suspected persons, and I want to have a chat with you at your place"—he accompanied me to the house, and opened the door with his latch-key—we went into the front door, and I produced my warrant, and said, "Mr. Howard; this is my real business; we have a warrant to search your premises"—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I know what you want; I will save you a lot of trouble; you will find nothing in this part of the house"—I followed him to the basement, with the other officers who accompanied, me—the back room in the basement was locked with a padlock, which he unlocked with a key on a ring—we followed him in—I saw two printing presses and photographic appliances and chemicals in the room; other things were in a cupboard which was not locked—in a locked iron box I found sixteen metal plates for pro<lb/>ducing 1,000 franc notes of the Bank of France; each was for the produc<lb/>tion of a particular part of the note, some for the front, some for the back, another for the signatures, and so on—I found sixteen photographic glass negatives of those plates, six ditto very much enlarged, four enlarged photos of the same, a lithographic stone for producing the water-mark, twelve enlarged photographs of a 100 franc note, two small negatives of the same, five unfinished notes for 1,000 francs, seven pieces of water-marked paper for 1,000 franc notes—I found the following things for printing bonds and coupons of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Rail<lb/>way Company. Nine plates, three small negatives of bond stamps, one litho<lb/>graphic stone with the company's name thereon, five pieces of bond paper with watermark of the company impressed, fifty-two unfinished bonds, these two genuine bonds with coupons attached, seventy-one sheets of unfinished coupons on paper very similar to the genuine ones, two photo<lb/>graphs of bonds, three bronze stamps, three photographs on glass of stamps for the same, ten negatives of bond coupons and stamps; one portion of a genuine bond and coupon cut from the bond No. 254846, which we found in the box, and pasted on glass—that portion contains the arms of the company, and is stamped with a die, of which we found this facsimile made on copper apparently—on the back of the genuine bonds, just where the coupons are attached, is a stamp produced by an India rubber stamp—I found this metal stamp which would produce the same impression—I found this official list of bonds stopped in France, and among them are the numbers of these two railway bonds which we found—we found no completed bonds of the railway company with the coupons attached—the coupons were separate; some of them were numbered—none of the bonds were com<lb/>pleted with their numbers corresponding with any of the stopped bonds—at the place where the genuine bond is joined to the coupons there is some very small printing, which is half covered where they are joined; that small printing is reproduced—I also found this stamp for producing the impression which I found on the face of the bond—I found the following materials for producing Belgian notes and bonds:—Two nega<lb/>tives of a twenty-franc note on the Banque Nationals de Bruxelles; three enlarged photographs of the Ville de Bruxelles bonds; two nega<lb/>tives</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189506170052"/>
               <p>of the Ville de Bruxelles coupons; six enlarged photographs of sections of the Ville de Bruxelles bonds; a negative of the Antwerp bond loan; a lithographic stone with the arms of the City of Antwerp there on, to produce the water mark; six sheets of Antwerp coupons un<lb/>finished; four unfinished bonds with coupons attached; three photographs of sections of the same bonds and coupons; seven Ville des Anvers bonds un<lb/>finished, having the water-mark corresponding to the genuine—the following things we found relating to German notes: Three metal plates, with sections of a five-mark note; three negatives of same; two photo<lb/>graphs of the above sections; one photograph of the whole of the front of a five-mark note; seven proof sheets of sections of the five-mark note, and the negative of a section of a note, value not shown; this genuine five-mark note, of which this appears to be a reproduction—this is the metal plate for printing the figure of a man in armour, which appears; this appears to be an impression from that plate—I found the following relating to America: Three plates of United States ten-cent notes; a plate showing a portion of the United States one-dollar note; a plate showing two heads of Martha Washington, as it is on the United States notes; a negative of an Equador postage-stamp; an unfinished portion of a United States dollar note; five negatives of dollar notes with Martha Washington thereon; two negatives of portions of dollar notes—this is the collection of plates for producing these ten-cent and one-dollar notes' and these are the genuine ten-cent and one dollar notes—in the whole collection there is no complete reproduction; the 1,000 franc note is complete all but the water-mark—we found the apparatus for producing that, and pieces of similar paper on which the water-mark was impressed—this is paper impressed with the water-mark of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Railway Company, and this is the plate for producing it—there is ink on these plates for producing the bonds and coupons of that company—this is a plate for producing the waves and marks at the back of the bonds and coupons—there is a separate plate for producing the printing at the back of the bond—this is the plate for producing the official's signature, and this for producing the water-mark on the 1,000 franc note—I also found two printing machines, photographic cameras, printing rollers, a fret saw, chemicals, silver sand, lithographic stones and other things—I said to the prisoner I should have to charge him with the felonious possession of these articles—he said, "I am an experimentalist; you cannot prove I have put any of these things off; but I suppose they will <hi rend="italic">squeeze</hi> me for it"—I also found there a quantity of this note-paper, with the printed heading, "M. Howard, general merchant, dealer in old bank notes and coins, 63, Queen Victoria Street."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I probably mentioned the name of Kerr and other suspected persons when I met you—I don't remember if you said you knew them—I did not say, "You are suspected of having made some credit letters for Kerr"—I think I asked you in your house whether you knew Kerr; we were two hours searching—I may have said in the street that your name had been brought to my knowledge in con<lb/>nection with Kerr and other suspected persons—after going to your study and taking down the plates and papers, I said, "How do you account for the possession of these things?"—I did not ask if you had a revolver—you</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-manager of the Secretarial Depart<lb/>ment of the Bank of France—I have had great experience in all matters re<lb/>lating to the manufacture of bank notes for fifteen years past, principally in connection with forgeries—I have examined a number of things found on the prisoner's premises by the police on 29th April—I have produced here a genuine specimen of a 1,000 franc note of the Bank of France, and I have examined a number of samples in a more or less complete state of the 1,000 franc notes found on the prisoner's premises. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner stated that he did not suggest that things found on his premises were not imitations of French notes, but that he wanted to show that nothing found was complete</hi>)—some of the notes found are complete except for the water-mark, and people do not always look at water-marks—in the present condition they would deceive an ordinary person, not an experienced eye like that of a cashier—this is complete as to the number and signatures—the water-mark is impressed on these pieces of paper—I have seen all the material necessary to make a complete note—the Bank of France could print a genuine note with these materials; we could not print a sufficient quantity, and there would be some differences, but we could print notes to deceive the ordinary public with these things—I could print one with these things that would deceive the cashier of the Bank of France—the prisoner has no authority from the Bank of France—I have made searches for the last eleven years, and we do not know his name; he never came to make any offers of services of any kind—we get officers to improve our notes and so on—I have seen some enlarged photographs of the 100 franc note; all that concerns the 1,000 franc note is finished; the 100 franc note is on its way to it—the first step to forge a note is to take a negative and enlarge it—these enlargements are incomplete; they remain at that stage; but the forgery of the 100 franc note would have been better than that of the 1,000 franc note—these are the two parts for the 1,000 franc note, one for the blue colour and the other for the pink—this enlargement for the 100 franc note is taken direct</p>

               <p>from the glass on ferro-prussiate paper, and the parts of the blue you want to remove are taken out with acids, which were found in his possession—the signatures are printed in black, and that is done from another plate—this is my authority to represent the Paris, Lyons and Mediterranean Railway Company—I find here exact imitations of certificates and coupons of that company—the coupons are not attached—they are done by the same process, and the dies and stamps and all that is necessary is here—the prisoner had no authority from that company; he is quite unknown to them; I have searched the company's records—these two genuine bonds were stolen—this is an official list published in Paris, and circulated throughout France, of bonds that have been stopped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This must have been ferro-prussiate paper, but I cannot see now, because it has been removed—the paper on which I found the water-mark is good paper—this is a copy of the 1,000 franc note without the water-mark—there is the mark of "Reve" on this paper; he is a French paper maker; it is ordinary paper—this 1,000 franc note requires to have the edges cut, and to have the water-mark—there has not been applied to it the stuff which makes it appear yellow—nothing else is wanting—there is no fine hatching running over this as there is over the original; that is so small a difference that it would not deceive a cashier, but it would deceive the public—although the original note has the yellow tint, and is printed in cobalt and magenta, you can photo<lb/>graph it, because it is photographed here—the 1,000 franc note is not complete; but it is complete enough to deceive—this plate for printing the pink part of the note is coated with bitumen—I am an expert in notes, not in preparing plates—I suppose it would take four hours to print from this plate in the sunshine; it would take very long in London weather—this sheet of coupons seems to have been printed from this plate; it fits the plate as far as I can see; there seems a little difference in size; I suppose that came from moving the plate—the sheet could be printed from this plate—all the coupons are of the same size—I suppose the plate is the exact size of the original—I incline to say that you might have been able to make your copies of the same size as the original—the stamp on the back of the bond seems the same size as the original—the figures on this numerator seem a little larger than those on the coupons; I cannot see that they are a different shape—the paper is not damped before it is printed on—I have seen a great many of the chemicals; some are used for the photo-mechanical process, and many are used for making inks—borax is not used for photo-mechanical process, but it may be used for arranging the paper—iodine may be used mixed with other things—salicylic acid is used in chemistry—chloride of calcium is used for the colours—I don't know what many chemicals are used for—if someone could find out the means by which the forgery of bank notes could be prevented it would be worth a large sum of money—among your things were found hundreds of nega<lb/>tives; that would be the beginning of the work—I don't know that they have all been used—I daresay you made some till you got one you were satisfied with—I only saw about twenty negatives—I suppose they were all for the same work—the plates for printing the numbers and names were only intended for the 1,000 franc note—I do not know what the three-colour</p>

               <p>printing process is; it is a new process—I could not say exactly how old these 1,000 franc note plates are; I would say a year or perhaps more—French bank notes are engraved, and then <hi rend="italic">galvanos</hi> are made from the original plate, for printing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Blue ink has been used on one plate and pink on another, and the plates have been recently used—blue and pink are the predominating colours of the French bank notes—those colours can be photographed; it is a very well-known process; a man did it a short time ago by the same process as the prisoner.</p>

The policeman came up and said, "Have you a pistol!" I said, "Yes." The young man told his story. There was nobody else there; the street was vacant. It is a bad thing for me. I may be sent to prison for a hundred years, and when I come out the mystery of the revolver will be made known.</p>

My wife, Mary Worboys, aged forty-eight, to whom I have been married for this past fourteen years, came in drunk (which is usual), and commenced to abuse me, and said that I had been living with a woman named Goody</p>

               <p>(a widow), the wife of a cabman, who has been dead about two years, and who belonged to a slate club which was held at the Victoria Baths, Martin's Road, Peckham, and who, whilst sick, I visited, being directed so to do as a member of the said club. I denied that I knew anything about the woman, as to sleeping with her, or anything wrong. She still kept on abusing me and pulled me out of bed two or three times, and kept on striking me with her hands. I then lost my temper and struck her, and knocked her against the window, and struck her several times with a piece of iron used as a rake for fire stoves. She then fell on the floor. I then picked up the chamber and struck her on the head, and afterwards put my thumbs in her throat and strangled her; and left her, as I thought, dead. I wish to add that previous to this I was an inmate, at Saint Saviour's Union in the Borough, from the 21st March till 2nd April, present year, and then went to Gravesend to work on the 3rd and came back to London same night, and went into Constance Road Work-house, Dulwich, where I remained till 29th April, during which time she (my wife) got out an order for me to pay her 7s. a week for deserting her. On the 29th ult. I went to Eltham, and returned on the following day, and went into Gordon Road Workhouse, and remained there till the 4th inst. When I went home she (my wife) presented a maintenance order to me for deserting her. I then went to see the doctor at Constance Road Workhouse, and was told that I would have to see Mr. Hall, the relieving officer. I did see him, and he told me that unless I could tell him where I was when the order was made, he would do nothing in t. I told him I was in Constance Road Workhouse from the 3rd to the 29th April. He (relieving officer) then said 'I can do nothing in it'") That statement was made about ten minutes past three in the morning—he was detained, and the police went to the house—while he was waiting he put up his two thumbs, and said, "I put these in her gullet, and she did die hard, governor"—a short time afterwards he said, "I thought I may as well do the job and be hanged, as to be made a convict of"—Inspector Briggs and Swaddling went to the house, and when they returned the prisoner was charged with the murder of his wife—he was perfectly cool and collected in manner—when he first came to the station his thumb was cut and bleeding; I bound it up.</p>

I meant to make a good job of it. Was she cold when you got there?" I said, "Not quite." He said, "Is she dead? Will she get over it?" I said, "She is dead." He said, "That is all right"—he requested me to go back to the house, and said, "You will find pawntickets on a sideboard in the kitchen, showing she has pledged my things"—I went back and found eleven pawntickets; all but one of them related to woman's attire—the tools he pledged in April.</p>

Purver"—I first saw this printed sheet when the prisoner delivered it to me on December 7th—I did not call his attention to it, nor did I at the meeting call his attention to its being a forgery, but I told the society at the meeting of the executive council on February 6th.</p>
