I am a preferable labourer at the Docks, and was acting in the warehouse, No. 6, on Saturday the 25th of May—the prisoner was the foreman there—at the commencement of the day I was ordered to press the bales of cotton—I continued there till about two, when he ordered me to the back of the warehouse, to assist in filling mats with cotton—I took a portion of it out of the original bales, to put into the mats—he saw ne do it, and directed me to do it—I put what I took out of the bales into mats, suspended to receive it—there was a man to tread it down close into the mats—it was sewed at the top, and removed to another part of the floor—I cut one bale of good cotton open by direction of the prisoner—I assisted to take the whole of it out of that bale to put it into the mat—the prisoner did part of it—I could not say whether he remained there the whole time—the cotton is always in fakes in the original bales—he saw the flakes put in—I made no observa<lb/>tion to him while it was going on—he told me there was an onto that he should leave the Docks and go to the town warehouse—he remained at the Docks the whole day, on the 25th—but I did not see him on Monday the 27th—I gave information of this on the Wednesday morning—I had thought more about it on the Sunday, and on Monday still had some doubt there was something wrong—on the Tuesday the goods were delivered, and 1 saw one which I thought weighed 3cwt., was marked "lcwt. lqr. 271bs.," (that was afterwards found on Hamilton's premises,) and I gave information the first thing on Wednesday morning, before I went into the Docks—I am not quite certain of the number of the mat—I do not remember that I pointed that bale out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 44.) I am stationed near Perry<lb/>vale, in Middlesex. On the 17th of June, near six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty near the Grand Junction Canal, and saw the prisoner in a barge there—I was spoken to by Mr. Cogden, who charged the prisoner with steal<lb/>ing a fishing-rod and line—I told the prisoner he was charged with stealing a rod and line, and he must go with me—(he was not in the barge at that time—directly I had come up on the towing-path, he had swung himself on shore by the shaft of the barge—there was another man with the barge)—he said he would see meb—first, and immediately struck me several times with his fist, and forced me into the canal—he laid hold of me bodily, and pushed me in before him—he went in with me, and forced my head underneath the water, in the middle of the canal—the water is nearly seven feet deep there, as near as I can judge—I could not stand—I was out of my depth—I was obliged to swim ashore—he did not keep me in that state a great while—Wallis, who was standing on the opposite side of the canal, hallooed out to him, and on that he let me go, and I let him go; and as soon as I did so, he walked out of the water before I could get ashore—I was deeper in the canal than he was—he forced me further out, and forced me under—when I got ashore I again attempted to take him into custody—he was very violent, struck me several times, and likewise kicked me on the thigh—I have no doubt he intended to kick me somewhere else—assistance was procured, and he was secured—I was in my full uniform.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-place, Gloucester-square. I went to Perryvale to fish—I placed my rod and line on the bank of the canal where it shelves off from the bridge, and widens—it could offer no obstruction to the boats passing—it was on the opposite side to the towing-path—I did not see it removed by any person—I saw it in the prisoner's possession immedi<lb/>ately after, in the barge which was going along—I followed, and called out to him, and begged him to give up the rod, and treated it as a joke, saying, I was not of an age to run after him—with oaths he declared he should keep it unless I stood so much beer—I followed him I think nearly two miles-—I then obtained Keeler's assistance, and told him he had stolen my rod and line—I heard Keeler tell him he must come with him—he swore he would not be taken, and immediately attacked the police<lb/>man, and after a short struggle bore him into the middle of the canal, and endeavoured to get his head under the water—I turned round to see where I could throw my coat, and go to the policeman's assistance, and on looking back, found the policeman and the prisoner both coming out of the canal—he walked or struggled out in some manner, either by walking and swimming, but I was very much agitated from the situation he was in—he was up to his arm-pits, and the prisoner was endeavouring to get his head underneath—they got ashore nearly together—the prisoner again attacked the policeman with his fists, struck him, kicked at him, and endeavoured to kick him in * * * *—the whole time using the most threatening and horrible language—after receiving several blows, the policeman took out his staff, and struck him over the head—I assisted him, and the prisoner was secured—I saw Wallis on the opposite side of the canal.</p>

On the day in question I was coming over the bridge, and met with Mr. Cogden, who asked me to go for a policeman—I fetched Keeler, and went on the off side of the canal, while he went on the towing-path—the prisoner was in his boat, and directly Keeler came on the towing-path, he took the shaft of the boat and jumped on to the towing-path, from nearly the middle of the canal—Mr. Cogden immediately said to Keeler, "I give this man in charge"—he put himself in a fighting attitude, and struck Keeler several times right and left—Keeler said, "My friend, you had better go with me quietly"—he said, with a tremendous oath, he was not going to be taken by him—he then caught hold of him, and carried him into the canal—they both went into the canal together, as near the middle as I could judge, and I was exactly opposite them—they had a violent struggle in the water, and he put Keeler under water twice—I called out to him," I know you, your name is Dixon; you had better let him alone, for you will be very severely punished for it"—he replied, "If you know me, did you ever know any harm of me?"—I said, "I never knew any good of you"—he then left Keeler in the canal, and went out—Keeler followed him—another violent struggle ensued between them—I called to Keeler, "For God's sake, take your staff out"—I saw there was danger—the prisoner kicked him most tremendously and dreadfully; and if he had not drawn back, I do not know what might have been the consequence—I likewise called out to Mr. Cogden to aid and assist him; and I believe, if it had not been for his assisting, the prisoner would have got the staff, and the result would have been tremendous—Keeler struck him once on the head with the staff, and I believe twice on the shins, but not tremendously hard—Mr. Cogden caught hold of the staff, and tried to wrest it from the prisoner's hands; and in so doing, it flew out of Keeler's hands into the canal—Keeler immediately went into the canal id search of it, and the prisoner got into his boat again—I went to fetch further assistance—as I returned I heard a cry of "Stop him," and saw the prisoner running across the fields—I immediately jumped over a high fence, and met him—he was stopped, and taken to the station—they tried to put the hand<lb/>cuffs on him, but could not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chaser, and live in East-street, Lambeth. On the 20th of June, near two o'clock in the morning, I was in a public-house in Tothill-street, Westminster—I went there about half-past one, and found the doors open—I was in liquor when I went in—I went to get more—I found Woods there—I had never seen her before to my knowledge—she proposed to take me to her room, I agreed and went with her—she took me a short distance, down a court, I do not know the name of it, into a house, and into a back room on the ground floor—there was a bed in the room—I undressed, and put my clothes a little distance from the bed where I could see them—I had three sovereigns and seven half-sovereigns in my trowsers pocket, and about five shillings in silver and copper in my fob pocket—(1 am single, and lodge with my brother)—I got into bed, and the prisoner got into bed with her clothes on—I saw her look towards my trowsers which caused me to have suspicion—she asked me to go to sleep—I told her I did not feel in<lb/>clined for sleep—she jumped out of bed and seized my trowsers—I jumped out and seized hold of them also—she commenced striking me with her fist, and pulled me towards the passage—it is a long passage—I there saw two soldiers—they came in but did nothing—she kept beating me and pulling me along the passage, trying to get me towards the street door—I kept hold of my trowsers all the time—she got me to the front door, and there got pos<lb/>session of my trowsers, and bundled me out—I had nothing on but my shirt—I went up to the door again, and she knocked me down—I went up again and was knocked down again—they then closed the door, but I rushed at it and burst it in, and gained possession of my trowsers again in the passage—I found her in the passage with my trowsers in her hand—I cannot say whether she was doing anything with them, but I seized hold of her again in the passage—she had some instrument in her hand—I do not know whether it was a knife or what it was, and she said, "I will cut your bhands off"—in the meantime the soldier (Moore) said, "Give it him"—she then cut the fob off with some instrument she had in her hand—I retained posses<lb/>sion of the fob with the money in it, and I was pulling away at the trowsers at the same time—she also took a piece out of my ear with the instrument, and likewise made a wound in my wrist, which has not healed yet—she was beating me all the time—she then got me into the back yard and kept bea<lb/>ting me there very violently—a man in a blouse (not Moore) came, and while we were struggling a half-crown and some halfpence dropped from my fob which was in my hand—she said to the man. "Why don't you assist me?"—he picked up the money that fell down and went away, and the prisoners also—they all went away together leaving me in possession of the trowsers—I then went into the room where it occurred, and put on my things—a police<lb/>man came in and told me something—I went with him to a public-house in Orchard-street, and gave Woods in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Brentford. On the 14th of June Roach came to me—I examined the index finger of his right hand, and found a wound about one-third of an inch deep, and three parts of an inch long—the knife had entered the finger about the middle, and pasted along the surface of the bone, under the integuments—a wound of that de<lb/>scription could not be inflicted except by a pointed and cutting instrument of this description—it was cut and stabbed—there was a cut on the outside where the knife penetrated along the surface of the bone about three quarters of an inch—I considered it a severe wound, and considered him in danger, as the tendons were wounded and divided, and in all those cases there is danger of locked jaw—he was in very great pain—there was inflammation all up his arm, but that subsided—he is still unable to straighten his finger, which proves that the tendons were injured.</p>

I am an oil and colour manufacturer, and life in Millbank-street, Westminster. 1 know the prisoner—I never knew him before this transaction—he was not introduced to me at all—he said he was recommended to me by a Mr. Tranter, for me to discount a bill for him—he produced this bill to me—I have endorsed it since—with the exception of my endorsement, no alteration has taken place in the bill, except the noting of my bankers—he likewise brought me these two cards—one has D. and H.

Weston and Young's—I did not know Brown, the acceptor—the prisoner said that he was building some bouses—I did not find that so—I never knew anything of the kind—I inquired, and was told he was not—Davies told me so—I did not inquire of anybody else—the prisoner does not live in Peckham-lane—he lived at Milford Cottage, Commercial-road, at that time—I am not aware that he had live I in Peckham-lane, or that be bad been building there—I found him there—I found he was not to be seen at Milford Cottage—I went to Peckham-lane to find Brown—my solicitor went next morning to Mr. Brown—he is here now—Peckham-lane is in Deptford, I believe—I do not think it is in a line with the Commercial-road, but I am not much acquainted with that part—I do not know whether the prisoner said when he saw me, "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, is that you?"—he might have said so—I told him Davies denied the bill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He had left the bill two days in your hands with Davies's card, telling you that Davies was the drawer of the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One day, 1 cannot say what day that was—he left it one day, and was to call the next—(I affirm, I do not swear)—I will affirm that he did not leave it for two days—at the time he left it with me I was in my counting-house, in Mill bank-street—Davies lived in the Kent-road—I did not go to Davies—he begged me to inquire of Messrs. Rigby—I inquired after those that knew the drawer—I did not inquire after Davies himself, but I inquired of Messrs. Rigby, who they were doing a deal of work for—my shopman went and brought me word—I went to Messrs. Taylor, in Parliament-street, but I did not go to Rigby's myself—I do not recollect his saying when I said Davies denied the bill, "Nonsense, you must have seen Henry Davies instead of Daniel"—I cannot affirm that he did nut—he asked me if I had seen the other Davies, one Davies could not write, and the other could—he did not say he would go with me and see Daniel directly—I will affirm that—he said he would go—I had no policeman with me then—we met the policeman, after walking a little distance together to go to Davies's—he was freely going with me at that time without the control of any third person—the prisoner did not say on seeing Davies, "Why Davies, here is your bill come due, you don't mean to deny your own bill"—he never said so—he said that Davies did that bill—there were very few words transpired—Davies said, "It is not my writing, I authorised nobody to do it"—the prisoner said, "You villain, you did it in that room," and almost in an instant we were all three pushed out of the room—Davies shut the door in our faces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and live in Wild-street, Drury-lane.

Last Monday evening, the 10th of June, about a quarter past six o'clock, we were at home, and had a little quarrel—we were both the worse for liquor—I was rather worse than her—there were some flower-pots there—I was going to take them away to my brother-in-law's eldest son—she did not like that, I think—I took them up—I do not know that I should have taken them if I had not been the worse for liquor—I went out of the house and across the road with them—when I got a short distance from the house, she came behind me and broke the flowers, and I tumbled down in the road—my foot might have caught against a stone-the pots were broken—I think she came behind me and pushed me down—I fol<lb/>lowed her home, and went up stairs—I believe she got hold of a knife when she got up stairs—she struck me on the arm with the knife—there were two marks in my jacket, but only one on my arm, where the knife entered—I do not think she struck me more than once—I struck her again—I did not see the knife in her hand—I <hi rend="italic">sung out</hi> for help—a young man came up and took the knife from her—I could not get from her—she had got hold of me round my waist—some persons came and took me down stairs—the blow on my eye was done with a poker—I was very drunk—I do not exactly know what happened—I had a great deal of blood on my face—the policeman was obliged to hold me up.</p>
