               </p>
               <p>Mr. Beaumont Morice prosecuted; Mr. Purcell defended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner was tried on the first indictment.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD GIMBLETT</hi>, New Scotland Yard. In the afternoon of Tuesday, February 11, accompanied by Detective Worth, I was keeping observation on prisoner. He went into the "Railway Tavern" public-house, Hackney. I then arrested him on a charge of possessing counterfeit coin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell submitted that prisoner's conduct when arrested on another charge was not admissible.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant held that the evidence was admissible, al<lb/>though possibly not material.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. When I told prisoner the charge he be<lb/>came very violent. On the way to the station prisoner said, "Let me wipe my nose." I allowed him to put his hand in his left hand jacket pocket and get out his handkerchief for that purpose. We were at that moment crossing the tramlines in Mare Street, Hackney. About five minutes after we arrived at the station I was shown three counter<lb/>feit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010008"/>
               <p>coins wrapped up in a handkerchief (produced). They are muti<lb/>lated and appear to have been run over by the tram. Next day I went with Detective-sergeant Goodwillie to 40, Myrtle Street, Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">PERCY WORTH</hi> corroborated.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HICKS</hi>, 343 J. On February 11, at about 1.20 p.m., I saw prisoner brought into Hackney Police Station by Gimblett and Worth. Two or three minutes afterwards a person came to the station and handed me three counterfeit half-crowns wrapped up in a handkerchief (produced). I handed them to Gimblett.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN SANDERSON</hi>, J Division. On February 11 I received handkerchief and coins (produced). I handed the handkerchief to prisoner; he said nothing. Prisoner was then discharged; he came back next day at about 2 p.m. for some eye-glasses he had left behind.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">DAVID GOODWILLIE</hi>, New Scotland Yard. On February 11, about 4 p.m., I went to Hackney Police Station and saw prisoner detained for possessing three counterfeit half-crowns. I told him I was not going to charge him with that offence. He said, "If you get me out of this I will help you to arrest the maker of the coins who lives at Hoxton." I thanked prisoner and said, "I shall be glad of any assistance you can give me." Next day, in consequence of a telegram I received, I met prisoner at 3 p.m. at Charing Cross Railway Station; he then said, "A man named Kemp, residing at 40, Myrtle Street, Flat No. 9, Hoxton, is the maker of the coins, and will be making counterfeit coins at 7 o'clock to-night." I handed him a pair of spectacles, which I had omitted to give him the day before, and said to him, "Meet me to-night at 8 o'clock outside Old Street." At 7 p.m. that night, I, Gimblett, Worth, and other officers, went to 40, Myrtle Street, Hoxton, where on the top floor I found Kemp, his wife and two children. I told Kemp I was a police officer and had reason to believe that counterfeit coin was being made there. He said, "Yes, I was just going to see you." Kemp then handed me two moulds dated 1912, a tin box containing twenty counterfeit half-crowns dated 1912, apparently made from the moulds, packet of sand, box of cyanide of potassium, two pieces of copper wire, one pot, two pieces of glass (all produced). The pot looks as if metal had been melted in it. Some of the articles he produced from inside a cupboard, and some from on top of the cupboard. Kemp then made a statement to me. I conveyed Kemp and his wife to Old Street Police Station. I then went outside the Police Station, where I saw prisoner waiting for me. I told him I had arrested Kemp, that I was a police officer, and should take him into custody for being concerned with Kemp. Prisoner said, "Do not do that, the other man made them." I took him into the station. Pointing to Kemp, he said, "I did not make them; he made them." When charged with possessing the implements I had found in Kemp's flat, prisoner made no reply. I searched prisoner and found on him 30s. including two good half-crowns (produced) dated 1912, which are very bright and look as if they had been used as patterns for moulds found at Kemp's flat. Those two half-crowns were not with his other money.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010009"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner gave me information against Kemp after he was discharged from the first charge. When we went to Kemp's room it was perfectly apparent that we meant to search. I did not believe him when he said he was just going to come round to me. Kemp handed me the articles from different parts of the cupboard. I arrested Kemp partly in consequence of what the prisoner told me, and then arrested the prisoner a second time partly in consequence of what Kemp told me. When prisoner pointed to Kemp and said, "I did not make them; he made them," Kemp made no reply. Prisoner did not tell me that he had received those two bright half-crowns from Kemp in exchange for two florins and a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>, dock labourer. In February I was living at 40, Myrtle Street. On February 11 I met prisoner outside the "King's Arms" public-house, Shoreditch. I knew him by sight, but had never spoken to him before. He came across to me as I was standing outside the public-house, and said, "Is your name Kemp?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Doing any work?" I said, "No, not at present." He said, "Where do you live, I can put something in your way?" I told him Flat No. 9, at 40, Myrtle Street. Next morning I got up at 4 a.m., went on the tram to Poplar, and walked to the Victoria Dock, looking for work; I then went to the London Dock, which I reached at 1 p.m.; then to the Victoria and Albert Dock, Fresh Wharf, getting home at about 5 p.m., having got no work. In consequence of what my wife told me, I found a cardboard box wrapped up in brown paper on top of the cupboard, in which I found all these moulds, etc., produced. I threw them into the cupboard with disgust. Shortly afterwards Goodwillie and other officers came in and said they understood counter<lb/>feit coins were made in my place. I was dumbfounded. I then handed them the things which I had taken out of the parcel. This tin box, which contained the counterfeit half-crowns, is my own box—it did not come out of the parcel. My wife and I were then taken to the police station. Sullivan pointed at me and said, "He made them." That is untrue. I said nothing; my wife said, "No, you are the man that fetched the parcel to my place." Next day prisoner and I were brought before the Magistrate. We were then both put back into the cells; prisoner said to me then, "Tell your old woman it was not me that fetched it up, it was a man very much like me, then I will get out of it. If she does not I will draw somebody into the cart. Oh, these can easy be bluffed. I was at the Old Bailey once before for the very same thing and we easy bluffed them there—me and two other men, and one of them was the maker." I do not know what he meant. I am an ex-soldier in receipt of 1s. a day pension.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled, cross-examined. Nothing more was said at the interview between myself and prisoner outside the "King's Arms" public-house; I did not know prisoner's name. When I came home next day my wife told me "a man" had left the parcel; she did not mention "Sullivan." I did not know who had left the</p>

               <p>cardboard box. I threw on top of the cupboard the articles, which I did not intend to take to the police station. I did not say to Ser<lb/>geant Goodwillie that I had said to my wife, when I came in, "I will take them to the police station as soon as I get a cup of tea and tell the police that a man named Sullivan left them here." I did not mention the name of "Sullivan"; I did not know his name. On Tues<lb/>day, February 11, Mr. More, my landlord's agent, called for the rent, which was in arrears. He stood at the door and my wife and I spoke to him. I promised him one week's rent on the following Wednesday, and another week's rent later on in the week. Prisoner was not in my room when More called. At the police court prisoner, in cross-examination, suggested to me that that conversation had passed be<lb/>tween me and More. Prisoner knew that conversation because I had told him of it. I had said to him, "You have got me in a nice scrape; my little kiddies will be thrown on the street for rent." It is not true that I gave prisoner on February 11 three bad half-crowns in exchange for 5s. in good money. When prisoner said at Old Street Police Station, "He made them," I said, "No," to my wife.</p>

He said, "Are you Mrs. Kemp?" I said, "Yes." He said, "It is all right, I have seen Albert." I said, "Are you sure?" He said, "Yes." I left him in the room sitting on the chair, while I went with my children to my mother's to get some food. My husband had gone to look for work at 4 a.m. that morning. I returned from my mother's at about 2 p.m. Prisoner was putting his overcoat on; he said to me, "Tell Albert I will see him between half past seven and eight to-night." He then left. I afterwards noticed that he had left the brown paper parcel on top of the cupboard. My husband came home at about 5. As the result of what I told him he looked at the parcel and opened it. (The witness corroborated her husband.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When prisoner called at the flat he left his name "Sullivan." When my husband came home I mentioned the name of "Sullivan" to him.</p>

I said to her, 'I shall take them to the police as soon as I get a cup of tea, and tell the police that a man named Sullivan left them here.'"

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have known Kemp for about seven or eight months. I knew his name, and he knew mine. On February 11 I was at Kemp's house from 10 a.m. to about 12 noon. He was pouring metal into those moulds produced, and making counterfeit coins. He said, "Are you doing anything?" I said, "Not much." Then he went to the tin box produced and handed me three counterfeit half-crowns out of the box. He said, "There you are, you may be able to do yourself a bit of good with these." I took them and put then in a pocket where I also had two pocket-handker<lb/>chiefs. Kempt said, "Try and change these. If you do, come back and I will give you some more." I then walked past Shoreditch Church to Hackney Station, where I was arrested and taken to Hackney Police Station. Goodwillie saw me in the cell and said, "I am not going to charge you with this offence." He then shook hands with me and said, "I give you my word of honour as a gentle<lb/>man, if you can let me know who the maker is I will let you go—set you free." He had a key in his hand, and he said, "I have got the key of the cell. I will let you out." I said, "I will tell you who the maker of the coins is between now and Friday." I was then released. Next day I met Goodwillie outside Charing Cross Station. His account of that interview is correct and of my second arrest is correct. While I was at Kemp's flat on Tuesday, February 11, More called and spoke to Kemp and his wife as he has described. I knew his name was "More," because Kemp told me so. I instructed my solicitor as to that interview, and questions were put to Kemp as to that at the police court. On Wednesday, February 12, I met a friend of mine named Lipman outside Shoreditch Church. We then went to Hackney Railway Station together, and went into the "Railway Tavern" public-house. I was in his company till 2.15 p.m. I did not go near Kemp's flat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When arrested I gave my father's address. I did so because I am living with a young woman and did not wish to give my own address. When I was being taken to Hackney Police Station</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010012"/>
               <p>the three counterfeit half-crowns dropped accidentally out of my pocket. Mrs. Kemp's evidence is untrue. I was not violent when arrested. I have known Lipman for this last three or four years. On February 11, at Kemp's flat after More had gone, Kemp said to me, "I think I will give him a week's rent to-day. I cannot give him these two. Change them, will you; you have got some money with you." He then produced the two bright half-crowns (produced). I gave him two florins and a shilling for them. I did not intend to pass off the three counterfeit half-crowns. They were in good condition then, fit to be passed. I had the two pattern half-crowns on me on February 11 when I was arrested. When I was searched the officers did not find them.</p>

                  </hi>, Montpelier House, Montpelier Road, Ealing. I carry on the business of a surgical and medical nursing home in partnership with Miss Jeffs. She has been with me about eight years.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010013"/>
               <p>She introduced prisoner to me in 1910 as Sydney Green. He told us he was connected with the firm of Richards, Jay, and Co., who were interested in buying and selling stocks and shares. He said it would be a good thing to invest money in buying shares, and he would keep an eye on the market and sell them when they went up. In the early part of 1911 I invested between £400 and £500. In June, 1911, a Mr. Fredrick Seymour, of the Mining and Industrial Corporation, Chancery Lane, called upon me. I bought through him 250 shares in the Standard Oil Company, of Maikop Chervianski, Ltd. Mr. Green selected the companies in which I invested. I had not heard of the Chervianski Company until Mr. Seymour mentioned it. I paid Sey<lb/>mour for those 250 shares by a bill for £62 10s. I met that bill by paying cash to Mr. Seymour Green, who is the prisoner. I did not get a certificate for the shares. Miss Jeffs was present at all the inter<lb/>views with prisoner as far as I remember. I told prisoner of my transaction with Mr. Seymour. He said he did not know him, but would find out all about him and the shares. At that time he told me he had done several transactions through the Mining and Indus<lb/>trial Corporation for me. Shortly after that he told me he had found out that the Chervianski Company was a very good company and that Mr. Seymour was quite straightforward and had done him invaluable service. Later he told me they were so valuable that he wanted me to buy 800 more at 5s., that he had control of the remaining shares in the company, and that if I did not buy them somebody else would, but he would like to do me a good turn and advised me to take them. I told him I had no more money to buy shares. He came several times afterwards to try to persuade me. He said they were so valu<lb/>able that in two or three months I should get treble what I paid for them. He suggested I should borrow from my bank on the deeds of my house, which were in the hands of my solicitor. I approached the assistant manager of the Ealing branch of the London and County Bank, who advanced £200. I handed to prisoner to pay for the shares a cheque for £171, dated July 5, 1911. Prisoner told me it would be much better to do it like that, so that the bank should not think it was a speculation on my part. I paid him the balance of £200 in notes and cash. He sent me a receipt, when he said he had got me the shares. I put the receipt in a drawer with all these papers. I do not remmber whom it was signed by. I got a contract note for the 800 shares. That was put in the same drawer. I have not now got the contract note or receipt. I lent him £30 and £25 by cheques, which he has repaid. After I paid him the £200 he told me on the telephone that the Chervianski shares were going up by leaps and bounds, to hold on to them, there would be a boom very soon, and to wait and see. At the end of 1912 I was confined to my room for some weeks, and in consequence of something Miss Jeffs said to me I allowed her to take all my documents in connection with the business I had had with prisoner out of the drawer. Miss Jeffs took them away from the room. Prisoner took some of them away, the others were put back. I have not since seen those which prisoner took away. Before prisoner came to see me in August I had heard of his bankruptcy.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010014"/>
               <p>He had been down on three or four occasions previously, and I did not see him. On this occasion I thought it better to see him to prevent his coming down any more. He came in and said, "I sup<lb/>pose you have heard that I have been made a bankrupt." I said I had. I said that all the shares he had bought for me were absolutely worthless. I asked, "What about that £200 I gave you to buy Cher<lb/>vianski shares with?" He said, "Wait and see, Mrs. Faulder." I said, "I hear they are absolutely worthless." He said, "It is abso<lb/>lutely incorrect. Give me the shares and I will go and sell them in the market to-morrow." I said I would not agree to it, it would only mean he would rob some other woman and do the same thing he had done to me. At that time I believed I was the registered holder of 800 Chervianski shares. I said I should be satisfied if he went to the accountants, Murray and Co., and satisfied them that everything was in correct order. He said he would see them next week; he was busy now. At that interview I asked him if he knew Frederick Sey<lb/>mour. He said he did not. I did not see him again after that. It is not true that the £200 was a loan. I attended at the Bankruptcy Court, when the defendant was there. I was not represented by a solicitor. The 250 Chervianski shares which I got through Mr. Sey<lb/>mour have been sold. I think my agent got 6d. each for them. I have got nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Miss Jeffs told me she became acquainted with prisoner through an advertisement she inserted for some shares. I first saw him about the end of 1910. I do not know if Miss Jeffs was satisfied with her investment at the time she introduced me. She had nothing from it. He was anxious that Miss Jeffs should introduce him to me and to get me to invest money. I talked it over with Miss Jeffs. I had four transactions with him altogether. I did not have receipts for the money. I did not have contract notes for all of them. I had a contract note for the 250 Chervianskis from Mr. Seymour. Probably I had a contract note for each one. I had a contract note for the transaction in respect of which I paid the £200. The first step I took in this prosecution was to lay an information. I could not say whether there is anything in that information about a contract note. I cannot remember what contract notes I got and what I did not. I understood that prisoner had always gone under the name of Green in this country. Miss Jeffs and I were at the Palladium one evening. He did not send us tickets, we met him there. He gave us compli<lb/>mentary tickets on another occasion. We sometimes used them and sometimes gave them away. In every case when I paid him money I gave him a cheque, except with regard to the £29. I had more than one transaction with the Mining and Industrial Co. Only one sum of money was paid. One investment was substituted for another. I got documents of one kind or another in respect of the London Maikop and Gold Coast Rubber and Mahogany. I had the shares. The London Maikop were sold for me. The Gold Coast Rubber and Mahogany were not sold. The company was wound up, I think. About July, 1912, I read of prisoner's bankruptcy in "Stubb's Weekly Gazette." Just before that Mr. Murray communicated with me about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010015"/>
               <p>some Gold Coast Rubber and Mahogany shares which had been sold to me through prisoner, which were transferred from a client of Mr. Murray's. I understood at that time Murray was a chartered accoun<lb/>tant. He did not tell me what his occupation really was. I suspected that prisoner's transactions with me were dishonest before I got Messrs. Osborn and Osborn's letter of October 22. My doctor told me about the value of the shares at the beginning of 1912. The £15 which I received from a patient, Mrs. O'Kelly, in June is not the only pay<lb/>ment I received from her. I do not think that was the last payment. I did not keep my accounts very accurately then. I have heard that prisoner says that I paid him the £29 on June 27 and that he paid one of the £10 notes into his bank on July 3 and that that £10 note has been traced as coming from the account of Captain O'Kelly with Cox and Co., the bankers. That is a remarkable fact. It does not alter my story about the money being given to prisoner to buy shares. I had a receipt book, but we did not always use it. I must have sent a receipt to Mrs. O'Kelly. I always send my patients receipts. I cannot remember if I looked for that particular receipt. I cannot remember my conversation with the bank manager about borrowing money. I did not tell prisoner about the conversation. I told him the manager had agreed to advance the money on the deeds. I did not tell the bank manager I had purchased shares of Mr. Green. I told the manager I wanted the loan for general purposes and particu<lb/>larly to help a friend. The friend was Miss Jeffs. With regard to the £30 which I lent prisoner, he gave me a post-dated cheque, but he kept on asking me to postpone cashing it. I got a post-dated cheque for the £25 loan. He gave me a cheque on October 6, dated November 14. I had no formal receipt for either of those loans. I cannot re<lb/>member when I got the receipt for the £200. I got it within a day or two. Either Miss Jeffs or myself put it in the drawer. I cannot remember when I last saw it. As far as I remember, I handed every<lb/>thing I had relating to Mr. Green to Mr. Murray in August, 1912. I did not make a list of the documents or take a receipt. We went over the papers together. I expect I looked to see if there was a re<lb/>ceipt. Mr. Murray told me there was not one.</p>

                  </hi>. On July 24, 1911, I was manager of the Ealing branch of the London County and Westminster Bank. In July, 1911, the bank lent Mrs. Faulder £200 upon the security of the lease of her house. To the best of my memory she first came to the bank to ask for the loan on July 7. That was the date she saw me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mrs. Faulder did not tell me she was drawing a cheque against that loan, as far as I remember. No doubt the £200 was placed to her debit to meet the £171 cheque. She said the loan was wanted to extend her home and particularly to help her friend, who, I understood, was the Matron or Head Nurse.</p>

               <p>of Richards, Jay and Co. I introduced prisoner to Mrs. Faulder towards the end of the year. I was present at an interview when some Chervanski shares were discussed. Prisoner said he would find out if the shares were all right, and who Mr. Seymour was. He telephoned that he had obtained control of all the shares in that company. He said the shares were good and advised Mrs. Faulder to buy more. He said he had found out that Mr. Seymour was all right. Mrs. Faulder said she had no money to buy shares then, and prisoner told her it was easy to raise money on her house from the bank. Mrs. Faulder saw prisoner two or three times. I was present when she drew a cheque for £171 and gave it to prisoner; it was given for the purpose of buying Chervanski shares. Money and notes to make up £200 were given to him. I heard from him that the shares were very good and were going up. Mrs. Faulder was ill in the early part of 1912. I telephoned prisoner and told him Mrs. Faulder was anxious to sell the shares to pay the bank. He said he would see me and look at the papers concerning the shares. He came and I gave him the papers. He took all but a few away. The documents I saw related to the Chervanski shares; I saw a stamped receipt, and I told defendant that the papers related to everything except the Premier and New Zealand. I last saw the Chervanski shares papers the day I gave them to him. At an interview in August, 1912, between prisoner, Mrs. Faulder and myself, prisoner asked if we had heard of what was going on. Mrs. Faulder said, "Yes, and she had heard that the shares were of no value." Prisoner said, "You have been misinformed." He did not suggest that the money had been lent to him. I first heard that suggestion in a letter in October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not remember any particular things about her evidence that I discussed with Mrs. Faulder. I have no doubt that the cheque for £171 was written on July 5 nor that the £29 was paid on the same day. I remember Mrs. O'Kelly paying her account. There may have been a £10 note in that payment. I do not know when prisoner took offices at Finsbury Pavement. Mrs. Faulder told pri<lb/>soner that the shares he had sold her were worthless. There was no question of paying Mrs. Faulder back. Prisoner said he would go and sell the shares in the City.</p>

On December 15, 1910, I let to prisoner, in the name of Seymour Green, on an agreement, three rooms on the fourth floor at £65 a year. The first rent was paid in the following May by cheque. The cheque was dishonoured and the rent was after<lb/>wards paid in cash. I occasionally saw prisoner at the offices, once a week or once a fortnight. He carried on the business of the Mining and Industrial Corporation. I did not see him after about the end of June. The June quarter's rent was paid eventually by Mr. Abrahams. Prisoner had to obtain permission before he could assign or sub-let the premises. I had no knowledge of any business being transacted by him after June. There was no termination of the tenancy.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, Companies Department, Somerset House. I produce a copy of the share book of the Standard Oil Company of Maikop and Chervanski, Limited. Mrs. L. Faulder, of Montpelier House, Montpelier Road, Ealing, is the registered holder of 250 shares in the company in the return of December, 1911. I do not think she has ever held any other shares, so far as the file shows. That is the last return on the file.</p>

                  </hi>, secretary, Standard Oil Company of Maikop and Chervanski, Ltd., 40, Eastcheap. I know a man named John Green. I produce the transfer book of the company. In July, 1911, John Green was the holder of 4,300 shares in the company. He has a balance now of 283. The first transfer was on June 6, 1911. On July 12 there is a transfer of 250 shares from John Green to Mrs. L. Faulder. The consideration is £25. I have only seen prisoner once; I know him as John Green's brother. He was introduced to me by John Green. Prisoner has never held any shares in my com<lb/>pany. In 1910 the shares of the company were worth about 5s., par. In July, 1911, I do not think there was any market value for the shares. I find a transfer on October 24, 1912, of Mrs. Faulder's 250 shares at 6d. per share, and on October 9 another transfer of 500 shares at £6 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. John Green is the transferror of the 250 shares belonging to Mrs. Faulder. The date of the transfer from John Green to Mrs. Faulder is July 12, 1911. At the end of 1910 and the beginning of 1911 the price of the shares was about 5s. per share.</p>

                  </hi>, messenger, London Bankruptcy Court. I produce the file in bankruptcy of prisoner. He was adjudicated bankrupt on August 23, 1912. The petition was on June 12 and the receiving order on July 5. The liabilities were estimated at £1,366 8s. 8d. and the assets nil.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The adjudication was in the name of Sydney Green and was afterwards amended to Sydney Grunspan. Mrs. Faulder is returned as an unsecured creditor for £200.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WALTER HAMBROOK</hi>. On December 17 I saw prisoner at Priory Road, Hampstead. I had a warrant for his arrest. I said to him, "I believe your name is Sydney Grunspan or Green"; he replied "Yes." I told him I was a police officer. I said, "You are charged for that you, on or about July 5, 1911, at Ealing, being entrusted with certain property, to wit, a banker's cheque of £171 and £29 in money, of and belonging to Lillian Mary Faulder, unlaw<lb/>fully and fraudulently converted the same to your own use." When I reached the name "Faulder," he said, "It is a lie." I then finished reading the warrant, and he said, "Yes, that is right; let me 'phone to my solicitor." I told him he would be conveyed to Ealing Police Station and would be able to communicate with his solicitor when he arrived there. On walking up the road, he said, "They heard what I said at the Bankruptcy Court; why did not they question me then?" He further said, "Mrs. Faulder heard what I said at the Bankruptcy Court; I told her there that she lent me the money; why did not she question me then; she has lent me £25, £30, and £50 at a time. I have never bought any shares for her in my life. She was a very great friend of mine. I did not think she would do this, but I expect she is very upset because none of the shares which she took up through me were any good, but I cannot help that." He was charged at Ealing Police Station and made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure he said "I have never bought any shares for her in my life," and that he said "Some of the shares she took up through me were bad." I heard that Mrs. Faulder was cross-examined at the police court with regard to a £10 note being paid to prisoner. I know it was suggested that the bank note came from Cox's Bank from the account of Captain O'Kelly, and I have ascertained that that is correct.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I was born in Warsaw. I came to this country in 1902. I have used the name of Sydney Green since I came here. I have lived at 82, Priory Road, West Hampstead, four years. In 1910 I was employed at Messrs. Richards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010019"/>
               <p>Jay and Co. as a travelling commission agent. In that capacity I made the acquaintance of Miss Jeffs. I called upon her with refer<lb/>ence to a purchase of shares. I invested certain moneys for Mrs. Faulder from time to time. I was not entrusted with £200 for the purpose of investment in Chervanski shares. It was a loan about June 26 or 27, 1911. Mrs. Faulder made an appointment with me about that date and we had tea at the Criterion Restaurant. I told her I would like to start in business myself, and I asked her whether she could lend me £200. She said she could. She said, "I have got with me about £29, and if you will call at my house I shall be pleased to give you the balance." About July 5 I called on Mrs. Faulder and she gave me a cheque for £171, which I paid into my bank on the following day. I never told her that the Chervanski shares were good and valuable shares. I never pretended that I had com<lb/>plete control of the remaining shares. I never suggested that I re<lb/>quired £200 for the purpose of paying for 800 shares in the com<lb/>pany. I never pretended that I would make inquiries about one Seymour, from whom Mrs. Faulder had bought 250 shares, or that I had ascertained that Seymour was an honest and reliable person. I never gave any receipt for either the £29 or the £171. I never sold any Chervanski shares to Mrs. Faulder. I never examined any of her documents. The only document I saw was a letter from Richards, Jay and Co. The £10 note (produced) was paid into my account on July 3. I got it from Mrs. Faulder, part of the £29. I produce the agreement for my offices at Finsbury Pavement House, which I took on August 8, 1911. I did not send a receipt for £200 about July 5 from Finsbury Pavement House. I do not know Mr. Murray personally, but I know about him. I became bankrupt in July. I was in Paris at the time and came back to this country about August 16 or 17. After that I saw Mrs. Faulder and she said to me, "What about my guarantee for the £200?" I said, "Mrs. Faulder, I cannot give you a guarantee at the present moment for the £200."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not suggest that Mrs. Faulder and Miss Jeffs are telling lies intentionally. They are telling untruths. I have not got any document to support my story with regard to the £200. I advised her to buy some shares. At the time I believed every share was good. I did not tell her my address was at Chancery Lane. I adopted the name of Green because I was with Messrs. Richards, Jay and Co., so that they should not know I was starting in business. I deny that I went to business almost daily at Chancery Lane. I handed the offices over to my brother at the beginning of January. I do not know why my brother used the name of Frederick Seymour. I did not know that my brother had any Chervanski shares. I first heard that my brother had been to see Mrs. Faulder about June and that she had purchased 250 Chervanski shares. I did not tell her Frederick Seymour was my brother, because I was not asked. It is absolutely untrue that I said I would find out all about Seymour. I never said that Seymour had done her an invaluable service. I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010020"/>
               <p>till afterwards that she had borrowed money from the bank. I do not know whether she made up her mind to borrow that money on June 20, when she got the deeds of her house. I first asked her for the loan on the 26th. I did not pay her any interest nor give her any receipt. I did not discuss Chervanski shares with her at all, apart from the telephone conversation. I never said that Cher<lb/>vanski shares were going up by leaps and bounds. I never looked at any papers at Mrs. Faulder's house. I told her in August that I was a bankrupt and she said to me, "What about the guarantee you gave me of the £200?" I never mentioned anything about Cher<lb/>vanski shares. I never said, "Give me back the shares and I will sell them for you." She never asked me if I knew Mr. Seymour. I would certainly have told her he was my brother if I had been asked. I had the £200 to furnish my office and start business with.</p>

I either gave it to the prisoner or left it on a place where I always left my letters to be posted. I heard very soon that Miss MacLeod had not received my letter. The order seems to have been altered from "MacLeod" to "Max Leodon." Prisoner did not speak to me about it nor I to him. He was taken into custody three weeks afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable attached to the General Post Office. I made inquiries with regard to Exhibit 1. I saw pri<lb/>soner at 30, Ladbroke Square on February 22. I spoke to him in French. He made a statement to me in French. I wrote it down in English and read it to him in French. He said it was right and signed it. I showed him the postal order at the time. Statement read: "One day, I do not remember the month or the date, Miss Leckie gave me a letter to post. When I went out I placed it in my hip pocket and forgot all about it. A few days afterwards I found the letter, opened it, took out the letter, which I burnt, and kept the postal order, which I subsequently cashed at the Post Office, 70, Oxford Street. The clerk asked me something at the time I pre<lb/>sented it, but I could not understand her, and before presenting the order, and whilst I was in the post office, I altered the word 'Mac' to 'Max' and 'Leod' to 'Leodon.' I am exceedingly sorry for what I have done and ask to be allowed to refund the money. I was hard up at the time, otherwise I should not have done it. I spent the money in buying clothes. I am employed as a house boy at 30, Ladbroke Square by Mrs. Petley. Miss Leckie is one of the lady boarders. I have only been at this address six months and in England seven months."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I was employed at 30, Ladbroke Square. One day Miss Leckie gave me the letter and told me to post it when I would be going out in the afternoon. I put it in the pocket of my coat behind. I do not know whether I went out on that day or not, but I forgot it. I only found it 10 or 12 days afterwards, absolutely crumpled and creased. I could not make out what it might be, and perhaps for the sake of curiosity or some other motive I opened it. I found inside that money order and I wished to return it to Miss Leckie personally, but I thought I might be reproached with it, and to send it on to the addressee I would have required another envelope, and I would have had to write an address, which would not have been in Miss Leckie's writing. I sent this money on to my girl cousin in Nice, and asked her to send me on two plants and a basket of fresh-cut flowers. The day before Christmas I received the basket of flowers. I went upstairs and found Miss Petley and Miss Leckie together. I offered the flowers to them and expressed regret that I had not recived the plants. I thought by giving those plants I had reimbursed the money. I did not think any further about the matter. I did not do it with a view to stealing, neither defrauding, only with a view to returning this money so that they might not notice it, and to avoid having any reproaches made.</p>
               <p>Miss <hi rend="smallCaps">LECKIE</hi>, recalled. Prisoner told us his mother had sent the flowers. We thanked him for them.</p>

                  </hi>, cashier, Barclay's Bank, 54, Lombard Street. On March 25 about 12.30 mid-day prisoner presented the cheque (Ex<lb/>hibit 1) for payment. I looked at it carefully. I did not like the "opening." I thought I could detect signs that it had been traced. Prisoner said, "That is not my name," meaning the endorsement on the back, "I got it at the races" (I think he said "Epsom"), "in part payment of a bet." I then referred the matter to the directors and communicated with Messrs. Hitchcock, Williams and Co. on the tele<lb/>phone. Mr. Fred Williams came. We sent for two detectives and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I may have asked prisoner, "How did you come by this cheque?" He might have said he got it at Kempton. When I told prisoner to wait, as I was going to telephone our customer, he made no attempt to leave.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HUGH MACLEAN</hi>. About 1.15 p.m. on March 25, in consequences of a communication, I went to Barclay's Bank, where I saw prisoner. I told him I was a police officer and had been in<lb/>formed that he had just shortly before presented this cheque, which I showed him, and had been informed that it was forged. He said, "This cheque was given me in part payment of a bet at Epsom, I mean Kempton, races yesterday." There were some races at Kemp<lb/>ton on Monday, the 24th, but none at Epsom. "I was betting with a man named R. Smith, a bookmaker of Canning Town. I gave him £12 for a bet on Himalaya at 10 to 1; that would be £120 I had to come." He really should have had £132 to come. "He gave me this cheque and nothing else. I made a row about it, and he said he was stumped, he had had a bad race. He gave me his card, but I have lost it. Smith is a man about 5 ft. 8 in., with a dark heavy moustache, and was in the outside ring on the course. After I came</p>

               <p>back from the races I told my landlady I had got a cheque from a bookmaker and was going to cash it this morning." He made no reply when charged. On being searched, in his possession I found 8d. in money and a slip of paper upon which is written the names of three horses that were running at Kempton Park on the 24th. One of which is Himalaya, and it says "£12 to win." A horse called Himalaya was running at Kempton Park on Monday, 24th, and it did win, and the starting-price was 10 to 1.</p>

The previous Saturday he owed three weeks' rent. He told me he should see me on the Monday, but I did not see him. He came in on Monday night, I am quite sure. I saw him go up the stairs. It was after 12. He did not give me any explanation how he was going to pay the 24s. he owed. I did not ask him. He usually paid once a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner has been a lodger of mine about a year. I have got a little girl. She always called prisoner or took up his tea before she went to school.

She said he called her to the room and told her to tell me he had a cheque and would pay me when he came home. She told me she had forgotten to tell me.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been living at last witness's house for nearly a year. I have been employed as a clerk to the Auto-car Supply Company, Wetherby Mews, Earl's Court. On March 20 I went to Folkestone with the manager of that firm. I returned on the Saturday night. On Monday, Bank Holiday, I went to Kempton races. I went into the outside ring, where the great majority of bookmakers are. I had a tip to back a certain horse for all I was worth. When I got that tip I wrote down the names of three horses upon the piece of paper which Inspector Maclean read from. I put £12 in gold upon Himalaya for the two o'clock race at 10 to 1. The horse won. All I got was the cheque for £31. The bookmaker had "R. Smith, Canning Town," round his hat. I had never seen him before. I did not touch the cheque in any way after I received it. I went home that night to my lodgings, and next morning gave a message to the little girl to tell my landlady that I had got a cheque and would pay her when I came in. I went to the bank for the purpose of cashing the cheque. When the cashier looked at the cheque he said, "Is this your name?" I said "No." He said, "Where did you get this cheque?" I said I received it in part payment of a bet at Kempton. I had no idea that it was a forged cheque.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I owed 24s. on that day to my landlady. The reason I had £12 in my possession and did not pay her was that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010024"/>
               <p>had this tip and collected as much money as I could possibly get together to put on this very horse. I put the money on in confidence that I should be paid. I was on a racecourse once before. I wrote the paper on Easter Monday, the 24th, on Kempton Park racecourse. I got the tip from Epsom by letter about a fortnight before the race came off. I wrote it down because I like to know what I have backed. I was entitled to £120 and my own money back. I do not know Canning Town. I have not had the opportunity to try and find R. Smith.</p>

               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">MARIAN A. HALL</hi>. I am caretaker at 28, Campden Hill Gar<lb/>dens, W.; prisoner, with another lady, occupied a studio there. On February 25 in the afternoon I noticed a piece of green cord with a flat piece of iron being swung from prisoner's window. About 7.30 p.m. a motor-car drove up and waited outside for some time. Some wraps were taken inside and some wooden poles were strapped on to the out<lb/>side. About 10.30 the car left with some ladies; I think prisoner was one. In the early morning about four o'clock I heard the front door bang and someone went upstairs. That morning I went to pri<lb/>soner's flat at my usual time, quarter to seven; prisoner came to the door and told me her fire was already alight; that was not usual. I told her I thought I had heard someone come in during the night; she said, "She was sorry if she disturbed me, but the lady did not understand the door." That morning there were two pairs of ladies' boots to clean; that was not usual; one was not prisoner's. The boots had mud and grass on them. I remember reading a newspaper report of a fire at the Roehampton pavilion. On February 26 about 7.30 a young woman called on prisoner; she had with her a gentle<lb/>man's dressing-case similar to Exhibit 41; shortly afterwards another woman called with a similar bag. About ten o'clock prisoner asked me for a little milk "because a young lady might be staying there that evening, she was not quite sure"; she said that she herself was going to sleep at her mother's. I think the two women left about ten. Prisoner went out alone. I saw her next day at lunch time. I gave her the front-door key, which my husband had found on the top of the area steps; she said most likely the young lady had left it there for her. I am certain that nobody stayed in prisoner's flat that night. Just previously to this I had seen in the flat a small bundle of shav<lb/>ings; some cotton wool; some candles similar to Exhibit 24; the little electric torch (Exhibit 42); the bottle (Exhibit 43); and the tin oil cans (Exhibits 4 and 44). Prisoner's flat was heated and lit by gas. I have also seen there some pails similar to Exhibit 22, some wooden poles; a bag containing flints (Exhibit 11); some bottles containing a dark fluid (Exhibits 15, 16, 17, and 19); the motor-car number plates (Exhibit 21); and a basket with various tools. In the floor of pri<lb/>soner's studio there was a board loose. (Cross-examination post<lb/>poned.)</p>

                  </hi>, cowman, said he occupied a small house on the east side of Priory Lane. About 9.40 on February 26, while sitting indoors, he heard a police-whistle blown. He went out and heard a man's voice calling out, "Stop them." He then heard someone clambering over the fence which separated his garden from the Roe<lb/>hampton Club. He saw two ladies running down Priory Lane in the Richmond direction. They were going at the pace of a lady running to catch a bus; that is, at a decent trot. He went into the road to look; one of the ladies he lost sight of and the other entered a motor-bus.</p>

They turned to the right of the pavilion towards Priory Lane and disappeared in the darkness. He could not see which way they turned. He blew his whistle and he next heard a sound as of someone trying to get over the fence into Priory Lane. He heard no sound which would indicate to which sex they belonged. He met the head groundsman about 200 yards from his cottage and informed him.</p>

He visited them again at four o'clock in the morning, and he found that some 38 squares of glass had been broken in each of the houses. They had been entered by somebody, and inside he found a number of orchids which had been pulled out of their pots, and with regard to which some of the blooms had been torn off. In No. 13a he found a small bag and a number of pieces of iron (Exhibit No. 58). In one of the houses he saw a lady's handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>, inspector of the engineering department, General Post Office, stationed at Birmingham, said that in consequence of some information which he received, he went on February 8 to Shirley, about eight miles from Birmingham, and there found that five telegraph wires had been cut. On the ground underneath the place where the wires had been cut he found the cutter (Exhibit 40), and at the West London Police Court he unscrewed it from a pole, which was handed to him for the purpose. This description of cutter was not used in the Post Office service.</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST MOLE</hi>, New Scotland Yard, said that on March 12 he kept observation on No. 28, Campden Hill Gardens, where prisoner lived. About 10.55 a.m. he saw her in Campden Hill Gar<lb/>dens walking with her bicycle. She went into High Street, Notting Hill Gate. He followed her on foot and lost sight of her as she turned into Ladbroke Grove, when she was riding her bicycle. He went into Ladbroke Grove, but she had disappeared. He then went back in the direction from which he had come to Holland Park Avenue. About 40 yards from the corner, outside the sub-post office, No. 6, Ladbroke Grove, he noticed some brownish fluid trickling from the pillar-box on the pavement there. A postman named Davis cleared the box at 11.30 and took from it the bottle (Exhibit 52), enclosed in the enve<lb/>lope (Exhibit 52a). The bottle had the cork out and the contents had run over some of the letters and stained them. The bottle had been identified as identical with Exhibits 15 and 16 found in the studio.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He only lost sight of prisoner for half a second as she turned into High Street, Notting Hill Gate. She was 60 yards from Ladbroke Grove when he first saw her mounted on her bicycle. After he finally lost sight of her it would be a quarter of an hour when he noticed the liquid coming out of the pillar box.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MCBRIEN</hi>, New Scotland Yard, said that on March 4 he went with a search warrant and entered the studio, 28, Campden Hill Gardens. He found there five cutters similar to the pair produced (Exhibit No. 1), and each had a cord attached to it. He also found a green silk ribbon (Exhibit No. 2), and on it the words "No security by post or wire till justice be done to women." He also found a coloured sash in the colours of the W.S.P.U., namely, green, violet, and white.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010029"/>
               <p>It bore the inscription "Votes for Women." He also found a tin of paraffin (Exhibit No. 4), a bundle of fire-lighters, and a number of tools (identified). He also found a quantity of cords, a green one and two white ones, and attached to each they had screw-nuts, which were identical with the screw-nuts on the top of the wooden pole produced. He also found a number of bottles; Exhibits 12, 13, and 14 were speci<lb/>mens of them. He found four with a dark fluid in them. He also found a bundle of suffrage flags (Exhibit 19), a motor-car license (Exhibit 20) issued to "Miss Hocking," and the motor-car numbers (produced). He also found two bundles of iron rods and wooden rods from 6 to 7 ft. long, the iron ones being adapted to screwing into one another; also a piece of candle (Exhibit 24), a quantity of literature connected with the W.S.P.U., a letter (Exhibit No. 26) signed "E. Pankhurst," a scientific instrument for measuring articles at a height from the ground, a piece of card with some writing upon it and with some rust marks on it as if it had been rubbing against iron; a violet card, called "Workers' member's card of the W.S.P.U." He also found in a brown rush bag some pole climbers (Exhibit 38). When he had completed his search he said to prisoner, "How do you account for these articles?" She said, "They do not belong to me; they have been left here by friends." On March 12 he received a warrant to arrest prisoner. When he read it to her she said, "I think I will be able to prove that I was not at Roehampton on that particular evening." At the police station, when charged, she said, "My mother will be able to prove that I was not there." Having executed the warrant, the same evening he went to the studio and there found all the things produced in court except those found in the two bags at Roehampton and the cutter, which was brought by the witness from Birmingham. On March 12 he found beneath the floor of the studio three cutting imple<lb/>ments with string attached to one (Exhibit 1).</p>

                  </hi>, 20, Queen's Street, Camden Road, coffee stall assistant. I answered an advertisement in the "Daily Chronicle" of February 18: "Man and wife as managers of coffee dining-rooms, cash security, address 6, Coptic Street, Oxford Street." Prisoner came and told me he was looking out for a man and wife to take over a coffee shop at 157, East India Dock Road, as he did not understand the business. He wanted £15 cash security. The wages were to be 10s. a week for the first month, 15s. for the second, and £1 a week afterwards. I agreed to give £5 cash and £10 other security. I met him by appointment and went to see the premises. They were un<lb/>occupied. He looked through the letter-box and tried to get his hand through. He said, "I suppose you would not be satisfied by seeing the outside of the premises." I said, "No; I should like to see the inside." He then went over to the agent's to get the key. We then went inside. The only fittings were the seats. He said he had provided all the utensils and had taken the shop. I paid him £1 and took his receipt on February 22. On February 26 he came to my stall at King's Cross, and on the 27th we went to a small office at 22, Philpot Lane, E.C. On the table was a note saying "Will be back at 1.30." We went out and returned in half an hour. There was still no one there. I said to him, "Cannot we manage this business between ourselvs?" and he pulled out a foolscap paper and copied the agreement (Exhibit 18) from it. I signed it and paid £4. He said the money was to show that I had an interest in the business. He said he had put £10 security in the agreement, but I need not take any notice of that; that was between ourselves. I was not to be exactly a partner; I was to take over the management of the business. On February 28 or 29 he told me not to give notice to leave my job as he had not properly settled the matter. I never saw him again, and never got my money back. In consequence of something I heard I informed the police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. A week after you last came to the stall Knight told me he had answered the same advertisement that I had. There was a name on the door at 22, Philpot Lane, but I did not notice what it was. I did not see the name of "Compton."</p>

The landlord told me he was not up. I left a message for him, and he called the same day at Lower Belgrave Street, where I work. I told him I would see him later in the day. I met him outside the "Horseshoe." I said I could afford to give £10 security, but should like to see the premises before I came to any agreement. I saw the premises on the following</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010032"/>
               <p>Saturday. I was satisfied with them. I was to manage the place and live there. He said he would sent two men to do the place up. I paid him £1 on account and took his receipt. He said he had taken the premises and was going to pay the rent on March 25. I promised to pay the £9 on the following Saturday. Meantime I found out that he had been doing other people for money and did not turn up. I went to the police with last witness.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You asked what assistance I should want. I said a cook and a kitchen maid. You suggested that an agreement should be drawn up, and if I started the job the money was to be returned on a month's notice on either side. On the following Wednesday you asked if I was going on with the job and that you had been after another man. You said you had a solicitor and you waited with him for me till 3.30. I did not turn up because I had suspicions. The following Monday you wrote asking me to meet you at the "Horseshoe." I saw you on Tuesday. I did not say I was dissatisfied with the shop and did not ask for the return of my £1; I thought I would lay a trap for you instead.</p>

               <p>Divisional-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS DUGGAN</hi>, L Division. On Saturday, February 22, at about 10.30 p.m., I went to a small hairdresser's shop occupied by prisoner at 38, Collingwood Street, Southwark, and said to prisoner, "We are police officers. Is your name Frank Croucher?" He replied "Yes." I said, "I have reason to believe you have counterfeit coin in your possession." He said, "No, sir." I said, "I am going to search you." I did so. In his right-hand trou<lb/>sers pocket I found three counterfeit florins (produced). I said, "These are counterfeit." He said, "I do not think so, they are my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010033"/>
               <p>taking; I took them in the shop to-day. I bent them." In his jacket pocket I found 8s. in silver and a halfpenny; in the left-hand vest pocket I found 9s. in silver. I said to prisoner, "You will observe that these three counterfeit florins were in the trousers pocket by themselves." Prisoner replied, "You have found money in the top jacket pocket, money in the waistcoat pocket, and the three counter<lb/>feits you found in my trousers pocket, I believe. I do not want to tell any lies about them—the only thing is if they are counterfeit I am unfortunate." I said, "Can you say from whom you took them?" Prisoner replied, "I cannot; I may have taken them during the week." On the shelf we found a sixpence, 9d. in bronze, and two farthings. I then told prisoner he would be charged; he replied, "I did not know they were wrong; I have taken them." I conveyed him to the station. When charged he said, "Pardon me, it is not knowingly at all."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A large amount of counterfeit money is passed in that district. Prisoner has occupied this shop for eight years. We made a thorough search of the premises but only found these three counterfeit coins.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK TROTT</hi>, L Division. On February 24 at Kennington Road Police Station an Arab, named Benali, handed me counterfeit florin (produced). He then pointed out to me the "King's Arms" public-house by Waterloo Railway Station. I then went to 23, Roupell Street, S.E., where prisoner resides, and there found a coloured tablecloth (produced). On March 3 I saw prisoner at Tower Bridge Police Court. I said to him, "You will be charged with uttering three counterfeit florins on Monday, February 23, to an Arab who was selling shawls and tablecloths in the "King's Arms" public-house, Roupell Street." Prisoner said, "What do you advise me to do about it?" I said, "It is not for me to say." He then said, "That is quite right, I handed them to the Turk; they were handed to me by another man to give to him. I knew they were wrong; I may as well plead guilty. I have lost my shop and everything over this. Do the best you can for me for the sake of my wife and children. I had none of the stuff that was bought myself, but I admit I asked Mr. Bonsey for a piece of paper to wrap them up with inside the bar; I took them outside and gave them to the other man that was with me." I said, "Who is the other man you refer to?" Prisoner said, "I do not know his name, he lives somewhere in Cornwall Road. Do the best you can for me, I will give you no trouble." When charged prisoner made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner did not say he did not know they were wrong. I made a note of what he said immediately afterwards. Har<lb/>vey and Thompson's, in New Cut, sell all sorts of things; I do not know whether they sell tablecloths of this kind. This tablecloth, which I found at prisoner's rooms, shows signs of wear.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT WARD</hi>, L Division. On Monday, March 3, at Tower Bridge Police Court I said to prisoner, "You are suspected of uttering a counterfeit florin at the "Enterprise" public-house, Long Acre, Endell Street, on Friday, the 21st of last month, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010034"/>
               <p>you will be put up for identification." Prisoner said, "I do not know where Long Acre is." He was then put up in a row of nine other men of similar build and appearance and at once picked out by Bowen, the barman at the "Enterprise" public-house. Prisoner said, "All right, I am quite satisfied, I admit I put it down, I shall be glad when it is over. This is through mixing up with crooks." When charged he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not ask prisoner, "Is not this through mixing up with crooks?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Algerian, and sell curios, table-cloths, etc. I have bad eyes. I do not remember seeing the prisoner before. On a Monday night in a public-house I sold to a man three tablecloths, one for 2s., one for half-a-crown, and one for 3s. For the first one he gave me a florin, for the second one a florin and a six<lb/>pence, for the third one a florin and a shilling. I then sold him a scarf for 1s.; he gave me a florin and I gave him a shilling change. I showed those florins to another Algerian Arab; he threw two in the fire and gave me back one counterfeit florin. I gave the bad coin to a detec<lb/>tive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. That was a bad day for me; I did very little other business; I did not take such a large coin as a florin at any other time that day. I do not know whether prisoner was the man; I do not know whether there were two men. Besides the four florins I took from prisoner I had 7s. in small silver; I put all the money together in my pocket. Tablecloth (produced) was the one sold by me in the public-house; I also sold two other tablecloths of another colour.</p>

Prisoner said to Benali, "Wait a minute, I shall go and ask my wife if she would like some more things." Pri<lb/>soner then left the bar, returned, and bought two more lots from Benali, paying him a florin each time, which he brought out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were seven or eight people in the bar at the time. I thought the first florin was bad; I did not say so because I was not sure of it. The three articles cost 2s. each.</p>

               <p>florin. It was dull, light in colour, and greasy. I said to prisoner, "Where did you get this one, it is a bad one?" He said he got it from a barber's shop in the morning at Lambeth. I said, "What did you go in there for?" He said, "I went in to get a shave." I said, "I do not believe you have had a shave for two or three days." He had not that appearance. He said, "Oh, I will take it back to where I got it, that is the best thing." I gave him back the florin, and he paid for the drink with three pennies. On Monday, March 3, I picked prisoner out at the police station from among a number of other men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was asked about this by the police five or six days afterwards. I said before the Magistrate: "I handed the florin back to him and he handed me a good half-crown in payment for the drinks." It is possible that prisoner said he got the counterfeit florin for a shave, and I thought he said he went there for a shave.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). For the last eight years I have kept a small hairdresser's shop at No. 38, Collingwood Street, Southwark. On a Monday night I went to the "King's Arms" public-house in company with one of my customers, who is a bookmaker's clerk, but whose address I do not know. Benali came in selling tablecloths, etc. The man with me asked me to buy some things for him; he said, "You can bid better than me; come round there and bid for some of them for me." Eventually I bought four articles from the Arab, for which my companion passed me the money and I paid. None of those things were for myself. I wrapped them up in some paper and gave them to my companion. Tablecloth (produced) was bought by my wife at Harvey and Thompson's, pawnbrokers, in New Cut three years ago. I did not know those florins were counterfeit. I was in the "Enterprise" public-house, as stated by Bowen. I ordered two ales and a packet of Woodbines, for which I ten<lb/>dered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010036"/>
               <p>a florin. Bowen took it away, came back, and said, "How many more have you got like this? It is bad." I said, "I am sorry. I had taken it in my shop, a barber's shop I keep in Collingwood Street." Bowen gave me back the florin, and I paid for the drink with a half-crown. I did not know that the florin was counterfeit when I tendered it. I received that in my shop; I cannot say who from. When I got home I turned over all my money to see if I had any more bad coins; I found two other florins which I did not like the look of. I put them and the florin Bowen returned to me by themselves in my trousers pocket, where they were found by Inspector Duggan. I did not tell Sergeant Ward that I knew the coins I passed to Benali were bad; I said I did not know. I did not say anything to Detective Ward about being mixed up with crooks.</p>

                  </hi>, farrier. I know Scholfield. I first saw him about February 14 at my shop; he asked me to make a chisel, which I did. After that I had a conversation with him about a stable. He asked me if I had got a stable and I said, "Yes." He asked me how much I wanted for it for a week; I said, "5s."; he said, "That is too much, will you take 3s. a week," and I said, "Yes." He said his name was George Barker. On February 26 I saw him again in the morning with another man. He had a bay horse, which he put in a stable. In the evening I met him, and he asked me if I would let my assistant, Capon, take the horse over the bridge; Capon went away with the horse, and Scholfield followed.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Grantham. It was a big horse. I have seen Clark several times, but not with Scholfield. Clark is all right as far as I know.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stollery. Wood was not with Scholfield on this occasion. I did not know Wood at all.</p>
               <p>To Scholfield. I do not drink much. You did ask me to make a case-opener. When you brought the horse I do not remember your saying anything about its being lame. I saw it coming out of my yard on February 13 or 14. You put one horse in the stable on February 14 and the other on the 26th.</p>

                  </hi>, decorator. Clark is my brother-in-law; I have lived with him since just before Christmas. I look after the stables. I have known Wood since Christmas. He used to sleep in one of the stables every night. I have never seen him doing anything there. Bob Clark used to visit Henry Clark's yard. He is no relation of Henry Clark's. Bob Clark brought a body of beef to the yard on Feb<lb/>ruary 28 in a van. Wood was with him. Bob Clark gave me some halters and a bridle and two rugs. I put them in Henry Clark's stable. Bob Clark did not have a stable there. These articles were in the manager when the police came. I put them there. I could not say who went into the stable where the pulleys were. I saw a black horse go in there. I never saw it come out alive again. Scholfield brought it on the Monday or Tuesday before the arrest. I told prisoner Clark there was a horse in the stable. I did not see the hide until the police came. I saw a brown horse and a black horse brought to the stable. Scholfield brought two horses. I saw the brown horse put into the end stable alive on February 27 or 28. I told prisoner Clark that Scholfield had brought a horse. I did say before the magistrates, "I saw Clark next morning and told him Scholfield had fetched a horse and left it there." I did say, "I saw the carcass skinned and cut up; I saw the meat hanging up there." I did not see the meat taken out. I did not see any cutting up going on. I did say before the magistrates that Henry Clark must have been there when the cutting up was going on. The meat was put in the van and taken away. Wood helped Bob Clark to load the van. I did not say before the magistrates, "I did see Henry Clark help put meat in the cart." Henry Clark and I were in the stable together on the day of the arrest. We were going to put a drain in there.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Grantham. I have known prisoner Clark for about 30 years. He is a carman and contractor and has three sons. He attended to the clerical part of the business. Bob Clark used to visit the yard and not Henry Clark.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stollery. I could not say that Wood was there when the cutting up was going on.</p>
               <p>To Scholfield. You brought a horse into prisoner Clark's stables. I did tell him that you had left the horse there. I could not tell you when it was.</p>

               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT YEO</hi>. I went to the prisoner Clark's stables on March 6. I said to him, "Are you Mr. Clark?" and he said, "That is me." I said, "I am a police inspector; I am making some inquiries about some horses that have been recently stolen; I have received information that one or more have been brought here, one this morning. He said, "No, no horses have been brought here, I can assure, you, sir, but those that belong to me; I have six horses of my own and my sons are driving them; I have not had a strange horse in my stable for months—at least six. Come and have a look for your<lb/>self." I went inside. I said, "Whose stables are these?" He said, "They belong to me; there is nothing in there; I have been repairing the drain in that one." I went into that stable and I noticed that there was blood on the floor. It presented the appearance of a slaughter-house. I saw two hides; one was the hide of a black mare and one a bay mare. I said to Clark, "How do you account for this?" He said, "I know nothing about them; they must have been brought here." I said, "There is every appearance of slaughtering having taken place here recently." He said, "No, sir, that kind of thing don't take place here." I said, "You are the landlord and must know what goes on." He said, "I let this stable to a man named Wood; he has just gone out." I said, "Where does he live?" He said, "Well, he sleeps here in my stable." I produce various articles used for slaughtering. I found two tubs with blood in them and entrails of some animal. I also found some letters addressed to Wood care of Clark. While I was talking to Clark there was a knock at the door. I went to the door, where I saw Lacey. He was leading a light grey mare. I said, "What do you want?" He said, "Mr. Clark." Clark was present. I said, "Where did you get the mare from?" He said, "A man gave it me up the street." I said, "Who do you want?" He said, "Clark." I said, "Come inside, Clark is here." I said to Clark in Lacey's hearing, "You hear what this man says; what do you know about it?" He said, "I do not know anything at all about the mare or the man." I charged Clark with stealing and receiving Payne's mare. He said, "Me steal? Well, you have got to prove it; that is what you have got to do; I never stole any of it; you prove it." The charge was then read to him and he said, "You have got to prove it." When Clark appeared at the Thames Police Court he said, "I do not steal horses." He called me to the cell and he then said, "The man you had at Poplar Police Station last night—what about him?—the short, clean-shaven, thick<lb/>set man, Joe Scholfield." I said, "We had no evidence against the man and he was liberated." He then said, "That is the man who brought the black mare and the bay mare you are inquiring about; he ought to be where I am; my brother-in-law can identify him as the man who brought the horses." I arrested Wood on March 9. I said to him, "Charlie Wood?" he said, "Yes"; I said, "I am a police inspector and I shall take you into custody for being concerned with Henry Clark in stealing and receiving a black mare and a bay mare—two geldings, one black and one grey, and also a quantity of harness." He said, "I never stole anything; I have been sleeping at Clark's place, I know, but that don't say that I know anything about it." I said,</p>

               <p>"The bridle, rug, and other articles were found in the stable where you sleep." He said, "I know nothing about it." I said, "You will be charged with being concerned with Clark in stealing the horses and harness." He said, "I know nothing about it." He was charged at the Limehouse Police Station and he said, "I know nothing about it." He was searched and in his vest I found a number of letters, some from Mr. Taylor, of Debden, Essex, and some from Mr. Parker, Clare, Suf<lb/>folk. I arrested Scholfield on March 10. I said to him, "I am a police inspector. You will be put amongst a number of other men to see of you can be identified by a witness as the man who brought a black mare and a bay mare to Clark'syard." "He said, "Who is going to identify me?" I said, "George Fowler." He said, "George Fowler; he is sure to identify me; he knows me and has done for a long time; still, I can do him hands down; he is easy; I do not want identifying by him; he can say it is me, of course; what chance do I stand? I worked a bit for Mr. Clark, putting down the concrete in the first stable, so he is sure to say it is me; he has not paid me for doing it yet and he is trying to twist it on me." He was put up with about twelve others and was immediately picked out by Fowler.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Grantham. I do not know where Bob Clark is now. As far as I know prisoner Clark has never been in trouble before. He has carried on various occupations.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stollery. The bridle and rugs were in the stable where Wood slept.</p>
               <p>To Scholfield. We had no evidence against you on the first occasion. You said nothing when the charge was read to you. You did not say, "I have never taken anything to Mr. Clark."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN CAYBURN</hi>. On March 6 I went to prisoner Clark's stables with Yeo. I went into the stable fitted up as a slaughter-house. There were pulleys and chains affixed to a beam and a quantity of butcher's tools covered with blood. There was a quantity of blood on the floor. I also found the hides of a black mare and a brown mare. Clark was standing by and he said, "They must have been brought here." He said, "The butcher's tools belong to a man named Wood who stands with a stall in Crisp Street; he keeps his meat here and has done so for a fortnight." While I was in the slaughter-house I heard the sound of a horse approaching. I went out and found Lacey in the custody of Inspector Yeo. Yeo said to prisoner Clark, "Is this your horse?"; Clark said, "No, I know nothing about it." Lacey said in prisoner Clark's hearing, "I am from Birmingham; a man gave me the horse outside to bring here."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BRADLEY</hi>. I went to Clark's stables on March 6. I made a search and found a jemmy. I also found a coat and in the pockets I found a number of letters addressed to Wood. I also found two rugs.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Green. I was told that Wood had been sleeping in one of the stables. I said before the magistrates that it was not used as a dwelling.</p>

               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM RYAN</hi>. On March 6, in the evening, I went to take possession of prisoner Clark's yard. About seven o'clock I heard a knock at the door. On opening it I saw Scholfield. I said to him, "Who do you want to see?" He said, "I want to see the guv'nor." I said, "Do you mean Clark?" He said, "Yes, Harry Clark." I said, "He is not here just now." He said, "I left him up Whitechapel about an hour ago; he knew I was calling to see him about some little busi<lb/>ness matters." I said, "We are police officers and in possession of this yard and Mr. Clark is at present detained at Poplar Police Station. What is your name?" He said, "My name is Cooper." I said, "Where do you live?" He said, "West Street, near the 'Moor's Arms." I said, "I am not satisfied with your statement. There is no such street as 'West Street' and you must come with me to Poplar Police Station." On the way to the station he said, "I am sorry he is pinched, but I suppose it cannot be helped."</p>
               <p>To Scholfield. You did not say "I want to see Mr. Clark about a little bit of work I have done."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grantham submitted that there was no evidence to go to the Jury was against Clark. His Lordship held that he could not withdraw the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green submitted that there was no evidence to go to the Jury with regard to Wood. His Lordship held that there was no evidence with regard to this particular indictment.</p>

                  </hi>, labourer. On March 6 at 12.30 p.m. I was standing outside Clark's stables. I saw two men drive up in a trap with a led horse behind it. I identify Lacey as one of the men in the trap. He, Lacey, got out of the trap and led it into the stable. Afterwards I saw him come out of the stable with two gentlemen.</p>
               <p>To Lambert. The two gentlemen who came out of the yard with Lacey were two detectives.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT YEO</hi>. At mid-day on March 6 I went with Cayburn to Clark's stables. While in conversation with Clark I heard a knock at the door, which was opened by Fowler. I went to the door and saw Lacey leading a light bay mare. I said to him, "Who do you want?" He said, "Mr. Clark." I said, "What do you want him for?" He said, "I have brought this light bay mare; it was given to me by a man up the street to give to him." I said, "Come inside." I took him and the mare inside the yard and I said to Clark, "Do you know this man or anything about the horse?" He said, "No, I do not know anything about the man or the horse." I took Lacey to the police station and told him he would be charged with unlawful possession of the mare and detained pending inquiries. Subsequently Barker identified the mare that Lacey had been dealing with as his mare.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Lambert. Lacey did not offer to me to make a statement in the police court. He mentioned the name of Purley as the man who gave him the horse. Purley is an associate of Lacey. It is my opinion that Lacey knew Henry Clark.</p>

He said, "I am going that way and you can ride with me; I am going to take this mare." I went with him and led the mare behind the trap. We got to some stables and Purley said, "Get down and kick the gates." I did so, and somebody opened the gate. I said, "Is this Clarkson's?" He said, "No, this is Clark's,"</p>

I knew Wood; he slept in one of the stables. In one of the stables there were a lot of chains, pulleys, and hooks when Bob Clark took it. On March 1 and 3 I saw some horses brought into what is called the slaughter-house; they did not belong to prisoner Clark. On the previous Thursday I saw a body of beef there in Bob Clark's van. I never saw any meat being cut up by anybody. (His Lordship allowed Mr. Percival Clarke to treat this witness as hostile.) I did say before the magistrates that prisoner Clark must have been there when the cutting up was going on. I also said I saw Henry Clark help to put the meat on the cart. I meant Bob Clark. I could not tell you what I said before the magistrates. I saw Wood helping Bob Clark. Wood was in the slaughter-house; I do not know what he was doing. If I said I saw Henry Clark help to put meat in the cart it was true, but I do not remember saying it. I never saw any cutting up going on at all. The rugs produced were brought in a van by Bob Clark and Wood. I put them in the stables.</p>

                  </hi>. I know prisoner Clark's yard. I have seen him in the yard with Wood. I once saw some meat hanging up in one of the stables.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN CAYBURN</hi>. On March 6 I went to prisoner Clark's yard in Alton Street with Inspector Yeo. I knocked at the door, but did not get an immediate reply. I gained admission to the yard through the house and I found Yeo talking to Clark. I went into one of the stables and found it was fitted up as a slaughter-house. I found two pails full of blood and containing the parts of an animal, also a sack which contained two hides of a brown mare and a black mare. When Clark saw them, he said, "They must have been brought here." I was examining some tools when Clark said, "They belong to a man named Wood who stands with a stall in Crisp Street; he keeps his meat here and has done so for a fortnight." While I was in the yard a horse was led into it and I saw Lacey in custody of Inspector Yeo. We were accompanied by a man who had made a complaint to the police. Lacey was taken to the police station.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BRADLEY</hi>. Following the arrest of Clark I went on March 6 to his yard in Alton Street and made a search. In a manger I found two rugs, a bridle, an overcoat, a jacket and vest, and underneath the overcoat I found a jemmy. In the pockets of the over<lb/>coat I found some letters addressed to C. Wood, care of Clark, 117, Kirby Street. I also found, a pair of boots which were covered with blood, and a head-stall, which I produce.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Grantham. In using the stables for slaughtering, Clark was committing an offence against the London County Council regulations. I have heard of a man named Robert Clark from outside sources. Prisoner Clark has never been charged before.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Lambert. I could not say how Lacey gets his living. At the police court he gave the names of some witnesses to prove where he was on the day in question.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Prisoner Clark has been convicted at this court of horse stealing and receiving.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green submitted that there was no evidence to go to the Jury with regard to Wood. His Lordship ruled that the case should proceed.</p>

You may think I am, but I am not legally. I am a woman and voteless, and no attention is paid to women except to punish them.

                  </hi>, clerk, Smart and Company, tea dealers, 6, Rangoon Street, E.C. On March 12 I locked up our premises at 6.20 p.m. This is the padlock that I secured the doors with. The jemmy produced is not our property. As far as I know nothing was stolen from the warehouse. About 8.30 next morning I found that the padlock had been wrenched off and the doors forced. The police were there.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL MOODY</hi>, 268 City Police. On March 12 at 6.45 p.m. I was coming from Northumberland Alley. Turning through Rangoon Street I saw a horse and van outside No. 6. On approaching the van I heard a low whistle, which appeared to come from the direction of the van, and a sound as of a bolt dropping inside the door of No. 6. Prisoner Bacon came from the door and jumped on the front of the van, which was driven off at a gallop. I did not see Coombs then. I followed the van, which collided twice with the kerb, to the Minories. I called upon Coombs, the driver, to stop. He did so. I asked Bacon his reason for being in Rangoon Street. He made no reply. Coombs said, "I am only on hire and sent by the governor to do a job for this man," meaning Bacon. I asked Bacon to get off the van, which he did, and under his feet lay a jemmy and pad<lb/>lock. The latter has been identified as prosecutor's. With the assist<lb/>ance</p>

               <p>Prisoner Coombs handed in the following statement: "On March 12 I was instructed by my employer, Mr. Edward Back, to go on hire with prisoner Bacon till such time as he had finished a job. I picked Bacon up in Vallance Road, Bethnal Green, and drove him to Rangoon Street, where Bacon got out of the van, leaving me sitting in the van on the off side. He could not have left me two minutes before he jumped on the van and said, 'Right away.' I drove in the direction he told me. I have been doing odd jobs for Back four years. The owner of the horse and van is Edward Back, 126, Blackwell Buildings, Whitechapel."</p>

He was carrying a parcel in his right hand. I asked what he had got. He said "Only some old silver." He told me he had got it from a man half an hour previous in a public house in the Borough to sell. He was charged with unlawful possession. On the way to the station he said he should have to suffer for it. He said he knew the man but did not know his name. The description of the property was circulated, and prosecutor identified it next day.</p>

I told him I should take him into custody for breaking and entering 45, Amherst Park between 11 p.m. on the 25th, and 4.30 a.m. on the 26th of this month, meaning February. He said, "I can prove where I was Tuesday night. I did not leave the 'Bell' public house, Brick Lane, till 12 o'clock that night. I then went and paid my lodging, and that would be about</p>

                  </hi>, night watchman, 19, Brick Lane. I went to bed at about 10.30 on February 25. I could not swear that prisoner was in bed then. I saw him during the night; he was asleep.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">EVANS</hi>. At prisoner's request, Detective Stevens attended at the Brixton Prison and took down a statement at prisoner's dictation. The statement read: "On February 26, about 2.45 p.m., I was in Brick Lane when I was called by George Gold, who was released from prison about two or three weeks' previous after serving fifteen or eighteen months' imprisonment. He said, 'Will you sell some old silver for me?' I said, 'Yes, I will try.' He then said, 'Where are you going to sell it?' I said, 'Barker's, pawnbrokers, Houndsditch.' He said, 'I will lend you this overcoat,' and he handed it to me. He also gave me the muffler which was wrapped up in paper. Harry Mason, waterside labourer, was with George Gold when he offered to lend me the muffler, which I took. I did not see any more silver in their possession. This conversation took place in Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, where I left Gold and Mason. I then went to Barker's, and asked the man in charge, who wore glasses, 'Will you buy any old silver?' I gave him the parcel. He took it to another part of the shop, and then came and said, 'What is your name and address?' I said, 'John Allen, 19, Brick Lane.' He said, 'Where did you get it from?' I replied, 'A man asked me to sell it for him.' He then said, 'Where did the man get it from?' I said, 'I do not know.' He then handed back the parcel saying, 'I do not want to buy it.' I left the pawnbroker's shop with the parcel in my hand. A policeman stood just by the shop door of the pawnbroker's and stopped me and asked, 'What have you got there?' I said, 'Some old silver I was trying to sell.' He said, 'Let us have a look at it.' I gave it to him. He examined it and said, 'You must come along with me to the station.' I said, 'All right.' I went to Bishopsgate Police Station, and I was charged with unlawful possession of the old silver. On February 26, the day I had the old silver given to me, I had not any breakfast. I had no money to get any; I thought by selling the old silver I might</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010050"/>
               <p>earn a few coppers to get some food. If I had had any money to get some food I should not have done it. If I sold the silver I was to meet Gold and Mason later on in Flower and Dean Street to give them the money for the silver. Since I have been on remand, I have seen Gold in prison waiting trial at the County of London Sessions. He was charged with another man, George Green, for being suspected persons, and having a jemmy in their possession. I have heard that Mason has been charged with two other men with some offence, either at Old Street or Thames Police Court, and is now serving a term of 2 months' imprisonment. The name of one man is Tom Lewis, the other I do not know. If Gold or Mason had any other property in their possession I did not see it. I do not know what they did with it if they had any. This is an entirely voluntary statement. It has been read over to me and it is true."</p>

Dear Sirs, If you could buy £3,000 G.N.R. converted ordinary stock at 52 1/2 or thereabouts, including the necessary declared dividend of 2 3/4 per cent. now payable, I shall be very obliged, and therefore await your early reply. Mr. Wilfred H. Godfrey has kindly recommended your firm to the writer. Yours faithfully, Owen Williams." In consequence of the name of "Wilfred H.

Thanking you in anticipation, yours faithfully, Owen Williams." On February 27 we sent letter (produced) asking for payment of £22 14s., that being the amount the stock had fallen. We received no answer. On March 1 we wrote letter (pro<lb/>duced). "Dear Sir, Since writing to you on the 27th we have learned your identity, and in consequence have therefore closed the transaction which unfortunately you induced us to open.

                  </hi>, 202, St. James's-road, Bermondsey, newsagent. On March 19, at about 2 p.m., prisoner called for a 2d. packet of Nosegay, tendering in payment a shilling (produced), which was laid down on the counter before I came out of the private part of the shop to serve him. I gave him the tobacco, a sixpence, and four coppers. Prisoner stayed filling his pipe and talking about the weather Just then a police-sergeant entered the shop. Prisoner looked sharply over his shoulder, said "Good-day," and left the shop hurriedly. In conse<lb/>quence of a communication I made to him, the sergeant went out of the shop, returning shortly after with prisoner, whom he searched in my shop, and found on him two sixpences, several coppers, and three or four other packets of tobacco. Prisoner was then conveyed to the police station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not recollect the sergeant asking prisoner where he got the shilling from. I may have said so at the police court.</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HYAM</hi>, 15M, corroborated. I came up to prisoner about 100 yards from the shop, and said to him, "I have reason to believe that you passed a bad shilling in a tobacconist's shop." Prisoner replied, "Not uttering." I took him back to the shop, searched him, and found on him two sixpences and 11 1/2 d. bronze good money, and three packets of tobacco produced in his left-hand overcoat pocket. I said to prisoner, "How do you account for buy<lb/>ing tobacco when you had already three other packets in your pocket at the time?" He made no reply. I conveyed him to the police station. When charged he made no reply. As I took prisoner out of the shop, a man whom I had seen outside ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. One packet of tobacco is old and dry; the others are quite fresh. It is not true to say that when I searched his pockets for this tobacco I found a hole in his pocket and found some of the packets in the lining of his coat. There may have been a small hole, but I did not have to feel round the lining of his coat to find the tobacco. I did not ask prisoner where he got the shilling. I could not understand what the prisoner was saying in the shop; he was like a madman. He did not say to me, "I got the shilling accidentally in change at 6.30 this morning at the 'Round House' public-house." When I went out of the shop after prisoner he was walking rather sharply. I put my hand on his shoulder; he made no struggle.</p>

               <p>florin in my possession at 5.30 a.m.; that was all the money I had. I called in at the "Round House" public-house, Vauxhall, and paid 1 1/2 d. for a drink, receiving in change 1s. 6d. in silver and 4 1/2 d. in bronze. I then had a 3d. breakfast at Lockhart's Restaurant close by. I ten<lb/>dered the shilling at prosecutor's shop as he says; I did not know it was counterfeit. I did not load my pipe in the shop. I walked out of the shop at my ordinary pace. When I was about 100 yards from the shop I heard a shout; I looked round, and saw prosecutor shouting to the sergeant, who had stopped a man on the left, telling him to stop "the man on the right." The sergeant then arrested me because I had the packet of tobacco in my hand. He said to me, "I will take you into custody for uttering a counterfeit coin in a paper shop down here." I said "I was not aware that it was bad." He took me back to the shop and again accused me of passing a bad coin. I said to Clinch "I am very sorry, sir, but I know where I have got it from; I got it in change for a 2s. piece this morning at what they call the 'Round House' public-house, Vauxhall." The sergeant searched me, but in the shop he only found this packet of tobacco which I had just purchased. At the station he found three old packets of tobacco which had got hidden away in the lining of my pocket. He broke a hole in my pocket before he could find them. I did not know those packets were in my pocket. (To the Court.) When I went into the shop all the coppers I had was 1 1/2 d.—I had spent 4 1/2 d. of the florin on drink and breakfast.</p>

               <p>Mr. Robert Wilkinson prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">HORACE CHARLES PHIPPS</hi>, City. On February 26, at 7.30 p.m., I was on duty in Fore Street in company with Detective Brad<lb/>shaw, when I saw prisoner go into "The Grapes" public-house; we went into the next bar, spoke to the barmaid, and came outside again. Pri<lb/>soner came out, went along Fore Street to London Wall, where he wanted for some time, apparently looking for somebody. He then came back, went into the bar of "The Globe" public-house, and walked to Liverpool Street. I told prisoner we were police officers and asked him what he was doing loitering about the city this time of night. He said, "I get my living here." I said, "I believe you have just uttered a counterfeit half-crown at 'The Grapes' public-house." Prisoner replied, "That is so." I searched him; in his right hand waistcoat pocket I found bent counterfeit half-crown (produced). He had no other money in his possession. He was then taken to the police station. When charged with uttering a counterfeit half-crown at "The Grapes," he replied, "I did not know it was counterfeit." I also found upon him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010054"/>
               <p>key (produced); it has a disc "97" attached to it. We asked him what it was. Prisoner said it was the key of his locker at 19, Brick Lane. Bradshaw and I went that night to No. 19, Brick Lane and opened locker 97 with this key. Concealed under a piece of serge cloth we found five counterfeit half-crowns all wrapped up separately in tissue paper (produced). I showed the coins to prisoner and told him where they were found; he replied, "I do not know anything about them." When charged with possessing counterfeit coin he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You did not speak to anybody while we had you under observation. You walked very slowly away from "The Grapes" public-house. At the station I asked you your address; you immediately gave me your correct address.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS BRADSHAW</hi>, City, corroborated. On the way to the police station prisoner said, "I carried a soldier's luggage from Liver<lb/>pool Street Station to Moorgate Street Station; he gave me a drink and the half-crown; I then asked him if he would not give me my fare home, and he then gave me a penny."</p>

I gave the half-crown to the proprietor, who bent it and returned it to prisoner. I said to prisoner, "You know what you have given me here." He replied, "I have got no more money upon me except a penny. Give me the half-crown back and the penny will pay for the beer; I shall keep the coin." I spoke to Detective Phipps.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I admit the truth of the evidence for the prosecution. When I was arrested I told the police officers my address and what the key was. If a man was guilty of such a crime, do you think he would send people to a place knowing that when they got there they would find five more counterfeit coins? Some<lb/>body may have had a spite against me and put those five counterfeit coins in my locker. I met a soldier at Liverpool Street the day I was arrested; he said he wanted to get to King's Cross. I said, "You had better get to Moorgate Street." He said, "I am in no hurry to get there and we will have a walk." I took him for a walk round and took him to Moorgate Street. I earn my living as a porter. He asked how</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010055"/>
               <p>much I wanted. I said, "I will leave it to you." He took out a pocketful of money and gave me a half-crown. He said, "Will that do?" I said, "Yes, if you like to give me a penny I will ride home." He gave me a penny. I called in at "The Grapes" public-house to get a drink, tending in payment the half-crown the soldier had given me. I did not know it was bad. I then walked to Liverpool Street Station, where I earn my living, thinking to meet a couple of chaps I know. I was arrested.</p>

She said, "It is all a mistake; my first husband was dead when I married Mr. Godson." I then said to her, "If you care to tell me when and where he died I will obtain you a death certificate."

               <p>Division, Middlesex, produced the register kept by that Court under the Summary Jurisdiction Act. There is an entry on March 11, 1893, which is a receipt purporting to be given in the name of A. A. Reeder. There is an entry on August 10, 1893, which purports to be a receipt signed by Ada Reeder. The next receipt is September 27, 1893; the next, March 2, 1894. All these receipts are for sums paid under a warrant. There is another receipt on April 13, 1894, and the last re<lb/>ceipt is June 1, 1894.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. These sums were in respect of proceedings against William John Reeder for non-compliance with a maintenance order. There is no payment since June 1, 1894.</p>

                  </hi>, telegraph clerk. On August 9, 1899, I went through a form of marriage with prisoner at the Registry Office, Hackney. I identify the copy of the certificate (produced). I knew prisoner about four months before I went through the form of mar<lb/>riage with her. She told me her husband was dead before the marriage and was buried in Hermitage Cemetery, Manchester. On April 25, 1900, prisoner said to me, "I am going to make a confession to you; my husband is alive; what shall I do?" I continued living with her after that up to last March. On March 7 I went to business in the morning and when I arrived home I could not get in; I found the house empty and all my furniture gone. Prisoner has not been back home since. She has since then instituted proceedings against me for restitution of conjugal rights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I lived with her after she told me she was a mar<lb/>ried woman until March, 1912. I gave information to the police about this matter on October 17 last. I made up my mind to prose<lb/>cute her because I led such a miserable life with her. I have been living unhappily with her for eight or nine years. She did not tell me all about her former marriage before I married her. After I knew she was a married woman I still wrote affectionate letters to her. I once made a will in her favour after I knew she was married.</p>

I kept a piece of the letter with the address and the date on it. She called on me on September 6 or 7 and asked to see my brother, her husband. I told her that he was not there and I did not know where he was. Then she asked to see my mother. She asked her where her husband was. My mother said, "You bad wicked woman, you drove him away, and I will never tell you."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I married William John Reeder on October 11, 1884; he deserted me in 1889, and I obtained a separation from him and got a maintenance order against him. I then searched for him and consulted the police and some solicitors. In September, 1898, I went to see my husband's mother and she told me he was dead, but she would not tell me where he was buried. I made a note of this conversation on a brief I had a few days afterwards. It says, "Mrs. F. A. Reeder holds his death certi<lb/>ficate." Since last summer this note has been in the Safe Deposit. I searched at Somerset House for the death certificate but could not find it. I was not surprised at not finding it as I had reason to think William John Reeder went under several names. After my husband left me I took up nursing. I met Godson about May, 1899. Before I married him I told him all about my first husband. I never told God<lb/>son that my first husband was buried at Manchester. I described my<lb/>self as a widow and I honestly believed that to be true. In July, 1900, I went to Brighton and my husband came and saw me and told me his sister had called and suggested my first husband was alive. Godson would not allow me to search for him, and after that we continued to live on affectionate terms. I lived with him until March, 1912, when I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had the brief in 1899 or 1900. I did not show the note I had made to Godson. I have not dated the note since. I did not ask Mrs. Lack to say that Reeder was dead. I did not trouble to make inquiries after I was told he was dead. I did not make an application for a warrant on November 19, 1897.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I had to leave Godson twice through his cruelty to me.</p>

                  </hi>, barman, "Cock Tavern," Walham Green. On Tuesday, March 4, at about 4.30 p.m., prisoner came into the bar with another man named Mike Burke. Prisoner called for drinks. Burke said he would pay, and put down a sixpence. Prisoner said he would pay, and put down a silvered farthing (produced), which I picked up. I said, "This is no good to me." Prisoner said, "Do not talk silly," and walked outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were rather busy. Prisoner ordered three drinks. Some of the lights had just been lighted. There were water jugs on the counter. I gave the coin to another barman, who gave it to the proprietor's wife. I know prisoner as a customer. (To the Judge.) Prisoner did not drink his beer nor ask for his change.</p>

                  </hi>, barman, "Cock Tavern," corroborated. As I returned from showing the coin to the proprietor's wife prisoner left the bar. I went outside after him and found him standing behind four men, making a cigarette. I told him he was wanted outside. Prisoner said, "What for?" and came inside. Tigwell said, "That is the man that gave me the sixpence." I fetched a police-constable, and prisoner was given into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mike Burke called for three ales; three other drinks had been called for previously; I do not know who paid for them. The price of both lots of drinks together would be 6d. The beer engines were between me and prisoner; they are big things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I came from the saloon bar into the bar at which prisoner had tendered the coin; I saw the prisoner going out. He is a casual customer; he is not a welcome guest.

               <p>Cross-examined. In the public-house prisoner said he had not paid for any drinks; not that he had not called for any. He came very quietly to the station. I know prisoner quite well; he lives in the district.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I was in the bar drinking; I did not pay for any drink. Mike Burke put down the silvered far<lb/>thing. The barman said, "This is not a good sixpence at all." Burke put his hand in his pocket and put down another sixpence, and said, "Give me that back and I will give you another one for it." Then there were two sixpences on the counter. The barman went for Mrs. Pymm. When I saw Mrs. Pymm coming down to the door I left my drink on the counter and went outside. I did so because three years ago we had a row and Mrs. Pymm refused to serve me; she would turn me out if I was in the bar. I then waited outside for Mrs. Pymm to go away, so that I might drink my ale up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. At the police station I said to Burke, "You put down that sixpence, do not forget."</p>

                  </hi>. I am 14 years of age. Prisoner is my mother. Deceased was my father. We lived in three rooms at 41, Moncrieff Street, Peckham. On Thursday, February 27, about 5.30 or 6 p.m., I saw my mother writing a letter. She asked me how to spell "merchant." I had discussed with her about my going into the merchant service. This letter and envelope, addressed to the coroner, are in my mother's writing. Shortly after she had written the letter I saw the revolver now produced. She was loading it. I do not know what became of it afterwards. Next morning, just before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010060"/>
               <p>seven, I was aroused by a revolver shot. I jumped out of bed. My mother came into the room I was sleeping in and told me to go and fetch a policeman. I did not see Mr. Thorpe, but I heard him speak to my mother. After mother left my room I went on to the landing. Father was on his back on the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My father ill-treated mother continually. Three days before he had given her black-eyes. I remember father leaving mother for three years. He came back penniless and out of work. Mother took him back. He treated her well at that time. Directly he got work he started ill-treating her again. The trouble was over Mrs. Clayton. Two of my uncles threatened to smash my mother's face when they saw her. Mother told me she had bought the revolver to protect herself from them. I never heard father ask mother for money or heard her refuse to give him money. He refused to give her money, saying it was for the other woman. I have not heard mother threaten to shoot father. She was a good mother. Father was not a sober man. The room where the tragedy took place was on the same floor as my room. The shot woke me up. Certain relations have been angry with me for giving evidence in my mother's favour.</p>

                  </hi>, jeweller, 41, Moncrieff Street. I sleep on the same floor as prisoner and deceased. In the early morning of February 25 I heard them struggling. Prisoner ran downstairs, fol<lb/>lowed by her husband. I went down to my kitchen. I had to strike a light to see them. He had prisoner pinned against the door. He said there was a revolver under the table. I found it there. It was loaded. He held her on the floor. When she got up she wanted to go for the police. There was one outside, but he would not interfere as he had not seen or heard any disturbance. After that they went to their room. I kept possession of the revolver. Later the same morning prisoner asked for it. I said she could not have it without taking advice. We went to the police station and saw the inspector. I told him she had been trying to use the revolver against her hus<lb/>band and asked what I was to do. She had a licence. Prisoner said she had the revolver for her protection from two men. The inspector said it being her property I could not detain it. We went back home. The same day she pledged it while I waited outside the pawnbroker's. She then gave me the ticket, which I kept until I gave it up to the police on the 28th. On the night of February 27th I saw her for about a minute. She said she was going to have her own back. As she went upstairs she said she was going to have the slate wiped clean. They had a few angry words. Soon after 7 a.m. on the 28th I heard a re<lb/>volver shot. I was awake in bed. In about half a minute I was out on the landing. The husband was on the floor dead. The wife said she was going to do the same to herself. She was flourishing the revolver and going to put it to her head. I said she should not. She lowered her arm, and I said, "I will go now for the police." She put on her jacket and hat and went out. Before that she was fully dressed except for the coat and hat. She took the revolver with her. I never saw the husband use violence to her.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010061"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. They were always rowing. On the 25th I did not make any inquiries as to who had been using the revolver. It was under the table when I got there. He said she presented it at him. Prisoner suggested pawning the revolver. I did not know then that she had pawned it previously. I do not think she told me that she went in fear of her husband. There were times when she was in fear of him. On the 27th I warned deceased not to knock prisoner about because I did not want a scene in the house, and she was threatening what she would do before he came in. I have not been approached by anybody since I gave evidence at the police court. She used the expression about wiping the slate clean pretty well every day for the last week. I could not hear their conversation on the night of the tragedy; I could hear the sound of the voices. When I first saw deceased after I heard the shot his head was in the front room, the other portion of his body was out on the landing. He was partly dressed. I did not take particular notice how prisoner was dressed. She seemed fully dressed.</p>

I lived with another married man for a short time. When I went into the infirmary deceased returned to his wife. I do not know if he had any money then. He did not tell me that he would make her go on the streets to keep him. She told me she had been on the streets and that her husband had told her to do so. After he returned to his wife he stopped the night at my place several times. He gave me 4s. or 5s. a week, and later on, nearer the date of the tragedy, 10s. a week. I did not say to prisoner that she would not have a halfpenny of her husband's money as I was going to get it all. I did not say anything like it.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM WHISTON</hi>, P. At 7.20 a.m. on February 28 I was in charge of the Peckham Police Station when prisoner rushed in and threw a revolver on the counter. All six chambers were loaded. There were five live cartridges and one spent. She said several times, "I have shot my husband at 40, Moncrieff Street." I went to that address and saw the body of prisoner's husband lying on his back half way in the doorway of the front room and half way out. The head was in the room. Dr. Hesler arrived two or three minutes after I did and by his directions we put the body on the bed, where he made the examination. I returned to the station, where prisoner handed me 15 live cartridges and a purse containing a gun licence. She was told that she would be charged with the murder of her husband, and she then said, "Is he dead? Good God! may I die soon." When formally charged she said, "Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT PAGE</hi>. On February 28, at 8.45 a.m., I told prisoner she would be charged on her own confession with mur<lb/>dering her husband. She replied, "Is he dead? Good God! may I die soon." I took her to Lambeth Police Court in a cab. On the way she said, "She has been the ruin of myself. I loved my husband, and if I cannot have him no one else shall. I have sworn I will do her in, and I am only sorry I have not done her as well. She has brought me to this, but she cannot have him any longer." She told me the woman was Mrs. Clayton, 117, Douglas-street, Deptford. She had bruises on her eyes and nose, which she said her husband had done.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was mar<lb/>ried to deceased on October 10, 1897. We had constant rows for the first six years, and after that time, when he gave up his work, he told me to go on the streets and get money for him. He had half of what I used to get. He beat me very much. I summoned him two or three times. In 1903 he left me and went home to his mother. In 1907 he fell out of work and wanted me to go on the streets again. I refused. He said if I did not choose to do it he knew somebody who would. He did not say who or how it would affect me. He went to live with Mrs. Clayton in November, 1908. I objected to it. I asked her several times to leave my husband alone. She refused and said she had herself to study as well as I had. My husband subse<lb/>quently returned. He had no money and was out of work. I gave him money. He treated me very well for the first three weeks, but when he got his licence and had a job to go to he started illtreating me again. I gave him the money to get his licence. My life was threatened by my two brothers-in-law and my husband. I bought the revolver because I went in fear of my life. I kept it under the mat<lb/>tress</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010063"/>
               <p>of the bed. I carried it with me when I went out. On Monday, February 25, I went to bed about 10 p.m. My husband came in about 12.15 a.m., pulled the bed clothes down and struck me across the nose. He had a pair of pliers in his hand about a foot long. I thought he was going to hit me with them. I sprang out of bed and rushed down<lb/>stairs. He followed me. He caught me as I got to the back door of the scullery. He got me on the floor. The revolver fell on the floor. I do not know where it came from. He must have had it in his hand. He knew where I kept it under the bed. He knocked me down again by the door leading to the passage and took the revolver out of the case, and said, "Supposing I put a bullet through you." Then I screamed out "Murder!" Mr. Thorpe was in the kitchen the latter part of the time. My husband handed him the revolver. I have never threatened to shoot anybody. I never said to Mr. Thorpe that I meant to wipe the slate clean. I pawned the revolver and gave the ticket to him. On the night of the tragedy I slept in the back room with my son. I put the bedstead against the door because my husband had threatened to take my life on the Thursday night when he came home. At 3 a.m. I shifted the bed from the door to see if my husband had gone to bed. I got up at six and called my husband to go to his work. He got up in a very bad temper. He partly dressed. I told him I should go up for my week's money on the Friday, as I always had done. He said I should never get another 1/2 d. off of him, and that he was going to send it all to the other woman. He came to hit me and I ran out into the back bedroom. I had the revolver in my chest. When I got to the back room door I thought he was coming to punch me. He turned sharp outside the door and I put my hand up and the revolver went off. I think the reason he turned sharply was because he was frightened of the revolver. I did not take aim at him. I did not intend to kill him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never fired the revolver. The man who sold it to me explained how to use it. I found out myself how to load and unload it. I went to see Mrs. Clayton a fortnight before the tragedy. I did not have the revolver on me then; it was in pawn. I do not remember telling her that I had something that would stop my hus<lb/>band paying her his money. I do not remember what I put in the letter I wrote to the coroner. I do not know if the revolver was then loaded. I loaded it after I got it out of pawn on the 25th. I do not know why I redeemed it on the 27th. The letter says, "In case any<lb/>thing happens to my husband and me. I did not anticipate something happening to my husband as well as to me. I wrote, "My husband pays her 10s. a week. I have sworn he shall not pay it any more." That did not mean that something was going to happen to my husband. I meant I should get him the sack from his work. I meant the coroner to have the letter to explain how it was I came to die. "I am prepared for trouble as my husband has threatened to do me in to-night, so I am going to be first," does not mean first with the revolver; I did not think about the revolver. It does not mean with the revolver. I do not remember saying to the inspector, "She has been the ruin of my life. I loved my husband, and if I cannot have him no one else shall." I do</p>

                  </hi>, manager, calendar department, A. V. Mansell and Co., art colour printers and publishers. Clark was in our employ as an agent on commission to sell our advertising calendars. His commission was paid weekly. On January 29 he brought in an order, purporting to be signed by R. Joliffe, for 600 calendars, value £11 14s.; on that his commission would be £2 6s. 10d. Joliffe is described on the order as a "Family draper, Forest Gate"; relying on that de<lb/>scription we paid Clark his commission on January 31. On sending to the address given a formal acknowledgement of the order we received a letter from Mrs. Joliffe. I wrote to Clark asking him to meet me; he did not do so. Eventually he wrote saying that he took the order in good faith and would refund his commission by instalments. We should not, without inquiry, have accepted the order had we known that Joliffe was a bandsman on the s.s. "Gaekwar."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Clark. We cannot execute these orders until we get from the customer the advertising matter to be printed, so there would necessarily be some delay in executing this order. Your com<lb/>mission was 25 per cent.; 20 per cent would be paid on the week fol<lb/>lowing receipt of the order and the remainder when the customer paid.</p>

               <p>is a bandsman on board the s.s. "Gaekwar." He was in England on January 30. He does not carry on business as a family draper. The writing on the order form (Exhibit 1) is not in his handwriting nor is it signed by me. I know nothing about it. I only know one of the prisoners, that is Spence; he is a friend of my husband's. Clark called upon me in reference to a letter I had received from Charles Mansell and Co. on February 3. That was the first time I had ever heard of this order. I went to Clark's house; I did not see him, I saw his wife. Later Clark called upon me. I told him I had received a letter from Mansell's, and I showed it to him, and he said that Spence had signed the order. He asked me to hold over a letter I was going to write to Mansell's as he thought he could make matters all right. He said he and another man, Burland, had drawn the com<lb/>mission; that Spence had not had any of it. Spence was a friend of my husband's; he knew that my husband was on his way to Cape Town.</p>
               <p>To Clark. You asked me to hold the letter over till Saturday and then send it. You said you were sorry I had been troubled; that you knew Spence had signed the order, and you had drawn the com<lb/>mission, but you would pay the commission back and that would stop everything.</p>
               <p>To Burland. I did not have half the commission; I had a third, 16s.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HUBBARD</hi>, K Division. On March 3 I saw Clark at his house. I told him I held a warrant for his arrest for forging on January 29 a bill for the delivery of goods to the prejudice of A. V. Mansell and Co. He replied, "The order was taken in good faith; I did not sign it; I was dropped into it." On the way to the station he said, "How can I be convicted when the goods were not delivered." When charged at the station he said, "I should like to say that no goods were to be delivered without the refer<lb/>ences, and I stated on the form that the references would follow. The calendars were not to be delivered till next November." Next day he gave me the address of Burland and said that Burland could tell me who signed the order. I then called on Burland. I told him I was a policeman and advised him to be careful; I said that Clark was in custody for forging this order and that it might be that he (Burland) would be arrested later; that Clark had said that he (Bur<lb/>land) knew who had signed the order; that he need not tell me unless he liked, but that anything he said I should take down. He said, "It was at the 'Spotted Dog,' I met a man who works in the docks and asked him if he knew anyone who could give an order for calen<lb/>dars; his name is Spence; he said, 'Yes, I can introduce a man; I will pop round to him'; he went out and came back and said, 'I will sign the order, I have got permission'; he then signed the order in the name of Joliffe; I thought it was perfectly genuine, and I received part of the commission, under 16s., from Clark. Spence said, 'Joliffe is away, but I have got permission from his wife to sign the order.' I have known Clark and Spence since the strike of 1912, and to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010066"/>
               <p>best of my belief they are honest men." A warrant was then obtained against Spence and Burland. On March 10 I saw Spence. After being cautioned he said, "I met them (Clark and Burland) and they asked me if I could get a few orders for calendars; I gave them the addresses of some tradesmen I knew in Stratford; they then asked me if I could get some crook orders; I told them I had a pal who had gone to Africa and who would not be home just yet; they said it was the very thing; I can't remember if I signed the order or not; I have had nothing out of it." On the way to the station Spence said, "Bur<lb/>land is going away; it's rough; I thought he wanted a few shillings to help him over; I have not seen them since." Later I arrested Bur<lb/>land. He said, "How can you take me when I did not sign the order? I gave it and received the commission, but I did not sign it."</p>

                  </hi>, lessee and manager of the Playhouse, Northumber<lb/>land Avenue. On March 11 I received this letter (Exhibit 1), printed by hand: "Kindly send me £5 or I will expose you and make your life a hell, as you made mine once.... I will do you in. Send money to me or care of brother, 8, Rochester Road.... Be wise. Reggie Treloar." I consulted the police, and on March 14 wrote this letter (Exhibit 2), "Mr. R. Treloar, 30, College Street, London, S.E. Sir, I cannot remember ever having made any man's life a hell, as you express it, and I am not in the habit of giving away £5 indiscriminately to any chance person. In that letter I requested him to meet me out<lb/>side the Playhouse on the afternoon of the 15th. I received another letter (Exhibit 3) containing threats signed "R. Treloar." I did not meet him as appointed and had nothing further to do with the matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never seen either of the prisoners before these proceedings. R. Treloar has sent me begging letters before; they never contained threats.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. R. Treloar wrote under different names and in dif<lb/>ferent handwritings. I prosecuted him; he is the only man I have ever caused to be sent to prison. I regarded this threat as a serious one; I thought it might be a madman.</p>
               <p>(Wednesday, April 9.)</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BOOTHEY</hi>, D. I was consulted by Mr. Cyril Maude on March 11. In consequence of instructions I gave him the letter of March 14 was sent to 30, College Street. I went to the Playhouse at half-past five on Saturday the 15th and saw George Treloar. I said, "Did you bring this letter?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Is your name Reggie Treloar?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Do you live at 30, College Street?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I am a police officer and shall arrest you for sending threatening letters to Mr. Cyril Maude.' He said, "My name is not Reggie, my name is George Treloar; I know nothing about the letters; I believe my brother knows something about it. He sent me here." I said, "Where is your brother?" He said, "I left him in the four-ale bar at the "Northumberland" public house; you will find him there." I found Reginald Treloar in that public-house. I said, "Is your name Reggie Treloar?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I shall arrest you for being concerned in sending threatening letters to Mr. Cyril Maude." He said, "I know nothing about any letters; I thought there would some trouble about this." On the way to the station he said, "I know Mr. Turner. I got two months on account of Mr. Cyril Maude for sending some begging letters, but I have gone straight ever since. I showed my sister the letter I received and she advised me to go and see Mr. Cyril Maude and get the matter cleared up." When charged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010068"/>
               <p>Reggie said, "I do not think this is fair; someone has got some spite against me; I believe it is a man named Sinclair." George said, "I know nothing about it; I am in regular work." Upon searching him I found a small memorandum book and some note paper and envelopes. I have compared the writing in that memorandum book with Exhibit 3. Prisoners were brought before the magistrate on the 17th. Before they were brought into Court George Treloar said, "Let me have a look at the letters; I believe I shall know the writing." After being cau<lb/>tioned he said, "I want to tell you what I know about these letters if you will show them to me." I showed him the letters. He said, "The letter marked 'Personal' is in the handwriting of my brother, Re<lb/>ginald; I have no doubt about it, as I recognise the letter r's and the writing. No other person other than my married sister knows our present address and no other person than my sister knows where I am working. My brother has not done any regular work since he left the Army."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Purchase. I gave no evidence as to hand<lb/>writing at the police court on the first occasion; I do not know why. From inquiries I made Reginald did show the letter to his brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cassels. George made no attempt to get away; he was too frightened. Up to the time of his arrest he had not asked for money. I saw him at work on Saturday morning. I asked him to write his name and address, which he did.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been living with my brother at 30. College Street. Three and a half years ago I was convicted of sending begging letters to Mr. Cyril Maude, but I have not been in trouble since. On March 14 I found a letter on the floor from Mr. Cyril Maude. I opened it and was amazed when I saw "The Playhouse Theatre" on the top, and my previous conviction flashed across my mind. I showed it to my sister, who gave me advice. I met my brother at three o'clock and asked him to go to the theatre. I made a mistake in not going myself. I told him when he got to the theatre to ask for an explanation of the letter. I said, "If you are not back by six o'clock I will go to Hammersmith." I did not write Exhi<lb/>bits 1 and 3. Beyond the begging letter matter I have not troubled Mr. Cyril Maude since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not in employment at this time. I had the whole of Saturday to go and see Mr. Turner and tell him I knew nothing about the letter, but I did not go on account of my previous conviction. I thought if I went to the Playhouse I should probably be arrested. I sent my brother because I knew he had no connection with Mr. Cyril Maude. I can vary my handwriting. The letters "r" and "b" are alike in the blue paper and the memorandum book.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am in employ<lb/>ment as a waiter. I did not write Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 3 and I did not know they had been written. I went to the Playhouse on Satur<lb/>day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010069"/>
               <p>afternoon at five o'clock at my brother's request and took with me Exhibit 2.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had never passed under the name of Reggie. Boothey did not ask whether I was Reggie Treloar. Turner spoke to me first, and after I said my name was Reggie the detective told me the charge. He said, "Are you Reggie Treloar?" I said, "Yes." I was then arrested. I went to the theatre on behalf of my brother, who said, "Tell Mr. Maude we know nothing about this letter. What does it mean?" I started to make that explanation with a lie. I said I had come for Reggie after I had been searched. I did not say why I had come, because I was arrested and was flabbergasted at being arrested on such a thing. When I was searched I said, "I know nothing about the letters; I am in work." My brother asked me to go on account of his previous conviction. On the Friday night it flashed across my mind that my brother knew about the letter, but I did not broach it to him at the time. I did not believe all of a sudden that my brother knew about the letters. I believed it from the night he read the letter and I looked at his face. I did not tell him what I thought at the moment. He met me at three o'clock on Saturday and said he had asked our sister's advice, and her advice was to send me to get this matter cleared up. I thought I was acting on her advice, but I found I was not. I wish I had had nothing to do with it, but I thought I was following my sister's advice.</p>

                  </hi>, greengrocer. On February 24 at 6 p.m. I was in the "Gun" beerhouse, Brunswick Street, Hackney, with Jack Smith and the two prisoners; we were all drinking together. Some time ago I had a fight and the prisoners came to me and wanted money. They had done nothing to earn money. On the night in question we had two small glasses of beer. We had a quarrel and we were ordered out. We then went to the "Robin Hood" public-house. We all had drinks there. Subsequently I came out, leaving prisoners inside. I stood outside. Percy Carter came out and caught hold of me by the throat with his left hand and said, "Are you fit?" I could not answer and then he hit me and knocked me down. I do not know what he hit me with; it felt like a hammer. Then Henry Carter came out and kicked me; he picked up the hammer after Percy Carter dropped it and hit me twice. I lost consciousness, and when I came to a little boy took me to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known prisoners about six months. I can suggest no reason why they should hit me. On this night I might have had three or four drinks. I did not see Jack Smith pour some beer over a cat or break a glass on the floor. I did not take up a glass and break it. Percy Carter and I challenged each other to fight in the "Robin Hood." I never threatened to hit Percy with a piece of broken glass.</p>

                  </hi>, poulterer. I have known Jones for 13 years and the two prisoners about five or six months. On February 24 the four of us were together in the "Gun." Jones had a fight with Percy Carter and we were ordered out. We then went to the "Robin Hood" public-house and stayed there about 20 minutes. I heard a scream and I went out and saw Jones falling to the ground. I did not see him struck. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Nothing took place in the "Robin Hood" public-house. I did not see anybody go out. I saw no broken glass.</p>

                  </hi>, lather boy. On February 24 I was in Bruns<lb/>wick Street and saw the two prisoners and Smith and Jones quarrelling. I went away for a few minutes and when I came back I saw Jones lying on the ground and Henry Carter striking him with a coke hammer on the head. I did not see Percy Carter strike Jones. Jones's head was bleeding, and his eye and finger. I did not see any glass there. Afterwards the prisoners went indoors and I took Jones to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The fight was between Henry Carter and Jones, and as soon as it was over the two prisoners went indoors.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">FELIX LEESER</hi>, house surgeon, German Hospital, Dalston Lane. On February 24 at 8 p.m. Henry Jones was brought to me for exami<lb/>nation. He was suffering from loss of blood caused by five different scalp wounds, which must have been caused by a blunt instrument. There was also a compound fracture of the middle finger of the right hand. Several days later blood poisoning set in and an opera<lb/>tion proved necessary. On his right arm there were signs of an old injury.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM SMITH</hi>. On February 24 at 9.30 p.m. I went to the German Hospital and saw Jones. From what he told me I went to 27, Brunswick Street, Hackney, at two o'clock the next morning. I found Henry Carter lying on a couch partly dressed. I told him I was a police officer and should arrest him for being con<lb/>cerned with his brother in unlawfully and maliciously wounding Jones with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm. He made no reply. Later that morning he said to me, "How is Jones this morning?" I said, "He is very bad." He said, "I admit I hit him, but he de<lb/>serves all he got; he came for me with a broken glass."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">TANNER</hi>. On February 28 at 9.40 a.m. prisoner Percy Carter came to the police station. He said, "I understand you want me for being concerned with my brother in wounding a man named Jones last Monday." I said, "Yes," and took him to the charge-room, where he was charged and made no reply. I was pre<lb/>sent when prisoners were charged; they reserved their defence.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at my brother's premises at Hackney. On February 24 Smith came to the shop and called for my brother Percy; he asked him to go and have a drink. They went to the "Gun"; I followed later and found Jones there also. There was a dispute in that public-house. We subsequently went to the "Robin Hood." While we were there Jones challenged Percy to fight. Two glasses were broken. Smith poured some beer over the cat and threw the glass on the floor. Jones picked up the broken glass and put it in his pocket. Jones afterwards went out and my brother followed him some few minutes later. When I got outside Jones and my brother were having words. I said to my brother, "Be careful, Percy, he has a glass in his pocket." I ran across to the shop and got a little case opener and came back. Jones saw me and said, "All right, you will do," and he went to make a blow at me and I struck him. I lost control of myself and hit him three or four times. I saw the glass in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw Jones put the broken glass into his pocket and I went home to get something to defend myself with.</p>

Prisoner made no reply. They went a little further down the road and went into a public-house. After a few minutes prisoner came out and walked in my direction. When opposite me he placed his hand in his right-hand pocket and threw a glass, which struck me in the face. He then ran into the roadway; I followed in company with Police-constables Sage and Crawford and arrested him; he was not drunk.</p>

They came out and prisoner took a half pint glass from his coat pocket and smashed it into Norman's face. Prisoner then drew a second glass from his pocket and threw it, and it smashed on the railings. He ran away and I chased him. Another man named Knox threw a glass at my head. I put my hand over my eye and the glass smashed on my centre finger. Prisoner was getting away and I drew my truncheon and struck him on the right leg. He fell to the ground and was taken into custody.</p>

He was suffering from many incised small wounds on the left side of the face and forehead, and one long incised wound about two inches long running down the left side of the face. There were small particles of glass on the side of his face and in his hair. These cuts could have been caused by glass. I saw prisoner later; he had contusions on the outside of the right leg; they might have been caused by a blow or by falling down.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. When I saw the bruises I think I said to you, "How did this happen?" I did ask you if you had been drinking.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED NORMAN</hi>. At 5.15 on March 17 I was in Mare Street, Hackney, in plain clothes, in company with Police-constable Sage. I noticed prisoner Knox and Larner and two other men making a disturbance and told them to behave themselves. Knox said, "It is St. Patrick's Day to-day and we can do as we like." They went into a public-house and Sage and myself remained in the vicinity. Subsequently Larner came out and walked towards me. He threw a glass at me and then went away. Sage went after him. I saw pri<lb/>soner throw a glass at Sage when he was running after Larner. Pri<lb/>soner had been drinking, but he was not drunk.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I saw you throw a glass before you were arrested.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">PERCY SAGE</hi>. I was in Mare Street with the last witness. I saw some men, including prisoner, making a disturbance and asked them to stop. Prisoner said, "It is St. Patrick's Day and we can do as we like." They then went into a public-house and stayed there about five minutes. Larner then came out and threw a glass at Norman. I ran after him and prisoner threw at glass at my head. I was cut on the centre finger of the right hand.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You were in the roadway. I saw the glass coming and I put my hand up.</p>

               <p>a disturbance and knocked at prisoner's bed-room door. Mrs. Mayall said, "Help, come in." I saw her lying across the bed and prisoner leaning over her. I got hold of him by the shoulders and pulled him away and got between them and prevented his getting at her. The daughter came in. Prisoner went to his kitchen and said, "If I cannot hit you with my fists I have something here, I will have your lights." I said to the mother and daughter, "Go and lock yourselves in my bedroom." I went to my bedroom to put my trousers on. While there I heard prisoner say, "I will settle your hash." I went to the kitchen and saw prisoner; he snatched something off the dresser; he raised his right arm and I knocked his hand. Then I felt the slash. I got hold of him by the wrists and he bit me through the arm. I threw him away and he fell in the corner. I said, "Ma, strike a light, he has cut my throat." A policeman took me to the hospital and I was there five days. If I had not knocked his arm up I should not have been here.</p>

                  </hi>, daughter of prisoner. On this morning I heard a disturbance and went to the bedroom where my parents sleep. Father had mother across the bed. He was not beating her. I asked him to let her come down to the kitchen; he told me to mind my own business. Father said to Gardner, "If I cannot hit you with my fists I will put your lights out in some other way." My father went into the kitchen. I heard Gardner call out, "Ma, fetch a light, he has cut my throat." I went into the kitchen and saw a quantity of blood, but there was no confusion. I cannot say whether the razor (produced) is my father's, but I have seen it used in the house.</p>

I told him I had been informed that he had cut the throat of Gardner and that I should take him into custody.

               <p>Mr. Grain and Mr. Beresford prosecuted; Mr. Bryan defended.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">ETHEL KEIGHTLEY</hi>, actress. I am known as Ethel Dane. I received a letter on February 25, addressed to me at the Strand Theatre, which was sent on to my home at 2, Cork Street. I do not know anyone of the name of John Anderson. Next day I received a further letter telling me to send £750 to John Anderson. I communicated with the police because it frightened me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have never seen prisoner before. I do not know Ada Millman.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">BOWDEN</hi>. On February 28 I went with another officer to 42, Marsden Street, Kentish Town, where I saw prisoner. I told him that I should arrest him and that he would be charged with demanding £750 from Mrs. Ethel Keightley. He said, "I do not know anything about it; I am out of work and I cannot afford to write letters as I have not any money to pay for stamps." I said he would be further charged with regard to the Millman letter, which I showed him. He said, "To prove to you that I did not write that letter I will write that name and address in your presence." He wrote on the envelope (produced) in my presence. I compared the writing on that envelope with the letter I had shown to him previously. (Mr. Bryan objected to the witness giving evidence as to the comparison of the handwriting; Mr. Justice Lush held that the evidence was in<lb/>admissible.) I took the prisoner to Bow Street Police Station, and he there asked me for a telegraph form and he wrote something on it. I know the district of Somers Town and Camden Town. They are both in the North-West postal district. I have examined the envelopes (produced) and both of them bear the North-West stamp-mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am aware that two detectives visited prisoner an hour before my arrival. He asserted that he knew nothing about the letter. There were no spelling mistakes in the telegram prisoner wrote at Bow Street, but the letter to Miss Millman contained many mistakes in spelling.</p>

I have known him as John Ander<lb/>son and I am not acquainted with any other person of that name. I recollect seeing him on February 27 in Camden Town about 9 p.m. After I returned home my father handed me the letter (produced). I do not know prisoner's handwriting. I had not given any authority to John Anderson to refer to me at all about the receipt of money.</p>

                  </hi>, hall-keeper, Strand Theatre, said that he received the two letters addressed to Miss Dane and forwarded them to her private address.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bryan submitted that there was no case to go to the jury. There was no direct evidence of the sending of the letters; the only evidence as to handwriting was that of a police officer. In R. v. Harvey (11 Cox) a police officer was held to be not qualified as an expert.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grain cited R. v. Smith (3 Cr. App. R., 87) where the Appeal Court Judges took the responsibility upon themselves of looking at the documents and forming their own judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lush held that under the terms of Denman's Act he was entitled, without the assistance of any expert witness, to look at a document, and, being satisfied that the document was genuine, he could compare it with the handwriting of the document in dispute. Here, however, there were marked differences in the handwriting of the documents, and, as there was no other evidence against the prisoner, it would not be right for the jury to convict upon such evidence.</p>

                  </hi>, manager, costume and blouse department, Liberty and Co., Limited, Regent-street. Prisoner was in our employ from 1910 to March, 1912. She had the control of the blouse suit department. Blouse suits are made from models in stock sizes in our workrooms. Early in 1910 the question of an outside workroom was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010078"/>
               <p>considered. Prisoner recommended Miss Dingley, who submitted a sample dress and prices, and I eventually employed her. Prisoner exercised her discretion as to sending out work. She also passed it when completed as being correct and well executed. At that time there was in our employment a Miss Hawkin, head saleswoman in the cloak department. Prisoner left in March, 1912. Miss Chessher suc<lb/>ceeded Miss Hawkin, and Miss Cuthbert took Miss Chessher's place. I had no idea that prisoner or Miss Hawkin were interested in Dingley and Co.'s business. Some time after prisoner had left, and while Miss Chessher had control of the department, the latter spoke to me about Dingley and Co.'s work. I asked some questions and the matter dropped. In December Miss Cuthbert made a communication to me, which I placed before the directors. The signature to the affidavit is in prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Any matters agreed to by prisoner had to receive my final approval. She had no power to agree prices. Shortly after she left Liberty's she set up in business as Jean Dunsmore. Miss Too<lb/>good left Liberty's on March 7, Miss Beaumont on June 15, and Miss Hawkin on September 30, 1912. The work supplied by Dingley's was satisfactory.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Liberty's employment for three years. I succeeded prisoner when she left. I had no idea that she or Miss Hawkin were concerned in the Dingley business. One Saturday afternoon I went with Miss Hawkin to prisoner's premises in Conduit Street. Miss Toogood and Miss Beaumont were there. They were talking together. I heard prisoner say, "Shall we tell Chess?" Prisoner then said to me, "I do not think you know that Miss Ding<lb/>ley's workroom belongs to Miss Hawkin and I. We financed her and found the appliances, and we three have been sharing profits until just recently, when Miss Dingley has stopped her payments and we are going to sue her." She knew I was engaged to a Mr. Wallace. She said she thought of starting a new wholesale business and wondered if Mr. Wallace would like to travel with her model; if so, he could take a salary and a partnership, I also a partnership, Mrs. Walz a partnership, and one other person, either Miss Beaumont or Miss Toogood. On the following Monday Mr. Wallace and I went there. After the plans had been placed before him, as they had been placed before me, he said that considerable capital would be required. Prisoner said that was not so, as she had an idea which would provide the capital, which was to open as outdoor workroom and run it on the same lines as Miss Dingley's, the profits of which would find the necessary capital or the greater part of it. She asked if I would be willing to introduce an outdoor worker to Mr. Lines and said, "If so, you shall have a share in the profits." I said, "Do you know a worker," and I believe Miss Beaumont said she thought she knew of somebody who would do. I said, as I should be doing a good deal of work in the business, I did not see that I should put a larger capital than the others. Prisoner said, "Decidedly not," as my work would be to see that the work went to the outdoor worker. She suggested that a dress as a sample should be found for the outdoor</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010079"/>
               <p>worker to take into Mr. Lines. As I was to introduce the outworker, I naturally asked her name. Several names were suggested. I was told I had not better not know her real name. Mr. Lines asked me if she was working for anybody else. I said no. I had difficulty in answering Mr. Lines's questions, and determined to adopt a certain course. I was introduced to a Mrs. Page. She said to me, "You are the young lady who is going to give me the outdoor work." I said to her, "Before we go any further, I should like to tell you that I have quite made up my mind to have nothing to do with it, as I felt I could not deceive Mr. Lines." Miss Beaumont said, "You have introduced the woman, she may as well go in." I said she should not go in on my introduction. I spoke to Miss Cuthbert, who was to succeed me. We told Mr. Lines about the whole thing. Once when prisoner was pre<lb/>sent I said I wanted Miss Hawkin's berth in the cloak department, as she was leaving, in which case I should not have the distribution of the work to any outdoor workers. Miss Hawkin said, "Well, Miss Cuthbert will be just the girl who will manage it all for us."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I could have honestly recommended anyone that prisoner suggested as an outdoor worker provided that I saw the sample garment. The object of introducing Mrs. Page was so that Liberty's should not know that prisoner was carrying on a rival business. I was willing to assist that. It was also to assist Mr. Wallace to get a berth. I had no occasion to complain of Dingley's goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I entered Libertys' service in Feb<lb/>ruary, 1912. I was promoted to the position of head saleswoman in the blouse department on October 1. Miss Chessher made a com<lb/>munication to me. I went with her to prisoner's premises that night for the first time. She and Miss Hawkin congratulated me upon my appointment. I was introduced to Collins. I recognised him as someone for whom Mr. Lines had bought goods. They said that if they sent in their models by Mr. Collins I should be able to make some money. I said, "Do you mean in the way of commission?" Prisoner said, "Yes, so much on what dresses you buy." I said I did not think that would be a right thing to do, but that I did not mind doing them a friendly turn. I was not to know who made Collins's models. She said, "Oh! we could make that all right later." On another occasion she said that I would be very surprised to hear that the Dingley workrooms belonged to her and Miss Hawkin, that they had helped Miss Dingley in the way of money and given her a part<lb/>nership; and that Miss Dingley had now got the workrooms into her own hands and had not paid out their shares; and that therefore she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010080"/>
               <p>had quarrelled with Miss Dingley and intended suing her for this money, and was going to smash her up and get her out of the work<lb/>rooms. She then went on to place a plan before me. They would introduce a woman to me and I should introduce her to Mr. Lines, that she should come in with a sample of work which they would supply, and if I would speak well of this woman and secure the work for them I could have a partnership and share in the profits. I said that as there was some idea of my going to America to take up singing, it was hardly worth my while to enter into business negotiations of that de<lb/>scription. She said that would not matter at all; if I could get this work for them they would be able to send my share by cheque—£8 a month. She asked me what I thought of the Dingley work, the work<lb/>manship, etc. I said, "Well, I could find fault." She said, "Why don't you, then?" I said I was new to it and did not feel that it was be<lb/>coming of me to begin to grumble, but if the workmanship was not up to standard I should consider it my duty to speak out about it. When these plans were put before me she said, "Now you feel that you could start grumbling at the work of Miss Dingley's, and that would be a way of getting this plan worked out." She said they had put the plan before Miss Chessher, but that she had not the nerve, or was too funky to carry it out. I spoke to my father subsequently about it, and wrote to the defendant. Miss Chessher and I made a statement to Mr. Lines in December upon his questioning us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not considering the proposition until De<lb/>cember 10. I had made up my mind before that. I had not told pri<lb/>soner. The model would come before me as head of the department and also before Mr. Lines. When the goods were delivered I would see whether they were in accordance with the sample model. I had noticed that Dingley's workmanship was not particularly good. I told the prisoner that I thought it might be better. I did not understand that prisoner's object was to get her sample models into competition with Dingley's. I sympathised with prisoner when I heard how Miss Dingley had served them. I do not remember if prisoner told me that she could sell at a lower price than Miss Dingley. Mr. Lines had to approve the models and the price.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath.) I am the wife of Frederick Walz, tailor, 16, Donaldson Road, Kilburn. I carry on busi<lb/>ness as Jean Dunsmore at 38, Conduit Street. For five years I was head saleswoman in the costume department at Liberty's. I left their employ in March, 1912. Miss Toogood, Miss Hawkin, and Miss Davis joined me in the business of Jean Dunsmore. While I was with Liberty's I observed that a large number of orders for blouses were given to outside workers when the pressure of orders was so great that Liberty's could not cope with them in their own workrooms. Miss Hawkin and I determined to start business as an outside worker. We found capital</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010081"/>
               <p>and took into our employ Miss Dingley, in whose name we carried on the business. Dingley and Co. supplied to Liberty's in the first six months goods to the value of £300, and in the second year £600 worth. No complaint was made of the goods. About eight months after we started we took Miss Dingley into partnership with one-third of the profits. Miss Hawkin and I attended to the business of Dingley and Co. in the evening after our business hours at Liberty's. About August or September last Miss Dingley removed the property of the partnership from 14a, Upper Montague Street to 246, Edgware Road. We took proceedings against her in the Chancery Division. She settled that action by paying us a substantial sum of money. In Sep<lb/>tember, 1912, Miss Hawkin, Miss Toogood and I took a workroom in Carnaby Street. We proposed to carry on a wholesale and a work<lb/>room business for frocks, when Miss Chessher called on September 28. There were present then Miss Hawkin. Miss Toogood, Miss Beaumont, Miss Chessher and myself. I remember saying, "Shall we tell Chess?" I told Miss Chessher how Miss Dingley had served us and that we were going to sue her. She told us that Mr. Lines had car<lb/>petted Miss Dingley for her work being bad and putting her prices up. We knew Miss Chessher was engaged to Mr. Wallace. She asked me to speak to some of my friends and try to get him a berth. We told her we should want someone to travel with our models and asked her if Mr. Wallace would care to take a partnership in the business. She said she would talk it over with him and let us know. We never pro<lb/>mised her a partnership or commission. On the following Monday another interview took place. Miss Chessher, Mr. Wallace, Miss Haw<lb/>kin, Mr. Spokes. Miss Toogood, Miss Beaumont, my husband and my<lb/>self were present. We discussed what had taken place on the previous Saturday. When Miss Chessher came in she said, "Well, girls, we are going to start the business," and was most enthusiastic about it. So was Mr. Wallace. As to the capital, I said it would not require very much, as we had all the machinery and fittings. We discussed how we should get our goods into Liberty's, and it was arranged that Mr. Wal<lb/>lace was to take our models in there, or into any other firm. Then my partner said she knew a woman who could act as superintendent of the workroom, and we could send her with Dunsmore's model as a sample to Liberty's. We gave her the name of Mrs. Page. I did not know her real name. No offer of any sort was made to Miss Chessher, except what was suggested in regard to Mr. Wallace. The suggestion about her speaking to Mr. Lines about Mrs. Page came from her. On October 1, about 7 p.m., Miss Chessher came to Conduit Street. She said, "Well, girls, we are not going to do the business." We asked why. She said she had spoken to Mr. Lines about Mrs. Page, and told him that she had made dresses for her sister, and that he had said, "Tell Mrs. Page to bring the model in." Then she told us that she felt that Mr. Lines would get to know that Mr. Wallace was indirectly in partnership with us. On October 16 Miss Hawkin introduced Miss Cuthbert to me. She was about to succeed to Miss Chessher's post at Liberty's. I did not promise any commission, reward, or partnership if she introduced our models to Liberty's. I did not talk about £8 a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010082"/>
               <p>week profits. We have not made any substantial profit. She said she was inexperienced in the position and would be very glad if we could help her in any way, so we told her about the wholesale busi<lb/>ness and the outdoor workroom. She said, "It will be a great help to me, knowing you were my predecessor, to have your model sent in, because it will be the right thing, as you have made a success of the department." I said we would compete against Miss Dingley and send our models in at a lower price. That is all that was said. We were anxious to oust Miss Dingley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had to get Mr. Lines's permission before decid<lb/>ing what work should go to the outside worker, and then it was only work that we could not do in Liberty's premises. I had to examine the work after it was delivered. It was mostly satisfactory. Liberty's always had very good value. I never passed any work that was not properly done. I do not remember having criticised goods that Miss Dingley brought in so that people could hear me. Miss Dingley sent on a cheque for the profits and my husband made the division. We had no banking account. After I left Liberty's Miss Dingley would not give us our share of the profits. It made no difference to the busi<lb/>ness that I did not send the work out or check it when it came back. I brought an action and was paid a substantial sum. Miss Hawkin and I divided it. Miss Chessher could have helped us if she had chosen to do so. I do not think she would have found fault with the Dingley work without she was dissatisfied with it. She seems to have entirely misunderstood the situation. I do not remember telling her that the Dingley business was mine and Miss Hawkin's or asking if she would be willing to introduce a worker to Mr. Lines and recommend her. We never offered her a share in the profits. We should expect her to do it for nothing as we were on such friendly terms. It is true that the name of Mrs. Page was settled upon. She did not say that in conse<lb/>quence of the lies she would have to tell Mr. Lines she could not go on with it. I do not remember saying to Miss Cuthbert that Miss Chessher had not the nerve for the business. Miss Hawkin told me that Miss Cuthbert had asked on several occasions to be brought round and introduced to me. I did not know she was coming. I spoke to Miss Cuthbert about Mr. Wallace bringing a model to show Mr. Lines. I did not say it would be a good thing to complain of Miss Dingley's work.</p>

                  </hi>, St. Anne's Road, Caversham. I met pri<lb/>soner at Liberty's and became friendly with her. I joined her in the Dingley business. I and other employés of Liberty's were in the habit of visiting Jean Dunsmore's premises in Conduit Street. On September 28 we were discussing the way in which we had been treated by Miss Dingley when Miss Chessher arrived. Someone said, "Shall we tell Chess?" She was told the trouble. Prisoner's private busi<lb/>ness was then growing and it was proposed to open an outdoor work<lb/>room. Miss Chessher's fiancé, Wallace, was rather a good business man and as he was out of a berth it was suggested that perhaps he might be useful in travelling with models that were made for the wholesale trade. A partnership was offered to him but not to Miss</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010083"/>
               <p>Chessher. There was no necessity to offer anything to her. On the following Monday we were all there together. Miss Chsesher said they would not take the business on. The question of capital was discussed and Wallace, as far as I remember, was not in a position to lose his little bit of money. Prisoner explained that a great deal of capital would not be required, as she had all the materials. Miss Chessher had approached Mr. Lines about some of the work of this work-room. Then she said, I think, "Well, girls, I have not got the pluck." I suppose she meant she had not the pluck to keep on with it. Mrs. Page was mentioned as a possible manageress for this outdoor work-room, which was to be run in her name. Mr. Lines asked Miss Chess<lb/>her what she knew of Mrs. Page's work, and I believe Miss Chessher said she had made some dresses for her sister and could vouch for her work. I was not present at any of the interviews referred to by Miss Cuthbert.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was a partner in the Dingley business. Miss Dingley was not a practical worker. She was introduced to Mr. Lines as an experienced worker. Miss Chessher was told that the Dingley business was ours. I think she thought it rather a pity that it should be lost to us. I do not remember the proposition being made to her that she should introduce a worker to Mr. Lines. She was not pro<lb/>mised a share of the profits. I do not remember her saying that having to face Mr. Lines and the questions he asked, and finding that she would have to tell so many lies, she could not go on with it. I did not say that if Miss Cuthbert got Miss Chessher's place she would be just the woman we wanted. Miss Cuthbert was a great friend of ours and we were naturally anxious that she should get a better position. I introduced Miss Cuthbert to prisoner from a purely friendly motive.</p>

                  </hi>, 38, Conduit Street, W. I am in part<lb/>nership with prisoner, whom I had known for five years at Liberty's. Miss Davis and Miss Hawkin were also partners. The former left the partnership by mutual arrangement. On September 2, 1912, Miss Beaumont joined us as an employé, having just left Liberty's. I recol<lb/>lect Miss Chessher calling on September 28. We discussed the ques<lb/>tion of getting Dunsmore's work into Liberty's and other places. I heard no mention of an offer of a partnership to Miss Chessher. It was suggested that we might give Wallace a berth as traveller. Nothing definite was settled. Miss Chessher was not asked to do anything. I was present on the following Monday. Miss Chessher then said, "We are going to do the business." That referred to Wallace acting as tra<lb/>veller to take our models round. He was willing to do so. He said some capital would be required. We told him a great deal would not be necessary as we already had our workrooms running. They both approved the project. Mr. Lines was first mentioned that day. It was suggested that Miss Chessher should speak to him, as we had to get his consent to have the work done. We knew that if Liberty's knew the work was done by Jean Dunsmore they would probably refuse to us. The name of Mrs. Page was employed to deceive Liberty's. A gown was produced by Miss Beaumont which had been made by Jean Duns<lb/>more.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010084"/>
               <p>It was shown to Miss Chessher, who said it was very well made and smart, and thought they would be able to sell it. I remember another conversation when she said that, knowing that the gowns had been made at Jean Dunsmore's, she would be unable to have them at Liberty's, as she would have to say at some time that Wallace was a partner of Jean Dunsmore. I first met Miss Cuthbert at 38, Conduit Street, after I left Liberty's employment. She was never offered a partnership in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Miss Chessher was asked to introduce another woman as Dunsmore and to recommend her as a competent and suit<lb/>able person. She was not offered a share of the profits for so doing; she was to do it for nothing. There was a person who was to be known as Mrs. Page. When Miss Chessher came again she said she was not willing to go on because of the number of lies it would be necessary to tell, and the matter ended. Miss Cuthbert was not asked to intro<lb/>duce an out-worker or told that she should have a share of the profits to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. Prisoner is my wife. I was in the habit of visit<lb/>ing at 38, Conduit Street. I was there on September 28 when Miss Chessher arrived. The Dingley matter was discussed between those who were present. My wife was at the time carrying on business as Jean Dunsmore. She spoke to Miss Chessher and Wallace about taking part in that business. That was all that was said as far as I remem<lb/>ber. No offer was made to Miss Chessher that day or the next Monday of a partnership or commission. Miss Chessher and Wallace came again on the Tuesday. She said, "Girls, I have a surprise for you. We are not going to go further with the business," and we took that as final. Her reason was that she would not like to assist Wallace with the business owing to her being at Liberty's. I was not there when Miss Cuthbert arrived, but I heard what passed after I arrived. My wife said the models that Mr. Collins was showing were made by Jean Dunsmore, meaning herself. Miss Cuthbert then said, "Oh! you bounders." No suggestion of a partnership or commission was made to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not remember Miss Chessher saying that she had seen Mr. Lines, and realised that it was impossible to go on because she would have to tell so many lies.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Thomas Simpson and Co., timber agents, 6, Great Winchester Street, E.C., who are agents for J. A. Enhornings Travaran Aktiebolag, a Swedish firm. In Novem<lb/>ber, 1911, this firm consigned some timber to us in the s.s. "Valke<lb/>rian." We sent a circular out to the timber trade with particulars of this cargo. On November 16, 1911, I had a conversation with prisoner. He rang up on the telephone and wanted to make an offer for a parcel of the timber at £6 12s. 6d. per standard. I told him my instructions were to ask for cash for any future business. He said he did not think we ought to ask for cash, as everything was quite right; he thought we ought to give credit in the usual way. I told him we had heard rumours that his credit was being curtailed, but I said, "If you can give us an interview and satisfy us absolutely that everything is quite in order my principals will consider whether they will send the order out to the shippers." We were the only agents for that particu<lb/>lar cargo. Mr. Mason and I went to prisoner's office. I told prisoner that we had heard he had been asked for cash for goods that he had bought by auction. He said that if that was so it would have been in cases where the owners of the goods had asked the brokers to obtain cash. He also said he had no idea his credit was being curtailed. He told us distinctly that he had £8,000 or £10,000 capital. He said he had no renewals of bills or advances and that he was solvent; so much so that he could retire from business in three months and pay everyone in full if he so wished, and that he had never been in a better position in his life. He said he had about £4,000 of acceptances. We examined the bill book and were quite satisfied that some leading people in the trade were trusting him. He also told us that he had £1,000 worth of furniture. We then sent on his offer to our Swedish principals. On November 18 I spoke to prisoner on the telephone and told him that his offer was not accepted; he then increased it to £6 15s. per standard. On November 20 I telephoned to him that his offer was accepted, and we sent the contract and other documents to him on that day. The bill of lading produced is for the goods he had. On November 27 I sent him a bill of exchange for £588 11s. 4d., which was returned to us on December 1 accepted. It was eventually dishonoured. On February 2, 1912, prisoner came to our office and said he had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010086"/>
               <p>looking into his books and he found he could only pay 10s. in the £. We asked him to put his scheme into writing, and he wrote three letters, which were sent to the three different shippers interested. The letter produced is the letter he wrote and signed. On February 5 there was a meeting of creditors at our offices, at which I was present. Defendant said he could not meet his engagements, and that the reason he had lost the money between November 16 and February 5 was that he had incurred bad debts. On February 9 there was a further meet<lb/>ing, when defendant gave a statement of affairs up to date, which showed a deficiency of £3,095.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My firm had been trading with prisoner about 10 or 12 years to the extent of about £3,000 a year. Up to this time he had carried out all his undertakings. The representation I placed most value on was with regard to his having £8,000 or £10,000 capital. He did not say it was property. We were satisfied with all that he told us. If he had said he had £500 a year net income from his property that would have weighed with us.</p>

                  </hi>, Senior Examiner in the department of the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy. I had charge of prisoner's bank<lb/>ruptcy. A petition was presented against him on March 14, 1912; re<lb/>ceiving order made on April 16; adjudication April 20. On May 17 his amended statement of affairs showed liabilities £6,686 11s. 1d.; unsecured creditors, £6,426 13s. 9d.; assets estimated to produce £2,215 11s.; deficiency, £4,471 0s. 1d. The Swedish firm was scheduled as an unsecured creditor for £868 7s. 8d., which includes a bill for £607 8s. The statement shows that on November 17, 1911, there was a deficiency of about £1,968. Furniture and effects were put at £150,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010087"/>
               <p>subject to a bill of sale for £140. (Witness produced the shorthand notes of prisoner's examination in bankruptcy, extracts from which were read.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The books were audited up to December, 1910, by a chartered accountant. Prisoner's credit balance at that date was £1,766; in December, 1909, it was £866. Roughly, the turnover was about £50,000 a year. Prisoner was landlord of thirty houses on which he had mortgages of between £2,000 and £3,000. The original mort<lb/>gage was £8,340, which was reduced by November 16, 1911, to £5,500.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There was a surplus of liabilities over assets of £3,000 or £4,000 at the time of the bankruptcy.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been a timber merchant in the City of London between 20 and 21 years. Up to the date of this charge my annual turnover was about £50,000 a year. During the 20 years I was in business I was never summoned for a debt. I borrowed £500 from Phillips owing to the fact that my bank gave me notice curtailing the amount of discount they allowed me. In Novem<lb/>ber, 1911, when I started negotiations to purchase timber from the Swedish firm, I considered myself solvent. I never told Squires that the value of my furniture was £1,000. I said I had a valuable home which I had been collecting for some years. I never said I had capital to the extent of £8,000 or £10,000; I said that I had house property to the value of £8,000 or £10,000, subject to mortgages on it, and that it brought me in a net income of £500 a year. Squires and Mason asked to see my bills-book, which contained all my trade debts. I did not say that I had never got an advance against a bill of lading or any such thing. I subsequently became insolvent and saw some of my principal creditors, when I made an offer of 7s. 6d. in the pound.</p>

                  </hi> (recalled, further examined). On February 22 I was pressed for payment of a bill; bankruptcy proceedings were com<lb/>menced and I was endeavouring to effect a composition with my credi<lb/>tors. As to other timber I had bought I returned the bills of lading as I could not see my way to pay for them. Up to January all bills had been duly met. In December, when I purchased the timber from Thomas Simpson and Co., I paid them £600 on account. I could have purchased timber anywhere in London at that time from mer<lb/>chants with whom I had been dealing for 20 years. From November I had been careful with my purchases; between November and February I paid bills amounting to £8,000. In February I was making arrange<lb/>ments to have the bills due to Simpson and Co. met at my bankers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010088"/>
               <p>or to get Simpson and others not to present them. This timber was bought exceedingly cheaply; some of it was sold at auction at a good profit and the rest was sold privately at a profit. The advance I ob<lb/>tained on it was at 5 per cent. interest. In 1910 I lost about £500 or £600 in bad debts. In 1911 the building trade was in a disastrous state; builders were unable to get mortgages for advances, could not realise, and bad debts resulted. In February, 1912, my bad debts were £2,845, as against £600 in 1910, due to the bad state of the building trade. The property mortgaged by me was of much higher value than the amount advanced; they were double flats bring<lb/>ing in £1 a week each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had done business with Simpson and Co. for 15 years, satisfactorily on both sides; we mutually trusted each other. In September, 1911, I was not pressed for money. I had done business with Churchill and Sims for 18 years to 20 years, they selling timber for me on commission. In September, 1911, they first advanced money to me on timber against the dock warrants for timber which had been partly paid for and partly outstanding on bills. The market being rotten I thought it better not to sell. The bank at that time reduced my discount from £5,000 to £3,000. On November 9 my banking account may have been overdrawn by £25; an acceptance for £547 17s. 10d. fell due; I applied to Phillips to discount my bills and they may have lent me £500. Between November 22 and December 7 bills fell due for £1,022 and open accounts possibly for another £440. I bought the timber from Simpson and Co. because I knew it was cheap and I was certain of a profit under the hammer or a greater profit by private sale. I did not then intend to obtain an advance on it. I did borrow four days after from Charley and Simms on that timber against the bill of lading. Squires telephoned to me that he had heard I had been asked for cash at auctions; I gathered that he was not satis<lb/>fied with the state of my credit. I had an interview with Squires and Mason. I told them I had £4,000 or £5,000 out in bills, that I had £8,000 to £10,000 worth of property, subject to charges. I am sure I said my property was charged without stating the amount of the charges. I said that I had a net income of about £500 a year, and furniture and effects worth £1,000. I knew that Simpson and Co. were agents for the Swedish firm and that they were inquiring as to my position in order to advise their principals, and that they would take my word as to my position. Squires may have asked if my credit was being curtailed. I did not say I was then in a better position that at any time during my business career; he is mistaken. I told him I was solvent. I did not say I could pay everyone in full and retire from trade in three months. I proposed a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound, 2s. 6d. cash and 5s. guarantee. I may have asked Simpson and Co. to be guarantors on the security of my furni<lb/>ture. I may have told Squires my furniture and fixtures cost £1,000. At the time of my bankruptcy I owed on bills alone £5,400. Squires had not asked me my total liabilities, but what bills I had outstanding. I handed him my bill-book and said, "You will see them all there."</p>

I asked them to read them, which they did. I wrote something on the petition and citation which E. S. Dean signed and which Dealler signed in the name of Richard Jones. Both admitted that they were the persons named in the citation and that the allegations therein were true. Kate Hardy was present. I said to E. S. Dean and Dealler that I should have to have some evidence that they were living there to<lb/>gether as man and wife. E. S. Dean pointed to Hardy and said, "Oh, you can give that evidence." Hardy said, "No, not me; I am not going into any witness-box." I served her with a subpœna. The affidavit verifying the petition and letter to the King's Proctor (pro<lb/>duced) are signed by S. C. Dean.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I now reside at Esher, in Surrey, and am a pawnbroker's assistant. I have been employed by my wife's stepfather for 15 years and by other firms. I have always been of good character and never been charged criminally. I am 37 years of age. I was married in March, 1903. My wife has had four children, the third of whom I doubt being my child, and the fourth I know is not. I have lived at various addresses in Dulwich, including 264, Upland Road. In 1907, at a music-hall, my wife introduced Dealler to me as David Jones—his professional name being Dealler—and at her suggestion I invited him to visit us, which he did, at 13, Jeptha Road, Wandsworth. I was away at business from 8 a.m. to 9.30 p.m., Dealler being occupied in the evening. In March, 1907, on my wife's suggestion, I let a room to Dealler; he occupied part of my house from then to October, 1911. In July or August, 1908, at 2 a.m. I found my wife had left our bedroom; she said she was getting Mr. Jones's (Dealler's) underclothing ready. The next evening I told Dealler he would have to go, I was jealous of him. He said I was quite wrong, it was my fancy; he left; afterwards at my wife's request he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010092"/>
               <p>returned. I did not further cohabit with her. At the end of 1908 I removed to Oakland House, East Dulwich, Dealler accompanying us. In 1909 we removed to 264, Upland Road, where Dealler introduced Hardy to me and she came as a maidservant. I cohabited with her until 1912. In August, 1911, the children were sent to school. In October Dealler and my wife left and I received letter from Croydon produced. The two youngest children were left with me for a fort<lb/>night; my wife fetched them away in my absence. In December, 1911, I went to 39, Temple Street, Brighton, to arrange with my wife about the schooling of the two eldest children. My wife had means of her own. Early in 1912 I consulted my solicitors with a view to divorce proceedings and swore an affidavit prepared by Lewis, which was true to the best of my belief. There was no collusion between me and my wife. I gave my solicitors the name of Richard Jones, believing it to be Dealler's true name; I believed Dealler and Goldsmith were his pro<lb/>fessional names. On February 12, 1912, I went to Brighton with Lewis to identify my wife and Dealler as respondent and co-respondent. The proceedings were heard on April, 1912, and a decree nisi was granted with the custody of the children. I and Hardy were called as witnesses. I made no untrue statement to my knowledge either as a witness or in the petition or affidavit or said anything which was intended to mislead the Court. (To the Judge.) I first made up my mind to commence divorce proceedings on receipt of the letter from Croydon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew my wife had been committing adultery with Dealler under my roof; it was impossible for me to prevent it. I did not say so in the petition because I was not asked and did not think it necessary. I handed my solicitor the letter from Croydon.</p>
               <p>Evidence of character was given.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I had made no arrange<lb/>ment or compact with S. C. Dean about divorce proceedings and have had no communication whatever with him on the subject. In February, 1912, a letter was received from Lewis making an appointment; I intended to keep out of the way, but he met me in the street and asked me to come in and sign a document, which I did; Lewis said there would be no fuss about the matter, I should not have to appear in court. I was treating the matter in a contemptuous way; the name of Richard Jones appearing in it had nothing to do with me; I signed it on the advice of Lewis; I would do it again for a lady. I knew nothing at all about the divorce proceedings being started. I did not want to go on living the life we were living, but I was not consulted from first to last about the proceedings. In October, 1912, I left London, having an appointment at Brighton. I did not inform S. C. Dean that I was going. I travelled by motor-car—it broke down and we stayed at Croydon for the night; otherwise I should have gone on to Brighton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010093"/>
               <p>that day. E. S. Dean did not speak to me about the letter she wrote. I knew she had written it. I asked Miss Pelliston for a receipt, as I usually do. I did not say, I wanted to produce it. I lived at Esher for three or four years under the name of Jones. I was employed at the Grand Theatre, Clapham, in the name of Dealler. S. C. Dean would be quite justified in thinking that was my professional name. Goldsmith or Goldschmid was a name selected for me by my employers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My name is David James Dealler. I dropped the name of Jones when I left Esher. I took Oakland House in my proper name, David Dealler—that is the district where my family reside and I was well known there by that name.</p>

                  </hi>, accountant, Sefton House, Westbourne Grove, W. On June 1, 1910, I was engaged by prisoner as confiden<lb/>tial company expert. I knew him as Thomas Cooper. His offices were at Spencer House, South Place, E.C. After he had engaged me he said I was to fit up or furnish one of the back offices for the purpose of seeing his clients as his employé. He was to pay for that. I suggested that I could possibly obtain the furniture for him on trade</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010094"/>
               <p>terms if I placed the order through Siddey and Siddey, my father's business. I suggested that the furniture should be bought from B. Cohen and Sons, Curtain Road. Prisoner said, "It is not necessary to order it through Siddey and Siddey to obtain the trade discount. I have one of my companies here, the India Trading Corporation, from whom I am in the habit of obtaining goods to send out to India." I ordered goods to the value of £40 gross. They were delivered to Spencer House to the name of Thomas Cooper or Cooper and Co. I had prisoner's authority for that. When the invoice was delivered prisoner complained that the claims were too highly priced and ulti<lb/>mately Cohen's made a reduction of 2s. 6d. per chair. I did not know that prisoner was an undischarged bankrupt when I ordered the goods, or that his name was Douse. I left his employment about the end of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On one door was the name of Thomas Cooper and on another the Rubber and Oil Company, Ltd. Prisoner did not give me definite instructions to order the goods in any particular name. He gave me two or three billheads. That was with the object of enabling him to secure trade discount. He gave me general instruc<lb/>tions that if Cohen's liked to charge the goods up to himself or to one or other of the companies they could do so. I am not aware that they charged them up to Thomas Cooper and Co., a firm that does not exist. I believe prisoner traded under the name of Cooper and Co. I should not like to say that there is no firm of Thomas Cooper and Co. None of the billheads bore that name. Cohen's did not allow the 25 per cent. discount because they knew me. That is not cus<lb/>tomary. Of course, I mentioned my father's firm to them and said that if I ordered the goods through that firm we should get the dis<lb/>count, but that Mr. Cooper himself was entitled to it.</p>

On October 1, 1909, and January 23, 1911, I delivered stationery and printing at Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate Street. The goods were invoiced to Cooper and Co. The amount was £100 4s. 3d. I received a pay<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010095"/>
               <p>on account of £50 on April 23, 1900. Previous to that there were three other accounts, one each to Cooper and Co., Horse Shoes, Ltd., and India Trading Corporation, Ltd. On September 30, 1909, Cooper and Co. wrote me enclosing cheque for £4 5s. and requesting that accounts for Horse Shoes, Ltd., and India Trading Corporation, Ltd., should be made out to Cooper and Co. direct. I knew prisoner as Cooper. He did not inform me that he was an undischarged bank<lb/>rupt. The two companies' accounts were paid and after that all accounts were sent in to Cooper and Co. They owe a balance of £50 4s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The account was first opened by a man named Fox for Cooper and Co. We asked in a letter of December 5 for references. Before that letter was delivered somebody came from Cooper and Co., and my shorthand clerk then and there at my instructions made a note on the back of that letter as Cooper's showed correspondence of a satisfactory nature with Thomas Hubbuck and Son, Ltd., 24, Lime Street, E.C., and Farman and King, solicitors, 62 and 64, Birkbeck Chambers, W.C. Those references did not refer to Cooper and Co., of Bombay. I did not know Fox in connection with Cooper and Co., of Bombay. I have no recollection of his telling me that he and prisoner were taking an office as their agents. I do not think I made any inquiries until Cooper disappeared.</p>

                  </hi>, fur merchant, 7, College Street, E.C. On Sep<lb/>tember 20 a man named Popert, with whom I had some small dealings, introduced me to prisoner. Prisoner said he was a director of several companies with offices in Great Winchester Street, and was also the manager of a West End bank which was in liquidation. He said he had £2,000 deposited there, but he could not get it yet. I agreed to do business with him for small amounts. He said he had influential</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010096"/>
               <p>friends in the House of Commons. Between September 20 and Octo<lb/>ber 3 I entrusted him with small parcels of goods. He came and saw me on October 3 and said he wanted a set of furs to the value of £300 or £400. I said: "If it comes to that, we must have substan<lb/>tial evidence of your means." He then volunteered the statement that Mr. T. P. O'Connor, M.P., was his uncle, and said that he wanted the furs for Mr. T. P. O'Connor, and through him he would be able to dispose of plenty of furs. I believed that statement. Prisoner also said that he was a married man with three children with a house in Kingston, and that he was on the telephone. Among other goods I entrusted to prisoner on October 3 was a stone-marten set value £32. The invoice produced is receipted by R. O'Connor. Prisoner paid two items of £9 and £7 10s., but he has never paid the £32, nor has he ever given me any information as to what has become of the furs. I have written to him frequently about it. On October 7 prisoner called on me and said that Lord Montague of Beaulieu was a very good friend of his, and he could sell a very fine coat to him. I believed this statement to be true, and handed prisoner an astrakhan coat value £19. On October 9 prisoner wrote saying that he had sold the coat. He has never paid me the money for it. Subsequently prisoner said, "Lord Montague has seen that coat, and it is not good enough; what he wants is a smart coat about £50 lined with sable." On October 10 I sent prisoner another coat value £15 for which he sent me a cheque. It was dishonoured. On the same day I sent defendant a set of squirrel furs, value £6 10s. On October 11 he wrote to me: "I have also sold the squirrel set you sent yesterday; you will receive the money for the same in a day." I never received the money. (Witness gave simi<lb/>lar evidence with regard to a large number of articles.) I have repeatedly pressed prisoner either to return the goods or pay for them, but have been unable to get any answer. On October 11 Popert came to me with a bill of exchange for £40. I handed the bill to my solicitor. It was met after the grand jury had found a true bill against prisoner. The bill was drawn by Daniel O'Connor and accepted by defendant. I subsequently made inquiries of Mr. T. P. O'Connor and Lord Montague.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I prosecuted prisoner because it was my duty as a citizen to bring a thief to account. The furs were always my furs and never became prisoner's. He paid me with regard to the first two transactions. I did think Mr. T. P. O'Connor was going to sell ladies' furs to people in the House of Commons. The bill of exchange prisoner gave me was eventually cashed. I did not doubt that he was a direc<lb/>tor of several companies, and do not doubt it now. I did not doubt that he had £2,000 in the bank. On looking at the document handed to me I do not doubt it now. Most of the invoices are made out to Popert, but were, in fact, transactions with defendant. I cannot account for the fact that Mr. T. P. O'Connor's name is not mentioned in the correspondence. I never gave prisoner any credit; the goods were handed over on sale or return. He did not tell me he was a nephew of General O'Connor, who was the oldest wearer of the Vic<lb/>toria</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010097"/>
               <p>Cross. Prisoner did not say he knew a friend of Lord Montague of Beaulieu and that through him he might be able to sell a coat; he said he was a personal friend of Lord Montague's.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Up to this moment I have not been supplied by prisoner or his solicitor with any details as to where the goods are or what has become of them.</p>

                  </hi>, Lucerne, Switzerland. I am chief clerk to Harry Cullerne Bown, who is known as the Totalisator, Lucerne. It is a bet<lb/>ting business. Telegrams making bets have to bear a code time pre<lb/>vious to the starting of the race. Exhibit 2 is a telegram received by Mr. Bown on October 8 backing Black Cap for 10s. to win. It is sent by George Clarkson, 57, Bromfelde Road, Clapham. Black Cap was entered only for the 2.35 race at Nottingham. The telegram bears the official despatching time, 2.53, and is supposed to have been handed in at 2.23. This cheque for £6 10s. 10d. was drawn by Mr. Bown and made payable to George Clarkson. I enclosed it in an envelope which I directed. It has been paid by the bank. It represents Clark<lb/>son's winnings from October 5 to October 12. We sent the telegram to the Investigation Department of the G.P.O. in London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We may send out a large number of circulars to officials in London, and may have more than one client in the G.P.O. All cheques and accounts sent to clients pass through my hands. We have hundreds a day at times. I can swear this cheque was des<lb/>patched.</p>

                  </hi>, 57, Bromfelde Road, Clapham, S.W. Prisoner lodged at my boarding house for over two and a half years. He left on November 9, saying he was going for a few days' holiday. I did not see him again till I saw him at Bow Street. Soon after November 9 he wrote saying he would not return. He left no address. I knew him as Claydon. I think two or three letters came in the name of Clarkson. They were put in the rack. Prisoner once said that if a letter came in the name of Clarkson I was not to send it back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was one of the most straightforward lodgers I have had. After he left one or two letters addressed to Clay<lb/>don came, which were sent back.</p>

                  </hi>, overseer, Central Telegraph Office. Prisoner was employed as a telegraphist in the cable room. He did not present himself for duty on November 9, 1912. On that day he tendered his resignation by letter to the Assistant Comptroller. It was received on November 11. He gave no explanation. I know his writing. I believe the letter is written by him. He did not give notice. The attendance book produced shows the attendances of the whole of the telegraphists. Between 3 and 4 p.m. on October 8 prisoner was working the sending part of the Baudot instrument, which was in use on the Zurich circuit. This slip (Exhibit 10) was used on that circuit from 2.53 or 2.55. Exhibit 5, No. F. 2,742, is one of the tele<lb/>grams that went over the Baudot instrument and was recorded on that slip. Exhibit 11, the original message, was handed in at Chan<lb/>cery Lane at 2.23 p.m. It is addressed "Mutuel, Lucerne." That is the registered address of "The Totalisator." It reads, "10s. to win, Aberdeen Blackcap Clapfelde." Telegram No. 2,668 to Zurich was signalled on that day. It was not completed. The signalling was completed only as far as a portion of the second word in the address. Then some conversation took place as to telegrams that had been sent and received. This all appears on the slip. On completion of that conversation No. 2,742 was commenced and completed and 2,668 com<lb/>menced again and completed after 2,742, although originally it was commenced before 2,742. 2,668 was handed in at Liverpool at 2.19 p.m. Exhibit 5 bears the signature that has been used for many years by prisoner, "Cla" and a flourish. I should say it is his writing. The "2.23" appears to have been substituted. It is an alteration. The piece of paper which should bear the number has been torn off. When messages are received by the counter clerk they are placed in a rack and put into a carrier by a tube attendant or messenger, the carrier ✗laced in the pneumatic tube and sent to the Central Office, St. Martin's le Grand. The number on the piece of paper, which has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191304010100"/>
               <p>been torn off, would indicate the time when it was tubed. I look at Exhibits 7 and 8 and say that Exhibit 5 must have been handed in at the counter between 2.51 and 2.55 p.m.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is possible that Exhibit 5 got mutilated acci<lb/>dentally. I cannot say that it is not unusual for a corner to get torn off. The form would go through several hands before it arrived at prisoner's table. I do not suggest that the alteration was then made by him. I make no suggestion. It must have been done at the Baudot table. There would be five people there two and a half feet apart. I can say that all the figures "2.23" had been altered. I think the figure "6," indicating the number of words, has been altered. There was no necessity to do that. The alterations look like prisoner's writing. I was not on duty in this division on that day. Whoever was the overseer would be near prisoner.</p>

I do not recognise the handwriting or the initials; Exhibit 7 is a foreign telegram which I received at 2.51 p.m. on October 8, which I marked with the same pencil as 24 and 25. It is numbered in the right hand corner, "83." The earliest of the three was received at 2.29 and the latest at 3.2. I was on duty during that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not think that if a telegram dropped on the floor it would remain there five or ten minutes. The tube boys do not search the floor every half hour, only the trays into which the messages</p>

               <p>are put. It is possible that Exhibit 5 had been waiting to go up the tube for some minutes. It may have been handed over the counter at 2.23.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant postman at Peckham. On October 8 I was tube attendant at the London chief office. Exhibit 6 is a tube check sheet, which I kept on October 8. It was my duty to collect foreign telegrams from the tray at the counter and number them with a machine on the top right-hand corner and put the time. The machine gives consecutive numbers. I then put them in the carrier. No. 83 is not in the sheet. No. 82 was the last number of the batch. That was sent up the tube at 2.50. No. 84 was sent up at 2.54. The sheet shows that 138 foreign telegrams were sent up. No. 84 is missing from the bundle, otherwise the number would be 138. Nos. 83 and 84 would be sent up in the same batch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If a corner got torn off we should put the number in pencil. I search the floor every half hour. I my time telegrams have not been dropped on the floor. Exhibit 7 is timed at 2.51 and it is not sent till 3.30. Exhibit 5 is timed at 2.23 and sent at 3.</p>

                  </hi>. On October 8 I was dispatching telegrams over the Zurich circuit by the Bandot instrument. I was relieved at 3 p.m. by prisoner. Exhibit 11 was dispatched by me at 2.53. The Bandot slip, Exhibit 10, records it. The next message recorded is No. 2,451. It was started by me and appears to be a rectification in a previous series. The next one is No. 2,668. That was started by me and apparently Zurich interrupted me by asking a question. The next is 2,742. That was not sent by me. That is Exhibit 5. It bears pri<lb/>soner's signature. The time it was sent by him is not indicated. It was sent after I had started 2,668.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It takes 35 to 40 minutes from the time it is handed over the counter for a telegram to get away on the wire. I have been</p>

                  </hi>, telegraphist, Central Telegraph Office. Exhibit 12 is the Zurich circuit diary. Part of it is in my writing. It shows that prisoner was on that circuit despatching messages from 3 to 4 p.m. on October 8. It was my duty to collect the telegrams from the operator after he despatched them and enter them in the circuit abstract. I usually do that in batches of 10. I enter the time. Ex<lb/>hibit 13 is a batch of 10. I received that at 3.54 p.m.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took duty at 3 p.m. at this table where prisoner was one of four operators. I was moving about amongst them. The wire was working badly prior to my arrival. That is recorded in the diary at 3.10. There are also the entries "3.25 O.K. to Paris, but bad to Zurich," and "3.40 O.K. to Zurich." They mean that the reception from Zurich was bad. The transmission to Zurich was never in question.</p>

                  </hi>, telegraphist, Central Office. It was my duty to make inquiries respecting a bundle of telegrams from Mr. Bown of Lucerne, which came addressed to "C. H. Hoskins Abrahall, Esq., Investigation Department, G.P.O., London, E.C." I received same on October 8 at 4.50 p.m. I had also some of the originals. I recog<lb/>nise prisoner's handwriting on three of them. I do not recognise his handwriting on Exhibit 5. Prisoner asked to see the documents. It was no part of his duty to do so. I took it to be curiosity on his part. I could not swear that he has ever before asked to see documents which I have had. He had them in his possession about three minutes. He seemed to be turning them over, so I presumed he was reading them. I saw the signature on some of them, and noticed the resemblance to prisoner's, but did not associate them with him at the time. I knew prisoner lived at Bromfelde Road. I visited him there once. I had not said anything to him about the contents of the papers before he asked to look at them. He gave no explanation for wanting to see them. I do not know whether he read the letter from Mr. Bown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave evidence at the police-court. The magis<lb/>trate rejected it. I was asked by the prosecuting counsel: "Did the prisoner see the papers?" I replied "Yes, he looked at them," and that was objected to by counsel for the defence. The magistrate asked me if prisoner made any remark; I said "No; he looked at them and nodded, and handed them back to me." Since the police-court pro<lb/>ceedings I have had to give an explanation of my evidence to the clerk who took my statement down in the first place. The solicitor also sent for me. Had the papers been handed to me in another section prisoner would not have seen or known about them at all.</p>

               <p>betting would be reprimanded or punished. The time occupied by me in going from the cable room to the special section, Central Tele<lb/>graph office, despatching a telegram, and returning to the cable room was seventeen minutes.</p>
               <p>Further evidence was given as to the time occupied in communicat<lb/>ing the result of various races.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kimber submitted that there was no case: (1) There is a presumption in law that the telegram (Exhibit 5) was in its present condition when passed over the counter, the prosecution having given no evidence that it had been forged or altered (Stephens Digest, 8th Edn., p. 97; R. v. Gordon 4 Dearsley, p. 586; Taylor on Evidence; Tatum v. Catomore, 16 Q.B., p. 745); (2) There is no evidence that the alteration (if any) was made by prisoner; no expert on handwriting had been called to assist the jury. (Reg v. Harvey, 11 Cox, p. 546.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir submitted that there was evidence that the document was a forgery, and that it was a forgery by prisoner or one to which he was a party. (Reg v. Riley, 1896, 1 Q.B., p. 309.)</p>
               <p>After discussion on the evidence,</p>
               <p>The Recorder: I am of opinion that there is no case to go to the jury. There are many circumstances which arouse suspicion, but there is no evidence that the document was forged when handed over the counter. The case is clearly dis<lb/>tinguishable from R. v. Riley.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT SAUNDERS</hi>. On February 25 I got from London Bridge Station for ticket produced a trunk and hat-box; in the trunk was a bond and jewellery identified by Miss Hamblock, also photo of the three prisoners. On February 5 Leroy was put up with eight similar men at Kensington Police Station and identified by several witnesses. He said to me in French, "They recognise me for my twin brother; we are twins." I translated the charges; he said, "It is me and it is not me, but it is the same as if it was me. I am one of twins. My brother has brought me over here and this is the result."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I translated the charges relating to 17 and 18, Harrington Gardens and 34, Pembridge Gardens. A. Wild has pleaded guilty to all and J. Wild to two of those charges. The camera and manicure set are the only things found on Leroy relating to this charge. When Mr. de Linde signed the charge-sheet Leroy said, "What does he value that at?" I said, "£300." He said, "He has got cheek (<hi rend="italic">toupet</hi>) to value it at £300." Some pawn tickets were found in the trunk which have no relation to these charges.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I came alone to England in December, 1912, at my brother's request. I last saw him two or three days before I was arrested. I do not know where he lives. I gave the name of Leroy so that my parents should not know of my arrest. I knew A. and J. Wild in Paris and Brussels as friends of my brother; they met me at the station when I arrived; I stayed at an hotel for three days and then went to Cromwell Road, where I was arrested. I was never at 34, Pembridge Gardens and do not know any of the witnesses from there who have given evidence. At Cromwell Road I gave the name on a card which I had—"Seyboth." I never took the name of Leroy before I was arrested.</p>

                  </hi>, builder's foreman. I was in charge of the building of Sir George Riddle's house. By February 18 the building was structurally complete, but painting and decorating work was going on. Twelve men were employed; they worked from 6 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. During the night the house was left unattended. Near the kitchen there was a small window, which a person might get through, about 2 ft. 6 in. from the ground. When I left on the 18th the house was in perfect condition. At 6.30 next morning. I found damage had been done to the extent of £400 to £450. In the servant's bedroom on the first floor I found some cord, a tin that had probably contained powder, some 2 in. wire nails; in the corridor I found a tin of powder, a tin containing shavings soaked in paraffin, with a candle sticking in the centre. (The case was that two tins of powder had been prepared, one placed in the servant's bedroom, the other in the corridor 35 ft. away; also, in similar positions, two tins of shavings, each with a candle in the centre; the ignition of the shavings by the burning down of the candle would cause an explosion of the powder; an explosion actually occurred in the bedroom, but the force of it extinguished the candle in the corridor before it burned sufficiently low to ignite the shavings there.)</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN LOUGH</hi>, Surrey Constabulary, spoke to a number of articles he found on the premises and handed to Inspector Tugdale.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT TUGDALE</hi>, Surrey Constabulary, said that he went to the premises on February 19 at 8.45 a.m. Assisted by Lough he made a search; among the articles found were a hatpin, the re<lb/>mains of a candlestick, a golosh, a tin of shavings, amongst which was a hairpin.</p>

               <p>Chief-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MCBRIEN</hi>, New Scotland Yard. On March 12 I went to 28, Campden Hill Gardens and found this letter (Exhibit 23), dated January 10, signed by prisoner. (It described her as Honorary Treasurer of the Women's Social and Political Union; it was addressed to members of the Union, and impressed the fact that the attitude of the Government towards the Suffrage Bill then before Parliament made "militancy" more a moral duty and a political necessity than it had ever been before.)</p>
               <p>Sub-divisional Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES CROCKER</hi>, who was acquainted with prisoner's handwriting, said that Exhibit 23 was signed by her.</p>
               <p>Major <hi rend="smallCaps">A. M. COOPER-KEY</hi>, Chief Inspector of Explosives, said that the tin found in the corridor contained gunpowder together with nails and percussion caps.</p>

               <p>Chief Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MCBRIEN</hi>, recalled, said that he arrested prisoner on February 24; on the warrant being read to her she made no reply, nor upon being charged.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, April 3.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner called no evidence. In a long speech to the jury she explained that she had pleaded Not Guilty because the indictment accused her of "wickedly and maliciously inciting," and she pro<lb/>tested that she was not wicked or malicious. But she accepted respon<lb/>sibility for all the speeches she had made. She was only animated by a sincere desire to get political power into the hands of women. Whether the sentence was long or short she should not submit to it. The moment she left the Court—if she were sent to prison, whether to penal servitude or to a mild form of imprisonment—she would quite deliberately refuse to eat food. She would join the women in Holloway who were already on "hunger strike." She would come out of prison—dead or alive—at the earliest possible moment, and once out, so soon as she was physically fit, she would enter into the fight again.</p>
