                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Lodge, a furrier, of 64, Aldersgate Street—I employ a forewoman and two women to work at goods—the prisoner was an outdoor hand—the fur-skins are cut out ready for her to take home, with the lining to line them with satin, and return them the next day—we enter the quantity of the lining given out, and she keeps a small book herself; and on comparison of the two books they ought to tally—on 7th May I saw my forewoman give out 12 brown rabbit-skin capes to the prisoner, and materials for lining at the same time—the value of the lot was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were to be returned next day—she said she had a machine, and could do some quilting work, and I said I would give her a sample—she said "I have not finished all my work, if you will give me some more I will bring it to-morrow"—she had previously done it very well, and my forewoman gave her 12 more capes and the materials for lining, to the value of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they ought to have come in in the afternoon, but not coming, I sent Mrs. Drew, one of my work-women, to her place three times, but I was not able to see her till the morning she was given in charge, when I went to her place at half-past 9 o'clock—I said to her "Mrs. Ford, I have come for my work; I must have it, done or undone"—she said "I will be round presently"—I said "That won't do, I must have it now"—she then said "I sent it"—I said "When?" she said "The morning after I had your note"—I said "Who did you give it to, then?"—she said "There were two young men on the landing, and I gave it to the young man that had a light coat on."—there are no young men there at all—the said "Who was the</p>

I met Clocker at the Clyde public-house, and he went with me to sell them at his aunt's, at Stopney; that is all I know about it"—Clocker said he was innocent, he had never stolen the goods—he said he went to his aunt's and asked her to buy the goods for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; she would not give 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, she would give 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I asked Clocker to sell them for me; I said 'Here is the invoice if you want to see it;' he said I cannot read;' he said 'I will sell them for you if I can.'

At 1 o'clock on 29th May the prisoner came to Hammersmith Police-station and said he wished to give himself up for committing bigamy—I told him he had better make a statement in writing—he said he was tired of the wretched life he had been leading, and was not sure whether he had committed bigamy or not, as he was very young, about 16, when he was first married—this is the statement he made: "I, George Bourne, give myself up not being positive whether I have committed bigamy or not. There is proof no doubt enough that that I did go to church with two separate women, but I am in doubt whether the first marriage was legal; if it is, I trust that, considering the wretched life I have led through my weakness, that justice will be done to me with every consideration and leniency."</p>

I am a provision dealer of 39, Stanhope Street—about 1 or 1.15 a.m. on 21st May the prisoner came in for half a pound of cooked bacon, a loaf, an ounce of Dutch cheese, and some pickled onions, which all came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he tendered a bad half-crown—I told him it was bad—he said "Don't damage it, as I had it from my employer out of a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">sub.</hi>"—I gave it to him back, he gave me a good shilling, and put the bad half-crown in his breast pocket—he stopped in the shop talking live or ten minutes, and then went out with the provisions—I went behind him and gave information to Keenan, E 286, who brought him back to my shop seven to ten minutes afterwards, with the sergeant, who threw down a half-sovereign, and said "Is this what he tendered you?"—I said "No, he tendered me a bad half-crown and he put it in his left breast pocket"—the constable searched him in my shop, and took the half-crown out of the same pocket that I saw him put it into.</p>

Schuster and Co., payable at the Union Bank, their bankers—since I accepted it the figures at the top have been altered from 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the words have been altered to <hi rend="italic">"Funf hundert zehn"</hi>—those alterations were made without my authority—I cannot say what time I accepted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Stern is a business friend of ours in Cologne; we honour any bill of his up to the amount of his credit—he generally advises us, and we were advised beforehand of a draft for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this letter of 19th February, 1884—I believe that letter says the bill is to the order of Jacob Rach—the words of the amount in the body of the bill begin with "F"—if it had been six hundred they would nave begun with "S"—it ought to be easy to see that difference—I always read the amount and wording before I accept; I do not pay; if I did, I think I should look to see that the amount and words were the same—one of our clerks brought it to me to be signed—I did not see who handed the bill in at our place—I believe it was the next day, early in the morning, some one came to me from the Union Bank.</p>

Giesser," in my presence—I took it to be sent by Mr. Rosenhain to be accepted—it was returned to the prisoner—I went to Paris with Sergeant Brett the following week on Monday evening—the bill had been produced on the Wednesday—on the following Wednesday I went before the Magistrate—when the prisoner was there I requested him to write his name on this piece of paper—he wrote the name Khiestaller</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188406230035"/>
               <p>when requested by the Judge—I afterwards asked him to write the name of Giesser—he seemed not to know how it was spelt—I wrote it on a piece of paper in pencil, and under that he wrote "E. Giesser"—to the best of my belief that signature is in the same handwriting as the E. Giesser signed in my presence by the defendant on the bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Thursday was 21st February—we pay a bill by ac<lb/>cepting it—the person who brought it was there three or four minutes while it was being accepted—it was about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the paper was immediately returned to the bearer, and he went away—we do not pay the cash unless we are asked to do so as a matter of con<lb/>venience—I was aware before I went to Paris that a person was in custody there who had possession of the notes which the Union Bank had issued—I gave this description of the man before I went to one of the managers of the Union Bank—Mr. Wyburd went to Paris with me—I am not aware that he gave a description also—we talked the matter over going—I don't recollect that we compared notes—Mr. Wyburd was the first person who said this man was Giesser in Paris—I said I did not recognise him, but he was about the same height and figure, and had an aquiline nose—he was in custody in Paris, and I knew he was under the name of Khiestaller—I did not hear the man that wrote in my presence in England speak at all—I spoke in French and English to the prisoner, he only spoke French in my presence—he did not speak Italian—I under<lb/>stand Italian a little—he said to the officials at Paris that he had left Turin, and that they could send to send to Turin and ascertain that at once—he said something to the effect that he had left Turin the night before—an account he wrote out for his advocate at Paris was taken from him—I did not read it—I do not know that in that paper he gave the name of the house and the person who had been to get the order—I did not see his passport.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Schuster, Son, and Co., of 90, Cannon Street—I was at the counter in their office on Thursday, 21st February—I saw this bill for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. presented for acceptance by the prisoner between 2 and 4 o'clock—I took it upstairs, gave it to Mr. Rosenhain for acceptance, and brought it down again—the prisoner was sitting down—I had a good look at him once or twice, and when I was looking at him the first time he turned his head towards the doorway—I went to the Mansion House Police-station for the purpose of seeing if the man accused was the man who presented the bill—I did not see his face—on 30th April I went to the House of Detention, when several persons were paraded before me—I picked out the prisoner at once—he is the man who presented the bill for acceptance at our office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My desk at Schuster's is six or seven yards from the counter, and my back would be to any one coming into the office—foreigners very often come into the office—I was standing at the counter when the prisoner brought the bill for acceptance, doing nothing par<lb/>ticularly; the person wore a hat all the time—I had no particular reason for noticing him, except that he turned his head when I looked at him—he was there for 10 minutes or more, I am sure he was there for more than three minutes—I heard the following morning that the bill had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188406230036"/>
               <p>been altered, and that the bank had paid 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 10 or 11 o'clock I gave a description to Mr. Clare of the man who brought the bill—he did not write it down, to the best of my knowledge he partly compared my description with his description—my description was a man of medium height, reddish-brown hair, beard, whiskers, rather high cheeks, rather prominent nose, wore a brown overcoat, and light brown trousers—I did not say to Mr. Goldberg at the police-court that I could not give a descrip<lb/>tion of any other person who came to that office that day—I cannot do so—I did not go to Paris—I knew the man who had the Union Bank notes in his possession was brought over as a culprit—I was standing at the police-court for half an hour—I knew the prisoner was the man brought over from Paris, I could not recognise him there—before the men were paraded before me I felt certain that I could recognise the man if I saw his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the Union Bank of London, Limited, 2, Princes Street, London—Messrs. Schuster and Co. keep an account there—on 22nd Feb., about 11.20, this bill was presented for pay<lb/>ment; the figures were for 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked for two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., six 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—when I had entered the notes in my book I found it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short, and I said "You want another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., how will you take it?"—he said he would have another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him to endorse the bill, and he wrote the last endorsement, the first one was then on it—I should say this "E. Giesser" on this paper and the "E. Giesser" I saw the prisoner sign are the same writing—the endorsement was written quickly and straight off, and that in Paris was written very slowly—I entered the numbers in a book which I have here—there were three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 24458, '9, and '60, dated 16th June, 1883; six 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, 97209, '10, '11, '12, '13, '14, dated 16th May, 1883; and one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 29196, dated 21st June, 1883—three or four minutes after the prisoner had gone away I discovered the discrepancy between the figures at the top of the bill and the amount in words—I communicated with Messrs. Schuster and found out it was a fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The person who came was in the bank three or four minutes I should think—he was a foreigner, and spoke broken English—he wrote the second signature at the back of the bill—I have not got into trouble about the bill—I did not notice the discrepancy between the words and figures—during the time the man was there I was writing down the figures in a book from the notes themselves—I entered also Schuster and Co., 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the bill; that was all made while he was there—I did not give a description of him in writing; I gave a descrip<lb/>tion, which the solicitor's clerk took down before I went to Paris—I described him as a German Jew, about half an inch shorter than myself, light brown whiskers all round, and I believe a moustache, thick brown hair parted in the middle, with a low brown hat—I did not talk over the matter with Mr. Clare going to Paris—I knew the prisoner there was in possession of these very notes—I do not understand French or German—to-day is the first time I have compared the "E. Giesser" written in Paris with that on the back of the bill—the capital "E's" are not much alike</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188406230037"/>
               <p>except in the tails, the bend is higher up in one than in the other, and one is commenced differently to the other—the tail of the "E" in the Paris writing is more like that in Mr. Clare's writing than that on the back of the bill—the tops of the "G's" are similar in the Paris writing and that on the back of the bill—I see no resemblance between the double "s"—I should not like to swear they were both written by the same person, but I should say the writing is the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I caused the police to be communicated with the same day, and a telegram to be sent over to Mr. Gil, our Paris agent, with the numbers of the notes.</p>

McHenry, money changers, at No. 8, Rue de la Paix, Paris, to inspect their clocks—while I was there the defendant came in—he said "Will you change me some bank notes; how much more must I pay for the exchange?"—Mr. McHenry said to him "You will have to receive 15 centimes over"—the prisoner showed some bank notes to Mr. McHenry—Mr. McHenry took them and looked at them, and at the same time he looked at a list that he had of some numbers of notes—Mr. McHenry said to the accused "I cannot change the notes, as they are stopped;" upon which Mr. McHenry went round to the door of the office and placed himself against it so that the prisoner could not get out—the accused asked for the notes to be returned to him—Mr. McHenry said to him "Where did you get them from?"—he replied "I have received them by post"—then Mr. McHenry said "That is no business of mine; I cannot return them, seeing that they are stopped; I must have somebody to take you to Mr. Gil"—there being nobody in the office but myself, Mr. McHenry begged me to go with the accused to Mr. Gil's—I did so—Mr. McHenry gave me two notes to give to Mr. Gil—on the way to Mr. Gil's the accused wanted to go by a certain road, which I objected to go, as it was not the straight road, and then the accused consented to go my way—when I got to Mr. Gil's I left the accused behind me a little at the door while I went in advance to speak to a clerk—before I had commenced speaking with the clerk I turned round to look at the accused; I found that the prisoner had gone—I went after him, and saw him leave the first door and go out of the house into the street—I ran after him—the accused was running—I cried out "Stop him"—some one put his hands up and the accused stopped—I was close behind him—I took hold of him by the arm and said "Is that your game?"—he said nothing—we went back to Mr. Gil's—the police were fetched afterwards—I saw the accused hand to Mr. Gil other notes, saying "I am lost; have consideration for my family."</p>

I live at 43, Carlton Road, Maida Vale, and am a rent collector—on Thursday morning, 24th April, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I saw my four-year-old pony safe in a field at the back of my house—on the 25th, Friday morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I missed it—I put its value at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I have no doubt it was worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was a clever pony—I gave 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I broke it, and taught it tricks—I had had it about a year and nine months—I next saw it on the following Tuesday, the 29th—I did not identify it at first; it had been very much altered—it had been clipped, its mane had been hogged, its tail had been docked, and its feet shod—it had no shoes on before—I have not the slightest doubt from its tricks and marks that it was my pony.</p>

I keep the Lord Hill public-house, North Wharf Road, Padding ton, and am also a cab proprietor—on Thursday, 24th April, about 10 o'clock p.m., I was coming out of my premises and saw Wilson leading a pony—he asked me if this was Miller's stable—I said "No, it is not"—he mentioned no Christian name, only Miller—I said "His stables are in Kent's Place"—he went away to see them—he came back again with the pony and said "Mr. Miller is gone away, can you tell me where he lives?"—I said "No, I don't know where he lives"—he made further inquiries and then said "Can I leave the pony here while I go to see him?"—I said "Yes, if you like"—I put the pony in the stable myself and left it there for the night—he said he wanted to sell the pony to Mr. Miller—I thought he was coming back for it, but he did not—the next morning, between 9.30 and 10 o'clock, I was in my bar—I saw Wilson with Miller there—Miller bought the pony of Wilson for ten guineas—Miller asked for a sheet of paper—I gave him this piece of paper which I took from a larger circular—there were pen and ink there—Miller wrote out the body of the receipt and read it to him, and Wilson signed it. (<hi rend="italic">Received from Mr. H. Miller the sum often guineas for a bay cob which I warrant quiet in harness.</hi>)—Wilson put the stamp on—across the stamp was written "April 25th, 1884, Henry Graves"—I did not know Wilson by any other name, he was quite a stranger; I knew Miller before—after that I saw 10 sovereigns or half-sovereigns laid on the counter by Miller and picked up by Wilson—at that time the pony had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188406230043"/>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. I have bought and sold horses and profess to be a judge of horseflesh—a Russian pony is not a very desir<lb/>able or marketable article—this was in a very rough condition—ten guineas was sample money for it, more than I should like to give for one—if I had bought a pony in that condition I should have clipped it directly and have had it shod, you could not work it without—the police green-yard is held at my place—Wilson asked to be allowed to leave the pony at my place—I saw nothing suspicious about it, or I should not have allowed him to do so, I should have given him in charge there and then—the police have access day and night to these stables, which adjoin the green-yard—if a man came bringing a pony asking me to buy it, and I liked it, I should have done so—he said he had got a grey horse about 15.1 or 2 which would make a good cab horse and he would bring it for me to look at—I took him to be a dealer, and might have had a deal with him if he had brought it—I know Miller as a man who buys and sells ponies; the utmost I would give for it was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were other persons in the house when the purchase took place, I can't say whether in the same compartment or not—they were not talking low or whisper<lb/>ing, anybody in the house could hear; it is not a very large house, I heard some part of it myself while I was serving other customers—I could give the police Miller's address if there was anything felonious in his conduct—the police use my house when off duty, they could have come in and heard any conversation going on—there was no secrecy or any<lb/>thing of that kind—I did not hear Miller send to his wife for cash—Miller's conduct appeared to be fair and open, there was nothing in his conduct to make me consider it was a stolen horse—Miller was using the pony in the public street openly, living quite close to the police-station—it was after the pony was clipped.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, carrying on business at Kent Place, North Wharf Road—I was present when Crane came round to the stable and I told them Miller would be home in the evening, and then they could see the pony—I made a communication to Miller in the mean<lb/>time, and was present when Crane and Jones came round in the evening, and heard what passed—I keep 30 horses—I should say the value of a pony like that in a rough state was eight or nine guineas.</p>

May came himself, and was very angry that he had not got his goods—in the end the goods were delivered by Pickford—on the 8th of May amongst other orders I received one from Owen Brothers, 2, Caroline Terrace, St. Ann's Road, Stamford Hill, to the value of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the good were supplied—I afterwards received this order, dated 9th May, pur<lb/>porting to come from R.

                  </hi>. I am an importer of margerine butter—I advertised for a traveller; Johnson applied; I engaged him—he brought several orders, the first amount was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from May—he said the usual trade credit was one month—I said I would not object to that if the persons were quite good—he said he would only introduce good people—I agreed to give him a penny in the pound of butter—I afterwards sent to May five cases, amounting to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got a further order in writing for 10 more boxes—before executing that I went to May and asked to be paid for the five boxes—he said he always had credit for a month, and he wanted the same from me, and he would pay it all right—I asked him to give me references—he said "References are no good, any one can give a reference; I will pay you all right after a month"—after that I supplied him with five boxes—that made 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. owing—on 19th May I got this letter enclosing a cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Cripplegate Bank—I have lost that cheque; I believed it to be a good one, and paid it in to my bankers—it was returned to me marked "Refer to drawer"—I told Johnson about it—he told me to go and see the manager of the bank, and ask him how much money stood to the credit of May, and if there was not enough to meet it to take it up and pay the difference—Johnson said he had done it before and got the money—I went with the cheque to the bank, and they would give me no information—I saw May after that at his place in Ridley Road, Dalston—Johnson was living there—I told May I was very much surprised that the cheque had been returned—he said "I was afraid it would not be paid"—I asked him to give me the amount or give me another cheque—he promised he would send me another cheque, a good one, the next day—at the end of the week I went down again, and the shop was closed and May had gone—on 30th May I addressed a letter to Johnson at the same place—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a press copy of it—he had then removed to Kynaston Road—I never got any answer to that letter—on 1st May Johnson sent me an order for Wenman, of Man<lb/>chester Area, Stratford, for five cases—I delivered the five cases to Wenman, of the value of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I called there five or six times—I did not see Wenman there, I saw his wife—on 12th June I got an acceptance</p>

               <p>payable in seven days—I have lost it—I presented it when due—I did not get the money, Wenman was not in—I afterwards went there and he had gone—Johnson gave me an order to send one case to a man called Tibbs, of 49, John Street, Liverpool Road, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was paid for—the next order was for two cases at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were paid for—the next order was five cases, and another for seven, amounting to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was never paid—the last delivery was on 15th May—I went to John Street and saw Tibbs—I asked for my money, but never got it—I am told that Tibbs has been convicted—Johnson sent me an order to supply margerine to R. Porter, of 32, Tabard Street, Borough, amounting to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went there, it was a small shop—I saw Porter—I told him my terms were cash—he said Johnson had agreed with him to pay every fortnight—he did not pay anything—I was selling the mar<lb/>gerine at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and Porter was marking it in his shop at half the price—before that I sold him five cases at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got these two orders from Johnson, for H. Hart, 1 and 2, Haydon Road, Wimbledon, for one box at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and another—I did not part with those goods, I was suspicious that Johnson was sending me orders from bad customers—I wrote this letter asking for cash—that letter was returned with this written on the back: "30th May, 1883,—If the box of margerine suits my trade then I will give you reference or cash; I will send on cash for the one received. S. Hart."—I was suspicious and did not send the box—on 4th May, 1883, I got this order from Johnson for a supply of five boxes of rolls at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to G. Homden, of 36, Cambridge Villas, Devonshire Road—I wrote to Homden on 12th May and got this reply of 1st June asking to be supplied with one box—soon after that I went to that address; it was a very small shop, it was closed—I don't remember whether there was any name over the door, at any rate his name was not—I could not find Homden—I spoke to Johnson about it and told him I did not like the look of it—he told me not to execute the order, he had heard something about Homden, and I had better not execute the order—I had orders from Johnson for other places—I went and saw them and did not like the look of them—among them was two orders of 10th May from W. Farrington—I supplied those—I went there—he had a nice shop—I saw him and told him I came for the money—he said "You are just a few minutes too late; my boy has just gone to the bank for the money, there he is sitting on the tram," which was just passing by—he asked me to send three more cases and he would pay me for the lot together—I did send three more cases—that made 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—the cases were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I went again and saw him—I told him I wanted my money for the four boxes—he said he would return me one box and pay me for the others—he said one box was not broken yet and was downstairs in the basement—he never sent the box back, and never sent any money—I do not know what became of Farrington—I did not know anything of him at the time I allowed him to get the goods—I did not know that he had been connected with Hiscock—I did not know that he had been at this Court—I got an order from John<lb/>son on the 3rd May for Mr. T. Corby, of Drury Lane, for five cases of fish rails, at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent him goods which came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him in cash on the 12th June—I had to go several times before he paid me—he said that Johnson allowed him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Johnson's first order was on 23rd April, and the last on the 10th or 12th of May—the</p>

I am very much engaged for the next few days, so cannot make an appointment. You know where to find the customers as well as I do"—I wanted to find out from him where the customers had gone—I wrote again after receiving that card, but got no reply—I went to 18, Kynaston Road—I did not find Johnson there, a servant came to the door and said he had gone out—I did not see him again—I have got none of the 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Johnson sent me orders for 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, which I did not execute.</p>

May, one box; Tibbs, one box; Emery, one box; Shirley, one box; Davis, one box; they all paid—I supplied Kirby with five boxes, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay you any commission on his account—I took the bill of Wenman on the 12th June, payable in seven days—I wrote you this letter of 19th June, stating that Wenman had paid for ten cases, making an appointment to meet me in Broad street; that was only a hoax to catch you—I am not one of the firm of Zeeley and Co., I am acting for Zeeley on commission—he gave me an order for May, but I did not execute it—you introduced thirteen customers, nine of whom paid me small amounts, one paid in full.</p>

Barnes," and on the same day I got this order purporting to be from Wells referring to the tables to be sent afterwards, and we delivered them—he had fetched the other three then—I got this receipt from Wells—the bill was returned accepted—it would be due on 27th Decemberr—I paid it away—it was returned unpaid—some one called from him for two more tables, which I never delivered—I don't think I saw Wells again—I next saw the tablet at Mr. Robertson's, a pawnbroker in the Blackfriars Road.</p>

Robinson, 3, Scarsdale Road, East Dulwich," and the references "Philip Barnes, 5, Lidoot Terrace,; and Mr. Wells, builder, Red Lion Yard, Holborn"—I caused those persons to be written to.

On the faith of those I let Robinson the premises, and he signed this agreement—he took possession the first week in Sept., some furniture afterwards went in—no name was put over the door—the shop was opened, but they did not do any business—the Christmas rent was not paid; I put in a distress—the new furniture that had been put in was taken away the day before the distress—the property I found there was only worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—there were some cases, barrels, and tubs, all empty.</p>

I know nothing of the acceptance." Eden did call on me a day or two afterwards, and I showed him the acceptance; he said he had never signed it, or authorised it; he had never seen it before, and knew nothing of it—I told him to sit down and write his signature, and he wrote these two signatures in my presence—I endeavoured to see Robinson—I wrote to him two or three times, telling him what Eden had said, and telling him to call at once—he came with the witness Bacon, and in Bacon's presence I told Robinson what had taken place at the interview with Eden, when he declared that the signature was a forgery—Robin eon said it was Eden's signature, and that the bill was his—I forget whether he said that he saw Eden sign it, but he said it was Eden's signature—I asked him how he would pay the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the fixtures—he said he would pay me on Monday. (<hi rend="italic">This was on Friday or Saturday.</hi>)—I got no money—I signed judgment and issued execution—Elizabeth Smith claimed everything at Waltham cross under an agreement—I took out an interpleader summons, and her claim was barred, and the goods were subsequently sold by the Sheriff—the stock, fittings, and everything were sold for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the Sheriff handed the key to me the day after—there was no rent actually due-till 25th March, and the sale took place before that; in consequence of Eden's repudiation of the signature I sued both Eden and Robinson, acceptor and drawer—I did not succeed in serving Eden till he got to the police-court.</p>

               <p>about the tins of cream being stale—he said he thought they would keep a week—he said he had ordered the fixtures for the shop, but they had not been sent, and that was the reason of business not going on—I called two or three times afterwards, but was not able to get the money—the last time I called I was told he had left—about the first week in November I called at 5, Railway Street, Barnes, and saw Eden—I told him I was the son-in-law of Mr. Milman at Ilfracombe, and that I had called for the account—he said he had a certain day for settling his accounts—I called five or six times—I cannot say whether I saw him again; I believe I did, and I fancy he said that he would forward the amount to Mr. Milman as soon as possible—on the 27th I called in the Holloway Road and asked for Mr. Wenman—a woman answered the door, and I gave her a message—while I was speaking to her Wenman came out—he was very angry because I made a mistake; I thought he owed my father-in-law more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I was confusing him with some of the other men—he blew me up and was going to punch my coachman's head—when I found it was only a small amount I apologised to him, and he forwarded the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't think the shutters of the shop were down; the door was open.</p>

               <p>and the goods were delivered on 5th March—that has not been paid—I applied for it, and took out a summons against him, but he left before the summons was served—an order was given from Wenman on 28th February of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the goods were supplied, no money was received—I called there several times, but never saw him; he always seemed to be in the country—on 9th March I supplied to Farrington 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; to Bobinson, 3, Scarsdale Terrace, on March 13th, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and to F.

Robinson from different parts of the country asking for money and threatening proceedings; also a list of cheesemongers' shops to be let in London; Rudelhoofs card, the firm for which Davis was travelling, Haydon's and Browne's address, were all found on White<lb/>Bacon was arrested but released—on 2nd February I went to 12, Market Place, Stamford Hill, where I found Johnson bidding his wife good-bye—I found on him some clean cuffs and collars and a bag—I told him the charge, he made no reply—I found Stubbins, one of the defendants not in custody, at the shop—in the parlour I found a book, the writing in which I have compared with some of the orders to Milman, of Ifracombe; it is the same, there is no doubt about it—I also found about twenty empty tea-cheats, one of them containing tea, five of them were numbered consecutively—on the counter, where every<lb/>body could see them, was a ledger, cash-book, and day-book; there was nothing in them—there was very little stock in the shop—I found no Khoosh bitters—on 26th February I went to Birmingham with Helson, and there found Davis and Reed in charge—Reed is no longer a defendant—I told Davis the charge, and mentioned the other persons in custody—we went to a lodging-house, where Davis said he had been lodging in the name of James—at his request I took him to the post-office, where he claimed a letter which contained an order for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a note signed H. May—on 30th April, after the remand, Reed's wife gave me two letters, which I have compared, and have no doubt are in Wells's writing. (<hi rend="italic">In this he stated that he hoped to he liberated, and could send letters through Owen; that he did not know the man who came from Young, who told him the things had been received at Wackara's; he inquired whether the police knew he had them, and about the refrigerator, though he did not believe they had anything to do with his case; he said that Wackard, if he came to Court, could do him either harm or good as he thought fit; that he wanted the dates when he went to and left Glo'ster Street, Lewisham, and Red Lion Row, Southampton Row, and Newgate Street, as during those dates nothing could be brought against him</hi>)—on the top is written "Barnes and Price are much wanted." (<hi rend="italic">The other letter, dated April 22nd, asked him to get Davis and Vulliamy, of Newgate Street, to produce a letter saying they never gave a reference, and stated that he wanted to make out on his trial that he had used the yard and stable at Red Lion Yard, and that the landlord there knew him as a builder and contractor, and that he did not stop there much; that Robinson really had nothing to do with him, and that he only gave him references for his shop; that the prose<lb/>cution Wanted to lead the Jury to believe he was not a builder in a position to give reference, but that he should produce sufficient to lead them to a different line of thought</hi>)—one address is Mrs. Westaby, and the other Cowdry, 4, Brunswick street—at Johnson's shop I took possession, of a</p>

Reed was arrested with Davis on 26th February, and was before the Magistrate six or seven times, and then was dismissed on the last remand, about April or May, in consequence of statements he made, and which I took down and sent to the Treasury, and he was made a witness—White's hand was nearly out of his pocket when I seized it—I had to pull it pretty hard to get them out—I did not notice his handkerchief in the pocket—it was a small compartment they were in; no one else was there in connection with this case—both I and Helson went up to them in the corner—it would not have been impossible for him to get rid of the papers, he was leaning over the counter with the papers over it like that—he had not just drunk some beer and put his hand into his pocket for a handkerchief—I don't know that White wrote all the letters at Robinson's dictation—I do not think they were in answer to <hi rend="italic">Exchange and Mart advertisements</hi>—Summers searched White's house.</p>

W. Johnson, grocer." on the back; and on the front "Agent for W. and A. Gilbey, wine merchants"—I did not inquire of W. and A Gilbey—I don't suppose I should keep a heavy stock in a shop in a neighbourhood of that kind; there was very little—I don't remember your asking Helson at the police-court if you had ever been charged before and his answering "No"—I will swear I did not get up and say "Yes;" I said I believed you had previously been in custody for some<lb/>thing—that had nothing to do with getting the various remands—I never spoke to you about what you were going to do about giving information—I did not say "Who is Dick White? No, I mean May."</p>

I have done no wrong"—on 21st February I took Waters at his shop, 57, Kender Street, New Cross—I told him I should arrest him on a warrant charging him with conspiracy with Robinson, Hiscock, and others to defraud—he said, "I know Hiscock, I don't know the others; I have had tea through Hiscock, and have not paid for it"—I said, "You have some Khoosh bitters here?"—he said, "Yes, Hiscock was very pressing with them, but I told him I should never sell them here, but then Hiscock said, 'You might do me a turn, I can do with the commission,' and I then allowed him to sold them in"—there were three cases in the shop; he said, "It is of no use to me, I wrote to the company yesterday to take them back"—Mrs. Waters said in his presence, "You have not sold a bottle, but have given a bottle or two away"—it was a small chandler's shop in a poor neighbourhood—there were no account books there; I found a number of papers—on 25th February I took Owen in a street at the corner of London Wall—I told him he would be charged with conspiring with Robinson and others in custody to defraud—he said, "I have not conspired with anybody, I have given Robinson a reference, I thought he was doing well, I don't attach any importance to this, I can clear myself"—I afterwards went to his shop at Keswick Terrace, Garratt Lane, Tooting—there were some papers, and Khoosh bitters in the window there; I found some accounts and invoices of Freeman, of Battersea—I next went with Glass to Birmingham, when Davis and Reed were taken—I took May on 17th March at 7, Monier Road, Victoria Park—when he saw me he concealed himself in his shop, which was shut up and dark—I told him he would be charged with being concerned with others in defrauding by conspiracy—he said, "I don't see how I am brought into this, I have looked around this case well, and I don't see how I am implicated, and I don't see why you should take me after all this time; this is all through trying to do other people good; I never gave a reference or made any false pretences; you have got a lot of them, haven't you?"—I said, "Yes, you don't appear to have obtained the Khoosh bitters in your own name?"—he said, "Yes, I did, Freddy Hiscock knew my name"—I said, "They are booked to you in the name of Sparks"—he said, "Oh, that was a lodger of mine, I had mine at the</p>

I am a master cooper—I buy casks from wine merchants and grocers—I can tell you of grocers who buy hogsheads or puncheons of gin at a time, Bone and Garter, of Chertsey, they are grocers and wine merchants; they have a licence to sell spirits—I keep books; I do not enter my purchases; I enter some of my sales, not all, because I give credit—I don't enter ready-money sales—I never dealt with the prisoner before in empty casks—I called in at the George and I called at the Alfred, which was a public-house at that time and the prisoner kept it, that is where I sold him the cask—I took it there—that is in Brushfield Street, Spitalfields—I do not know Fanshaw Street, Hoxton—Spitalfields and Hoxton are nearly half a mile apart; it would not take long to drive if you can get along—they are on a different side of the water to Rotherhithe—the Alfred looked as if there was a good business going on, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner was standing at the door—I should not be very much surprised to hear that the Alfred was burnt out in October because I heard of it—the hoarding was round it when I took the cask and people were at work—I do not know that the George was also burnt down, or the Boot; I never heard of the Boot—there were marks on the top of the cask I sold; I did not notice what they were—it wanted repairing—I am not prepared to swear that the cask outside is the one I sold—I sold it twelve or fourteen days before Christmas—we do not make memoranda of those small items; anything large we should book.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 2nd May, about 1.30 p.m., I was in High Street, Borough, and saw John Ellis standing outside a pawnbroker's shop with a parcel under his arm—Mary Ellis came out; he joined her, and she handed him something and went to the corner of the street, stopped for a minute or two, and went into the Austrian Groom—I called a constable to the door and said to Ellis "What have you in that parcel?"—he said "What I have bought this morning; you can see"—he went quickly to a room at the back and undid them—Mary Ellis came up and said "I have had them in my box these three months"—I took them both to the station, and on the way John Ellis said "How dare you interfere with respectable people?"—I said "I know you"—Mary Ellis said "Sergeant Waldock knows me; I have known him from a child"—he gave his name Ellis at the station, but refused his address; she refused both name and address—the inspector asked him how he became possessed of the tablecloths; he said that he bought them at Debenham and Storr's, Covent Garden Market—I called his attention to the pencil marks, and the woman said "I know what they are, I put</p>

               <p>them on myself"—I received a parcel wrapped in paper from John Simpson—it contained two other tablecloths, which have been identified—this is the paper, it is marked "Parcels Post, Gibraltar Street, Sheffield, May 1"—the postmark is May 3—on 13th May I went to Sheffield, showed the tablecloths to Mr. Sheffield, and he identified them and called Spicer in—I said to Spicer while the parcel lay on the table "Do you know a man named Roberts?"—he said "Yes, I knew him when I was in Lon<lb/>don"—a policeman present said "Do you know anything about the writing on that?"—Spicer picked it up and said "Yes, that is my writing"—I told him I should take him in custody for stealing four tablecloths and other articles, the property of Mr. Crossley, his employer—he said "I know nothing about it; it may be in my writing, you will have to prove that, I am not supposed to tell you anything"—I went to Daniel's Hotel, Sheffield, where Spicer lodged, and the prosecutor found a parcel containing two pieces of sheeting, his property—I searched his box, and found an iron chisel or <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, 16 inches long, one end sharp and the other blunt—on 2nd May I went to Prince's Road, Lambeth, with Sergeant Gray, having found out that the Ellises lived there—I searched the room, and found 34 pawn-tickets, some blank bill-heads of J. Roberts, general draper, 39, Shepherd Street, Sheffield, a draper's order-book, a memorial card to a child of Mary Spicer, a needle-case with the name John Welch, 37 to 58, High Street, but the name of the town is rubbed out—I saw this pocket-book found in the pocket of a coat which was hanging on the wall in Ellis's room—there is writing in it—I showed the bill-heads to Ellis—Mary Ellis said "I have never been in Sheffield in my life"—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. while he was in custody, and he signed this receipt "J. Ellis."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the prosecutrix, Caroline Betts, who has been some years a widow—she is a harness maker, of 62, Bow Road East—I have kept the books for some time—I keep a day-book and ledger—in January, 1883, the prisoner was taken into my mother's service as traveller and manager—he had a pony-cart in which he took out goods; Fricker drove it—the prisoner used to come and say what orders he had taken during the day, and they were put in hand, and when they went out of the shop I entered them under the name of the customer which he gave me—I posted from the day-book to the ledger in due course—the prisoner said that he had got an order from Mr. Clague for three sets of harness—he took out four dozen nose<lb/>bags, and brought some of them back, but he left some at Clague's at Millwall—they were not made for Clague; they were made while we were alack—I entered them in the day-book to Clague—this is the entry: "Three dozen Betts's nosebags at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner ran out the price wrong, and I had to alter it to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he always brought his orders verbally, he never entered them in an order-book—he came home and said that he had got three sets of thill harness; that is large cart harness—he said that the initial "C" was to be engraved on the brass, which was done, and they were out on January 1, 1884—they were delivered to the prisoner—this is my entry: "Clague, three sets of thill harness at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I derived the price to charge, from the prisoner—he said in March that he had got an order for three sets of thill, harness from Mr. Patten, of Finsbury Pavement—that was made and delivered to the prisoner—the entry is my writing, and the figures are the prisoner's. "Three sets of thill harness complete at 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a set," and the "22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is the prisoner's writing—I have never received any money for those three orders; they stand debited against the respective persons in the ledger—the prisoner has never accounted to me for the harness or for the value of it—before January, 1884, I entered cash received in a diary, but since that I have kept a cash-book—this is the prisoner's agreement: "Arranged that the salary to Mr. Cousins be 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, and in addition a per<lb/>centage of 5 per cent, be paid on the net profit made over and above the average of the last three years. N. E. Ottaway, R.F. Pelf. March, 1883. Signed, Arthur Cousins"—the "Arthur Cousins" is the prisoner's writing—Mr. Ottaway and Mr. Pelf are trustees under my father's will—my mother paid the prisoner's wages generally, and he asked at the end of the week for what expenses he had incurred, and was paid—I know Mr. Hyams by his coming to ask for orders in January, 1883—he had some orders for collars until we started the collar work our<lb/>selves, and we paid him for them several cheques—I never sold him any goods to my knowledge, except a few, which are entered, amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We were not in difficulties from December, 1883, to April or May, 1884, but the prisoner backed a bill for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for us, and another lor 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not request him to do it, I don't know whether my mother did, it was the executors—it was for the debts of the business—I still say that we were not in difficulties—creditors were not pressing us when he signed the bill for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they have from Christmas last—he backed several other bills—he was very friendly with me in a gentlemanly manner—I have been out with him on business in his trap,</p>

               <p>and also on Sundays with other people—I have not been to any theatres with him—my mother has been out with him in his trap—he was on very friendly terms with our family—before December he was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods which he received, but he has not brought the money home—here is "November, 1883, one set of harness, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," he has never brought that money home—he has not been since December in the habit of taking out goods in his trap to sell them and raise money when we wanted ready money, and bringing the money back—we sometimes took 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day over the counter—he has paid money into the bank on three occasions, and when he gave me money I paid it in—on 2nd February I paid 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into the bank, and on 5th March bills 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was one of the bills which he had backed—800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into the bank in January—that purports to be all the cash I received—I have collected money myself, and cheques came by post as well as what the prisoner collected—this book should not agree with the bank book because the cash which was taken daily over the counter would go into the pass-book—we have taken 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a day over the counter, and sometimes not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three days—I have not got the book here in which it is entered—he has lent me money amounting to 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think; it is in black and white—he was paid his expenses—the horse and trap were his own—he did not use it every day for the business—as a rule he took out goods every day in the trap, for which he received 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sometimes 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he issued a writ against my mother—I don't know the date, but it was not before his defalcations were found out—he was taken up on 31st May—the writ is entered here May 24th, I don't know when he issued it—he has a wife and three children—I did not know that he took goods to Mr. Hyams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This is the writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was issued after we found out his defalcations—I knew of his accepting bills for my mother—he has never paid them—here is an entry, "1884, May 24, Commission on 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 5 per cent., as per agreement, 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is no agreement in existence entitling him to receive that—I have not seen or heard of any agreement except the one produced—we have never made 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. Chandler has examined the books—this bill for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due last month; he has not paid it—there is no truth in any part of the claim as. to the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or as to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I can tell by looking at my book whether orders were given to clay and Pattens before December—this is my cash book—these amounts would be banked on February 2nd—Gibbs is the only customer he had anything to do with, the others are old standard customers—whatever we take over the counter appears in this book—from February 1st, 1884, to the time he left in May the receipts over the counter might be 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for we were very slack—the business was established in 1708.</p>

I live at 33, Lower Andrew Street, Silvertown, in the same house as the prisoner—I lived on the top floor, there is only one floor—the prisoner lived underneath—about 10 minutes past 7 o'clock on the morning of 27th May I was in bed—I heard a row in the passage downstairs—I heard the prisoner say "I will do it, I will do it"—I then heard the front door open—I heard Mrs. Hills say "Don't go into the street again"—after that I heard nothing more for half an hour, I</p>

               <p>then heard a scream of "Murder" out in the street; I don't know who it was that screamed, it woke me up a second time—I got up, looked out of window, and saw the prisoner dashing his wife's head on the pavement—she was lying on her back, and he was kneeling across her body—he had hold of her by the head and was dashing her head on the asphalt pavement—I saw him do so three or four times—I ran back to put on my clothes and then saw Rose bringing the prisoner across into the house—Rose was dragging him across the road as well as he could—the prisoner was struggling—I helped Rose when he got him into the house, and we got him into his room and held him on the bed till the police came—I had known the prisoner about two years—I never saw him the worse for drink—I have always known him to be a kind man to his wife and very quiet, no quarrel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Adam Dye, and live at 4, Lower Andrew Street, Silverfown—on 27th May, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing, I heard cries of "Murder" from a woman two or three times—I got up, opened my window and looked out, and I saw the prisoner across his wife, knocking her head on the ground, near the door of Mrs. Buckingham's house—the deceased had her feet towards the kerb—in the excitement of the moment I could not say how many times I saw him knock her head, it might be three or four times—I called out "Murder" and "Police"—I saw Carter come out of the house—he ran across the road and said to the prisoner "Don't kill the woman"—he said "Yes, you old b——, I will kill you, or you will kill me"—Carter then ran into his house, and the prisoner ran after him—the woman was still lying on the pavement—the prisoner came back to her from Carter's house and said "You old b——, are you not dead yet?" and he did the same as he had been doing before—he knocked her head on the ground and began thumping her—I continually called "Murder" and "Police"—Rose came out of his house and ran up to where the prisoner and his wife were—he caught the prisoner by the collar of his shirt and dragged him off his wife—I got up and went out into the street and found Mrs. Hills lying senseless on the pavement—I bathed her head—the prisoner was out in the street in nothing but his shirt—her head was bleeding very much—she was insensible and moaning—she had on a dark petti<lb/>coat, and a brown and white jacket, stockings, but no boots—she was taken into her house, and Dr. Holton was sent for—I had known them three years; they had been very quiet people indeed—he was a very good husband—for the past fortnight or so she had taken to drink freely, before that she had been a very quiet woman—she was addicted to taking a little now and again, but not in the way she did for the last fortnight—the prisoner had been out of work for some time.</p>

I could hardly do it because I had had no food, I was so weak"—I took him to the station with assistance—the woman was unconscious—in the morning he was charged with attempting to murder his wife—he made no reply—I went to the London Hospital on the moraine of the 28th and found that the woman had died there at half-past 12 that night, never having recovered con<lb/>sciousness.</p>

I live at 17, Barnes Terrace, Deptford, and am an iron plate worker—on 13th June, between 9.30 and 10,1 was in a public-house in New Cross Road, the prisoners came in and we began talking, and Simpson said "You don't belong to about this part"—I said "No, I come from Wolverhampton"—we drank together, I paid; we then went to another public-house, where we drank, and I paid; we stopped till turning out time, 12.30; then they took me down a little street, and turned up another street, which led into a yard or stable—I wanted to get out, Simpson knocked me on my mouth, knocked me down and kicked me on my forehead, and as I was trying to get up he kicked me in my eye and made the blood spurt out and turned it black—before he kicked me I said "Let me get up"—Simpson said "Now then," and they both fell on me and held me down while Leighton took the money out of my pocket—there was about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse and some coppers, it might be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in the other pocket—I struggled while on the ground, but they held me, I could not struggle much; after they got my money, they gave me a kick and ran away—I lay on the ground I don't know how long, and then went down the yard into the street—while trying to find my road home I met a policeman; I spoke to him; he took me to the bottom of the street, where we met another policeman, 361, and they took me to Simpson's brother's house—they brought him outside, and asked me if he was one of them—I said "No"—they then took me to the prisoner Simpson's, and I recognised him as the man—I charged him—when they were going to take him he said "Don't have me took, I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now, and I have a job to go to in the morning, and if you go I will give you a share of the money'—I never had seen the men before, and was never in either of the public-houses before—I could not get out at the end of the street they led me into—I was in their company altogether about two and a half hours—I was sober when I met them—when I left them I was not drunk nor sober, I knew what I was doing—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife; we have been married 10 years—I used to live with him at 5, Bowering Road, Cam<lb/>berwell—prior to 25th May he spoke several times about his going to America; he said he thought of going to New York, and that a wife in England was not a wife there—I told him he would be found—I did not know at that time that he was keeping company with anybody else in particular—he was in the habit of coming home late at night—on Sunday morning, 25th May, he got up before me between 7 and 8 o'clock—he afterwards came up again; I was then dressing; he said I need not have got up—he went back again to the kitchen—I finished dressing and went downstairs about five or ten minutes afterwards—I don't know what he was doing then—I went back to my bedroom and then went down a second time—there was a jug of coffee on the table, and he was stirring it—he said, "Shall we have breakfast?"—I said "Yes"—I then cut the bread and butter—he said, "Your coffee will get cold"—he tipped it from the cup to the jug—he drank a cup of coffee, but I could not say for certain where that came from; there was more coffee in the saucepan—he went on drinking his own coffee—he noticed that I had not drunk mine, and he put it back into the cup again and stood it on the table—I noticed a strange smell from it and said to him, "What a strange smell there is"—he remarked that it was from the water from the fish-globe, which he had emptied that morning and broken it in the sink, and the stones had fallen through—I knew it was not a smell like that—he smelt what was in my cup, and said it was all right—I said I would taste it; I did taste it; it was so horrible that I could not swallow it; I spat it out and rinsed my mouth out with cold water—he laughed at me and said I should put the fire out—I said I should not give the children any—I smelt what was in the saucepan, and he did so also; that did not smell like what was in my cup—he tipped what was in my cup back into the jug, and when he did there was a blue smoke came from the bottom of the cup—I said, "Oh, George, just look, if a cup of coffee was ever so hot it would never retain any heat to cause a smoke like that"—I did not until then really suspect anything—after that he said, "Well, if there is anything wrong with the coffee we had better throw the lot away"—I said, "No, leave it till it gets cold, and I will see if it smells then"—I put the jug on the dresser, and he took both the jug and the saucepan in his hand—I said, "Leave it, George, I will have it analysed," and then he threw the contents down the sink—the gravel stones from the fish-globe were in the sink; I wanted them taken out of the sink, and he removed them into the ash-bin—I afterwards took some of those stones and gave Mrs. Biscomb a portion of them; she gave them back to me, and I gave them to Dr. Oldfield—on Wednesday morning, 4th June, my husband got up first, before 7 o'clock—I did not get up till about an hour after he had gone to business—I cut his bread-and-butter while I was in bed—he brought me up a cup of coffee and went down to his own breakfast—I noticed that my coffee smelt strangely, smoking—I never intended to drink any more that he brought me, I did not taste it—it remained on the dressing-table till I got up; I then took it into the kitchen and put a portion of it into a bottle—I found a white jug of</p>

               <p>coffee on the kitchen table where my husband had been haying his breakfast; I smelt it, it did not smell like what I had in my cup, and I put some of it into another bottle (No. 2), and subsequently gave both bottles to Dr. Oldfield; the one that had my coffee in was the largest—my husband came home about half-past 10 on the night of 4th June—I asked him to send for some ginger brandy for me—he knew I had not been well all the week—nothing was said about the coffee then—on the Sunday, 25th May, I asked him why he put the stuff into my coffee in the morning, and he said he put nothing in—I said, "There must have been something in it, or else it would not have been so nasty"—he said whatever was in it he had had his share—I said no, he could not have done, for what was in my cup nobody could drink—on Friday morning, 6th June, I was in bed, and he brought me up some coffee then—I put some of it into a bottle; there was no smell to it, but I kept it and gave it to Dr. Oldfield with a cork which my little boy found in the kitchen on the morning of 4th June.</p>

               <p>but it might be minutely divided, and pouring it over stones the water would dry off and leave the phosphorus there—I did not separate the stones, I packed them up again and sealed them—supposing phosphorus put into a cup of coffee and the coffee then emptied, the major part of the phosphorus would be left behind in the cup; there would be a luminous appearance and also smoke would issue from the cup, because it would be warmed with the coffee; it might possibly catch fire—phos<lb/>phorus taken internally is a poison—the smallest dose that has been known to cause death is one grain; one or two grains would be dangerous and might cause death—there is a taste peculiar to phosphorus, some<lb/>what resembling sulphur, but only to a slight degree—it would cause great irritation soon after swallowing and great pain—I cannot tell what the taste in the mouth would be before swallowing—I examined the two bottles; they both appeared to contain coffee—the larger bottle smelt of carbolic acid—I took a portion out and tested it; there was about half a pint or rather less—I found that it did contain carbolic acid—I did not analyse the quantity—there was no trace of any poison in the other bottle—carbolic acid taken internally is poisonous—it is un<lb/>certain how many grains would cause death, but eight or ten would certainly be fatal—it would depend much on the condition of the patient whether three grains would be dangerous to life—if mixed with coffee the greater portion of it would sink to the bottom; the coffee would only take up a small part of it if simply poured in or stirred a little—there would be a deposit at the bottom—if the acid was perfectly pure the deposit would be white, and of an oily substance; a part of it would waste at once, but a great part would be suspended—phosphorus is not soluble in water—I examined the cork; it smelt strongly of carbolic acid—eight or ten grains of carbolic acid would be about twelve drops or rather less—there would be a peculiar smell from it, somewhat resembling tar; there would not be a smoky smell with it; there would with phosphorus—I received another bottle next day, that contained coffee only—I sealed up the three bottles and the stones and handed them to Inspector Hunt on 11th June.</p>
