            . I am an officer. On the 27th of July I apprehended the prisoner at the Belvidere; she was servant there. The waiter shewed me the room where she slept. I took the prisoner and Mrs. Linfitt into her room. There was only one bed in the room; the prisoner said it was her room. Between the bed and the sacking I found a pair of blankets; they were claimed by Mr. Linfitt. I found a silk handkerchief and a cambric dress; they were in the room, but I cannot now say whether they were found in the box or on the bed, because the prisoner attempted to throw herself out of the window. I prevented her. It was the upper room, the four pair, I believe. I searched the room again the next day; the prosecutrix was there; I found several articles that she claimed. On Wednesday the 28th, I received the pocket-book of the prosecutor at the Bell inn, Noble-street, and one silver spoon. I went with the prosecutrix on Saturday, the 31st, I received this pair of sheets of Mr. Blunt at the office. The pawnbroker has the spoon; they are here.</p>

From Mr. Price, the landlord of the Prince Regent; the hat was there, and there was blood just inside of the lining, it corresponded with the cut upon his head; there is a break in the hat; the break seems to have been hit with the thick part of the hammer, and the cut with the sharp part; it was coloured with some blood, and there was some white upon the hat.</p>

             - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he and you been intimate before this unhappy transaction - A. Five weeks either the Wednesday before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring any money with you from Ireland - A. Yes. I got my money by selling a little place, and he got his by his work and labour. I had but seven pound when I came into London, and he had six one-pound notes and a five pound note, two guineas in gold, and sixteen shillings in silver. I am speaking now of what money he had when he was killed. He gave me before that a two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to lodge when you first came into London - A. We came out of the waggon into the street; Leary's wife was in the street; she asked me if I was from Ireland. I had never seen Leary or his wife before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go, in consequence of your forming an acquaintance with them, to their place - A. I asked her where I could find a lodging for the children, as I was so much a stranger here. She said, as you are so much in distress I will invite you to my own bed. No more passed. I went along with her, and I lodged there four nights.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clifford go there to live with you - You once stated that Clifford was your husband - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not true - A. He behaved to me as a husband. I lived with him as his wife. My real name is Burke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to live after the four nights - A. She charged me half-a-crown a night for the four nights. I met Slattery; I told him that I was paying so much; he said it was too dear; there was a room to be let in Church-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. And Slattery engaged to lodge with you - A. Yes, as soon as I got a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mrs. Singleton's, was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And to that room you moved from Mr. Leary's - A. Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary after you got to your apartment come to visit you - A. No, not till the Saturday before this unhappy transaction; he came about eleven o'clock into my room on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Leary or his wife any means of knowing whether you or your husband had money before Saturday - A. She knew that I had money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary know that your husband had money - A. No, not till I told him; that was on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Leary when you told him that - A. On the Saturday night when he came to me, and it was late. I asked him what made him come out at that late hour of night; he said that he had come to let Clifford know that he had work for him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Leary on the Sunday - A. Clifford went on the Sunday morning to look after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had told Clifford what Leary had told you, had you - A. Yes. I could not find my way to Leary's room; I begged Slattery to shew me. Clifford had told me that he should go. Slattery went to Leary's room. It was half after seven when I went out of my own home. When I came to Leary's place, I found no one but Leary's wife. I asked her where Clifford was; she said he was out. While I was there Leary returned; I asked him where Clifford was; Leary said he will be here in a few minutes, and when he came I asked him if it was not time to go home; he told me as soon as he could buy a hat he would go home: he went out to buy the hat; I went along with him. Slattery and Leary and his wife were left in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person's name that you bought the hat of, Mr. Barnet - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you when Clifford bought the hat but Clifford - A. No, there was not. This is the hat; I know the hat by the lining and the band that is on it. My little girl bought the band, and put it on the hat; he changed a one pound note, and gave four shillings for the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. When he took his money out to pay for the hat did you see what money he had - A. He counted the notes; I saw what money he had; he had six one pound notes before he bought the hat; he paid for the hat with a one pound note; he had then five one pound notes and a five pound note, two guineas in gold, and sixteen shillings that he got in change for the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Leary was never with you at the hatter's shop - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Having bought the hat did you return to Leary's - A. We did, for Slattery to go home with us. Clifford had the hat he had purchased in his hand. I put off the old hat, and put the new purchased hat on. Leary said, Clifford, remember I have invited you to dinner to-day. Leary then said to me, do you know this man is going home to Ireland at night; I said, no, I never heard any thing of it; he then said, for your life do not tell him that I told you any such thing. Leary said he is to go. This passed in Leary's room. I asked Clifford if it was true. Clifford said, no, who told you of it. I would not tell him. I took it in my mind that he was going; I said I will not give you your riding coat; do, said he, laughing; he said, I will give you my silk handkerchief for a token. We came home then and had our breakfast in our room. Slattery returned with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Leary in the room all the time that you and your husband had the conversation - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary hear it - A. I don't know. I think he could not but hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel between you and your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150006"/>husband in Leary's room - A. Not one word but what I am telling you.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home did Clifford stay at home with you - A. Yes, he was in and out until I had my dinner in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He was never long from you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you your dinner in the afternoon - A. I had it between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the time that you usually dine - A. No, I was employed in getting some furniture up to my beds, that made me longer.</p>
               <p>Q. At five o'clock you dined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came first to your house, Leary or your friend Champion - A. Leary and his wife came first; they came between four and five to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect them - A. No; Leary's wife said if I was uneasy about my furniture she would take it, and give me my money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary and his wife come by your asking - A. They came, but I never spoke a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were surprised at seeing them - A. Yes; I could not take a bit of my dinner at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. The wife was quite drunk, and Leary was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you eat your dinner - A. She alarmed me by being so very drunk, and by using bad language, cursing and swearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either Leary or his wife say what they came for - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband eat any dinner - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he eat much or little - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you do not know whether he ate or not - A. I do not know, sir; I saw him take something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice what your husband had - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me all that Leary said or did when they came - A. I was sending out for half a gallon of beer, Leary said, make it up a gallon, and I will pay for the other half, and the gallon was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary drink of the beer - A. He drank some; I cannot tell how much; he partook of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband drink freely of it - A. Yes, he drank.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Leary and his wife stay with you - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Champion come in while he was there - A. Yes, they were going away as Mrs. Champion came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Champion is a relation of yours - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Slattery there too - A. Yes, he was</p>
               <p>Q. When Leary and his wife were going away what time was it - A. I think about eight o'clock: Leary called Clifford out, and he went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by Leary's desire that he went out - A. - A. Yes, he called him out; Mrs. Champion and I were talking together when Leary called him out; I did not hear what was said. After Leary and his wife had departed Mrs. Champion asked me to go and see her son; I made answer that I could not, I was not so well as I could wish. I remained at home in my apartment until after eight o'clock. Before I went out to look after Clifford I went to the corner of the street that I lived in; I did not go any farther at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him there - A. No, I did not. I came back and told the children that I could not find him. I sat in the window a bit; I went off to Leary's room. I went off alone to go to Leary's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with him before you got to Leary's room - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. When you got to Leary's room whom did you find - A. I found both Leary and his wife standing at their own street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what time might it be when you got to Leary's house, and found them standing at the street door - A. It was after nine o'clock; it was day-light then.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Leary and his wife - A. Nothing, but the wife was quite drunk. I asked them about Clifford; she made answer that he was up in the room; I asked her who was along with him; she said, no one; he was quite tipsey: she went and brought him down; I did not choose to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go up stairs yourself - A. I wanted to get back to my children; I did not go up stairs for fear of being kept.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clifford drunk, as Mrs. Leary told you - A. He was tipsy. When I had got Clifford I asked him to come home; he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he set out to go home with you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Leary's - A. Clifford and I came together, Leary followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you when you came away that he should go home with you - A. No, he did not; I had but just got out of the court where he lived when he followed us; he said that he was come to get Clifford work against the morning; he took him into a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house was it - A. A public-house at the corner of the lane where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Leary took him in; your husband did not propose going then - A. No, it was Leary. I spoke against Leary taking him in.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought he had liquor enough - A. Yes; Leary said he would only let him take one glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary drink - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the liquor - A. Leary paid for the glass of gin; we all came out of this gin-shop together, and then we turned into another public-house and had one pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of that other public-house - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed going to have the beer - A. I cannot recollect about that; Leary turned in first, because we did not know anything about the public-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank the beer - A. I took a drop of the beer, they took the rest. I paid for the beer to prevent Clifford drawing anything out, because he was so tipsey.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when you had the beer - A. Then we were coming on.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150007"/>Q. Did you sit down in that public-house - A. I did not, but they did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not sit - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any stick or any thing hard at your breast - A. No, I never had anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hammer in your bosom - A. No, sir, I had not. I asked Clifford to come home; Leary said to me, you seem to be uneasy; my hand and my word to you I will have this man in work against Monday morning then they were going on quick.</p>
               <p>Q. They got a little bit before you - A. Yes; I begged of them to wait, not to leave me by myself; Leary said, I am going to take this man to my master's house to settle with him against the morning. I said it was a late hour to go to a gentleman's house, and especially of a Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it at this time - A. It was after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the watch gone ten - A. I don't know. I think it was about ten, or between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very certain about the time - A. No. Leary said, walk easy, and don't distress yourself, and we will be up in your room and have a gallon of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that - A. I don't know. I thought he meant to get him in work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suffer them to go on first - A. I said no more. They left me to go home at my own pace.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any where in your way proposed going round by any square; which way were you going by at this time - A. A place they called Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Holborn by this time, did not you - A. No, I did not, only as they called it. They went before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they there parted with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Leary parted with you, had you asked him to go a different way to that you were going - - A. I never spoke a word to him than what I am telling you.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite a stranger to London - A. Yes After Leary left me I came straight as far as St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home did you find any body there - A. The children and Slattery. I got a candle at the chandler's shop; I slit it, and brought it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name of the man that kept the chandler's shop where you got the candle Macklarin - A Yes. I looked up at the window and saw there was no light; I returned back and got a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you now any knowledge of the time when you came - A. No further than as I was taking my pipe it struck twelve o'clock. I was a good while getting home. It struck twelve soon after I got home, and neither Clifford or Leary had come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Slattery come home - A. He was in bed; his bed was in my room that I and my children slept in. I sat and smoked my pipe, and then I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep - A. No, I did not; I did not rest much. I got up at two o'clock; I was awake; I heard the clock striking two; I was quite uneasy in my mind. I sat in the window until it was between three and four. I was uneasy not having him at home, and thinking that he was gone off to Ireland. I thought he might have done so, and between three and four o'clock I went to Leary's room.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did Leary occupy - A. An up stair room. I found the street door open; they are stone steps to go up from the street. I went to Leary's room door; I found the key outside of the door. I unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the key of Leary's door before that morning - A. No, I never noticed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the key in the door what did you do - A. I unlocked the door; the wife asked me if that was Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Leary's name is Jem - A. I suppose it is. I said, it is me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Leary or not - A. She was in bed. I stood at the door; I asked her where was her husband; that was, Jem Leary.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there and did not find Leary - A. No. I went away when she told me what she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room and put any thing out of your hand - A. I did not go into the room at all. I stood at the door, with the door in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you found that Leary was not there - A. I came home again to my own place, and went to Mrs. Champion.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she live near Leary - A. No, she lives in a place called Drury-lane. I enquired my way to Mrs. Champion's.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what time in the morning it was when you got to Mrs. Champion's - A. I cannot. I told her what had passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay with Mrs. Champion, or what did you do - A. I went home to my lodging; she went to my brother first and told him what had happened; after that she came to me in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it when she got to you - A. I think it was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the people up, and about their business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time heard what had happened to Clifford - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Singleton before you heard what had happened to Clifford - A. The woman at the door told me what had happened to Clifford; they said there was a man hurted last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Mrs. Champion proposed to go along with you - A. She proposed my going with her to my own brother; my brother said he would interfere to get me pass, as I thought of following Clifford that I might save what little money I had to help me on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day on Monday was it when you heard about Clifford being murdered - A. Between eight and nine, as I told you.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mrs. Singleton was by when the woman told you of it - A. She was in her own room. I then went out with Mrs. Champion, and a good many more women to see the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the body when you saw it - A. At Mr. Price's public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150008"/>Q. Was it Clifford's body you saw there - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it when you saw it - A. Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of Leary and Clifford parting hih you in Holborn, he told you he was going with wim to his master, did you ever see Clifford afterward until you saw him a corpse - A. Never, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home between eight and nine, you found Slattery in bed, did you - A. When I came home at night Slattery was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you told me that Mrs. Leary did know that you had some money - A. Yes, sir, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know that Leary knew Clifford had any money - A. No further than as I tell you, Leary asked me, as I told you before, and I was so foolish as to tell him; this was on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on Sunday was it that he came to your room, he and his wife - A. At my dinner time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what did he ask you, and what did you say - A. He asked me whether it was he or I that kept the money; I said I had a trifle of my own, and he had his own; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to carry what money you had about you, or did you leave it at home - A. I had it about me at the time that this body laid dead; I had no place to leave it at home; it was sewed in the waist of my petticoat. When I found his body was a corpse I ripped it out of my petticoat to give the men something to drink that brought the body home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever denied that you had money - A. I have; because the place was so wicked; I did not wish to own it. I then gave it to Mr. Lawrence, not to conceal it, but for safety.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been delivered since you have been in prison of a child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Mrs. Burke attend to me a little. You came to London quite a stranger, Mrs. Leary let you have a lodging for four days - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that you had never seen them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no reason to believe that Clifford ever saw them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Leary live - A. In Fleet-lane, near Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Q. He never called upon you from the time that you left him until the Saturday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never mentioned before that time of your husband having any money; on the Sunday morning nothing passed about the money until he and his wife came in the afternoon - A. No more than what I am telling you; the woman was drunk, and the man was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been with Leary four days you met Slattery - A. Yes, he was an old acquaintance, he came from the same neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. He found you out this lodging, he knew what money your husband had - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it never communicated to him that your husband had money - A. No, it never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in London before you came with Clifford - A. Yes, I came when I was a child.</p>
               <p>Q. How old were you when you left London - A. I do not know; my brother knows.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you live then - A. With my brother, in Parker's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live there then - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Two years - A. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not at least twelve years when you left London - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you now - A. I suppose I am three or four and thirty years of age; I have been married twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were married to Mr. Burke - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been as little as six months in London - A. Yes. I cannot give a particular account.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been there a year or two with your brother - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean for the jury to believe that you were so ignorant of London that you did not know the place called Holborn - A. I did not know where Holborn was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you capable of running about the streets - A. I suppose I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at least a girl of seven or eight years old - A. I was that at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps ten or twelve - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on errands - A. Yes, I used to go in and out</p>
               <p>Q. How came it when you came to London that you did not go to your brother - A. Because it was very early in the morning when the children got out of the waggon; the children were fatigued; I went to my brother the next day; he came to see me at Leary's; he proposed to get me another lodging. Slattery took me a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that the money that you had you obtained from selling a little property of yours - A. Yes. Clifford obtained his money from his hard work.</p>
               <p>Q. That is true - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account how he got his money - A. Yes, he sold cattle, and got money. I sold a little house, and some land; it was near Clare, in the County of Tipperary.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you sold it before you came to England - A. About three months.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it produce - A. Some of it was corn; it was sold for thirty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the thirty pound - A. I had it. I was obliged to part with fifteen pound to pay some debts.</p>
               <p>Q. The thirty pound, what was it paid to you in - A. Notes of the Bank of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes did you give to Mr. Lawrence, English or Irish Bank notes - A. English; I changed them Irish Bank bank notes for English notes in Cork. Clifford knew that I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that the money that Clifford had was part of the produce of this house and land, and of a horse - A. I don't think I have.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have said so it is not true then - A. No part of the produce of that house ever was Clifford's; I sold the horse for nine guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had thirty-nine pounds - A. I was obliged to pay the debts; I sold the horse, and Clifford had none of the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150009"/>Q. You said Clifford was your husband, did you ever disclose the contrary until it afterwards came from Ireland - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations did you undergo before the magistrate, before you told the magistrate that Clifford was not your husband - A. I don't know, I did not tell the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the second - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason that made you tell it you knew that they had got intelligence from Ireland that you was not married, and then you told them - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Clifford and you while in London lived very happy together, you had no words with one-another at any time, that is as true as the rest that you are telling - A. I am telling the truth; we had no words at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never heard Clifford threaten to go away to Ireland, and leave you - A. He said very often he wished to be in his own country; he did not disagree with me at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday morning you breakfasted at home, and Slattery with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Slattery went with you to Leary's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Slattery staid behind when you went with your husband to buy the hat, did not he - A. He staid in the room with Leary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time observe any hammer in Leary's room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Clifford and you bought the hat together - A. Yes; Leary was not there.</p>

               <p>Q. Slattery was not there - A. No. We went back to Leary's room, and Slattery came home with us, and we breakfasted together.</p>
               <p>Q. Slattery dined with you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drink any of this gallon of beer - A. He was there at the time the beer was drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home at night, you say you found Slattery in bed; you heard the clock strike twelve when you were taking you pipe - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued very uneasy, was Slattery asleep then - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Slattery was in bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to him one word, good or bad - A. I cannot recollect; I spoke to the children.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up at two o'clock did you speak to Slattery - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Leary's room - A. Yes, and when I left Leary's room I went to Mrs. Champion, I spoke to her husband, the husband was up, but she was not up; Mrs. Champion dressed herself, she wanted me to breakfast with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her and spoke to her at that time in the morning that you came from Leary's; when you went home was Slattery in bed then - A. No, he was got up and gone to work.</p>
               <p>Q. But how are you sure that he was in bed when you was at home at two o'clock in the morning - A. Because his coat was on the table; it was at four o'clock when I went out to Leary; he was in bed then. I did not speak a word. It was from my uneasiness that I was going to Leary.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give Mr. Lawrence your money, or any body else until after the murder; who is Mr. Lawrence - A. I don't know; he keeps a chandler's shopover right where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell him when you gave him that money - A. I did not tell him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you tell the magistrate that you had any money - A. The first time; I told him I had a trifle, but I did not tell him what it was, nor to what amount.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up at three o'clock and went to Leary's you knew your way well enough - A. I did not, I enquired.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask Slattery to go with you - A. No, because I knew he was going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure you did not go into Leary's room at all - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You say you got thirty pound by selling your property in Ireland, was the price of the horse part of that thirty-pound - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole sum that you got was thirty pound and nine guineas - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what age you were of when you were here with your brother - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go much about - A. I don't know no more about it then a baby.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you speak English when you were here - A. I believe I was learned; I don't recollect any thing about it at all.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information did you go to where the body was - A. Yes; Mrs. Clifford came to the public-house while I was there; I think I was there about an hour before she came. I went to Leary's lodgings; he was not at home; the door was locked; Thisselton was with me; we broke it open; I and Thisselton searched his lodgings; while I was searching the box Thisselton picked up this hammer under some coals; just by the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in that apartment - A. There were some clothes, but we had not time to look at them. Thisselton and I came back to the magistrate; we then went to where Leary was at work; Thisselton and I found him, there were two or three men at work; Leary had got a hod upon his shoulder. I said to Leary, where is your master; he said it is not my master you want, it is me: I said it was. We apprehended him; he said let me speak to my master; I said yes, certainly, where is he; we went into a place about twenty yards; his master met us; he said to his master I am going with these gentlemen to Hatton Garden; he came along with us directly: Thisselton laid hold of his arm, I walked behind him; we took him to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you found the hammer among the coals; was there anything about it that excited your attention - A. Nothing more than the hat I saw at the public-house; I thought it was done with that hammer; there is nothing about the hammer particular. It was very rusty. I could not tell whether there was any blood upon it or no. The other hammer Thisselton produces. I know no more.</p>
               <p>Mr Adolphus. What time in the morning was this - A. I did not go to the public-house until half after twelve, and from there I went to Leary's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Leary at his usual work in his usual place - A. Yes</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150010"/>Q. Was he searched - A. He was, nothing was found upon him but an eighteen-penny piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any property was found in his room whatever - A. No; there was some white upon the hammer at the time it was found in his room. The hammer was more rusty than it is now; it is a shoemaker's hammer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. What is Leary by business - A. A <rs id="t18130915-3-deflabel15" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the murder of Clifford being discovered did you go to apprehend Leary - A. I did, in Windmill-court, Giltspur-street; that was where he was at work; he had got a hold on his shoulder. I asked him for his master: some one said, he is backwards. He was coming down with the hod; he said, it is not the master you want, it is me. Mr. Helston, the prisoner's master, asked what was the matter; we told him there had been a murder. Leary did not hear that. I said I thought Leary could give some information about it. Crossing Giltspur-street, Leary said he had heard of the poor man; I asked him, how? he said, never mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his working dress at this time - A. He was. I found this shoemaker's hammer under some coals in Leary's room. This shoemaker's hammer found in a corner by the fire-place, under some coals. I put my stick in and found the hammer, and this hammer I found Mrs. Clifford's apartment in Fitzroy-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a man of the name of M'Carthy coming to Leary when he was in confinement - A. I do. I understood that Leary wished to see M'Carthy. I had just locked him up in a private place, and coming from there one of my brother officers said that Leary wished to see M'Carthy. M'Carthy was there. I said I had no objection of his seeing Leary if he would speak English. When M'Carthy first went into Leary, Leary said, what do you think of this job of mine; M'Carthy said, it is a bad case, and I think the evidence that has been brought against you, will be sufficient to hang you. He urged him, if he was guilty to acknowledge it, to clear the rest of his countrymen that were in the country. Leary said, if he could get a person to prove that he was at home and in bed at ten o'clock on the night of the murder, it would be all right. They were the very words as well as I can remember. M'Carthy replied, suppose you could get a person to do that, where were you between the time that you parted with Mrs. Clifford and ten o'clock. Leary answered, that is where I should be lost. M'Carthy said he thought nothing would get the prisoner through it. Leary said, there is nothing but one thing that is, to fix it on some one else. M'Carthy said, if that is what you sent to me for I will leave you to your fate, and you may be hanged like a dog, and none of your countryman shall come forward to give you a shilling. I unlocked the door then, and M'Carthy came out. No more passed. That conversation was on Thursday, what I call the first examination. I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. The second hammer you found at Mr. Burke's lodging - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That hammer has a wooden handle, if that was put in a woman's stays it would form a thing like a busk - A. I cannot form any idea of that.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of this interview with M'Carthy there had been interviews with the magistrate; on Thursday Mrs. Burke was examined in his presence - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that was the first of what he had heard what she could allege against him, she then stated pretty much the same circumstances that she stated to day - A. She did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when this interview was with Leary and with M'Carthy - A. In the passage, close to the door. There is a grating over the door; we can hear what is said if they speak in a common tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken him into the strong room, had not you - A. Yes, I had, in the strong room in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. You opened the door and put M'Carthy in - A. That is the fact. I do not know whether I did not speak to M'Carthy while I was unlocking the door that he must speak in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary hear it - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Mrs. Burke give any account of her not being Mrs. Clifford - A. I was not present when that disclosure was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you heard this conversation - A. Wood, another officer. I do not know whether he heard it or not; it was Wood that told me that Leary wished to see M'Carthy.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him at the lock-up-room at Hatton Garden office - A. I do; he sent for me; I saw the prisoner there; I and the prisoner were alone together. When I went in I asked him what he wanted with me; he asked me what I thought of him. I told him that I thought him in an aukward situation, and that I thought him guilty of the murder; he said he felt himself very uneasy at my having thought so, I being one of his nearest friends. He said he was innocent of the man's murder; he knew nothing of it. I said, if that be the case, what time in the morning did you go to your work, and who had seen you. He said, a person of the name of

            , and fifty others saw him go to work. I then said, why does not White come here and prove that on your part, and suppose he had come and proved that, how can you account for going to bed at ten o'clock, as you say you have done. There, said he, is where I am lost; if any body could be got to prove that, I should be free, said he. I told him that I considered him guilty of the murder, and not to suffer two of his countrymen, after whom there was a pursuit, to participate in his guilt. I told him he would be hanged; he said, I am sure I shall. I said, you have no means of getting over it. Leary said, none but the one. What is that, said I. Leary said, to fix it upon some one else. I said, upon whom do you mean to fix it, who is implicated. I think, said he, when I sat in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150011"/>the Union Arms public-house I felt in her right hand pocket a hammer. Here ended the conversation. I believe I told him that he was the man that committed the murder, and that he should have no friendship from me. As near as I can recollect these were the words. Then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever with him alone ever since - A. Never. I would not go to him. I disclosed this conversation to the officers, and told them to mention it to the magistrate if they thought it material.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. When you went to him you had made up your mind that he was the guilty man - A. Yes. He said, I know I shall be hanged, and the moment I am hanged may I go into Hell if I am guilty of the man's murder.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not ask you to do any such thing as to get a person to prove that he had seen him go to bed - A. Just as I have stated to you.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you at any time while Leary was in your care, any conversation with him - A. Yes; the first conversation the expression was, faith, I will tell you the truth. This conversation was taken in writing. I said nothing to him about confessing. This declaration was taken in writing the same morning. He said he did not commit the murder himself, but he was there present at the time of the murder. He told me that Mrs. Burke had committed the deed. I asked him what distance he was off Mrs. Burke when the murder was committed; he told me he might be three yards distant. I then asked him respecting his dress; I do not remember his answer. I asked him if there was any blood on any part of his clothes; he said there might be some on his shoes; the deceased bled fresh; it spurted from him; he might have got blood though a yard or two distant. I then asked him what the implement was that the murder was committed, whether it was the shoemaker's hammer; his answer was, no, he did not think it was; he believed not. I then asked him where the implement was concealed, where it was to be found; he told me I should find it at his master's, and gave me the direction where his master lived. Mr. Helston delivered it up to me. Leary told me the hammer had been in use one week since the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You got the hammer of his master - A. I did. I asked him respecting of the knife; he denied any knowledge of the knife on the Monday and the Tuesday, but on the Wednesday he said that he had an old knife at home, and described it to me; he told me that it was a broken pointed knife, and the top part of the handle was broken off. This is the knife; Lee gave it to Mr. Price, and Mr. Price to Higginbotham. I shewed the knife to Leary, and asked him if that was the knife that he had described to me; he said it was. Leary added, that Mrs. Burke might have taken it from Clifford, and Clifford had taken it from his apartment, and put it into his pocket. I asked him how he knew that was the hammer; he said he saw Mrs. Clifford lift up the hammer with both her hands; he was within a yard or two of her. He always denied having any hand in the murder, only that he was present.</p>

Yes, Mr. Clifford; he came by himself to buy a hat; I sold him this hat for four shillings; he was receiving the change of a one pound note when the woman came in; I asked her what she wanted. I did not know she belonged to him. When the deceased took the money out to pay for the hat he turned himself round; he would not let me see what he had. The deceased said the woman that came in belonged to him; she took hold of him; he ran into the parlour, as if frightened at her. They seemed as if they had been quarrelling before they came in. It was about noon when he came in, I am quite certain.</p>

             and his wife. I walked with both until we came to Ely-place, and then we walked faster. It was Clifford's intention to get his clothes out before his wife came home. When we got to Holborn Bars Mrs. Clifford was about thirty yards behind; there we met Slattery. Slattery came and said, Ned, you have disappointed us very much this afternoon; I am very much obliged to you for the civility. I then left them altogether. In my way back, at Shoe-lane, I met Clifford's wife, and passed her without speaking to her. That is the substance of the first confession. After this a message came from Leary to Mr. Adkins the governor, stating that what he said on the 28th of July was false. Then I took this in writing from Leary's mouth, dated the 1st of August; he then said he would give a true account. I reduced it to writing. This is the same. It was signed first by Mr. Adkins, and then by Leary. I saw Leary sign it, and then Mr. Adkins.</p>

             came to my lodgings; he told me that he wanted to get away on Sunday night if he could; he said, I will lay myself down here and go to sleep. I put him three chairs together; he laid down there for two or three hours. I put my great coat over him. He then requested me to go with him to his house and ask his wife for the clothes that she had got. A little after eight he went away; I did not go with him. After he went away his wife came after him. I think it must be between eight and nine. When Clifford came back, Slattery and his wife were there. He said he would go back to Ireland. His wife took hold of him; they quarrelled together. He said, it was of no use, he would go back to Ireland. He then offered her a silk handkerchief that he said he gave nine shillings for, if she would give him the great coat. He opened the window and attempted to throw himself out. She laid hold of him and prevented him going out; he said he was determined to go to Ireland; she said she was determined to go after him. My wife opened the door; he went down stairs; Mrs. Clifford pulled off his hat. Between two and three in the afternoon I and my wife went to their lodging with intention to buy the bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150013"/>bed and what things they had got. They were getting the dinner ready. She asked Slattery to fetch half a gallon of beer. She gave him the money, and before he went out I said I thought he had better bring a gallon, and I would pay for half a gallon. I did pay for half a gallon, all we were in the room. They all dined together except Clifford; they all seemed agreeable together. I did not say a word about buying the bed. Clifford kept by the door, holding a shoemaker's hammer in his hand. When I and my wife went out of the room we met Mr. Harrington and his wife; we agreed to go to Mr. Griffiths's house in Church-street; Clifford came after us and partook of the beer. My wife was tipsey; she wanted to go home. As we were coming along Clifford complained that he was hungry; I said, if he would go along with me I would give him something to eat; accordingly he did. I gave him some bread, meat, and cabbage. As near as I can say this was about nine o'clock. While he was there Mrs. Clifford came; they began quarrelling. Clifford and his wife and me went out; we went to the Union Arms, Union-court; I had a glass of gin, Clifford had one, Mrs. Clifford had none. Coming along I accidentally hit my elbow against her side: I felt something hard, like a stick. She complained of being ill; she did not wish to go up Holborn, as the people would push against her. She asked Clifford to come this way through Gray's-inn, as then they would have an opportunity of going through the squares. I said, I wish you good night, madam; she said, no, go a little further with me, if I am taken ill this man knows nothing, he will be of no use to me. As we got towards the brick fields he said he would be gone in the night, he would not stop by any means. They began quarrelling again; she took the hammer from her breast and struck him down; she then struck him two or three times very hard. I moved a little nearer to him, and saw the blood flow from him. I made my way across the fields as well as I could. I went home about eleven o'clock; my wife was fast asleep in bed. I undressed and went to bed. About three o'clock Mary Clifford came and said, are you at home, Leary. She did not come into the room, but put this hammer into the room. She went down stairs without speaking one word. When I got up I found the hammer by the door, which made me suspect that she had put it there. I got up about half after five. I went to my work, and took this hammer with me. I came back to breakfast about eight o'clock my wife said

             had been enquiring about her husband. When I went to dinner I met my wife; she said how Ned had been murdered, she hoped I had no hand in it. After dinner I went to work until about three o'clock. The great coat that I had on when Clifford was killed there might be some blood it.</p>
               <p>MR. FORD. James Leary further saith, that at the time the deceased and Mrs. Clifford were in the brick fields, about ten yards further was Slattery. Slattery said, is that you Mary, we are well met; I have been about five minutes looking for you. The deceased requested Slattery to give him the great coat. Slattery had the coat on. Mrs. Clifford struck the deceased; he fell, and Slattery took hold of his legs and dragged him to the pond.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever go with her to Leary - A. I did; on Sunday morning when her husband was gone out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being turned out of the room on the Saturday, and sleeping on the stairs - A. No, I do not. About eight o'clock on Sunday morning we went to Leary's.</p>

               <p>Q. Used not they to quarrel - A. No; he said the place would not agree with him, and she at eight o'clock on Sunday morning asked him if he was going to leave her and go to Ireland; after that he went out and bought the hat, and we went home together and got our breakfast; this was about nine o'clock. I helped her to put up the beds, and Clifford remained in the room until about five o'clock. When Leary and his wife came in Leary ate some dinner. Leary told Clifford he would get Clifford a job of work at his master's; they went out; I never saw Leary afterwards until I saw him the next day at Hatton Garden office. Mrs. Clifford remained in the room; Mrs. Champion came next, I went out with her; I came home about nine o'clock, there was nobody at home but the children.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the same room with Mrs. Clifford - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her up in the night - A. I did not; I do not know that I was awake all night; I knew nothing that passed, nor of the murder until I heard of it at one o'clock; the next day I got up at six o'clock and went to work in Camden Town; I breakfasted in Camden Town; I heard nothing of the murder until I returned home to dinner in Clifford's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. I hope you will grant me the indulgence of having my defence read, and if there appears any guilt before you that I was the hand that murdered Clifford I will not ask my hte at you hand; but if my story be true, and if I prove some part by the evidence of proper persons who may be believed, then I shall look for a verdict of an acquittal. I am very low in spirits, not having the same kind of living that I used to have. Some gentlemen have come forward and have employed the learned lawyer in my behalf, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150014"/>I had no money. I do not doubt that if I have a patient hearing I shall disprove the unconnected evidence against me. Clifford came to me to know what he was to do, the same as another of my countrymen did, and because I can write, (my father was a schoolmaster they call me) Mr. Leary. Gentlemen, I did not kill the man, nor did I lend my assistance, nor thought of the affair until it was actually done; we never had a quarrel or ever fell out. If I was a thief, but I am not, I might easily have robbed him without murdering him; this never entered my head; I never would suffer men to overreach one-another at pay-table; my master knows I never was found committing such tricks as journeymen bricklayers are used to commit; I have told the masters about them, and they have been discharged, although they have been good workmen. Gentlemen, I am not a thief, nor ever did I covet other mens property, or liked to see one man overreach another; if a reason is assigned why I am accused of this horrid deed it must arise from something higher; although I am very poor I am as sensible as some that are better off. The statement published by the keeper of the House of Correction you are well acquainted with, as it has been stated in the public-newspapers, and other paragraphs, stating further proofs as they said Leary's of guilt. I trust this honourable court will not believe that I am guilty of this murder from the depositions that have been inserted in the newspapers; they call the papers that I signed at the House of Correction a confession. On the night of this lamented murder I was tipsy; the women were all tipsy, and if I have mistaken one house for another it will not be thought I am guilty of this crime, or knew of it before it took place. I will now return to the newspapers, I am ill used by them, they have raised a strong perjudice against me; they have offered false assertions for facts, told the public that the examinations tended to prove Leary's guilt, when truely they did not tend to any such thing; for God's sake gentlemen do not take in your minds these newspaper reports; his lordship I hope will tell you that the only way you can give the proper verdict is to take into your consideration only what has occured in court to day, that is the only way you can give the proper verdict on my case; there have been verdicts passed on prisoners by the evidence of police officers, which verdicts have been lamented afterwards; you see I speak of the danger of deciding from circumstantial evidence, on account of Holloway, Haggerty, and others. Gentlemen, there have been shewn to you three hammers, a knife, and my great coat; the large hammer is the property of my master, and was brought from the building where it was used on the building by all the men; I being the oldest man in the employ it was carried home by me; I knew Mrs. Helston was ill, I did not like to disturb her, so I carried it to my own home, I had often taken home tools before. I am told it was the small hammer that killed the man, but I am fearful it was the large one; as to the other hammer being covered with coals, I had not coals enough to cover it; I never had it in my hand. At the third examination several witnesses were bought up to prove that this knife was mine, but failed; I think Clifford put it in his pocket after supper; we had but three knives, one I had, the other my wife had, and Clifford had this. My coat was said to be bloody, and then it was said to be scowered; this was disproved by Martin during the examination; Cook and Thisselton harangued at me, and said they should have other evidence to prove my guilt, that I should be hanged, that I was done, and many other such expressions, it certainly induced me to say to them you want my life, take it; this was natural, for it is better to die at once than live under such.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the road - A. I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>Q. While Larman was working with you what happened - A. We were looking at some slugs, he happened to get up and he fell. I heard a report of a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find what had occasioned that fall - A. No, I saw the blood come from his body by the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a ball - A. No. I found a hole in his ribs, and blood come from that hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look towards the part where you heard the report of a gun - A. I did, up the high road, there I saw two soldiers, they had both a gun, each they were dressed in blue; like the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other persons near the spot from whence the report came except these two - A. No, I did not; I ran away to Whetstone for assistance; I passed them. One of these two men that I passed was the prisoner now at the bar; when they got to Whetstone they were stopped and examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his gun examined - A. Yes, it appeared to have been lately discharged. It was quite we, when you put your finger in the mouth of the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his companions gun appear to be loaded - A. They were all loaded but this one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You knew nothing of the prisoner before this time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did he knew Larman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you in the field - A. Against some paling which my master had lately put up.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the paling - A. Higher than me a good deal, and higher than Larman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the soldiers who were in the road on account of Larman stooping see him - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the person whoever he was that hred did not you know - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fence between where you stood and the soldiers - A. There were low rails, he shot over two or three rails, we could see those in the road and they could see us. The rails are open rails.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the wounds even - A. No, one was higher than the other. It went in one side and came out of the other. I cannot say which side the wound was highest. One side the hole was about two inches higher than the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say, the pointing of the gun was towards that part of the field where the boy was, and whether it was pointed towards the boy you cannot say - A. No.</p>

I put four crown papers of halfpence upon a desk that I had in the accompting house. After I had put them there I took one paper away; I went out and locked my accompting-house door.

I saw the prisoner and a woman looking into my accompting-house; they were looking in at the front window; the halfpence were on the desk, near to the accompting-house door. When I returned to my accompting-house I found one paper of halfpence taken away. There were but two left. The prisoner was close by. I detained the prisoner; the woman escaped.</p>

On Saturday last, between nine and ten in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop; he agreed to buy two shirts for eight shillings, two pair of stockings for three shillings, and a waistcoat at seven shillings and sixpence. He told me to fold them up; he would pay me for them. I folded them up; he seemed to feel in his pocket for the money. In a little time I turned my head of one side, he throwed a quantity of snuff in my face. He took the bundle and ran away. He was pursued and taken, and brought back with the property.</p>

            . I live in Wilson-street, Somers Town. On the 1st of September I saw the two prisoners, Whittel and Wood, between five and six o'clock, they were coming along the road from Hampstead, just by the turnpike gate. They were driving three pigs, two little ones and a big one. The pigs were dirty; they appeared to be disguised with some stuff. I do not know what, and appeared as if they had been driven some way. I told the man at the turnpike I thought them pigs were stolen. I then fetched Avory, the officer; he took them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 1st of September. Truro called upon me; I went with him to the New-road, near Pentonville chapel. I observed the prisoner Wood coming out of a public-house door; directly he saw me he turned back and ran in doors. I met Whittel just as he was coming out of the Lord Vernon's Arms door, the same public-house. The sow and pigs at that time were laying opposite of the said public-house; they appeared very much fatigued. The pigs were very much splashed over with tar. When I secured Whittel, Wood absconded; he was brought to me by Dobson. I asked the prisoners where they brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150018"/>pigs from. They said they knew nothing of them. I took the pigs to my own home until they were sworn to at Bow-street office.</p>

I have lost nineteen poundsworth of pots since last April, and I have no doubt but this woman took three parts of them. On the 2nd of this month I had information that the prisoner had some pots in her possession. I went to Mr. Walker. The prisoner lodges in Mr. Walker's house. I asked Mr. Walker to go and look for my pots in the back garret: The prisoner lodged in the back garret in Mr. Walker's house. The prisoner then was not at home. I went the second time; Mr. Walker delivered five pint pots and one quart. About seven o'clock they sent over to me, and told me there was a strap full of pots. I went over; I brought out of the prisoner's room twenty pint pewter pots and seven quarts. These are the pots; they are every one of them mine.</p>

I went up stairs with her when she came home; I told her I wished to go into the room; I was informed there were some pots there. She refused. At last I went in; I found five pints and one quart. She said the pots had been brought there in a mistake. About seven o'clock I went into the room again; she had absconded then. I found twenty pints and seven quarts in a bag by the side of the bed. In searching the room I found an old frying pan; in it were the remains of pewter.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 31st of August last, I placed myself in a situation where I could see the prisoner, knowing that he would be sent into a room to look out goods for an order. When he had looked out the goods he took six wineglasses, and concealed them in his breeches and his waistcoat, he was sent out with the goods that he was desired to look out, into Holborn; after he had left my premises and gone into Shoe-lane I went out and desired him to return, which he did without any hesitation. In the mean time I had sent for a constable, and on the prisoner's return I accused him of having property of mine about his person; they were taken from him in the presence of one of my shopmen.</p>

Mrs. Denton was in the corner against the clock; I saw the prisoner look very stedfast at her, and then he rushed against her; she screamed, and the blood flew into the corner; I saw the knife when his hand drew from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it bloody - A. I did not take notice. The woman ran out directly screaming, the daughter took hold of her: I jumped up instantly and catched hold of the prisoner by the wrist; I said for God Almighty sake, Denton, what have you been doing; he made no answer; I made my escape out of the house, and left him in the house; he was shortly after secured. I ran to Mrs. Denton at the top of the lane, about forty-yards off.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 13th of June, in the morning, had your mother expressed any displeasure to him - A. Not as I know of; he was there in the morning, he went away, and come again in the evening, then Mr. Puddiford was there; he came with a bottle in his hand, he offered the bottle to my mother when he came down again; she refused taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mother give Puddiford any - A. Yes, I brought in a quartern of gin, my mother gave Puddiford a glass. When the prisoner came in he said something to my mother; the words I cannot repeat. My mother told him to go out of her house, for he was a disgrace to his sex, while my mother was winding up the clock. He said, what am I, a disgrace? My mother said, yes, you are. As soon as she said that he ran up to her. I did not perceive the knife until I saw him draw it out of her arm. Then my mother ran to the top of the alley. I held Denton by the right hand while he had the knife in his right hand. He shifted the knife into his left hand. My mother ran to the neighbours for assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your mother live - A. A month, sir. On that day month she died.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had been there the fore part of the day, and there was some difference - A. Yes; he struck a woman of the name of Whitehead; my mother went up to him and told him he ought to be ashamed of striking a woman; then he turned round and hit my mother, I believe on her arm. She desired him to go away. Mrs. Whitehead came into the room; he followed her home. My mother told him not to strike a woman, and told him to go away.</p>

               <p>Q. to Doubleday. Upon the alarm of this violence, did you take up the prisoner - A. I did, at my sister's dwelling house. This knife was given to me as soon as I got there; I asked the prisoner how he came to be guilty of that rash act; he said it was love. I do not recollect any thing else being confessed; when I took him in custody I found him laying on the floor, he seemed in a melancholy way at the time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Had he made any attempt on himself - A. He had a slight wound on his side. This knife was given to me in a bloody state.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the unfortunate woman until the time of her death. The wound in her arm was about two inches in length, and four inches in depth; it was inflicted by a sharp instrument; it had nearly divided the arteries; that was the occasion of a great effusion of blood; she died of a mortification from that wound and the great loss of blood from the part. In consequence of the disease of the part I attended her until the time of her death; the wound in the side was not the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. Another person was called in before you - A. Yes, there was; I found the prisoner laying in the front room, with a wound on the left side, it was only a superficial wound. I went to the deceased, I found her in an exhausted state, it must be a period, from my seeing her from the time of the accident. It was the principal artery that nourished the arm; I never knew that artery to be wounded in a less degree but what it was fatal.</p>

            . I was ships corporal on board the Royal George. While the prisoner was on board his character was very good, only at certain times he was taken with a lightness in his head; the cause was he fell down the main hatchway, and got his scull fractured; that caused him to be wild and mad; once he jumped over board off the gangway; the captain put him in irons; on the next day he had him brought up and was going to flog him, he found out he was in this state, he gave him his liberty; he then cautioned the ship's company never to agitate him any more; he was reckoned a good man in the ship as could be, only when these freaks took him. I and he, and the whole ship's company were discharged together; he was discharged twelve years ago; about four years after I saw him he was much the same, and looked wild in his eyes.</p>

            . I am sister to the prisoner. Since he has been discharged from the Navy he has resided with me; I am a married woman; I live in Bow-lane-buildings. He has frequently been outrageous; I have not been able to live in the house with him; I have been obliged to hide the knives out of his way. He was particularly so at the time of the full moon; he was light headed and mad frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day this affair happened between him and Mrs. Denton - A. Yes, that morning he came in and struck me with his hand more than once; Mrs. Whitehead was there at the time, Mrs. Whitehead bid him beat me more until I gave him some money; he struck her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on what terms he lived with the deceased before this affair happened - A. He was particularly fond of her; she has frequently fetched him out of my house to go home to sleep with her; he was so fond of her that he did not follow his employ after he got in liege with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his employment - A. He worked in the East India Docks as a labourer, and sometimes at rigging. I saw the deceased after this accident; I was with her ten minutes before she died; she did not speak to me. On the Thursday before I had some conversation with her, she did not at that time think she should die. On the 26th of December I went to market a little way from our house, I was not gone above twenty minutes from the house; when I came back he was suspended to the bed by an apron of mine; he had slit it down; it was tied round his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he suffered to walk about - A. Yes, and he had his wages; he gave me his money, and I laid it out for him. I never consulted any medical man upon him. I had it not in my power.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, had you touched him, or his private parts - A. No, I had not gone near him; he might have touched the back of my hand by rubbing against me; I had not gone to him, he came to me; he said why will you handle my private parts; I said, I touch your private parts. He said yes, and I'll make you know it; he look hold of my collar. I resisted; I said you have not a blackguard to deal with, I will give you my address; on which I gave him my card; on receiving the card he held his hand on my collar, and looked on the card. I told him if he was not satisfied with that, he might watch me home; he would see me let myself in with my own key, which I had in my pocket, that he would not be deceived where to find me. He then said you are an opulent tradesman, twenty pound will not be an object to you; I must have that sum, or I'll expose you, and you'll be pillored. Upon this I proceeded towards my own house. He had hold of the sleeve of my coath; e went with me, and insisted upon the money being paid, or he would carry his threat into execution. I felt myself greatly terrified at that, saying, I believed I had not twenty pound in the house; would not ten pound or less do. He went home with me, and followed me into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What servant had you in the house - A. Only my female servant in the house, that servant was gone to bed. I let him into my house; I remonstrated with him; he insisted in it, that he would swear the charge against me if I did not give him twenty pound, no less sum would he take. I went to my drawer, and took out my pocket-book; I then thought I had done wrong by letting such a man into my house; I went into the passage and took out the money to give him; I took out four five-pound Bank of England notes; I gave them him instantly; when he had got the money he immediately made way to the door; he went out; he told me I never should hear from him again, he was going to sea, or abroad; he was going out of the country. This was on Sunday, the 20th of June. On Monday, the 21st of June, I was going through Saville-row, I believe about five o'clock in the afternoon, I passed the prisoner, he was with an old man; upon passing him the prisoner followed me, he put his hand on my shoulder; he said, do you know me; I said, no; at that instant I did not recollect him. Upon my saying no, he said, do you recollect on the Sunday night how you gave me your address; I then said you are the man that extorted twenty pound from me; on that he went up to the old man, he said father this is the man that I spoke to you about; the old man then came close to me, he said sir, (in the hearing of the prisoner,) this is my son, but he is a d - d rascal, I want to send him to sea, and from what he has told me about you, you will not have any hesitation to assist me; I have not money to send him; we will go into some house sir, and have a bottle of wine, and talk this matter over. I excused myself going into any house with them, saying, I had not time, I would, meet them on the Wednesday; we appointed to meet on the Wednesday morning, at the Cumberland Arms, in Oxford-street, nearly opposite of my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Against the Wednesday did you provide yourself with a Bow-street officer - A. I went immediately to Dyer's-buildings, to Mr. Townes, my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact get a Bow-street officer - A. Yes; I kept my appointment, and was there five minutes before them; I saw the old man come in after me, and called for a glass of beer at the bar; the prisoner came in about five minutes after. I sat myself down between them in the parlour; Adkins, the officer, was in the same room; Adkins and I were not seen to go into the room in company together. Then I being with these two men, I said, now gentlemen, what do you want with me; I said I understand on Monday you wanted more money, I can muster ten pound more to the twenty you have already had of me, and looked at the young man. The old man said, no, sir, if you give money it must be your own voluntary act. I perceived the old man's eyes to be particularly upon Adkins. The old man said, I want your interest; I know your interest is great; I want you to get my son out to sea, as I told you before, I want you to get a captain for him to get him out; I said I know no captain, all I can do, is to give you ten pound to the twenty pound you have already had. I got up and said Mr. Adkins that is the man, take him into custody; Mr. Adkins took the prisoner into custody, and I called a coach; upon this the old man went to the door, and said, what is all this about; when he saw Adkins push him into the coach, Adkins said to the old man you must go with us; the old man said no, I must go to get some men to come and speak in behalf of my son's character. I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you parted with these five-pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150023"/>notes under what impression did you do it - A. Under fear from a threat of a rascal, who had no hesitation in swearing any thing; I did it for fear that he would swear that abominable thing that he charged me with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Where had you been on the 20th of June - A. I was walking in the afternoon with some friends over Westminster-bridge, and then after that I called on Mr. Roberts; finding that it was earlier than twelve o'clock I went into the Rose public-house, in Wimpole-street, looked at the paper, and had a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went in your way home through Mill-hill-mews - A. It was my nearest way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any body at the Rose public-house that you knew - A. No; I am not in the habit of frequenting public-house, unless to see the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night, was it a light night - A. Not moon light, but cloudy.</p>
               <p>Q. Mill-hill-mews, is that a light place - A. No, it is a dark place; it was light enough to see to read the name on the card; he held it up as though he read it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mill-hill-mews from your house - A. Perhaps five or six hundred yards; it may be near a quarter a mile; I think it is less than half a mile</p>
               <p>Q. This man walked with you, holding you by the sleeve to your house at twelve o'clock at night. How many watchman did you pass - A. Not one, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a watchhouse there for the inhabitants of Marybone - A. There may be. In my way home I do not recollect meeting a single watchman; my fears and terrors were great; I do not know that I met one single person.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you by the desire of the prosecuter, go to the Cumberland Arms - A. By the desire of Mr. Read, the Magistrate, I did at the instance of the prosecutor. I got into the house first, after I was in the prosecutor came in, the prisoner came in, and an old man.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were all in the room did you bear any part of the conversation - A. I did; there was a conversation about the young man going to sea in a faint voice by the old man; Mr. Gunning said, I understand that money was your object, I have mustered up ten pound, and that with the twenty pound you have already had if that will do I will give you that; Mr. Gunning appeared to be holding a note in his hand, in his waistcoat pocket. The old man's eyes were fixed on me. The prosecutor got up and said that is the man who obtained the twenty pound; I told the prisoner who I was, and took him in custody The old man said this now must be settled before the magistrate; I asked the old man to go with me; he said, he would go and get persons to speak in his son's character; he would be down there as soon as me. I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge that is alleged against me. I never demanded a farthing of the man in my life; he never gave me any money at all.</p>

After I drank in company I came down stairs in company with the serjeant of the 18th Hussars and four privates, and hearing a noise in the parlour where there were more than twenty people, it induced me to go into the room to see whether there was a man that would wish to engage with me. On my entering the room there were four coal porters; one of them asked me whether I was not a Don Cossack; I said I belonged to the 15th Hussars; they asked me if I thought they would do for recruits. I said I should be glad to take such fine men as them, and as I was going to the door I found the prisoner had got hold of my watch-chain and seals. I felt the watch go from my pocket. I seized the prisoner, took the watch from him, and pulled him into the room by force. Immediately the company arose in a disturbance; they said I was not robbed. I persisted that I was. The prisoner went and concealed himself at the upper end of the room; he was there five minutes. A man got upon the top of the chair or stool, he said, you scoundrel, how dare you say you have been robbed; do you know who robbed you; am I the person? I said, no. I went to the upper end of the room, and discovered the prisoner under the table. I gave charge of the prisoner, and surrendered my watch to the constable. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I took him in the house and searched him; I found five one-pound notes in his breeches pocket, and four watches, and some silver. I then took him to Tothill-fields bridewell. In the jail I again searched him, and in the lining of his waistcoat I found thirty-one pounds more in one-pound bank notes. They are nearly following numbers. These are the notes. I asked him how he came by the notes; he told me they were from his hard earnings; he had been down in Lincolnshire. The notes are all dated the 9th of August. He told me where he had bought the watches. I went to the house where he told me in Moorfields; I found he had bought them with one pound notes. I advertised the notes; Mr. M'Ritchie came forward and owned them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the notes that I received from Mr. Mackintosh's clerk on the Saturday night. They are the same numbers and the same notes, all of them.</p>

            . I am superintendant on the part of the East India Company, at their dock. The property in question is their property, and it was taken from their dock. I saw the prisoner in the Exciseman's office. On my seeing this bag I thought it was a systematick proceeding. I took the prisoner's hat; I found this bag; it went round the prisoner's hat. I then told the prisoner this seemed to be a systematick plan. The prisoner said it was the first time he had been persuaded by a man at Camberwell, a tailor, who had made these things. He said he got the tea from the Cumberland. I have seen the chests on board the Cumberland. I found a great number of the chests had been plundered of this tea.</p>

I searched him before he went out of the dock; about an hour after I searched him upon his coming out; his nose-bags were hanging on the shafts of the waggon, and these three bags of tea in it, and some hay on the top. The bags contained six pounds of green tea. I asked the prisoner how he came by it; he said he found it in the privy, and he wished to God that he had left it. He said the first time he saw it in the privy he was afraid of taking it for fear of being detected with it, but the second time he was determined to take it; and the first time he saw it there was only two bags, the second time there were three bags; he then took it; he was going out of the dock with it if I had not stopped him.</p>

               <p>Q. In June last was any thing done to your back parlour in that house - A. In the night when I went to bed the window was whole of the back parlour, and just before six o'clock I got up; the window was open, and my shawl was taken away. The window was shut when I went to bed. There was a little hole cut in the window big enough to put something in to move the fastening that fastened it down. I missed my shawl from off the line. I had seen my shawl the night before; it was wet; I hung it upon the line when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the shawl - A. It cost me a pound when new; it was worth six shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon it that you should know it - A. There was some oil upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they grown up - A. There was nobody at home but my wife, me, and him. My family are all grown up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On Saturday last this witness came into the court of Requests, and desired to speak with Mr. Johnson; he came and said to me, here are two fine gold seals, you will have a gold chain to match it if you will make a flaw in the indictment. I said, I would not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miller. Look at this paper; do you know the magistrate's hand-writing - A. Yes; that is the writing of

She put the three three-shilling pieces into my hand; she said she got them of a friend that slept with her the last night; I laid them on the bed. She denied having any more money; Mrs. Wilson insisted upon her being searched and stripped naked. I stepped out of the room; I heard Wilson exclaim, here is the money. She gave me a paper; I went into the room and asked the prisoner was this money found upon you; she said it was, but it was not Mrs. Freeman's.

               <p>Q. The number of the three large notes, the two twenty-pound and the twenty-five-pound note, did you take the number of the notes before you were robbed - A. After I was robbed I went to the bankers I took them of.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do; is there any mark upon them independant of the numbers you should know them - A. Yes; the mark over May, there is a kind of an impression on the paper that I had observed before I had lost them. It was over the letter M in May. The prisoners are the persons that shewed me the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards - A. I saw them the next morning, about ten o'clock at Lambeth-street.</p>

            . I am a cooper, at the London Docks, near the prisoner's station. There was a brandy cask that had been been recently plundered. On the 14th of July, I examined it about nine o'clock in the morning, it had been bored in the bouge of the cask; it appeared to me to be recently done; the cask contained brandy rather paler than is usually shipped to an English market. This bottle appeared to contain the same liquor; I have no doubt about it; the liquor in the stone bottle is the same that was in the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th a sailor, an old lodger of mine brought me this brandy on the South key, I told him I did not want any more than a glass. I put it by the side of the dock. On the 14th I took this brandy out from where I put it; when Clements asked me what it was; I said brandy; I got it from an old lodger of mine on the South key. I begged Mr. Slater to come with me to the ship on the South key to compare the brandy with the brandy on board the ship near the South key.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went by this house about ten minutes after three in the morning. I was looking after the watchmen; I heard a creeking in the house, which induced me to stop; in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner coming out at the back gate; I told him to stop or I would shoot him; I took him by the collar, and took him to the watchhouse, a young woman followed me out of the gate; I told her to follow me; after I had taken him to the watchhouse I went back to the house; I found two planes in a handkerchief that I had heard drop, and I found these two sashes, they had been taken out of the back parlour, and were taken up into the front bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gissing. How was this house left - A. The front door was locked, and the back door bolted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. There was a young woman taken up with him - A. Yes, she was discharged by the magistrate.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I have known the prisoner about five or six months; when I first knew him he lodged in Carnaby-market; he afterwards lodged at Somers-town, about two or three months after I removed his goods from Somers-town up to St. John's-lane, Paddington. Mr. Fidlers man assisted me; his name is Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did the prisoner apply to you to remove any thing else - A. Yes, about a month after that, it was on a Sunday, I do not know the day of the month; it is now about two or three months ago that I moved the press for him, on a Sunday morning, about a month after I moved the other goods; I removed the press from Baldwyn's-place, Baldwyn's-gardens, to Gwyn's stable, by the assistance of

               <p>Q. Where was Gwyn's stable - A. In Grafton-mews. He said there was something to pay, if I would move it and find a place to put it in for a little time, he would satisfy me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it removed from - A. I did not know the name then; I paid three shillings; they said that was owing for rent of the room; the prisoner told me there was some rent owing; they said that was the rent. I removed it into Gwyn's stable, and asked the favour for me to put it there a few days according to the prisoner's order; after that the prisoner came to me at the Three Compasses, in Holborn; he asked me if had ever seen any bad bank notes, and if I should like to pass any; (I lodged at the Compasses public-house then,) I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150032"/>said I should not like to pass them, I thought it was a dangerous case to pass them; we parted then. He called again upon me, after that he asked me to take some; I drank with him; he then said that he had worked at the Bank; he said if I would pass some I should soon make my fortune; I consented. I saw Gwyn after that; he said a young man had called upon him, and asked if that press was for sale; I said I did not know. I would enquire. I saw Foss after that; told him there was a person that wished to buy the press if it was for sale; he said he should not sell it; put it out of sight and let no one see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards do any thing with the press - A. Yes; Gwyn and me removed it over to the coach-house, opposite his stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner there - A. Yes; he called upon me afterwards, he asked me to walk up to his house; I went to him one evening, and Gwyn with me; he was not at home then; his wife said he was down at the shop in Crawford-street; we saw him at a public-house in Crawford-street. He asked me then to get him a stone as soft as I possibly could; I said I did not know that I could get a stone; I though Gwyn might, as he was so much among the stone-masons. Gwyn got the stone, and we walked up with it to Foss's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the stone given to - A. After that we gave the stone to Foss in the public-house, Crawford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards do any thing with the press - A. Yes; he came down to us; we walked down to the stable together; he desired us to move the press from the coach-house into the stall in the stable; he said that would do for the purpose that he should want it for. We moved it there by his order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing with it - A. Not that time; soon afterwards the press was put up in the stall.</p>
               <p>COURT. When - A. When we removed the press over, then it was put up; after that he came with some paper, and wished us to go the Grafton Arms. Grafton-mews, and in the parlour he produced some paper of two sorts; he asked which would be the best to make Bank notes; I told him I did not know; I thought he was the best judge; he said that was what they called Bank post paper; he thought that would be the best to make Bank notes of. After that we met at the Goat and Compasses Fitzroy-square; he desired Gwyn and me to get some old coal or charcoal, and a saucepan to make a fire; we got charcoal on the Friday evening. He met us again between eight and nine o'clock at the Goat and Compases; Gwyn and we went down to the stable to get a light; Foss got whiting and some oil himself; Gwyn got a light; we all went up stairs together in the room over the coach-house; Gwyn and I lit the fire; Foss made a rim round the stone to pour the pewter in the stone, and I and Gwyn melted the pewter; when the pewter was melted and poured on the stone Foss said he thought it would not do; he touched the stone up again with a knife, and made a rim round the stone; we melted the pewter; he poured the pewter on the stone again.</p>
               <p>Q. What then - A. After that he turned it out again; he said he thought the pewter would do very well; then he mixed some oil and some black on the back part of the stone; we all three went down stairs together; he tried the pewter plate on some of the blank paper; he said it would do; after that he rubbed the blacking on the copper plate, rubbed it off with a rag, and rubbed the copper plate with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced the copper plate - A. Mr. Foss produced it; he wiped his hand over with whiting and laid the plate on the plank, after he rubbed it over he put a slip of paper over the line of London and the date of the year; he told me it was London and the date of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot read yourself - A. No, I am no scholar myself. He applied another piece of paper for the purpose of making a Bank note, and run it through the press; after that he applied another plate with the line of London, and the date of the year; he told me so; after that we run it through the press again; I turned the press, and Gwyn held the light; we made five or six that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something about the water mark - A. We run it through the press for the water mark. This is the pewter plate; the paper was put on this, and run through the press afterwards. This is the stone; here is where he mixed the blacking on it; after this was done we went up stairs all three of us together; he wrote on one corner of all the notes, six of them; he gave me two, Gwyn two, and kept the rest himself. We parted that evening; he appointed to meet us on the Saturday again.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plates and materials in the mean time - A. We left them on the table up stairs. Gwyn had the key of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he say any thing to you about these notes that had been made - A. He appointed to meet us again, told us not to part with these notes, they would not do, he would make some better. He met us on the Saturday evening to tell us not to part with the Bank notes; then he appointed to meet us on the Sunday morning if I could get any burnt oil in Long Acre. I got it early on Monday morning, I took it to Gwyn, and we met on the Monday night at the Goat and Compasses, and the same thing was done again in the same manner as before; about forty only were made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing written upon them - A. Yes, Mr. Foss wrote upon them at the corner; Mr. Foss took some away with him. I did not take any that evening. The room was locked up as before, and the notes were left on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any direction what was to be done with the materials - A. He told me to remove the press, and take it away as soon as I could, and the plates likewise, except one plate he wished to be left. There were three plates. I took them to

               <p>Q. Did any body write upon these notes before you went - A. I saw Gwyn write upon some of them; then we went with them to Billericay fair. I passed one at a butcher's shop, another at a public-house, and the remainder I bid fifteen pound for a horse; I gave nine of them for a horse, and the other six pound in good money.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Foss - A. Yes. The first time I ever saw him was about six weeks before I was taken in custody. It is now about thirteen weeks since I first saw him. I first knew him by going with Norman to his house in St. John's-lane. The first transaction was, he asked me to get him a stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, some things had been removed to a place of yours - A. Not to my knowledge that it was his then. A press had been removed; that was first placed in my stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a stable to which persons had occasionally to resort - A. Yes; I kept a horse and cart first. The first press stood public just as you opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, you say the prisoner asked you to procure him a stone - A. Yes, a soft stone as I could possibly get, about ten inches by six. I procured him the stone, and delivered it him. I afterwards saw the stone in his possession, about a week after I had given it him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the stone after it had been in his possession about a week - A. There was the word one, and flourishes round it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that stone, and say whether that is it - A. I have every reason to believe that is the stone. When he first shewed me that stone he had hid it in a field. He gave me the stone to take care of until I should see him again. The next time we met at the Goat and Compasses.

             was with me and Foss at the Goat and Compasses; he asked to go down to my stable. We went there to look at the press. The press was removed; it had been removed by me and Norman to the opposite side of the mews, to a coach-house. He asked us to move it into the stable, at one particular place in the stable; he said that would answer the purpose that he wanted at present. It was removed accordingly. He said he would meet us again in a few days at the Goat and Compasses. We met there. He asked us to go to a public-house where we were not so well known. We went from the Goat and Compasses to another public-house. We went into the front parlour to ourselves entirely; there was no one it: we had a pot of porter; he pulled out a sample of paper, which he shewed to Norman; he called it bank post paper, and asked Norman which he thought was best to make bank notes. Norman told him he did not exactly know, the prisoner must be the best judge. The prisoner fixed upon one; he said he thought that would do. He said that was what they called bank post paper. He said he would call again in a few days and leave the plates. He came again on the following Monday or Tuesday, and brought the plates to me. He brought three copper-plates. I had not seen any before he left them in my possession. I looked at them. He told me he would meet me and Norman in a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they plates of this description - A. Yes, sir; this is one of them, and that is another.</p>
               <p>Q. You can read - A. Yes. I can swear to these two; that is one of three that he left me. He mentioned the night that he would meet us again, which was the Thursday evening, at the same public-house, the Goat and Compasses, and told us to get some charcoal or old coal to make a fire to melt some pewter down. We got some charcoal. We went to the stable where the press was; Norman, me, and Foss went to the stable. On Friday the prisoner met me and Norman at the Goat and Compasses; he ordered me to light a fire with the charcoal. He made a rim round this stone with some whiting and water while we melted the pewter. He poured the pewter into the mould, and after it was hard he turned it over and looked at it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the marks resemble the marks on the pewter plate - A. It did. He said that would not do, there was a deficiency in it. The marks then were not so strong as they are now. He ordered us to melt the pewter over again, and while we were melting the pewter he touched the stone with a knife that he took out of his pocket to make the impression deeper, and then the mould was run over again, and when it was hard he turned it over again and thought it would do. I believe that to be the pewter plate in the amended form. After that he turned the stone on the other side, and mixed some blacking and oil, which I delivered to him. Norman, me, and the prisoner went to the stable where the press was fixed by the prisoner's order; the first thing he tried was the pewter plate upon a piece of blank paper, to see whether it would do or not. He put the pewter upon the plank of the press, with the blank paper on it, and run it through the press. After it came off he said he thought it would do, it had the appearance of water marks. The next thing he rubbed some of the blacking that he had been mixing up on this copper plate, and after that he rubbed the blacking off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Mr. Harper, attend to this part of the witness's evidence; perhaps you may be asked some questions upon it by-and-by.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150034"/>Gwyn. He rubbed some blacking over the copperplate marked No. 1, and then he wiped it off with a rag. After he had prepared the plate he put it on the plank of the press; he put a slip of paper over the date line; he put a piece of paper over it, and run it through the press; then he took the plate, No. 2, rubbed the ink in the date line only, and rubbed it off as before. He put the same paper over it, in order that the paper should take the number from No. 2. The next thing we went up stairs; he wrote the signature to each of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he make - A. To the best of my knowledge, six or seven. He went up stairs, carrying those which had been printed into the room above; he there sat down and wrote the signature to each of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what the signature was - A. The signature of White. He then gave me two and Norman two, and the rest he kept himself. He said he would meet us on the next evening at the Goat and Compasses, between eight and nine o'clock. He met us accordingly at the same house; he said it was too late to get some burnt oil; he asked Norman to get him some on the following morning; if he could get it to bring it to him: he could go to work without us. Foss came on the Sunday morning to me; we had not got the oil, being Sunday. At that meeting on the Sunday morning he told us if we had not passed the notes not to pass them; they were bad, and would not do. I had not passed them, nor Norman. We both destroyed them together. We met again on the Monday evening at the Goat and Compasses between eight and nine o'clock. We then went to the stable as before, and made about forty.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say we, you mean you three - A. Yes. They were made the same way as the others. After the impressions had been taken from the plate we went up stairs. The prisoner then put the signature as before, the same name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at this, and tell me whether you believe this to be one made of that batch on the Monday - A. I have reason to believe this to be one of them by the signature, and by the general face of it; 1813 in the date line, and then in the Bank of England line there the year is 1812.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. The top of the note is 1812, the other is 1813. What name is written on the back of that note - A. Thorowgood. I wrote that upon the back of it by the prisoner's order, for it to appear as though it had passed to other people before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow that direction of his by writing a name to every one of the notes for the purpose of circulating them - A. Yes, upon all, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then seeing the name of Thorowgood written by yourself, have you any doubt that is one of the notes you took of him for the purpose of circulation - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Norman cannot write - A. No, to the best of my knowledge he cannot. I wrote the name upon them; any name that first came into my head; no name in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these notes, and see if there is any thing written by you upon each of them - A. Yes, there is. I find some name written by me upon every one of them. I am certain they are every one the notes of his making.</p>
               <p>Q. After these forty were made what was done next - A. He went up stairs and wrote the signature upon each of them, and then ordered me and Norman to move the press as soon as we possibly could. We were to move the press, and all the plates but this No. 1, that was to be left behind. He intended to take the date line out, and the number line out, and put a fresh one in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any distribution of notes made - A. No. He ordered us to take a house in the country, that he might; have an house to go to work. He said by that means we should soon make our fortunes. He was to work two or three days in a week. He wrote upon the back of the notes, them he took away with him, and left the rest for me and Norman to circulate as soon as we could. I passed two to a woman of the name of Jones; these were two that the prisoner made in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with Norman to Billericay - A. Yes; that is my native place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass any - A. No. Norman bought a horse; he paid nine of these notes that were made by the prisoner, upon which I wrote some names on the Sunday morning before we started.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the nine that he paid in part of fifteen pound for the mare were part of those that you saw him make - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. After Norman had made his payment he was suspected and apprehended, and you were apprehended too - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were taken did you state this circumstance - A. Not while I was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. I say, when you were in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you stated this circumstance to Mr. Kay did you know that Norman had made any confession - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How many notes did you utter - A. Five.</p>
               <p>Q. That is five capital offences. Are you out of employment - A. No, I am in the yeast line.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know, I dare say, there was any harm in it - Witness paused.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give me an answer. Why are you so dumb all at once; you have been so glib in telling your story - A. I have been telling the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not believe all that men swear - A. I do believe there is harm in it now.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the discovery - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the time that you were in the hands of the officer that you made the discovery. You must have known at the time that these things were made in a coach-house that there was harm in it at that time - A. I could not think it was any good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know it was a very wicked crime - A. I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this great town - A. Some years. I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Norman was caught at Billericay - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Each of you thought it better to save your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150035"/>own necks - A. We thought it better to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You would rather any man to be hanged than yourself - A. I suppose that is every man's feeling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. You have given a true account of the circumstance - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not know that Norman had given any account - A. I did not, sir.</p>

Mr. Foss came to me in the beginning of February to come and look at two presses that he wanted to sell then; while he was there he looked at a press. He afterwards came back and asked the price of the press that was at our shop. I have seen the press since. That is the press that he had of us. This is the plank to the press, and these are the blocks that belong to it. Mr. Hanson agreed with him for the press; he offered eight guineas and the two presses.

I told him there was a room in the house where I lived, if that would do, in Baldwin's-gardens. I agreed with the landlady of my house for the room for eighteen-pence a week. I carried the press from Mr. Hanson's with another porter, and put it up in that room. I think I took a written order for it.

             - A. Yes; I have seen the prisoner and Norman together down at the Compasses in Holborn, and also at my own house.</p>
               <p>MR. HARPER. I am an engraver and printer, employed by the Bank of England. Early in April, 1806, I became acquainted with the prisoner; he was my assistant in that employ from April, 1806, to November, 1810; he was only a <rs id="t18130915-50-deflabel301" type="occupation">printer</rs>

               <p>Q. Look at these plates, you have examined them before - A. I have looked at the notes, and the body of the notes is taken from No. 1, excluding the date line; the date line, excluding every thing else, is taken from No. 2; so there is the circumstance of 12 and 13 occurring in two parts of the note. The witness gave a very correct description of it, putting a piece of paper over it; I have no doubt it is so manufactured.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature, T. White do you believe that to be the prisoner's hand writing - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the back of that bank note I now hand to you; do you find the name of Johnson upon the back of it - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find the word cash upon the back of it - A. I do; I think that is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the face of that, and see whether it appears to be made in the same manner as note A. appears to be - A. Yes; I am sure it is composed of part of these two plates. The name of the signing clerk is much the characters of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. As to all that is printed, you have no doubt it is printed from these two plates - A. I am sure of it, by stopping out each with a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I hand you a bundle of notes, which I call C. these eight notes upon the outside is marked C. - A. These all appear to be manufactured in the same way. I believe the signatures to be the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that plank, apply one of these plates to it, does it appear to you that plates of that size have been used to that plank - A. It exactly covers the marks. One of these plates called A, is on it now; these plates are capable of making that impression on it. I have no doubt it has been so used. I have examined the pewter plate; there is every thing necessary for making bad bank notes This pewter plate has been cast from this stone; it would give the water mark by bruising the surface of the paper.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentleman of the Jury, I stand before you with all the fortitude a man in my situation can be supposed to possess; not from the effect of hardihood or want of knowing that a just application and impartiality in which every men's case is treated by the jury, assisted by the learned charge, which is delivered by the learned judge, to each man accused; I must take the chance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150037"/>as well as other men, and trust my case with the Court and Jury. If this had been an action for forty I night have had the assistance of counsel to have pleaded in my behalf. Not so now; I am compelled to explain the circumstances which may have run in my favour, although I am obliged to go by the established practice of our criminal code. With deference I submit how improbable it is that I, who have been four years and a half in the Bank of England, should send out notes with 1812 at the top, and 1813 at the bottom, which at first inspection would appear to be bad notes; but how much unlike myself, who had been in the habit of printing bank notes. A man not invested with education would not have acted so as to be accessary to such base conduct. Surely it cannot but be supposed that I should have acted otherwise, instead of bringing forth such things as were sure of detection. With respect to the evidence of Mrs. Elms, can it be supposed that she would destroy the plate of a stranger. No, gentlemen, it was her brother's property; her brother prompted her to do it, them knowing the circumstance of Norman and Gwyn. They disowned each other, and persisted in it, until they were informed the other party had impeached; then the plan of my destruction was fabricated, and these men, to save themselves, would sacrifice not only me, but the whole court. Gentlemen, you see the danger of relying on circumstantial evidence. The present aweful sessions exhibits a melancholy instance of the danger of circumstantial evidence. Some time ago the late Haggerty and Holloway forfeited their lives upon evidence founded solely upon an accomplice, and now at this sessions another person has been indicted for the same offence.</p>

I cried out once or twice at the time, and struggled, and when he tried for my watch I was so tired with struggling that I could not cry out; then they were about three minutes in getting my watch out of my pocket. When they had got my watch they let loose my arms; then the prisoner gave something to one of the other men; I thought it was my watch that he had given him. I collared him as soon as I had power; I took him by the coat, and the other two men ran towards Gracechurch-street; he ran the contrary way, with me holding him. I cried out, stop thief, as long as I well could, and when he had ran a few yards he stopped; he took hold of me round by the body; he lifted me off the stones two or three times, and twisted me about to fling me. I put out all my strength, and would not let him fling me. He got loose from me; I followed him, and kept nearly up to the side of him; as he ran I cried out stop thief, until he was stopped. I am sure he is the man; I never lost sight of him. He took my watch, a seal to my ribbon and key, and five three-shilling pieces.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th it was my night to be out; I heard the cry of stop thief, as I was in Lombard-street watchhouse; I immediately ran down the street; I laid hold of the prisoner by the Post office; I asked who it was that he had robbed. The prosecutor came and said that he had been robbed of his watch and money. I found the box of the watch close to us. The case was blown off; the watch was in the street; there is some dirt on it now. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>

            . About a quarter past twelve, I was proceeding up Lombard-street in my way home, on Monday night, I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately looked round, and saw the prisoner running very fast, as though he was pursued; before he came to the spot where I seized him, he upset a man; a man attempted to seize him before me, and at the corner of St. Swithin's-lane I seized him; he instantly cried out he was not the man, but I still kept hold of him; when he found that I would not let him go he stooped down, and threw the watch into the street; I kept hold of him until the constable came up, and took him to the watchhouse. I looked round for the watch, and found it, and the case; I gave it into the custody of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence On this night I was coming down Cheapside; I had been drinking with a cousin, a west country-bargeman; this gentleman was fighting in the street; I picked up his hat off the the ground; I put it on his head; he had a woman with him; she said he had lost his watch; I said you had better see whether he has lost his watch or no. I then proceeded up Lombard-street, then I run, and when I came in the watchhouse he did not say any thing about his money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you serve a public-house in Grub-street with beer - A. Yes; the Weavers Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the custom for the benefit society that was held at that house to deposit money in your hands - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time who were the trustees of that benefit, society -

               <p>Q. At that time had they money in your hands - A. They had considerably above sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that check your signature - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is the body of that check - A. Mr. Grose's, the prisoner; the filling up is in the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you hold in your hand the check-book, with the counterpart of the check - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the counterpart - A. 8th of July, Rickards and Boller, sixty pounds, interest eleven shillings, and by the side of it is casting up the interest, which is usual sixty-six days interest, from May the 3rd; that is the prisoner's hand writing. I rather think I was engaged at the time that I signed it. The accompting house that I sit in is remote from the accompting-house to which persons come.</p>
               <p>Q. By the number of the checks signed that day, does it appear to be late or early in that day - A. There are but three checks signed that day. I cannot exactly tell by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, refer to your books for the entry I have already alluded to; how lately before had you made your annual rest - A. I cannot exactly say; the time we finish is the nearest Saturday to Michaelmas day. June the 27th was he rest day in this instance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find any entry in the prisoner's hand writing which applies to this transaction - A. Yes; there is one through three of the books of his hand writing; this is the Trade Ledger; the entry that I fix upon there is Bollam and Company, on the debtor side, to cash sixty pound eleven shillings; that is the hand writing of the prisoner; on the credit side, 27th June, by stock sixty pound, and July 10th, profit and loss, interest, sixty pounds eleven shillings; these entries are in the prisoner's hand writing. The next book in which you find it is the Trade Journal; on the 10th of July, Bollen and Company, to cash paid them, sixty pounds eleven shillings. The Cash Journal, 10th July, Boller and Company, notes and interest, sixty pounds eleven shillings; I believe it is note and interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any concern with any such person as Bollam and Company - A. No, sir; nor Ballon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any concern with Boller, excepting Rickards and Boller - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these entries ticked off, as if they had been examined - A. Yes, in the New Ledger; I cannot say by whom the ticking is, the writing; except in the Cash Journal, the note and interest, one part is Mr. Howson's, and other part Mr. Thorton senior; that is a superscription from the back of the counter check.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these entries in the book, copied as they are from the counter part of the check, did they serve to prevent any detection until they made their next annual rest - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. That next next annual rest you made last Midsummer - A. As near to it as we could, and when we came to that we found a deficiency of sixty pounds eleven shillings; that caused a great deal of examination, and ended in this discovery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you had no connection with Bollam and Company, or Bollen and Company - A. No, our only connection was with Rickards and Boller.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Thornton. Take these notes into your hand, and tell me whether you find the prisoner's hand writing upon any of them; look at the 5,200 - A. I. H. Grose, the prisoner's name, and East Smithfield, and Goodwin and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the Ledger - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Howson. Look at these notes, do you find any entry upon the back of them - A. Yes, I do; 5,193, and 93, here is Mr. Grose's name, written by himself; I suppose I received them of the prisoner. I know no other person of that name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask the present witness whether he was in the habit of paying money for Messrs. Goodwin and Co. - A. I was; the prisoner and other clerks likewise did, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose business was it to make the entries in the Cash Journal - A. I have generally done it; it appears I was absent that day, and I suppose the prisoner put it in; there are three or four entries of mine before that, and I believe the prisoner asked me to put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that I asked you to put it in - A. No. I cannot; I suppose so. I should have entered it without. There was a counter part in the Check book.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no money paid but what goes through your hands - A. Yes, there is; I have been in the habit of paying cash, but not checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you put any date to the note that you received of me, or had it been endorsed before - A. That I cannot say; if it had I should have put the name of the person upon it that I received it of.</p>
               <p>Q. You received it as a private note, and not in the way of business - A. I can say I received it of you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not prepared to make any defence for myself; the gentlemen of the jury as well as your lordship, have heard the crime that I am charged with; the last witness has summed up the whole of it; he does not know when he received it of me, or whether it was in his possession before, and to the last question I put to him he gave a very evasive answer. I am perfectly innocent of it. I trust you have seen enough of the case.</p>

On the constable being sent for, and proceeding to search him it was found I think in three other pockets, different parcels; the whole weighed three pounds and a half; he was then conducted into the work-room, where he worked in a box, of which he kept the key, we found six pounds and half more; the prisoner acknowledged that he had taken it from Mr. Maud's premises, and hoped we would not hurt him for it.</p>

In about half an hour afterwards he brought the articles in question; I agreed to give him seven guineas for the whole; four pounds he took in money, and the remainder he was to have the next day in two jackets and a pair of trowsers. I did not buy the watch, nor did I see the watch. He called on the next day; I said, I do not like these goods, if you will return me the four pounds you shall have the things again; he said he would bring the four pounds if I would give him the goods back, he could get a ready market for them any where; when I paid him the four pounds I saw him give the money to somebody at the door; he told the Lord Mayor that he sold them for another person.

I was going up Skinner-street, towards the city; I heard a person close after me; I looked behind me, and I saw the prisoner close behind me. I went on; he kept close after me until I got into Newgate-street; I clapped my hand to my pocket, put my handkerchief further in. When I came into Newgate-street, at a bookseller's shop, people were standing there; I could not pass so well. The prisoner was closer to me than before. I kept on, but not quite so fast as before, and then the prisoner was closer upon me than before; then I felt a twitch at my pocket. I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I looked round, and saw the prisoner going on the other side of the street, and I had lost my handkerchief. I followed the prisoner. As soon as I began to follow him he began to run. I cried stop thief, and he threw the handkerchief into a cart; I saw him do that; he threw the handkerchief in the cart; I took it out, and still pursued him. He ran into Christ's Hospital, and in the square he was caught. I have no doubt he was the person. I saw his person previous to his doing the act. I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man. There was no person running away but himself; there were several pursuing of him. He appeared to have no accomplice whatever. The officer has the handkerchief.</p>

I took him to the accompting-house, and coming up the yard to the accompting-house he dropped two weights.

Bradley attended to him; he shewed him a bundle. Bradley, after he had shewed them the prisoner, brought to me to count them; he said he missed a piece. I counted them; there were nine pieces. Bradley said he counted them before he shewed them the prisoner; there were then ten pieces. Bradley left that bundle with me. He went to get another parcel to shew the prisoner, and after some time he missed a piece from that parcel; he then told me that the prisoner had got another piece from that parcel. There was no other customer at the counter where the prisoner was. The prisoner hesitated a long time, and said there was none to suit him. I then went up to the prisoner, and said, as you do not want to buy, I must take from you what you have stolen. I lifted up his waistcoat, and saw ten black silk handkerchiefs under one arm. I took them from him, and four coloured silk handkerchiefs dropped from under his other arm. They cost me more than fifty-four shillings.</p>

            . I shewed the prisoner the black silk handkerchiefs; first I counted them; there were ten pieces in that bundle; he did not choose any of them. I perceived they were one piece short; I took them to Mr. Hayward to count; he made nine; there should have been ten. I shewed him some coloured ones. I laid six pieces before him; they contained different quantities; he said they were too dear. I missed one piece from them. I saw Mr. Hayward take one parcel from the prisoner, and I saw the other parcel drop from him. The prisoner bought nothing; he spoke English very well then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a Malay and Sidah do any thing - A. Yes, I saw Sidah roasting a potatoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did a quarrel arise between them about a potatoe - A. Yes; the quarrel began with them both; one said it is mine, and the other said it was his; at last they began fighting; the Malay took his shoe, and knocked him; Sidah, after being knocked by the Malay, he set off. The Malays wanted to tie up Sidah and flog him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Malays were there at first - A. Seven or eight. They took him to tie him up; they did not tie him up; they said they would fight.</p>

               <p>Q. Who talked of fighting - A. The Malays. The prisoner said, what do you want; come along, and fight. All the Sidahs were quiet, but when the Malays came out against the Sidahs then they began fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fight - A. Yes, the Sidahs had sticks, and the Malays had knives and scrapers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the prisoner had - A. The prisoner had a Batavian knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay to see them fight - A. I saw the fighting; I ran away into my own room. The Sidahs came into the same room where I was sitting.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150043"/>Q. What did the Sidahs come into that room for - A. To hide themselves from flogging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man that is dead come into that room - A. Sidah was sitting in that room; he ran away first. The Sidahs shut the door; the Malays got in at the window. Abdulah got in at the window. When the Malays came in, the Malays beat the Sidahs with their sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Abdulah do any thing - A. I saw him stab Sidah with a knife upon his belly. I saw him stab Sidah with the knife with my own eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. What nation are the Sidahs - A. Madsgascars.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSEY. I am a pupil at the London hospital. I was there when the deceased was brought in. The deceased had a wound in the belly, on the right side of the abdomen, which extended into the cavity; likewise a wound in his right loins. I attended him until his death. He died in two days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of his death - A. The wound in his belly; it appeared to be done with a knife. He was brought in a dying state. He had received a mortal wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were fighting. I do not know who stabbed the knife.</p>

I immediately collared the prisoner; he knocked me down and made his escape.

After Smith had been before the magistrate Taylor and Turner, at eight o'clock, followed her; as we were conveying her to New prison they asked us to let her have something to drink at the Jolly Cooper. They drank together, and talked together. Limbrick told me these men answered the description that he had of them; he took them in custody.</p>

I observed her hand upon that single piece of cambric, that made me look more particular at her. I had suspicion of her when she came in. At last she fixed upon a cambric, and asked for three nails, and while I was cutting it I observed her take a piece of cambric from the counter, and throw it under her arm. I cut the piece of cambric for her, and moved the cambric from off the counter. I gave her the change, and while I was stooping for the paper I observed her put the cambric that she had stolen under her apron. After I had given her the change I charged her with stealing a piece of cambric.</p>

               <p>Q. You observed her steal it - A. Yes. She denied having the cambric at first; I told her I must search her, upon which she put her hand into her apron and threw the cambric behind the counter. This is the piece of cambric; it is the property of my employers. The value of it is six shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he bring any more than one trumpet at a time - A. No. On the 19th of January last he pawned two bugle horns for one pound one shilling in the name of Turner. He has pawned several times at our house. I am positive to his person. I produce the property.</p>

On Sunday morning master sent me into the field to see if any body was milking the cows; the mare and colt were there, the colt had her bowels out; a man was sent to let him know; about eight o'clock I let him know; he said I did it; I said I did not; I cannot say whether the cow did or not. One of the cows had lost her calf, it was vicious; she might have done it.</p>

I saw Mr. Webb pick up the veil. The prisoner did not strike me until after he got the veil. It was a sudden snatch, the taking of the veil, and the miniature.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your suspicion at last fall upon the prisoner - A. Not before I received information. The prisoner's house is next door to mine; his yard is in a direct line to mine, with a wall about seventeen feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner carry on any business with your permission - A. Certainly he did, and I wished him to do it; I had a good opinion of him; he was my confidential man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you recollect any body going out of your house on the very day that the prisoner desired you to mark the hair - A. On the night it was stolen I certainly did observe one of the women go out bulky.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you the hair cloth for that purpose - A. He did; from Mr. M'Kenzie's premises into his own; he handed it over the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hand over the quantity that you wanted, or a larger quantity - A. A larger quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you by his desire cut off for the work - A. Four yards and a half, which covered the seats of six chairs; I cut it off on the prisoner's premises in the back-house; I took the remainder into his parlour, because it should not lay in the back-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had given information to the prosecutors were you shewn the hair-cloth again - A. I said I should know it again by some marks that were on it; it was a chalk mark that I found on it. This is the hair-cloth that was fetched from Mr. M'Kenzie's press, and shewn me; it is in small pieces now; it has the marks on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you receive the brass nail - A. I received one thousand over the wall, by Mr. Best; they were used when they were wanted for this job; the covering of the chairs took about a day; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150049"/>was about the middle of June; it was handed over to me in the middle of the day.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner asking you to buy a thousand nails - A. Yes; I purchased them of the person that the prosecutor dealt with; I delivered them to Mr. Best's servant, at his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Large. Did the prisoner any time in June last, apply to you for permission to take any haircloth, curled hair, or nails - A. Never; if he had I should have put them down in the Waste-book.</p>
               <p>COURT. We have heard from your master that the prisoner advanced to the partnership a quantity of horse hair, and he believes that to be so; did you make any entry of that for the credit of the prisoner - A. I never did; I never knew it until I learned it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose duty would it have been to have made an entry of that - A. Mine, undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever applied to you to take this hair-cloth, curled-hair, or nails - A. He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, we have heard of something that passed at Bow-street, that he lent to your manufactory; did you know that - A. I did know of an advance.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was that - A. One dozen only; that was not entered; he said Christmas was very near, he would lend us that, and pay himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked Mr. Blissett's leave to take this double hair-cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. to Mr. Blissett. The whole piece originally was the prisoner's, you did not want so large a quantity as that - A. No; I told him if he wanted any of the hair-cloth to take it from us, and put it down in the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is he credited in the book a whole piece - A. He is; this is the book; twenty-two yards of satin hair-cloth, sixty-four pounds and seven-pence, April, 1813. It is still remaining in account between us, and the balance not settled; he was to have any part of it; I said, take it if you want it, put it down in the book.</p>

On the 27th of June, about half after ten at night, I fell in company with the prisoner in Whitechapel; I had been to see an acquaintance in Spitalfields; I fell in company with the woman at the corner of Essex-street, Whitechapel; I asked her the way to Execution-dock, I wanted to go to Deptford; I thought I could cross from Execution-dock to Deptford. I was the worse for liquor. She said it was late, I had better come and get a bed; I said. I would rather go home. She catched me by the breast, she said come along, go to bed, you cannot get home.

I said, I would not sleep there; she shoved me down, and said I must strip and go to bed; she pushed me down on the bed, she pulled my watch out of my fob; she ran out of the room with my watch, and shut the door. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch since - A. Yes; at the pawnbroker's. I gave five guineas for it; I had it three years; it is worth two guineas. I remained in the room about a quarter of an hour; being a stranger I did not know what to do, and then a man shoved the door open, and muttered some words in a threating tone of voice; he collared me, and knocked me down; I got up, and struck him, and scratched his face; he did not say what he was. When I scratched his face, he knocked me down again, and when I was getting up, he shoved me out of the room; my hat fell off; he took it up and looked at it, and threw it out of the room after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since - A. No. He followed me into the passage, and struck me; this room was up two pair of stairs. A man opened the door in his shirt, with a candle in his hand; the man left me alone, and went to him, he called him Jack; he said see the way this fellow has left my face, shewing his face to the man; I saw his face then, it was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner at the bar - A. He was about the size of him, I cannot swear to the man. Jack shut the door, and he knocked me down again in the passage, and there I laid till day light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last blow deprive you of your senses - A. Yes, entirely; I lay in a gore of blood until the morning; I could not see out of my eyes; when I got up I went into the opposite room to where I had been robbed; I told a woman and a man how I had been robbed; they directed me to go to Lambeth-street office. I went to the office; I described the woman to Dalton, the officer, and the prisoner; the woman was brought to the office; I knew her again. I told the officer I was quite sure she was the woman that robbed me of my watch, and I now say upon my oath, she is the woman.</p>

On my hearing the blades of the scissars move I put my hand down and saw my seals were gone. I saw the prisoner run away from me; I ran after him, and caught hold of him by the collar; he struggled to get away: he asked me what I wanted; he put his hand to his jacket pocket, and appeared to throw something away. I charged him with stealing my seals; he said he had not got them. They were picked up near to where he stood. The person that picked them up does not appear. These are the seals that were cut from my ribbon. A pair of scissars was picked up; another person, his name is Catling; he produced the scissars from behind the prisoner; he put them on his shoulder. The prisoner said they were not his.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received were you induced to go to M'Gibbs's house, in Fitzroy-square - A. I was. That was on the 27th of May last. I was there introduced to the prisoner. I knew her before; she gets her bread by making bad money, and putting it off. A conversation arose that I wanted some bad money; she said that she could serve me with any quantity; her mother was by at the time; I knew her. The prisoner whispered to me, and told me that she took a good deal more pains with her goods than her mother did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by goods - A. Counterfeit shillings. She finished the counterfeit shillings better than her mother did. I asked her how she sold them; she said forty-four for a pound, two bad ones for a good one, and four over in a pounds-worth. She appointed to meet me at a public-house in St. Martin's-lane. On the 28th I agreed to meet her in St. Martin's-lane; a man came with her; she called him her husband: his name is

I waited in the street until she came out; she said she had another person to serve and then she would go in doors and serve me. She went up a court to this person, and then returned to me. We walked together to a gateway, and then there she gave me twenty-two counterfeit shillings; I gave her ten shillings, two three-shilling bank tokens and four shillings in silver.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get that money that you paid her - A. Matthews, the officer, marked it and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money afterwards - A. It was produced to me. It was the same money that Matthews had given to me, and had marked in my presence before he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these twenty-two shillings - A. Matthews, the officer, has got them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the last witness at the Sun public-house on the 29th of May I marked two three-shilling bank tokens and four shillings; I gave them to Herbert. This is the marked money that I took from the prisoner, and these are the twenty-two shillings that I had of Herbert.</p>

            . Q. You are the assistant solicitor of the Mint. You have been long in the habit of proving money: look at these twenty-two, and tell me whether they are all counterfeit - A. These twenty-two are all counterfeits; they appear all alike, and they appear not to have been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Mrs. Fitzroy; she made me a gown. I went up to her on Sunday night; I saw Mrs. Tuhoy and this man, Herbert; they deal in bad shillings and bad notes; they asked me if I wanted any. I said I wanted nothing of the kind.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150052"/>I had but fourteen shillings and sixpence. On the Saturday Mrs. Tuhoy borrowed ten shillings of me; they both said would I have any thing to drink. We went to the corner of the street, to the wine vaults. Herbert treated me. I said to Mrs. Tuhoy, will you give me the ten shillings that I lent you on Saturday; she said she had not got it; here is twenty-two shillings. I replied I would have nothing of the kind. She said, Mr. Herbert, if you will lend me ten shillings I will pay you on the Monday. Herbert gave me the ten shillings, but the twenty-two shillings I did not give him at all. They found the ten shillings on me which they say is marked.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner for several years about the town, but not where her place of dealing was until I had information of Tuhoy. I went with Tuhoy to the house of Mr. M'Gibbs, in a passage leading from Fitzroy-market to Tottenham-court-road. I think it was on the 25th of May I was introduced to her by Tuhoy; we got in conversation; she gave me to understand that she served the person who owned the house with bad money; she agreed to serve me also; she said she sold two for one. She agreed to let me have five or six in the evening; she could not let me have more; Old Abel, the cutter, had got drunk and disappointed her. I have heard Abel talked of, he is a button-maker. She came in the evening to M'Gibbs in the court; she served me six counterfeit shillings; I gave her her a three shilling bank token. We had something to drink; these parties were there; I drank with them. She produced a quantity of bad shillings with rough edges, just as they came from the cutter. She then said I might have any quantity I wanted the next day. I met with her on the next day at M'Gibbs's, and then I gave information to the assistant solicitor of the Mint. Matthews was waiting on the opposite side of the way, and a son of mine was present too. I bought some more money of the prisoner. We thought of detecting her then. She was apprehended on Sunday the 28th.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Herbert and his son on both days when he went to the house of M'Gibbs; I staid at a public-house right opposite. I saw Herbert go in. On Sunday I apprehended the prisoner in Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square; her husband was with her; she nudged him and said, there is one of the Hatton Garden traps. I stepped up some steps of a gentleman's door; I saw her give a blueish rag in his hand, there appeared to be something wrapped in it. I came down the steps; they both ran away immediately; she ran into a public-house. When I got in she was having a glass of gin at the bar. I took her to the office. I went after the man; I met him in Tottenham-street. He came behind me and struck me. He threw a blue rag from him that was like the rag that had passed from the prisoner. Herbert gave me the money.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 12th of August were you in Church-row, Pancras - A. I was, a little after four in the morning; I there saw Saunders, the prisoner; he was in the field opposite of Church-row, Pancras; he had a butcher's tray on his shoulder. I saw him lower it on a post; it was covered. I went round to him; I asked him what he had in the tray; he said he had got a sheep; he was going to Newgate-market with it. I uncovered it; it was quite hot; it was the hind quarters of a carcase of mutton; there was a knife and steel with it, and a gambol and hook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner, Saunders; what is he - A. A butcher. He attempted to get away, and struggled very much with me. I asked a man to assist me in taking the mutton. I went to Mr. Hill's field; I found the sheep's head, that is all I found there. Mr. Hill's lad found the entrails, the skin was produced by Mr. Hill, and the entrails all but the heart. Bousey produced the fore quarters to these hind quarter of mutton; it tallied with the hind quarters. Whitehair produced the heart; it tallied with the rest of the entrails.</p>

               <p>Q. On Thursday morning, the 12th, did you see the prisoner, Thompson - A. Yes, at five o'clock in the morning, as I was coming off my duty; he was coming from Charlton-street, Somers-town; he had a bundle on his shoulder, tied up in a blue apron; I asked him what he had there; he said, I might feel; he put it down; I felt it was meat. I examined the bundle; it was two fore-quarters of a sheep, the pluck, and fat; it weighed forty-three pounds; the heart was not weighed in it; about a minute or two I looked behind the prisoner, there I saw a heart in a paper; I picked it up; the mutton appeared to be fresh killed, but I cannot say it was warm; I delivered the mutton and the heart into Whitehair's custody.</p>

I then passed them. They followed me. I did not observe that until a little time afterwards, when I felt some one behind me again. I looked round; the prisoner, Farthing, was on my right hand, and Wright on his left hand, the same as before. Soon afterwards I felt a hand in my pocket; my handkerchief was there then, and when I felt two doors further my handkerchief was gone. I immediately turned round when my handkerchief was gone, and the prisoners were gone.

It was exactly the same quality as my own flour. The prisoner asked me to forgive her, and let her go about her business. I ordered the watchman to take her to the watch-house.</p>

They were two white pigs, one was larger than the other. Woodberry, the officer, pursued them. The heads of the two pigs were brought to me by Woodberry. The pigs had rings in their noses when I bought them. I observed, before they were taken out of the sack, if they were the heads of the pigs that I had lost, one was larger than the other. On the day before I lost them one of the pigs had got the ring out of his nose. The other the ring was in, and when the heads were brought to me that which had the ring before had got the ring in; that was the larger pig. I have no doubt of their being the heads of my pigs. They were of the value of twelve guineas.</p>

            . I am the father of the last witness. On the 7th of September, a little before six in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a bed on his back in Broad-street; St. Giles's; he was without shoes or stockings; I said you are padding the hoof, if you have far to go you will want shoening; he said I shall, like a horse. I saw him put the bed in the private door of the Southampton Arms, Tottenham-court-road. I went with another constable to the Southampton Arms, after I found the bed and things were my son's; the prisoner then said that he had been robbed by the woman that belonged to the room; he took the things out of spite. These are the things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman took me to that room; she robbed me of three pound eight shillings; I, out of vexation, took these goods. I was destressed to the utmost.</p>

            . I keep the Blakeney's Head, Islington. On Sunday the prosecutor came into the tap-room, he had two pints of porter; he laid his head on the table and fell asleep; I saw a sack by his side. The prisoner knocked at the door; (he had lodged with me one week,) I let him in; he went into the tap-room. He brought a sack to the bar; he took the sack into the tap-room; he brought me a clean calico shirt, and asked me to take care of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150058"/>it for him; I took the shirt, and put it away; he took the sack and went out of doors; all this time Sparkes was asleep. When Sparkes awoke he missed the sack; he made an alarm about it; I said, Dick had gone out with a sack. None of the property has been found.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sparkes. Have you ever found your things - A. No.</p>

The prisoner escaped.</p>

            . I am shop-woman to Mr. Nutting. My master said a man had taken a parasol from the door. I ran after him down Hand-court; he put the parasol under his apron; he was stopped by the populace in Warwick-court. I know he is the same man. He hoped I would have mercy on him, and many gentlemen said I had better let him go, as I had the parasol. I let him go. This is the parasol; it is Mr. Nutting's. I never lost sight of him.</p>

On the Thursday night I missed two three-shilling pieces, on Friday morning I missed one three-shilling piece; on the Saturday morning I mentioned it to the landlord of the house, he desired me to mark the money. I marked four three-shilling pieces, an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling. I marked them on the tail side, and my landlord on the head. I had been in bed about a quarter a quarter of an hour when the prisoner came up in the dark. I then heard the prisoner taking more money; he drawed the breeches from under the pillow. He got up the morning between five and six; I got up, and ran down stairs; I called for assistance. My landlord and I went up stairs; we accused him of taking a three-shilling piece, an eighteen-penny piece, and a shilling; he denied it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do, he has been employed there ten years. In consequence of information I watched the prisoner. On Thursday the 5th of August, as the men were going to breakfast at half past eight in the morning, I watched the prisoner into an old iron shop, kept by Mr. Whitehead; after two or three minutes had elapsed I went into the shop and saw six horse-shoes in the scale; I asked him what he was selling there; he said, nothing. He was taking sixpence of Mr. Whitehead for six horse-shoes. He had sold six horse-shoes for sixpence. They were old horse-shoes. I knew these horse-shoes perfectly well; one of the six had a private mark that I had made with a punch. I have no doubt they are my masters property. I saw some more in the shop. There was more than twenty. I believe them all to be my master's property. The prisoner said they are none of yours. I took them one by one out of the scale, and when I came to the marked one, I said, George, these are certainly ours, why did you sell them? He said distress made him do it. The horse-shoes were taken from our farrier's shop.</p>

            . I keep an iron-shop in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; I have seen him often come to our shop for the purpose of selling brass cocks and horse-shoes, and different things. On the 16th and 17th of June he came there; I considered from the mode the goods were brought in he did not come honestly by them. I went to Messrs. Hanbury, and made enquiry. He came to my shop; he said he had carried them some horse-shoes to sell; I bought them of him. I down Hanbury's accompting-house, and asked the people if they were not theirs. They told me to continue to buy them, they would stamp them to know them again. On the 5th of August he came to sell some horse-shoes that weighed twelve pounds. I bought them of him, and paid him sixpence. Mr. Dibben took them with him. They are the same that the prisoner sold. I was present when Dibben stopped him.</p>

            . They carry on the business for the benefit of myself and brother. I superintend the whole business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner been for some time a clerk in your brewhouse - A. He was a clerk to my father, he was continued by the executors; he was entrusted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150061"/>by them to receive money for the house. When he received he was first to make an entry in his own cash book. That is the cash book in which he was to make the entry. That book is all his hand-writing. He strikes a balance once a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever pay over to you the ninety-six pounds five shillings received of Mr. Arthur Newman - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22d of March last do you find in his cash book any such entry - A. No; between the 20th and 27th of March there but three items of five shillings each.</p>
               <p>Q. When he paid over money to you did you make entries in your own cash book - A. I did. I have carefully examined it; he never paid over that money to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in your service - A. Until the early part of July. I then discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the only person to whom the prisoner accompted - A. I was the only person. The executors do not interfere in the business. Directly after he was discharged I made the discovery of his embezzling the monies.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that did you cause warrants to be issued - A. Yes, and offered a reward for the apprehending him. A few days after I had done that I received this letter from him.</p>
               <p>"SIR, Enclosed I return you three bills which I had in my pocket-book; at the same time on my past misconduct allow me to say a few words; I have committed a crime. I do most sincerely acknowledge I deserve every step you have taken. My life is forfeited to the laws of my country, I readily allow. For myself I care not; I am ready to meet death: 'tis for others. This occasions me to place myself in a secure asylum, where it will be surprising to me that I should be discovered. If, by any untoward circumstance, my abode should be traced. I hope my Maker will excuse me if I should be my own executioner. Consider your own sentiments under my sufferings. I am happy to hear that most that profess themselves friends for you and your family with me will most cordially pray for you.</p>
               <p>I remain, sir,</p>
               <p>Your repentant humble servant,</p>
               <p>T. A. GEE."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, Q. to Mr. Hodgson. When was he apprehended - A. He was apprehended last September, about ten days ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was born of respectable parents. I throw myself on your mercy. I hope you will take that into consideration.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again - A. Yes, his wife gave me intelligence that he had got them. I went with the officer up to his place. I found the ring upon Mrs. Murray's hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What is he - A. A clock-maker.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I am an headborough. I have got a pair of ear-rings and a metal keeper. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner. I asked the woman that lived with the prisoner to let me look at her hand. She gave me the keeper off her finger. The woman went out and fetched these two ear-rings. The prisoner then said he was sorry; distress drove him to do it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The ear-rings and the keeper are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I purchased them of a person at the Pied Horse public-house, Chiswell-street.</p>

I saw Price and Holland in a little room that I have backwards for the ladies. White was in the front shop, they did not appear to know each other. Price made an offer that could not to be taken. She went out; White followed her, and just at that moment Huggins, the officer, brought Price back with a pair of shoes in her hand, which he saw her take from a nail.</p>

            . I am an assistant officer of the court of Requests. On the 23d of August I was waiting at the corner of Denmark-street, about half after seven o'clock, close by the side of Mr. Bartlett's shop; these three women came by me in company together; they stood talking to each other; presently two of them went in; Price and Holland went into a little shop backwards; White went in with a little boy that she had with her; Holland was trying some shoes on. I saw Price take a pair of shoes and put them under her apron. As soon as

In about a quarter of an hour after I had taken charge of Holland and Price, a woman came to the watchhouse door; she said, Mary. I desired Mr. Bartlett to go round and see whether that was the woman that had made her escape: he went out, and brought her in. I searched her, and found some money about her.

From suspicion I measured some bed-ticking; the roll contained forty-nine yards. I cut sixteen yards off it. I left thirty-three yards. This was on the shop where the women were at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other woman there but the prisoner - A. There was one. I sent the other woman out. I went out at the warehouse door, and went into my house by the private door. I saw the woman when she came back by the window. The prisoner was left alone in the shop where the ticking was, the thirty-three yards. I went into the shop immediately the other woman returned. There was no opportunity for any person to take the ticking but the prisoner. I then measured the ticking; I missed about six yards and a half; suspecting my women, I determined to detain them when they left work. I sent for a constable. The prisoner went away at seven o'clock. After she had gone about twenty yards I called her back; she came willingly. Read, the officer, was in the shop. When she was brought back, I told her before several of my women that I had lost several yards of ticking. I was determined to find out the thief. The prisoner asserted her innocence, and said she was very willing to be searched. Read searched her in my presence; he found concealed under her clothes two bags of feathers; they were made to fasten round her waist. The bags hanged low, and were not perceptible. She acknowledged they were my feathers; she said she had taken them out of my picking room. The officer then took her into a room to undress her, and when I entered the room the officer said she had confessed where the ticking was, and she would shew us. She went with Read and myself into a back room; there under a shelf she pointed it out. It was six yards and a half, the quantity that I missed. This is the first offence of hers that I know of.</p>

On the 9th of August, about nine o'clock, I came down stairs; I heard some person talking to my errand-boy; I got on the stairs to see what was going forward; the errand-boy went outside of the shop, was taking the bar, down of the shutters, and the prisoner at that time was coming from the glass case; he had taken something from the shop; I then asked him what he was doing there; he said he was come for work for his master. I counted the pieces of galloon in the drawer; I found two pieces short. The constable searched him, and found two pieces of galloon under the bib of his apron. This is the galloon; it is mine.</p>

They never parted, nor left the room until they came out with me, and when I came to the top of Duck-lane they wished me good morning, and I the same; it was then about three o'clock. I turned the corner of the Broad-way, I put my hand in my pocket, I discovered that the parcel I had in my possession was gone; I turned back to go in pursuit of these two women that I had been with; I met two watchman; I asked them to go along with me; at that time I did not know what the parcel contained. I went back to the house that I came from, along with two watchman; I rapped at the door; I had no answer.

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 14th of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the watchman; who said, that two women were charged with robbery; I immediately went to the room in New-court, Duck-lane. The prosecutor charged the prisoners with robbing him; I searched them, and also the room; I found nothing. I took the prisoners to Tothill-fields; I returned and made enquiry; I discovered that Gohan lived in a room nearly opposite; I went to that room, and upon the table I found this handkerchief, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150064"/>on searching the bed I discovered a hole big enough to put my hand in; I did not at that moment search the bed diligently; I pulled my coat off, and put my arm in; but the bed was so dirty I was afraid of getting something; I must confess I did not search the bed so much as I ought. On Friday, the 10th of the present month, I received information that a publican had stopped a note of a great amount, and suspected that was one of the notes that were lost; I traced the fifteen-pound note. This was a month after the robbery all but one day.</p>

On Saturday I was charing there; that was the room that Goban lived in, my landlady told me so. On Thursday night, I was shaking the bed, it rattled; I got a knife and ripped the bed; put my hand in; I pulled out three three-shilling pieces, an eighteen-penny piece, and an halfpenny; then I felt again, and pulled out two notes. I cannot read. I kept them in my pocket until the next morning, and then I gave the landlord of the White Horse one of the notes; he said it was a fifteen-pound note; he gave it me again; I put it in my pocket. I went again to that house; the landlord said, here has been a woman here that has had a lucky find; I said, I had. He said, have you got them; I said, yes; I took one out; I gave it him. He said, it was not the note that I gave him before; he said he would keep that; I said are you going to keep that, and to give me nothing for it; he said there would be something given for it, he would give it me; he would not wrong me of a halfpenny.

She first came a quarter past six in the morning, on the 10th; she said, she had been lucky this morning and found something; she a fifteen-pound note in my hand; I told her if she was an honest woman that was a good find; I gave it her; she came again in a quarter of an hour afterwards; I began telling her what a lucky find a woman had, not knowing it was her. She said, this is the note. I took it. I said, this is not the note you shewed me in the morning. I stopped it; it was a two hundred-pound note. I went to Gosling's house, in Fleet-street; I shewed Mr. Sharp the note, and told him the circumstance; he searched his books, and found the note came from Mr. Bosanquet's house in Lombard-street. This is the note that I received of that woman.</p>

I asked the prisoner what she had done with the things that she had taken out of the house; she said, she had not taken any. I began to search her; she said, I will give you no further trouble, I will shew you where they are; she took me to a woman's apartment, No. 16, George's-court, Wapping; the woman delivered me all the things.

            . On the 16th of August, I met the prisoner in Broad-street, St. Giles's; I went home with her; in the morning when I got up I missed my waistcoat and handkerchief; the watchman took her into custody. The next night the prisoner before the magistrate confessed to taking the things, and pledged them at Mr. Lane's.</p>

I then went into the riding school; I saw the marks of many people's feet, more than usual. I went to the other side of the stables; I saw that window pushed up, and the shutter just shut down; I fastened it the over night. I found four pair of spurs missing, and three umbrellas. I saw the saddle-room was broken open, and two box-coats gone; I had locked them in the over night and in the cupboard of the stable, I missed two pair of boots; a chaise-bit was found by the officer at

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. I apprehended the prisoners on the 7th of September; Bradnum let me in; Burridge was in bed, and some other person, who made his escape; Bradnum ran up stairs. I found a coat on the table in the lower room; I found three duplicates on the bed; one for an umbrella, and a pair of overalls, in the name of Smith, and I found a chaise-bit. As I was searching under the stairs, I observed Bradnum push something of one side; I went immediately there, and took this crow. I have matched it to the doors that were broken open; it exactly corresponds. Bradnum said it was a bar that they occasionally fastened the gates with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pickett. Look at the great coat, and the chaise-bit - A. They are my masters property, and the other box-coats are my masters property.</p>
               <p>Bradnum's Defence. On the day stated in the indictment, Burridge and Smith were lodgers in my house; I thought they were honest characters; the crow was certainly taken by Smith, as well as the coats; every thing was pledged in his name; he has escaped. I am innocent of this charge, so help me God.</p>

On the 2nd of this month I suspected the prisoner was robbing me, in consequence of which I requested several of my men before they left work, to mark the pieces of silver, and to leave them in their usual places. In the evening, when the prisoner was about to leave my premises, I searched him; I found these pieces of silver in his shoes; he denied taking them; he said they must have fallen into his shoes. These are the pieces of silver. I directed them to be marked. They are my property.</p>

            . On Saturday the 11th of September I saw the prisoner in Eagle-street; he had something in a mat under his arm. I asked him what he had got; he said they were glasses; he had them given to him by Lord Bathurst's coachman, to sell. On my taking him to the office he told me that he worked for Messrs. Lukin and Allen, and that he had taken them out of their shop, and if I would let him go I might keep the glasses. I then sent to the shop; Messrs. Lukin and Allen's foreman, came and identified them. I went and examined the carriages; I saw a post chaise that had two glasses taken from it. I enquired into the prisoner's character; he bears an undeniable character for honesty and sobriety.</p>

This Pugh came to me, and asked me if I would buy them. Parker was with him. He had got two live ducks and two dead ducks, and an old hen. I asked Pugh where he got them; he said, it was all right; they came far enough off. I said I would not buy them. I told Pugh I should detain the ducks until I heard further about them.</p>

On the 2nd of August she had nothing on but a frock and a pinafore; the weather was very warm; I put nothing else on her; she went to play on the green. I saw her about half past nine at my door; I went out; about eleven I returned, the child was missing then; her sister was looking for her. Her sister's name is

            . About one o'clock I found her; she had nothing on then but her shift; she had been stripped of her frock and pinafore. About half past six in the evening I saw the prisoner I stopped her myself. I told her she had stripped my child; she said, me, woman, I have plenty of clothes for my child; the prisoner went into a public-house; I saw my child's frock at the public-house; from there I followed her to her home, No. 24, Mitcham-street, Lisson-green. She threw my child's pinafore down the stairs, over the people's heads. She was afterwards taken in custody. The frock was worth two shillings, and the pinafore one shilling.</p>

Yes; I saw her about ten; she had her clothes on; she went to play on the green; I missed her about eleven o'clock; I looked on the green; I could not see her there. My mother saw her before me. About half past six, I saw the prisoner; I stopped her by the account of the children. I told her she was the person that had stripped this child. She said, me, woman, my child has plenty of clothes. I stopped her until Mrs. Marlow came up. The prisoner went into the public-house, and there I saw my sister's frock. I saw the prisoner take it from under her petticoats. I asked her for the pinafore; she said she had lost it. I went with her to her home; she chucked the pinafore over the stairs to me. This is the frock and pinafore. I am sure it is my sister's.</p>

The prisoner lodged about a year with me; he had all the articles in the indictment for his use in the lodging; he was to pay five shillings a-week. He left me, and in about a week after he was gone the key of the room was sent me in a paper. On my opening the door I missed the several articles in the indictment.

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Jupp - A. A haberdasher; he had been a customer in a house in which I had been a partner recently. I was perfectly known to Mr. Jupp. He said, that he was sent for a piece of black twilled sarcenet; he afterwards stated that he wanted a shot sarcenet, and produced a pattern of a coloured shot sarcenet; he had accordingly fifteen yards and a half cut off the piece, that was about three pounds twelve shillings and four-pence. He had a whole piece of black twilled sarcenet. In the afternoon of that day he brought back the piece, stating that only thirty-five yards and a half were wanting of it; the thirty-five yards and a half were cut off; the amount of that is eleven pounds and odd; he took it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner before, did you - A. His person was familiar to me; he lived in the neighboured; I had no reason to doubt at that moment but that he came from the person as stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive the value for these - A. Not a farthing; I neither got the property or the value; I was totally defrauded of them all.</p>

Branscomb was with me; we waited some time; he at one part of the yard, and I at the other; and after some time Levy came there, he went into the coach-office; I followed him in, from what I heard before. I asked the book-keeper if this was the gentleman who had left the bundle; he told me it was. I then asked Levy if he had not come for these two bags; he said, no. I asked the book-keeper if this was not the gentleman who generally paid for such things; he told me yes. I then told him that he must go with me; I took him to a public-house in Gracechurch-street; there I searched him; on him I found a pocketbook; I handed over the book to Branscomb, and while I was searching him further, Branscomb produced me a letter; I saw him take it out of the prisoner's pocket-book. (The letter read.) I read the letter, and told him there were facts to prove these things were directed to him; it corresponded with the weight. I said, I had facts that these were directed to him; he then, told me that he thought every thing that was sent up was fair, that was what he agreed for. I then asked him who he had them from; he said
