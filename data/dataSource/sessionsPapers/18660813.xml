                  </hi>., M. P. I am one of the members for Maidstone—I was elected in July last year—a petition was presented against the return—the Committee reported in my favour, and I am now the sitting member—Mr. Lee is my colleague—I represented Maidstone in 1852, and was member for the county at the following election—I live a short distance from Maidstone, and am well known there—I heard the defendant examined before the Committee of the House of Commons, but cannot say whether I canvassed him or not—I have no recollection of it—the constituency is about 1800—we canvassed the majority of them for several days—I did not know the prisoner by sight at all, or remember him when I saw him in the Committee room—it is not true that on Thursday or Friday before the election I went to his forge between ten and eleven at night with Mr. Lee, or on any night, nor did I on any occasion say to him, "Will 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be of any use to you?"—he did not say, "No, if I do vote I shall vote for the Conservatives"—Mr. Lee never said anything of the kind in my presence—I never promised the prisoner a sum of money directly or indirectly—I did not take a sum of money out of my pocket and offer it to the prisoner, and say, "Here, get something to drink with that; it will do you good," nor did Mr. Lee say, "If he will not take it from you he will take it from me, I have had a little talk with him before"—nothing of the kind occurred—Mr. Lee did not take any money from me and say to the prisoner, "You are a hard working man; you will find use for that in your family; take it and get something with it," nor anything to that effect—Mr. Lee did not in my presence take any money and put it into the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">slop</hi> pocket on the Thursday or Friday before the election, or at any other time—I never gave the prisoner any money for any purpose whatever—his evidence given before the Committee is entirely untrue—I never during the election gave any money to any voter, or promised any, nor did Mr. Lee in my presence to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>night before the election; I cannot tell—I have understood that there was a ward meeting at the "Sun" tavern, but I do not actually remember the name of the house—there were several of these meetings at which I addressed the electors, but where they were on each night I cannot tell—the "Sun" tavern is in High Street—we had no committee rooms but one—I addressed meetings at different parts of the town at public-houses—they were ward meetings, not committee meetings—there were certainly not twelve committee rooms to my knowledge, I do not think there were six, nor four—I will not swear anything about it—I told you I believed we had but one—we have paid for the use of some rooms used for the ward meetings, and they are called in the bills committee rooms, but they were not committee rooms—I have since ascertained that Pudding Lane is the lane that Chambers's forge is in—the "Sun" is pretty nearly opposite the end of Pudding Lane, in High Street—Chambers's forge is at that end of Pudding Lane—I never canvassed alone in the town—I drove in my carriage before a meeting to the house of another Chambers, but he was not at home—that was the only occasion on which I went alone—I am quite sure I never canvassed any elector alone in the town—I do not recollect the name of John Richards, an elector, in the employ of the South-Eastern Railway (<hi rend="italic">George Richards was here brought into court</hi>)—I do not recollect him, or canvassing him—I will not say that I did not—I can positively say that the week before the election, and about the middle of the week, at two or three o'clock in the afternoon, I did not call at his place alone and canvas for his vote—I think I was asked to go to one of these people in Prospect Place, if that is in the West Borough, and I remember riding on horseback to a house there—I do not consider that to be in the town, but there was somebody with me, whether it was a servant or who I do not remember—it is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> possible that I asked one of the family who came to the door if Mr. Richards was at home, and that the man who has just been in court came out to speak to me, but I do not remember it, and it is extremely improbable that it occurred—I do not remember saying to that man, "You have already been canvassed, but I have not heard that you have promised anybody yet; you will vote for me"—I will not under-take to swear that I did not, or that he did not say, "Sir, I have made up my mind, and I cannot vote for you," but if anybody said that to me I always said, "Then keep your promise"—the ward meetings terminated about ten o'clock or soon after—I do not recollect where I was between ten and twelve o'clock on the Thursday night previous to the election—I was not examined before the Election Committee as to these particular days you are speaking of—I do not know Richard Coker, a voter, who is employed at the South-Eastern Railway station<lb/>master's room (<hi rend="italic">Coker was here brought in</hi>)—I know that person, but should not know him by name—I do not recognise him as a person who does duty on the South-Eastern Railway—it is very possible that in the week before the election, at the Maidstone Station, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I asked him if he would vote for me, but not when I was alone; we went there to several of the railway men—I said before the Election Committee that I never was alone, and that there was never so few as one person with me, and that I did not. recollect any occasion when only one person was present—it is very possible that I was walking into the station with Mr. Charles Arkoll, and that I addressed Coker and asked him for his vote—I recollect walking into the station with Mr. Arkoll when there was nobody with me—I had totally forgotten the circumstance at the examination—I do not recollect</p>

                  </hi>, M. P. I am the sitting member for the borough of Maidstone—I live at Aldborough, in Kent, about seven miles from Maid-stone—I have lime and cement works in Kent—I was elected member for Maidstone in 1853, and again in 1859—at the general election I stood again in the Liberal interest with Mr. Whatman, and was elected—I never directly or indirectly offered the prisoner any money to vote for me and Mr. Whatman—I never said to him that if 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was of any use he could have it—I never went to the prisoner's forge between ten and eleven at night—I never canvassed after six o'clock—I might have called at his forge, but I never was alone in his forge with Mr. What-man, and certainly not so late as ten or eleven at night—it is not true that Mr. Whatman said to the prisoner, "Are 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of any use to you?" nor did he take out any money and say to the prisoner, "Here, get something to drink with this; it will do you good;" nor did I say, "If he will not take it from you he will take it from me"—I have had a little talk with him before—I did not take some money from Mr. Whatman, and say to the prisoner, "You are a hardworking man; you will find use for this in your family; take it and get something with it;" nor did I then place two sovereigns, or any other sum into his <hi rend="italic">slop</hi> pocket, or any pocket—I heard the prisoner describe, at the House of Commons, the interview with us—that was untirely untrue—I went canvassing with Mr. Whatman and several of the leading persons of the place.</p>

               <p>pretty well convinced—I said before the Select Committee that I never did, and I do not think I have—I know James Jowett, the tobacconist—I believe he voted against us—I did not the week before the election go to him alone and press him as an old friend to give me his vote—I called with other gentlemen, who went into his shop—I might go in and they might stand at the door—I never called and canvassed him unaccompanied by any person—I know his brother Thomas and the whole family—I did not call on Thomas alone and canvas him for his vote three or four days before the election—I may have canvassed him, but I do not know where he lives.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my property at Maidstone—a few nights before the election I was at Mr. Smith's public-house, in Pudding Lane—I do not recollect the sign, as it has been altered—I was there from eight till nine in the evening—I know Messrs. Lee and Whatman—I saw them both coming out of a forge or blacksmith's shop in Pudding Lane, kept by Mr. Chambers, the defendant—I made an observation to Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown—on another occasion, previous to the election, I was going through Pudding Lane with Mr. Brown—I think it was before ten o'clock—I saw Chambers in his forge and some gentlemen talking to him—I cannot swear whether it was the members—there were two or three gentlemen—they had a respectable appearance, but at ten o'clock at night in June it is dark—on the other occasion I saw them coming out of the forge, and am certain it was Messrs. Lee and Whatman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the Bexley Road, Maidstone—I was inspector in the King Street ward, on the opposite side to the sitting members—I was a witness before the Parliamentary Committee in 1859, when Mr. Lee and Mr. Buxton were returned—I was not particularly a witness against them, I deposed to a certain fact—I stated that there was a committee opposite my house, but there is such a different opinion about committee rooms that it is liable to contradiction—I cannot say whether it was contradicted—the Committee seated Mr. Lee and Mr. Buxton—I was in London at the time of the trial of the petition, the day it commenced and the next day, not the whole time—I was there when Chambers was examined, but was not in the committee room at the time—I did not know that he was to be examined, but I knew afterwards that he had been—before the case was over I saw in the newspapers that Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman were examined—I was not up in town as a witness—I had nothing to do with the petition at all—I merely went up, like a great many others, to see and hear how the petition was going on—I did not watch the evidence, I was only present occasionally—I was in and out—I was not minutely attending to the evidence given—I had no other business in London, but I did not attend to the evidence particularly, because I had nothing to do with it, and I did not give evidence—the whole town of Maidstone took an interest in it—I was partly in the room when Chambers was examined, at the commence<lb/>ment I think—I cannot say that I heard him give evidence with respect to Messrs. Lee and Whatman being at his forge, I gathered it from the newspapers—I did not see a "slip" of the evidence every night—I saw the printed sheet which the <hi rend="italic">Maidstone Journal</hi> published—I bought it at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Maidstone Journal</hi>—I saw the evidence day by day as it was given—Mr. Goodwin, the Conservative agent, acted under the petition, I believe—I took no part in obtaining witnesses to be examined—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130010"/>
               <p>opposed to the petition from the first; I thought it ought not to be presented, but it was a matter of perfect indifference to me—I received a guinea for my services as inspector, the usual fee—the others were paid the same for the King Street ward—the ward is divided into four compartments, and each inspector has a book containing the names of the registered freemen and electors, and they have to see that no one comes up who is not registered—for that I received a guinea—I have no occupation—I was articled to the law fifteen years ago—I have no occupation at present—I live on my property—to the best of my belief, it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when I saw Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman—I cannot be positive that it was as late as eight—I will swear it was as late as seven, because I did not go into the house till nearly eight—I think it must have been later than six—I am certain it was, and to the best of my belief it was much later—I will not swear that I saw Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman later than six in Pudding Lane, it was the evening part—I had no communication with Mr. Goodwin before the petition came on—I may have spoken to him—I did speak to him, but only casually, not upon any evidence—I do not take upon myself to say the exact nature of the conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you take upon yourself to say that you only spoke to him casually? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, not upon the nature of the evidence, because I did not know the evidence, I only knew one case, and that was notorious through the town—I knew the evidence day by day—I cannot say positively that I did not take a witness to Mr. Goodwin during the petition—I cannot recollect having a conversation with Mr. Goodwin about the evidence that had been given, or taking him a witness to be examined—I cannot swear that that did not occur—I cannot recollect taking him a witness before the petition com<lb/>menced—I will not swear that I did not—I did not have a conversation with him as to the nature of the evidence, but it was perfectly notorious all through the town that one witness, Mr. Kirby, was to be examined—I cannot say that he took an active interest on the Conservative side—he did not come up with me—I did not come up in the same train as he did; but I saw him in London in the Committee room—he does not take a par<lb/>ticular interest on the Conservative side—I saw two or three gentlemen in the forge, to best of my belief; there were not six—I will not under<lb/>take to say that there were not five, or to say the exact number—it was ten o'clock in the evening—I do not understand this line of examination, it is not fair—I had not a view of the whole of the forge—there were a good many people, two distinct parties, about Maidstone canvassing—the borough is divided into two separate parts, as nearly every borough is, and the candidates and their friends go round in a canvassing party—the numbers vary; sometimes there are 20 and sometimes 25, and sometimes only four or five, or less—I never made a statement to the effect that I have now while the Parliamentary Committee was sitting, because I did not know that Mr. Chambers would give evidence—he was examined the second day, and I was there—I did not see the printed paper at night when I was in London—I got it on Wednesday, when the petitioner's case had closed—I made no statement while the petition was pending, to the effect of what I have said to-day, but it struck my mind that I could—I believe the prisoner was the first man who was examined on Wednesday, the 18th—I was not there in time to hear the whole of his evidence, and on the following morning you will find the petitioners' case closed—I first made a statement similar to what I have made now last week, but I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130011"/>
               <p>stated it verbally prior—I first stated it when the petition was going on, not before the petition—(I did not understand the nature of Chambers's evidence; I did not know he was going to be called)—I did not state it to Mr. Goodwin, but I stated it publicly in Maidstone to a few friends—that might be the Friday or Saturday after Chambers was examined, I cannot now charge my memory; the election is now more than 12 months ago—the petition was in April this year—I mentioned to a few friends that I thought I saw, to the best of my belief, Messrs. Lee and Whatman coming out as I described—I said on the first occasion that I could not tell who the parties were—I say that, to the best of my belief, I saw them coming out—I was certain about them then in my own mind, and I swear now that, to the best of my belief, I saw them coming out—I have lived in Maidstone a great many years, and know them—I was a witness against Mr. Lee seven years ago, and I knew him and Mr. Whatman per<lb/>fectly well—I will swear that I spoke to them on the first occasion that I saw them, and yet I will not say more than to the best of my belief—it was some time before the election that I saw them in Pudding Lane—I made no memorandum of it—I mentioned it to several friends after the petition, as I thought it was important—I swore just now that it was not of sufficient importance for me to give evidence—I mentioned it in casual conversation to a few friends—the time when I believe I saw them was some short time prior to the election—I made no memorandum of the time—it was not a fortnight before the election—I cannot state positively, you are taxing me too fiercely—it was not the day before the election, it was ten days or a fortnight before—to the best of my belief, that was the first occasion.</p>

Lee and Whatman at the forge, they were coming out of the forge—that was the evening I saw Mr. Brown—he said, "I have just come from the house, and Lee and Whatman are gone into Chambers's forge," on that I and Mr. Smith looked out at the window and saw them come out of the forge—I knew them by sight, and have no doubt that the two persons who came out of the forge were Messrs. Lee and Whatman, now sitting on the bench—Chambers was examined on Wednesday—I did not go down to Maidstone on Wednesday evening—I did not come up to town again—it was the next day (Thursday) that I read the account of what Chambers had said—I was not five minutes in the committee room during Chambers's examination—what I read in the papers was the first I heard of it—I did not mention it to any one in Maidstone on Thursday, not till I heard the evidence of Mr. Whatman and Mr. Lee—Mr. Whatman was examined one day and Mr. Lee the next—it was mentioned at Maidstone the same evening—I read their evidence partly on Thursday, but I read it on the Friday—it was either on Friday or Saturday that I said some<lb/>thing about the evidence of Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman—Mr. Goodwin was solicitor to the petitioners—from the time I left home on the Wed<lb/>nesday evening I had no communication with him—I called at his office on professional business and saw Kirby there; that was before the petition was presented—I did not take Kirby there; I had nothing to do with him—he happened to be in Mr. Goodwin's office when I called.</p>

               <p>Lee and Whatman half-way up the lane—I followed them through the lane—they were coming from Earl Street towards the "Sun"—it was between eight and nine, nearly nine—they did not pass me—I followed them till they came opposite Mr. Chambers's shop, and they stopped and went in directly—I saw them go in—I knew them by sight perfectly well, and have no doubt whatever that they went in—I went into Smith's beershop, Pudding Lane, perhaps five or six yards from opposite Chambers's forge, on the other side of the street—I saw Hawkins there—I had passed the forge to go to the public-house—I saw them go in and saw them in there, but I did not see anything of the defendant at that time—I did not wait a minute—two or three days after that, at night, I saw Messrs. Lee and Whatman in Pudding Lane—Hawkins was going home with me, and I saw them in the forge talking to Chambers, who was standing close by the anvil, but he was not at work while they were talking—I did not stop scarcely half a minute—I can speak positively that Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman are the two, and I saw Mr. Lee at Chambers's forge between four and five o'clock one afternoon—I did not notice Chambers—I saw Mr. Lee come out of the forge—my place of business is about 200 yards from Chambers's forge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Harris, of Maidstone—I know the defendant—his forge is seven or eight yards from us, on the opposite side of the way—a few evenings before the Maidstone election in July, I was in my bedroom, which is opposite the forge and looks into Earl Street, the clock struck nine shortly afterwards, and I saw Messrs. Lee and Whatman coming in the direction of Earl Street, arm in arm in the middle of the road—Earl Street leads into Pudding Lane—when they got to the forge they made a stop, and Chambers came to the edge of the forge with his shirt sleeves tucked up; the two members walked into the forge out of my sight—I cannot say how long they were there, I had no watch, but it was a short time—when they came out they passed by my house into the High Street—I saw them canvassing during the election, and Mr. Lee came and canvassed my brother, who was not at home, and he said that Mr. Whatman was knocked up—I am sure that the Mr. Lee who went into the forge was the same Mr. Lee who came and asked for my brother's vote—I never spoke to Chambers in my life, but I know him.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Maynard &amp; Co.—we acted as solicitors for Mr. Brett in advising him in the proceedings—previous to the prisoner being called before the Committee as a witness he communi<lb/>cated to me what his evidence would be, and I told him that if his state<lb/>ment was not believed by the Committee of the House of Commons it would be fatal to the petition, and that if Messrs. Lee and Whatman went into the box and denied its truth it was probable he would not be believed; and further, that if the Committee did not listen to his evidence it was certain there would be an indictment against him; and I cautioned him against the danger and told him to consider well what he was about.</p>

Mind you make no mistake"—she said she was quite sure—I went to the other end of the bar and sent my servant for a constable—she then gave me the other shilling, kept in the ornament, and I went round to the bar where the prisoners were—the woman said, "Don't lock me up"—she said, "Give the man in custody, but don't lock me up"—I gave the constable the two bad shillings—I marked them before I gave them to him.</p>

I am the wife of William Thomas Strank, a greengrocer, of Moor Lane—we had apartments in the same house where the prisoner lodged—about twelve months ago I lent her some things to pledge to raise some money upon—I had applied to her for the money or the things back—on the night of the 17th July I was sitting in my parlour reading the newspaper, with the door open—the prisoner came in, and hauled me down off my chair by the hair of my head—she then took me up and smashed me down again, and also kicked me—I have the wound, but it has been sewn up—she went upstairs, came back, and did it again—she went upstairs a second time, and came back and wounded me again—what she did it with I do not know—no one came to my rescue—she cursed and swore all the time she was doing this—she was quite sober—I had not spoken to her at all.</p>

He said, "Because I had Mr. Canton's authority to do so"—upon that I told the prisoner that I suspected he had forged stamps about him, and that I should take him into custody—he said nothing—I then took him to the station and took charge of all the letters, eighty-five in number—when I got to the station I opened them—I produce them.</p>

Canton, 9, St. Thomas's Road"—I will not say without examination whether that is in the same handwriting, I do not see that it is—the filling up, "H.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Caton, a glass-blower, of Bartholomew Close—I was with McDonald and his wife at the "Red Cow" on this Saturday night—I saw the prisoner come in and take up a young man's pot of beer and drink out of it—the young man asked what he did it for, and he laughed and jeered at him—the young man then struck him in the mouth—McDonald went to part them, and he moved to a corner of the room, where he remained about twenty minutes—he then put his hand to his right hand pocket and took something, and came to where McDonald was standing—McDonald told him to go home—he said, "What did you say?"—McDonald again told him to go home, and spoke to him several times—he said, "The best thing you can do is to go home"—he then leaned towards him, and said, "I don't care a b—for any man while I have got this"—McDonald then staggered and halloed out, "Mind, he has got a knife; I am stabbed"—the prisoner then rushed to the door—he was stopped by Barrett—he struggled to get away from him, and I and Connelly laid hold of him—he dragged us across the road—we screamed "Murder!" and the policeman came up and took him.</p>

On the 4th August I went into a house with the female prisoner—she took my hat off and went into the house, and I followed her and asked her to give it me—she said she would not until I paid her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered her a shilling—after a time the male prisoner came into the room, and an old woman at the same time with a candle—I told him all that had occurred, and he told Harley to give me my hat and let me go—she said she would not until she broke it, and she threw it down and broke it—I then picked up my hat to go, but before I could get hardly outside the street-door I was seized by the female prisoner—she put her hand into my left-hand trousers pocket—I laid hold of her hand and shoved her down—I was directly laid hold of by the male prisoner—the female came to his assistance, and they both got me down—the man knelt on my chest while the female kept my right hand, and turned my fingers back—the male prisoner took the watch from me—I laid hold of the chain, but he pulled the watch out of the swivel—I saw him undo the swivel—he then ran down the passage—I followed him, but could not see him—I went into the parlour, but could not see him—I then went into Victoria Street, and I had scarcely got into the passage again, when I met the female prisoner, and she hit me on the head with a stick or a portion of a bedstead—I gave an alarm to the police—they searched the place, but could not find either of the prisoners—about an hour and a half afterwards we went back to the same house, and there found the prisoners with about half a dozen more women talking over the affair—directly the male prisoner saw me he attempted to get out of the window—the police laid hold of him and asked if that was the man, and I said, "That is the man and that is the woman; I have not the least doubt of it"—he said nothing—he went quietly to the station.</p>

               <p>Money—I walked with her from Pall Mall to Victoria Street—we went up a dark turning—she said it was the nearest way, and so it would have been if we had gone through, but she took off my hat and ran into the house and locked it in a cupboard, and put the key in her pocket—I seized hold of her to get the key of the cupboard from her—I did not try to throw her down—she threw herself down on a chair and screamed out, "Charley"—when I was going she said, "You are not going away like that, after bring<lb/>ing me from the West End?"—I gave her a florin and asked her for a shilling change out of it—I did not throw her down then—I threw her down outside the door when she attempted to rob me of my watch—she cried for help when I was trying to get the key—it was then that the male prisoner came in with the old woman—he did not touch me till I threw the woman down—he then came up and seized me and knocked me down—she helped to keep me down, and held my left hand while he robbed me of my watch—there was a lamp just outside the door—there was no light in the passage—he knelt on my chest and took the watch.</p>

On the 4th August I was on duty in Victoria Street about three o'clock in the morning—I saw the prosecutor there, and accompanied him to a house of ill-fame in Union Court, Orchard Street—he had stated the particulars and given me a full description of the prisoners—that was an accurate description—I knew them—we went into the house, and as soon as the male prisoner saw me he made a move towards the window to get out—I seized him and asked the prosecutor if it was the man who robbed him—he said, "Yes; take him into custody." I said, "Is this the woman?" He said, "Yes"—I took them to the station, and charged them with stealing the watch and assault<lb/>ing the prosecutor—Constable said he did not take it—I found nothing on him relating to the robbery—the prosecutor handed me this chain, which he retained in his hand.</p>

I am cab inspector at the Ludgate Station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—on the 10th July, in consequence of information, I went to the top of the incline at the Ludgate Station, and saw three boys on the line between Skinner Street and Seacole Lane—a train was about leaving at the time—I got into the guard's break van at the end of the train, and on the way down the incline I saw the prisoner take a brick in his hand and place it on the metals—I saw him pick up a second and place that on—I also saw him pick up a third, but before he had time to place that on I jumped out of the van and caught him with it in his hand—on the way to the station he told me he had only laid one brick on, and would never do it again—the boys must have climbed over a wall eight feet high to get on to the line.</p>

I am barmaid at the "Prince Alfred," Eleanor Road, Hackney—about a month or six weeks ago, at 8 a. m., Clements came in for a glass of sixpenny ale—it came to threehalfpence—he gave me a bad shilling—I returned it—he said that he only had one penny, which he gave me—on 30th of July Brown came in alone and called for a half-pint of porter and a screw of tobacco (I had noticed Clements pass and go down the Eleanor Road)—Brown drank the porter and gave me a bad shilling—he said that he had only one penny—I kept the shilling and Mrs. Empson tried it with caustic; this is it—I told him it was bad—he said that he humbly begged my pardon and I could keep it; he left—I went to the door and saw Clements, who turned back and passed again and went towards Hackney—Brown went the same way—I spoke to Mr. Eady—we had not tested the coin when he said that I might keep it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a footman in the service of Mr. Whitmore, M. P. for Bridgnorth, of 68, Eaton Place—I was a servant there on the 6th July—the prisoner called on that day about twenty or twenty-five minutes past one—the visitors' bell rang soon afterwards—I answered when the prisoner came—he asked me if Mr. Whitmore was at home, and I told him he was not—he asked mo if Mrs. Whitmore was at home, and I said, "Yes"—he said he wanted the address of Mr. Bluck, a friend of Mr. Whitmore's, if Mrs. Whitmore would see him—I asked his name, and he said Captain Marden—he came into the hall—I shut the door and went up to Mrs. Whitmore—she told me the address—she was in the drawing-room—I returned into the hall and gave the prisoner the address, 21, Upper Rane<lb/>lagh Street—when I gave him the address he said, "Thank you, good day, good day," got into a Hansom cab which was waiting at the door, and drove off—I had laid out the things in the dining-room that morning—I put some spoons and forks and a quantity of other silver on a side table, which is opposite the dining-room door, and which was open—any one in the hall could see the silver on the table quite plain—after the prisoner had gone the visitors' bell rang—I cannot exactly say how long after, it might be a quarter of an hour—I then found the street door open and a servant at the door—I went into the dining-room after a short time, and missed some ladles, forks, spoons, and several other things, which I had left in the dining-room—I gave the alarm to Mrs. Price, the lady's-maid—she went upstairs to the drawing-room—the next time I saw the prisoner was at Westminster Police Station—before I went to the station I had seen a photograph—I could not identify it—I said I could not swear to it—there were six or eight persons standing with the prisoner—I pointed him out at once—I have not the least doubt that he is the man who called on that morning.</p>

You know Mr. Hunt the one I mean," placing his stick on the counter sharp, making a rattle as he laid it down, and leaving it lying there—Mr. Walton took a red book down and looked for Mr. Hunt's address, and just as he had got the book open</p>

               <p>about the average weight of a child of that age—I examined the brain—it was healthy, a little firmer than I had usually seen—I attributed that to some slow form of inflammatory action, which had condensed its structure—the heart and liver were healthy, also the stomach and intestines—the lungs were healthy, with an exception of a slight bronchitis in the upper lobe, but far too slight to produce any deleterious consequences—there was extreme pallor of the body, and a total absence of fat everywhere—there was slight disease of the mesenteric glands, but not that amount that I have seen in other cases—I have made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations of a great many children who have died of mesenteric disease pure and simple—it is an enlargement of the glands of the mesentery, brought on by irritating or improper food where children are brought up by hand or exposed to damaging influences in the way of foul air, or any vitiating condition—gin and beer would of course provoke such a disease—there was a total pallor of the whole body—I do not know that I ever saw a case of a child so pefectly and entirely neglected—I attributed it entirely to neglect, and I formed that opinion at the time without having any previous history to guide me—I did not mark any appearance about the heels—I did not notice anything particular about the lower part of the stomach—the child had been in the house a week at that time, and had been carefully looked after and attended to by the nurse—I came to the conclusion that the death was provoked by neglect—there was a continuous neglect extending over a considerable time—it had not a fair chance of life—that neglect consisted in the deprivation of food, and a continuous administration of improper food—the nurse told me in the prisoner's presence that the child was in a dreadful state of neglect at the time it was brought in, and that it took its food in the most ravenous manner, that it was pitiable to see it, and the same thing was repeated to me on the second morning—the prisoner made no observation to me, or in my hearing—it was in consequence of the representations made to me in her presence that on my mere notion I was disposed to give her into the custody of the police, with a view to her being punished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of Hounslow Heath—on 14th July, about 5.30 p.m., I was crossing Sunbury Common to Feltham in a donkey-cart—the prisoners passed me in a cart, went on about 300 yards, and then turned round and passed me again—when I got to the "Red Lion," at Feltham, I got out to have a pint of beer—the prisoners got out of their pony-cart, and Ayres knocked me down with his first—he jumped on top of my chest and called Sexton, who held me while Ayres picked my pocket of 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., leaving 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on me—I had had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—Ayres kicked me three times in the ribs and back—they jumped into the cart and drove away, and I ran after them, leaving my cart—I overtook them at the "Railway Inn," Feltham, and said, "Give me my money;" Ayres threw down two penny-pieces, and said, "Take your b—money"—after that he stabbed me through my cheek into my gums—I did not see anything in his hand—I knew the prisoners by sight, and am sure they are the men—Ayres goes about with a cart gathering dust.</p>

                  </hi>. I am first officer of the <hi rend="italic">William Penn</hi>—I have served on board her three or four months—she is a new ship and sailed under British colours—her owners are Malkinson Brothers—they are British owners—the prisoner was an able seaman on the last voyage to New York—Waring was the third officer of the ship—between nine and twelve o'clock on 22nd June we were off the banks of Newfoundland—the helm was relieved at ten o'clock, and the prisoner and a man named Doughty went on—at ten minutes or a quarter past ten I found by watching the compass on the saloon deck that the ship went several points off her course—there were from 600 to 700 people on the ship—I gave charge of the ship to the third officer and Waring, and went to the wheel-house to ascertain the cause—I found Doughty there, but Allen was absent—he came into the wheel-house in about three minutes and took hold of the wheel—he was what I should term half drunk, and Doughty was slightly the worse for liquor—I said that it was requisite to have them relieved, and went and told the captain, who had just left the deck and was undressing—I received directions and went to the wheel-house and had them relieved by two of the watch—one man went away</p>

               <p>quietly, but the prisoner held on to the wheel and would not suffer the ship to be steered—I reasoned with him, but it was of no use—a vessel was reported on the port bow, and I put my hand in a persuasive manner on his right shoulder, and he dealt me a blow in the face as hard as he could—a struggle ensued, and I eventually got him towards where the captain was, who assisted me—we all three struggled, and eventually the captain sent me below for a pair of handcuffs which I had in my cabin—I returned with them, but the captain said that we should be in port in a few days, and no doubt he would run away—he promised to behave himself, and was not handcuffed—I then went on the saloon deck and took charge of the ship—Waring was there—that is a part where seamen are not allowed to be—Waring was pacing across the deck, and I had paced a few yards on the starboard side, when I turned round and saw the prisoner in the act of striking me from behind—his hand was at my side with something in it, I could not make out what—(this was three-quarters of an hour after I had brought the handcuffs)—I sprang back and partially fell on my back—he jumped towards me—I jumped up and he made a blow at me—I dealt him a blow with the handcuffs, which I had in my pocket, and Waring called out, "He has got a knife in his hand"—I saw the knife before I struck him—the chief engineer got behind him and secured his hands round his waist—he tried to throw the knife away and it fell about a foot from his feet—he was secured—the captain was sent for and he was put in irons—he broke two pair of irons that night, and the third he picked in some way with a piece of string—they were two handcuffs with a chain between them—he was put down the steerage—the blow he struck me at the wheel-house took effect on the lower part of my nose—it hurt me, and made me all over blood—my nose has only just recovered—it knocked me against the wheel-house three feet from where I stood—this is not an ordinary English knife—sailors are not allowed to use them, and in American ships they take a pair of pincers and break the point off the knives.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have not you seen him with that knife in his possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till this evening—there were I believe several American seamen on board—I have not seen them with such knives as this—the prisoner was half drunk at the wheel—I cannot say how he got liquor—the men have an allowance, and are not allowed to bring spirits on board—I have never seen sailors' chests examined when they come on board—I had never seen the prisoner drunk before, or the other man—we had a light in the binnacle—I was three or three and a half feet from it when I was struck—there was also a light on the saloon deck and a compass—I did not strike the prisoner with the handcuffs till he struck at me with the knife—I had not got them in my hand till then—I swear I did not push him in the wheel-house—I only put my hand on his shoulder—I think I struck him twice with the handcuffs—he was confined in a bath-room for the rest of the voyage.</p>

I am thirteen years old—I was in the service of Mr. Henderson, of the Temple, about nine months—I recollect taking some property of his—a boy named Drew persuaded me to do it—I took some chessmen to Mr. Read's, the prisoner—I did not know him before—we asked him if he bought them—he said, "Yes"—he asked me where I lived—I told him in Stamford Street, but I lived in Providence Place—he did not ask me how I came by them—I forget what he gave me—he offered me a price and I took it—that was the first thing I took to his shop—I went with Drew—I went again about a fortnight before I was taken into custody—Drew asked him if he bought silver at the time I took the chessmen—he said, "Yes"—Drew is a little taller than me—he was fifteen years old—he said that he would bring some silver, and we took a dozen forks—we did not take all the silver forks at that time—we also took a large soup ladle and some spoons—we did not take all the plate at that time—he gave us 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the forks and the ladle and the spoon altogether—there were three large and three salt spoons—we said we would bring some more things—he said, "Very well"—I went again in about two days and took two telescope</p>

               <p>candlesticks, two large branch ones, and some silk handkerchiefs—he gave me about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I mentioned the price—he asked me how I came by them—I told him we were selling them for mother—he only asked me that once or twice—I went about four times a week to the shop—I sold him things on every occasion—there were no books—I received about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether from Reed—I got all the things from the prosecutor's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been to school? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about a year and three months, at the Borough Road—I had also been at school in the country—I am fond of reading, not newspapers—I made Drew's ac<lb/>quaintance just after I got my place—I stated to the officer at one time that some one besides Drew was engaged in this matter—that was not true—I afterwards told the officer that that was a lie—I and Drew went together to Mr. Read's—Mr. Read's shop is in Great Turnstile—there are curiosities, pictures, china, and old plate in the shop—I did not see any chessmen in the window—when I went in first I took two or three chess<lb/>men—I do not remember telling the officer that I told Mr. and Mrs. Read at various times a parcel of stories and deceived them—I did not tell him that I had succeeded in deceiving Mr. and Mrs. Read—the first time I went I found Mr. and Mrs. Read in the shop—I was not dressed as I am now, I had a longer jacket than this—when we took the chessmen I told them that my mamma had been to India and was now in London, that she had several curiosities and silver things, and that they brought some of them from Indian—I told them that my parents were going to remove to Camberwell, not that they were going back to India—I told them my mamma had a great many curiosities which would be of no use to her when we removed, and would he (Mr. Read) buy them—I did not take with me anything else when I took the chessmen—I did not ask him what he would give for the chessmen—he said he would give me a price for them—I did not know then they were chessmen—I took two or three as a sample—I thought they were curiosities—I told him my mamma had sent me out to see what I could get for them—he then asked me where my mamma lived, and I told him Water Street, Stamford Street—I believe I told him No. 4 or 15, I will not be certain which—I told him that my mamma's name was Mrs. Henderson—I do not know on what day of the week I paid the first visit—I asked him the same day whether be bought chessmen—he said, "Yes," and we went back and brought the others the same day—he said there were three or four of them missing—I said, "Will you be good enough to put down in writing the names of the pieces that are missing? or I shall not remember, and I will take it to my mamma"—he gave us about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not more—when I went back I said that I had given my mamma the piece of paper with the names of the missing chessmen on, and she had looked and could not find any more—the next time I went I took some silver forks, and some old-fashioned bags, and some bead bracelets—I took two packs of cards one afternoon—we had asked him before whether he bought old silver—Mr. Read said that they did not deal in new things, only anique things and curiosities—I took some of the plate about the second time after I had been there—I took it at different times—on this occasion I took some forks and spoons, and the bead bracelets—one spoon was broken—I do not remember whether the ladle was broken or not—he told me it was not much use buying the plated things, because they were not worth melting—Mr. Read gave me one of the forks and told me to take it back to my mamma, as it was not silver—he said he would come and speak to my mamma—he did not say my mamma was to come and</p>

               <p>speak to him, but that he would go and see her if she made an appointment to meet him—he only said that on the last occasion—I never said that my mamma was so busy packing her boxes that she had not been able to come to see him—he did not ask for an appointment—I did not tell him on one occasion that my mamma would have called on him but that the housemaid and the other servants had insisted on going out suddenly for a holiday—Drew did not say so in my presence—we told him that we were cousins—I told him that Drew had been adopted by my mamma and papa, because his father and mother were dead—I do not think I told him where they had died—it is a fact that Drew's father is alive at this moment—I told Read when I brought the two candlesticks that my mamma had no use for them, and that she was no judge of them, and would he be good enough to see what the value was—I thought the forks were silver—he said I had better take them back to let mamma know they were not—I took the candlesticks back with a leather bag with "A.H." on it—he told me to go back and tell my mamma that he could not give more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or two guineas for the candlesticks, as she might think they were worth more—he said the branch candlesticks were not worth more than a guinea—there were two sets—I do not know how much he gave us for the other set—Mrs. Read gave us sixpence apiece—I asked him if he bought cards—he said, "Yes"—I went on the second occasion with a riding whip in my hand, and dressed as if I was going out riding, and told them we were going to a riding school to take lessons—that was not true—at another time we told him we were in a very great hurry, as we were going to see Christy's Minstrels with my mamma and papa—they said that they must take the plate to Mr. Hanley's, to get it weighed, and see what it really was worth—Mrs. Read said, "Perhaps you cannot wait?"—we said that we could, and we waited—I do not think I said that I wanted to take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to my mamma—I never got more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a cheque from Mr. Read for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go back and say that I enjoyed Christy's Minstrels very much—I did not go for a day or two after that—I told him the last time I went that my mamma would see him between ten and eleven next morning, as he had said that he really must see her—I did not go there after that—he did not say that he would pay me no more money until he had seen her—Drew was not with me the last time—I was alone—I received between 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—no money was owing to me for plate, nor did he say that he would not pay it till he had seen my mamma.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—on the 10th July I went with Mr. Henderson to the prisoner's shop in Great Turnstile, and saw in the window a box containing a silver bouquet holder, a gold pencil case, gold cross, silver brooch, and other things—I could see those from the outside—these articles on the second page of this list were found in the back parlour—I told Read I was a police officer—I pointed to the things lying in the window, and asked him who he got that property from—he said, "Why do you ask that question?" I said, "This property is stolen from Mr. Henderson's chambers, in the Temple." He said that he bought them from a female, and he thought her name was Henderson, and she lived over the water—I asked him if he had any more property—he said, "No,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130054"/>
               <p>nothing more than what you see"—I showed him Wilton's photograph, and asked him if he knew that boy—he said, "Yes; that boy and another boy brought the things to my shop." I said, "You bought them of a boy, not of a female, then?" He said, "Yes"—I went into the back parlour, and saw these two candelabra on some drawers, these two candlesticks, and in one of the drawers was found this plated bread basket, eleven plated forks, a silver strainer, a silver vinaigrette, punch and sauce ladles, and other articles—I asked him where he got them—he said that he bought them of the same two boys—I asked how much he gave for them—he said that he did not know exactly, his wife could give me more particulars than he could; that he did not like to buy of boys, but his wife would do so—I told him there was a large quantity of silver plate stolen at the same time, and asked him if he had bought any of these boys—he said, "No"—I took him to the station, and next morning told him I had ascertained that he had sold some plate at a silversmith's in Holborn—he said, "Yes"—I asked him who he got it from—he said, "From the two boys."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith and jeweller, of Holborn—I have known Read for some years—on the 23rd June he brought me some silver spoons and forks and five half-pint silver mugs, weighing together from fifty to fifty-five ounces, for which I gave him 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at the rate of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce—it was then sold to Mr. Sirrell, a buyer, and has been melted—Read afterwards offered me this pair of candlesticks and this candelabra—I offered him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, but he would not take it—a few days afterwards he brought me some rings and a pair of silver shoe buckles—I offered him a price for them, which he refused—I sold the plate in exactly the same state as I received it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Jack, what have you got here?" He said, "Some iron that has been dredged up." I said, "Let me look at it"—he then slipped the bag off his shoulder and tried to make his escape—he kicked at me twice in the private parts—we had a scuffle, when assistance came, and he was taken to the station—the others got away—the bag contained plates like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the following Monday I apprehended Parker—I told him he would be charged as con<lb/>cerned with others in stealing a quantity of iron from the Millwall Iron Works on Saturday—he said, "I know nothing about the iron; I was not there"—on Wednesday evening I apprehended Greaney, and told him that he would be charged for being concerned with others in stealing iron from the Millwall Iron Works—he said, "I was in the boat with Parker"—I had known Parker before.</p>

I said, "Yes, I do." He said, "If you go round to Broad Street you will find him at the stables; he has just gone round there"—he afterwards admitted that he was Mitchell—I said, "We are officers, and we have a warrant to search your premises"—I read the warrant to him, and he said, "I have no such papers as are mentioned in that warrant in my office"—I said, "Well, we must go in and see"—he said, "You cannot go in; the place is locked, and the landlord has the keys"—we found it was locked—I put a boy through the window, and he let us in—when inside, Mitchell opened a cupboard, and said, "There are all my papers; these are my desks; that one over the way belongs to Mr. Marshall"—finding they were locked, I said, "We must open these desks"—he said, "I have not got the keys"—I sent for a locksmith, and had them opened—in the top drawer on the left-hand side I found these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked 1, 2, and 3—Mr. Hall, from the Law Institution, was standing by me when they were taken out, and he said, "Why these are the identical papers"—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for these papers being in your drawer?"—he said, "That is not my drawer; I know nothing about them"—I also found this draft of a letter, marked "4"—Bull found a bottle of medicine which the prisoner said he had been taking for a diseased heart—he wanted to take some of it then, but I would not let him—that bottle was in the same drawer as that in which the papers were.</p>

               <p>[The prisoner's statement before the Lord Mayor was read, as follows:—"I am here, my lord, upon a charge of stealing printed papers from the library of the Incorporated Law Society. It will be necessary to tell you that about three months since I was instructed to obtain a copy of one or more of the monster charter petitions presented to the House of Commons. After making a diligent search at the British Museum and other places I found that there had been three presented, one in the sessions of 1829, 1842, and 1848, and, knowing that those and all other original petitions had been destroyed by order of the House of Commons up to the session</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130062"/>
               <p>1850, amounting to eleven tons in weight, being considered by the House of no value, I applied to Mr. Hansard's printing office to know whether they had any waste copies of the petitions in question. The answer was, 'No, they are out of print.' I will explain why I asked for waste copies. Public petitions, after being presented to the House, are printed in large quantities, as you see (referring to the appendices), and they are then sent to the members' residences, public offices, and distributed for the benefit of the public three times a week, to save trouble in constantly referring to the original petitions, which can be seen by the public at any time without the payment of a fee. These copies are called <hi rend="italic">Appendices to the Reports on Public Petitions</hi>, when, after they are circulated to the public, they become waste paper, and copies then may be seen in almost any butter shop in London. Three copies, of course, are kept at the British Museum, under special Act of Parliament. If the original petitions are condemned to destruc<lb/>tion, being worthless, of what possible value can the waste copies be? They may be seen at the end of each session sent away from the House of Commons, and other offices, in large quanties as waste paper. There is a book called <hi rend="italic">The Journals of the House</hi>, which contains a record of all its proceedings, present<lb/>ments of accounts, public and private petitions, deposits, &amp;c., which is con<lb/>sidered to be a valuable document, which book and other valuable papers it was my duty to produce before the courts of law when required—I think some years ago I was of assistance to the gentleman conducting this prose<lb/>cution in a trial for perjury against the late Mayor of Rye. With regard, my lord, to the missing papers in question, amongst other places I called at was the library of the Incorporated Law Society, and introduced myself to Mr. Lapworth, the librarian, not as a reporter of the House of Commons, as that gentleman erroneously stated, but as the proprietor of three parlia<lb/>mentary works, and told him the object of my visit, which was that I was anxious to find out when the monster charter petitions were presented, and that I wanted copies of them—Mr. Lapworth's reply was, 'If there is anything that will assist you amongst our parliamentary papers, they are at your service'—I immediately made a search and found one presented session 1839, which I took from the book, and came with it in my hand folded up to Mr. Lapworth at his desk. That gentleman said, 'Have you found what you required?' I thanked him and said, 'Yes'—on the other occasions the conversations were much the same, except the last time I called to search for Hansard's Debates for session 1842—on that occasion I left the book without telling him, as Mr. Lapworth had left the library—I think on the following day I wrote and thanked that gentleman for his courtesy, and enclosed in the letter an admission to the House of Commons—I think I called there altogether four or five times—if I had had any felonious intention of stealing any of these valueless pieces of paper I could easily have taken them from the British Museum, or have gone to the House of Commons, having access to all the offices in that establishment, and found some old copies there—I ask your lordship, is it likely that I should sacrifice my position?—I am proprietor of three parliamentary works, I hold an office in New Broad Street at a rental of 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, having, at the same time, the patronage of the Princo of Wales and many leading members of the aristocracy; also the government offices, and some of the first mercantile houses in the city of London—do you think I should sacrifice this position for a few sheets of printed paper that it would be impossible to place a value upon?—if the gentleman for the prosecution will permit me I shall have much pleasure in restoring the missing sheets four-fold—this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130063"/>
               <p>cruel prosecution has been brought about by an anonymous letter, which I hare not seen—your lordship is, perhaps, not aware that when I was arrested all my desks, cupboards, and drawers were ransacked; all my papers were taken, both public and private, including letters from the late Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gladstone), General Knollys (Equerry to the Prince of Wales), a bill of exchange for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., an agreement for a lease of my office, which the Metropolitan Railway are about to take down for the extension to Tower Hill, and of which I estimate the value at about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other papers that could not possibly have reference to this case—I had just finished one of my parliamentary works, and had given instructions to my printer to print 1500 copies, from the issue of which I fully expect to realise 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—another work of a similar character was in compilation, of equal value, but now, unfortunately for me, I am obliged to abandon them through this cruel persecution—if I had had the slightest felonious intention after using the papers complained of I should certainly have destroyed them, but, on the contrary, I did not attempt to disguise them—I did not hesitate to mention the circumstances to my clerks, or keep it secret from any person connected with me in my business; they were oftentimes lying carelessly with other papers in a desk, and it was quite by accident they were not there when the officers came to the place, which I should otherwise have avoided if I felt I had wilfully stolen them—all I have to say, my lord, in conclusion, is, that I beg to express my deepest contrition and regret at what has taken place, and I sincerely hope and entreat that your lordship and the court will take into its serious con<lb/>sideration the extreme harass of mind I have already undergone, the im<lb/>prisonment I have suffered, and the heavy loss I have sustained, not only in pocket, but position, and give me an opportunity of regaining that character and position by foregoing the prosecution, and granting me an acquittal".<hi rend="smallCaps">

I don't want to fight"—Burgin was going wrangle again, and got up in an attitude of fighting—they closed and got entangled—they fought one round and were parted by two men—I then went away—I returned some few minutes after seven, and Fisher was then on the green senseless, with blood all over his face.</p>

I am a blacksmith, and live at Notting Hill—on 25th July I was at the "Britannia" public-house, asleep in the parlour—I was awoke by a noise—I went into the bar and saw Burgin in a scuffle with Fisher—the landlord separated them—Burgin put ten shillings on the bar, and said he would fight Fisher and give him sixpence a round to fight—he threw his cap on my feet, and I kicked it back to him—he said, "What did you do that for?"—I said, "What did you throw it on my feet for? If you throw it there again I shall kick it again"—he deliberately picked it up and threw it with full force at my feet again—I kicked it back again—he then got up and was going to strike me—he said he had fought bigger men than me, and he could fight me—the landlord put him down and told him he had better not fight me, he would get in the wrong—he pulled his things off and went out to fight—his wife came to prevent</p>

About three o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 25th July, I saw the prisoner coming from the rear of Ports-down Road, in Clifton Gardens, in the direction of the back of the prosecutor's house—he was carrying these two bags in his hand, and as he came along I saw him put this screwdriver into the big bag—on seeing me he went back a little—he then came forward—I went back out of sight and he came towards me—I went to see if I could find a policeman in uniform—I was in plain clothes—not seeing one, I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Good morning;" he said, "Good morning," and asked me the way to the Great Western Railway—I told him I did not know, and asked him what he had got in the bags—he said, "Oh! you have no need to look; it is all right, I assure you"—I told him I was a police constable, and I should like to see—on looking in the bag I found this property and a candle partly consumed—I asked him where he got these from—he refused to tell—he said he was going to take them to the Great Western Railway to meet his master—I told him he would have to go to the police-station to satisfy us how he came in possession of them—I took the bags in my left hand and caught hold of him with my right hand—he struck me a very violent blow at the side of the head and ran away—I ran after him for about 300 yards, and then overtook him and knocked him down—we had a struggle, and he got away from me and jumped over some railings—I followed him for about 300 or 400 yards into another field, and there we had another struggle together for about an hour and a quarter—during that time he got on the top of me and ran a small chisel, which he took from his pocket, into the corner of my right eye, and also in several places in my face—he got my thumb into his mouth and severely bit it—he also bit my second finger; at the same time he took hold of me by the collar, and said, "You b—, if you don't let me go I will kill you"—we had a desperate struggle together—an old watchman at last came up and took him to the station—I had a rattle with me; no staff—I have not been able to find the chisel that he struck me with—I took possession of the property, and afterwards showed it to Mrs. Leate.</p>

On the evening of the 30th July I was in High Street, Aldgate, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and a man not in custody walking side by side, with their hands in their pockets—in consequence of what I saw, I said to the prisoner, "I am a police constable, I shall charge you with attempting to pick pockets"—he said "What is your game?" and at the same time got hold of the black guard which was fastened to a silver watch in my waistcoat pocket—he took my watch and threw it to some one in the crowd—I seized him by the collar—a great many people of the lowest class came round, and after a very severe struggle he bent himself and threw me over his shoulder, and I came down on the top of my head—as I went over his shoulder my feet went through a shop window—I felt much pain for a fortnight afterwards—I got up, collared him again, and after another struggle, in which parties assisted me, I was thrown again—I felt that I could not get up any more, but twisted myself round the prisoner's legs, so that he could not move them—he struggled to get away, and pulled me up by my hair—some of the others joined with him, and completely pulled him away from me—he went twenty yards, and was then brought back to me by two plain clothes men who had come up—I went to the surgeon of the club—I felt sore for a fortnight—my watch was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was taken to the station—his left coat pocket had no bottom to it.</p>

I am a sheriff's officer, and live at 12, Pea Row, Kilburn—on 1st August, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to 1, Dock Street, Wapping, to arrest the prisoner—I saw him at the end of the room, went up to him, and said, "Mr. Bugby, I have a warrant to arrest you, at the suit of Mr. Green," opening the warrant and reading the name and the amount it was for—he said, "I suppose you want the money?"—I said, "No, I do not; my warrant is to arrest you"—he said that he would kill any man who attempted to take him out of the house—I said, "It is no use your talking like that; you will have to go with me, and you might as well go quietly," on which he struck me in the face two or three times, and also struck my assistant Milsom, who was with me—we both took hold of him and pulled him half-way along the shop—he called out for a knife, and called on a sailor, who was there, to assist him—Milsom went out for a policeman, while I struggled with the prisoner for ten minutes—he repeatedly struck me, and I struck him several times in self-defence—he called out again, "Give me a knife, and I will have the b—heart out of him"—we still kept struggling together till we got to the end of the room, where there were some knives on a table—he caught up the carving-knife, which was the longest, in his left-hand, raised it in this manner, and said, "Now I will have your b—heart out"—he made a strike at me, with the point of it towards my chest—I let go of his collar, raised my left arm, put my hand up, and caught the knife in the centre of my hand—he made a second strike at me, which I caught between my forefinger and thumb—I wrenched it out of his hand, and threw it on the floor—he ran out at the back-door into the yard and tried to fasten the door against me, but I got between the door and the door-post—he then struck me on the head with a scrubbing-brush and afterwards with a shovel—he continued in the yard a quarter of an hour, and then made a rush into the house—Milsom came back with a constable, and I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he ask you to show your authority, and did not you say, "I shall not show you any authority; you must come with me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had the warrant open in my hand—this was in the coffee-room—a sailor and two females were present—it was not I who took the knife up—the sailor is here—the prisoner's wife did not succeed in getting the knife from both of us—very likely the prisoner's hand was cut—the surgeon wished to attend to it at the station, but the prisoner would not allow him.</p>

I am a clothes salesman, and live at 45, Prince's Road, Notting Hill—on Monday night, 2nd July, about half-past nine, I locked up my shop—all my premises were then secure—the shop was full of clothes—I returned about half-past eleven to twelve on the same night—I found the candle that I had placed on the counter, moved, and a ticket was on the counter that had been on a coat—the coat was missing—I am quite certain it was there when I went out—I found a shelf on which some clothes were kept was empty, and the clothes gone—an entrance had been effected from the back window—that was fastened with a catch—some flowers on the ledge had been lifted down, and the catch forced backwards—the lock upon the door leading to the room had been forced back—the door was open—it was shut when I went away—I found a screwdriver in the shop—the constable compared it with the marks on the door—the prisoner lodged in the kitchen under my shop—he had done so about two months—I didn't see him on the night of the robbery, but I know he left the premises on the Monday morning—I heard him come upstairs and go out—I lost eight coats and some trousers—they have not been found.</p>

On 3rd July I went to the prose-cutor's house, in consequence of information—I found that the window leading from the back yard had been forced open by the catch being forced back, and the door leading from the back parlour to the shop had been forced by something being put in, and the lock forced back—he gave me this screwdriver and told me he found it in his shop—the mark on the side of the door where the lock was forced back exactly corresponds with the small end of this—I think part of the socket was broken off and that made a dent in the ironwork—I went in search of the prisoner—I apprehended him in some waste fields at Hammersmith—I told him I wanted him for committing a burglary in Prince's Road, Notting Hill—he said, "I know nothing about it; it's no use asking me any questions, for I know nothing."</p>

I am deputy warehouse keeper at the "B" jetty in the Victoria Docks—Lowrie was quay foreman there—I believe he has been in the service of the company—on Saturday, the 30th of June, at eleven o'clock, I was at the "B" jetty—I saw some one push off the barge <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi>, but could not say that it was Gulliver—Lowrie was there—I went to speak to him, but before I had time to put a question he said he was preparing sweepings for forty-two pockets of linseed, an order for which he held in his hands—the order was not signed—I then com-municated with the constable Grigg—a short time afterwards I saw the barge <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi> alongside—Gulliver was then in charge—I saw taken out of that barge thirty-three bushels of linseed sweepings from the centre—that was worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lowrie ought not to have delivered without having an order properly signed at the office—this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not properly signed—it ought to be signed by Messrs. Lang and Merridew, the merchants, and at our office—when a delivery is made to a barge it is Lowrie's duty to see that an entry of it is made in a book—no such entry was made—I have not the book here—the quantity of sweep<lb/>ings usually given with forty pockets of linseed is two bushels—that would be a fair quantity—these forty-two pockets of linseed were after<lb/>wards delivered for a proper order, and I have the order with me—that was a portion of the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Bengallon</hi>—these sweepings were taken from a pile off the quay where Lowrie was—I saw that pile on Friday—on Saturday, when I spoke to Lowrie, that pile was gone—I should say there would be about thirty-three bushels in that pile—on Saturday I found some loose bags on a pile of saltpetre—Lowrie ought not to have delivered any pockets or any sweepings on this order.</p>

               <p>some conversation with him, and in consequence of that I went to Lowrie, who was in his box near the "B" jetty—I said, "Have you delivered any seed or seed sweepings lately?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Be careful what you say; have you delivered any seed or seed sweepings during the day, or authorised any to be delivered?"—he said, "No, I have neither delivered any seed nor authorised any to be delivered during the day"—I said, "There must be some mistake; come with me and see Jones"—we went to Jones—I said to him, "Jones, have you delivered any seed or seed sweepings from this jetty to-day?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "How much?"—he said, "I believe it is about three or four quarters"—I said, "By whose authority did you deliver those?"—he said, "By Mr. Lowrie's authority"—I then said to Lowrie, "You hear what Jones says, Mr. Lowrie?"—he said, "Yes, I was not aware that any had been delivered"—I then requested him to go to the superintendent's office—when there the superintendent asked him if any seed had been delivered, and he said, yes; he had delivered it to forward business—he said there had been an order from the lightermen, but it was not correct—Lowrie was then suspended—it is the practice in the docks that no orders are to be passed to a fore<lb/>man unless they are previously passed by the general office and properly signed—I then saw Gulliver on the "B" jetty, and said, "There is some<lb/>thing wrong about this, Gulliver; you had better come with me to the superintendent's office"—he said, in the superintendent's presence, that the seed was delivered to him by Lowrie according to the order that he had in his possession—he was allowed to go away, but was afterwards taken upon a warrant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer, in the London Road, Southwark—about August, 1864, I was recommended to Cross as an attorney—I employed him to collect a debt of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to me from a Mr. Romsey—he collected that, but never paid it over to me—I did not see him from the 14th September until about a month ago, when I gave him in charge—I never gave him authority to sign my name to any document—the signature "A. Raphael" on the back of this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing.</p>
