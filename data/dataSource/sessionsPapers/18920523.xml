I went through the form of marriage with the prisoner on 29th October, 1691, and up to 14th April he resided with me—on that day we went down the King's Road together; we had words together, and parted—when I returned home, about four p.m., I found the parlour window and folding doors broken open, my box broken open, and £15 in gold taken away—I had seen the money safe at two, previous to our going out—it was my money; I had sold some of my furniture to make the money up—I had not given the prisoner or anyone else leave to take it; no one knew but he that it was there—he knew 1 had sold the furniture the day before; he wrote out the receipts—he had also taken his own wearing apparel—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I gave information to the police directly, and they saw the room disarranged—the box in which the money was was in the front parlour, and he got in by the front parlour window.</p>

On 23rd April I apprehended the prisoner at Southampton—I read the warrant to him; he made no reply—next morning, while walking to the railway station, the prisoner said, "I broke open the box to find my discharge and pension papers, as I could not find them in my own box; I could find no money in the box, and I don't believe there was any there. She told me she did not keep any in the house, but at the bank. She has written me two or three letters, and I have answered them, and she knew perfectly well where I was."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the Sunday evening after I had been to Southampton she said, "I don't believe he had the money"—I believe I had told her he had run up a bill at the hotel there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined;</hi> I called to tell her the prisoner had been brought back from Southampton, and she said, "I don't believe now he has the money"—she did not say that in consequence of anything I said to her—the prisoner said he had quarrelled with Mrs. Hodgson, that he had got in by the window, as he had often done before, and opened the box to try and find his papers, but that he did not see any money there.</p>

I am station-master at Hounslow—on 2nd May, About 5.50, Mr. Gunn came and made a communication to me—I Went to the crossing, and when I was about 400 yards from it I saw the four prisoners apparently putting something on the line—I secured Stevens and Cooper, and handed them to a policeman; the other two ran away—I found on the crossing some pieces of brick and cement, an old pail, and some clinkers—the pail was close to the line, and had been crushed—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen it before; it belonged to the fogman, and was kept in his hut, close to the level crossing—the bricks were so close to the metals that the flange of the engine would strike them—one piece of brick appeared to be a little chipped by the engine—when charged, Cooper said that the little boys did it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not lay my hands on any of the boys; I had not the chance—the porter grasped Cooper and another, and said, "Why are you putting things on the rail?"—one said, "I did not do it," and Cooper said, "I did not do it; I will tell who did it"—the porter said, "Then you had better tell the station-master"—he then said that Crook and Newman placed the obstruction on the line—they had run away—I saw them before the Magistrate the next morning—the pail had been by the hut since the foggy weather, and probably before—it was intact before this, but it was disused.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It could be used for putting fire in when I saw it last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a railway porter at Hounslow Station—on 2nd May, about 5.40, I went to this level crossing and saw the four prisoners</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205230019"/>
               <p>running backwards and forwards across the line—they ran away when I went up; I ran after them and caught Cooper and Stevens—Stevens refused to walk to the station, and a gentleman let me put him into his trap—the ticket-taker took Cooper to the station—I saw the two trains come through, and attended both of them on the platform—there were passengers in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said to Stevens, "Come back to the station with me"—he said, "I shan't"—I said, "You will have to come some way or other"—he started kicking—a gentleman came by with a horse and trap, and I asked him to give us a lift, but I had to strap Stevens' legs before he got in, to stop his kicking—I took him to the railway station and fetched a constable.</p>

On 2nd May, about 6.30, I was called to Hounslow Station, and Stevens and Cooper were given into my custody—they said, going to the station, that it was not them; it was Crook and Newman—I found on Stevens four linch-pins, similar to those used for connecting points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I got to the station the station-master told me he wanted to give Stevens and Cooper in custody for placing bricks and an old pail on the line—on the road Stevens said, "It was not us; it was Crook"—Cooper said, "It was not us"—the two little boys were brought to the station by another constable—neither of them said that he had been smashing these pins on the railway—Cooper lives with his parents; his father is a night watchman at the powder mills, and is a very respectable man—Crook's parents are very respectable; they keep a small dairy.</p>

I am carman to Charles Webster, a carman, of 85, Camden Road, Bow—on 2nd May I left there with a horse and cart laden with fourteen chests of tea, covered with a sheet, to take to Clyde Wharf—when I got to Nightingale Lane, a quarter of a mile oft about half-past five, I found the traffic blocked—I drew up on the near side, and went into a urinal thirty yards off, leaving a friend of mine, Benjamin Doyle, in charge of the cart—when I came back after two or three minutes I found the cart gone, and Doyle too; I have not seen him since—I went to the Police-station about half-past eight, and then to my employer about ten—I gave Doyle's address, 50, Christian Street, to the constable—I used to work for Mr. Nelsen; I had been discharged—it took me ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to get to the place where I lost the cart.</p>

               <p>they almost tipped the horse up—with the assistance of a ticket collector we shifted the boxes forward—the prisoner came up and said, "What's the matter, governor? Who has been interfering with my load?"—it was about seven; it was not dark—I told him what I had done, and asked him if he was the carman—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you work for Webster?" (I saw that name on the sheet and on the harness)—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you any papers to show you are the carman?"—he said, "No, I was taking them to Webster's yard and wanted no papers"—I was satisfied with his replies; he drove away in the direction of Bow, and in the direction of Webster's—I followed some way, and, as he kept looking back, I thought it suspicious, and held up my hand and called to him to stop; instead of doing so he lashed the horse into a gallop—I gave chase, but lost sight of him; there was no other vehicle about—I informed Mr. Webster at the time, and he was satisfied that everything was all right; but afterwards he found that it was stolen, and I gave a description to Detective-Sergeant Pearce, and on the following Sunday morning, 8th May, I was called to Leman Street Police-station, and identified the prisoner from eight or nine men, first by his features, and then I called him out and asked him to walk to see if he was lame, as the man with the cart was lame; the prisoner is lame—I was three or four minutes making inquiries of him—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man I saw in charge of the cart.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Webster, carman, of Camden Road—I was there on Monday, 2nd May, at five minutes to five when the horse and cart went out in charge of Brady, laden with fourteen chests of tea, value £113—Brady came back without the horse or cart about ten o'clock—I have not seen the tea since, but the horse and cart have been recovered—I do not know the prisoner; he had no authority to be on our cart—I know Doyle; Brady had no authority to leave the cart with him, nor to take him up—Doyle had been with us some three months, and had been discharged about six weeks at this time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I was twenty-one years old last February—I was in the employ of Mr. Kahn, a furniture dealer, of St. Andrew's Street, Holborn, as junior warehouseman till April 21, when I was given in custody; I made a statement when I was arrested, and I have pleaded guilty to-day to this indictment—in November, 1890,1 was in Messrs. Copestake's employment, and was introduced to Lewis as Mr. Fredericks, at 110, London Wall—I went there to borrow £4—I told him where I was employed, and he sent his son round to see that I was in the employment—I afterwards borrower other sums of £1 and 30s., and gave promissory notes, and paid them by instalments—I left Messrs. Copestake's in October, 1891, and went into employment in St. Paul's Churchyard, and from there to Messrs. Kahn's on February 9th this year—I sometimes</p>

               <p>fell behind in my instalments, and Lewis wrote to me about it, but I burnt nearly every one of the letters—these are some of the receipts which I paid to Lewis (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—from the time I first borrowed money of him I never got out of his debt—he said if I did not pay on the day it was duo ho would take my salary from Hunt's—I had signed this paper to that effect. (<hi rend="italic">Assigning his weekly salary to Lewis as security for the loan</hi>)—I left Hunt's on February 17th, and Lewis gave me this. (<hi rend="italic">A notice to Messrs. Hunt, withdrawing his claim on the salary</hi>)—before that I had received this memorandum. (<hi rend="italic">To the witness from J. Fredericks, enclosing receipt far</hi> £1, <hi rend="italic">and stating that he should require a further payment on Saturday, or steps would be taken which he would regret.</hi>)—at the time I went into Mr. Kahn's employment, Lewis had my promissory note for about £8—I signed the last promissory note on February 20th—I got 25s. a week at Kahn's—Lewis knew that; he always inquired what my salary was before he advanced me the money—I paid him 5s. a week from the time I went to Kahn's—at the beginning of March I went to Lewis to tell him I was at Kahn's—he came to see me there, and said he wanted a suite of furniture re-covered, and asked if I could bring him some samples of something to London Wall to show him—I took round a sample of saddle-bag and of red velvet—he said he did not care for it; he liked silk tapestry—I took some samples of silk tapestry to him, and gave him Kahn's price, 13s.—he said he would settle the price after he had shown it to his daughter—I called soon after, and he gave me an order for 8 £ yards, and showed me the one he had selected, and said, "What are you going to charge me?"—I said, "I have told you the price, 13s."—he said, "It will not cost you anything, so you can let me have it for about half that price; I don't suppose you will be found out"—I then told him he could have it for 8s. a yard—he would not have it at that price, and we finally agreed that he should have it at 5s. a yard—his son, aged about twenty-six, was present at some of the conversations—on a Friday, between two and three o'clock, I took him 8 1/2 yards of tapestry which I had stolen from my employer; I cut it off and took it from the warehouse, and gave it to him—his son was with him—he looked at it and said, "That will do," and wrote a cheque for £2 2s. 6d.—his son went with me to the bank, and I went in and endorsed the cheque, and received the money—the son waited outside for me; I gave him two shillings for himself, and gave him the gold to give to his father—whenever I borrowed money it was usual to give something to the clerk; I have given him a half-crown on some occasions—after that Lewis wanted some lace curtains, and I sent him round two pairs, and told him the price would be six shillings a pair, as far as I could judge, but there was no ticket on them—that was Kahn's price—he gave me this card with a black corner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as the address to send them to, and I tied them up in paper and took them to the Great Western Railway Office, Holborn Circus, and sent them to 14, Beresford Road, Highbury New Park—he paid me 3s. 6d. for the two pairs—he said he was going to sell them to a friend, and that he wanted some more—I said, "We have not got any more of that kind"—he said, "Send me a sample of the nearest you have got to it"—I sent him a sample pair of Swiss curtains for which Kahn's price was 13s. 9d.; he paid me for them sometimes 3s. 6d., and sometimes 4s.—I sold him six pairs at 13s. 9d.—that went on till a</p>

               <p>week or ten days before I was arrested—when I told him I had no more at that price he said two pair, more were all he wanted—J told him 15s. 9d. was the nearest; he told me to send him two pairs, and I did so—he paid me 4s. for them; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after I had got all he said, "I don't suppose you will be found out, will you?"—he kept some of the money to pay my instalments—on 20th April Mr. Hallam spoke to me, and I went to London Wall with a detective the same day, and pointed out Lewis—his place is about a quarter of an hour's sharp walking from Mr. Kahn's place—I have known Defries getting on for three years—he has a second-hand clothes shop in Nile Street, Hoxton, four or five minutes' walk from my house—I told him on February 20th that I was employed at Kahn's, and should not require clothes any more—he asked me if I could send him something by Garter, Paterson, and Co., as he very often had things sent to him by them, and I could have the money when I called in the evening—I sent him two French rugs, for which Kahn's price was 13s. 9d. each; he gave me 5s. for the two—I afterwards sent him some silk curtains, price £5, for which he gave me sometimes 6s. and sometimes 10s.—I sent about three pairs direct to his house—I stopped sending them because he did not like the van driving up so often, and I sent some to my house, and he arranged what time he should meet me outside my house in the evening—he came there two or three times, and I brought down the parcels from upstairs which I had directed to my house, and gave them to him—they contained silk curtains—that went on up to, I think, the Tuesday before I was arrested—I recognise these silk curtains—Mr. Kahn's price for them is £5.</p>

I first saw Lewis on November 9th—I went there because a man named Kennedy sent me a cutting out of the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>—I was at Copestake's about ten months, and before that at Rotherham's, of Shoreditch, and before that at Simpson's in Queen Victoria Street, a furnishing warehouse—before that I was apprenticed to a grocer in Powis Street, Woolwich—I was not in monetary difficulties in November, 1890, but I wanted £4—I may have borrowed a shilling before that—I was nineteen then—he asked my age, and I told him my exact age—I was nineteen in November, 1890—I never told him I was of age—he asked my salary—he did not tell me I should have to go before a Commissioner, but I went—I had no Testament put into my hand—he did not read the declaration over to me—this is my signature, but the paper was not read over to me before I signed it—I did not say I was a clerk at Copestake's at a salary of £45 per annum—I told them £35, with board and lodging free of expense, payable monthly. (<hi rend="italic">This staled</hi>, "Income from all sources £45")—I had nothing but my salary—I was getting £35, and I wrote "£45"; I was to have £45 if I was there two months longer—I never borrowed of anyone but Mr. Lewis, but I have other debts; I used to have an account with my tailor—if I did not pay, Mr. Lewis was to give Messrs. Hunt my assignment of my salary, and he sent it to them in February, 1892—they did not dismiss me upon that; I had given them notice before—I told Mr. Lewis I was going to have some money when I came of age; I gave him a charge on the legacy, and he wrote to my aunt; she lives at Hemel Hempstead—I have told the jury the full and true account of my dealings with Lewis—I was committed for trial here from Guildhall—I wrote a note to the solicitor the night before last, and saw Mr. Wontner's clerk yesterday</p>

               <p>and Inspector Denning, who had taken me to Mr. Lewis—two warders were also present—I was in Newgate—the interview lasted an hour before dinner, and two hours after—something was written down in my presence—it was about March 8th when Mr. Lewis first spoke to me about goods—I first sent goods to Defries about March 4th—he had asked me as far back as February 20th to send them, that was to steal them—I did not lead him to believe that I would; I had no intention in my mind to steal—I first had the intention to steal when Lewis asked me for goods—I used to pass Defries' place nearly every day going home from business, but had not spoken to him about sending him any goods before the day I sent them—I sent him the first goods in March; on March 4th I became a thief—the first parcel of my stolen goods went to Defries—I cannot remember whether I sent him another parcel on the 7th—I went on some little time, but I cannot remember the dates—I first sent him two rugs; that was my first theft—he gave me 6s. for one pair of curtains, and 10s. for another—I sent him six pairs of curtains altogether: three by Carter, Paterson and Co., and three delivered to him personally at my home—that is seven distinct acts of stealing from my employers—I sent goods to a man named Chandler, a bricklayer, about two days before I was arrested; I sent him a pair of silk curtains like these—Defries introduced him to me some months before, and told me that he sold what I brought him to Chandler—I met him in Defries' shop, and agreed to let him have a pair of those curtains, and he had two pairs—I stole them, and got 10s. a pair for them, and spent the money on myself—I never took anything from any of my employers before March this year—I was discharged for intemperance at Hunt's—I do not remember going to the Fountain public-house, City Road, but I have been at the Green Gate plenty of times—I have met White in Nile Street, City Road, but not is Defries' shop—it was when I was going to Defries'—I have only known White this year—he had a pair of curtains—I sent the parcel to 31, Windsor Terrace, City Road, by Carter, Paterson and Co., from the Great Western booking office, about a month before I was arrested—Defries introduced me to White—I also sent a pair of silk curtains to J. C. Wernheim, at some gardens in Bayswater, about the end of March; I got two guineas for them—the price was £5 at Kahn's, but he did not know that—nobody introduced me to him; it was through an advertisement—he sent me three postal orders, two for £1, and one for 2s.—I think I spent it on myself—I have never sent goods on other occasions, or sold anything at a public-house, or to a person I met there—I think I have seen that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi>' <hi rend="italic">son</hi>) at Mr. Lewis house; I cannot say that I have seen him at his office—I do not remember seeiog any patterns on the table at Mr. Lewis' office which I had not let him have—I do not remember taking up some patterns in the presence of Lewis and his two sons, and saying that my people dealt in such goods—I never said, If you want anything like this I can got them cheaper for you than you can, and that it would benefit me, as I should get a commission"—I never knew that I was allowed to have goods if I paid for them; I never asked—on the day before I was arrested, a little before four o'clock. I met Mr. Hallam coming upstairs; I had a parcel in my hand containing a pair of curtains—I told Mr. Hallam that it was a rug—that</p>

               <p>was a lie—he is buyer and foreman to Mr. Kahn—I said that I was sending it home to my mother—that was another lie—he asked me if I had entered it, and I said yes, but I did not say, "Yes, in the appro. book"—Lewis told me he wanted the material to cover a suite of his furniture—I did not say that I had got a remnant—on Friday, the 11th, I brought the goods; I did not bring a pattern—I did not say that the pattern was a remnant of about 8 1/2 yards—Lewis did not say anything about haying curtains of the same pattern, but he said he should like a pair of the same, material—I said that the 8 1/2 yards would not be sufficient to coyer the suite and supply curtains—Lewis did not say in his son's presence that Swiss curtains would do as well, nor did I say that I would get some travellers' samples, which were only a little disturbed in the way of trade, and I could let him have a pair for 10s.; nothing of that kind took place—this pair of lace curtains have never been used as travellers' samples—young Lewis had lent me 1s. 6d. in the Angel public-house, and I gave him 3s. back for it the next day—I sent Lewis about five patterns of silk tapestry before I got the £2 2s. 6d.—I do not think I took him these patterns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) three days after I got the cheque—I won't swear I did not—I did not say I had got 16 yards of that which I could let him have, which would do for the suite and curtains—this is proper material for covering the suite and for curtains—I took the 8 1/2 yards to his office, not to his home; I am sure of that—I sent him a table-cover—I stole that—this is the first time I have given evidence—the table-cover I sent him was not returned to me; he gave me half-acrown for it; the price of it was eight shillings—he also had two rugs; I don't recollect anything else—I sold him a pair of guipure curtains before April 4th; they were never returned to me—he had two rugs from me: I do not know the dates—I had not a rug in my possession on April 20th—nothing at all was ever returned to me—Defries sold the goods through Chandler, who was examined before the Magistrate and discharged—when I was arrested I told the police that I had sent goods to White—I did not, on the very day I was arrested, produce a parcel containing a rug; I showed Mr. Hallam a rug which I had returned from my house to the business premises, but I had not taken one out of the place—that was another lie.</p>

I have known Defries about three years—I sold two or three. secondhand suits to him—I sold him some on the Saturday before I entered Mr. Kahn's service, and he then for the first time suggested that I should bring him articles—he did not say "thieve," but he said it in such a way that I understood I was to steal them—I was shocked at the proposition, and he told me he bought stolen property—'he said, "You can send by Carter, Paterson's"—I refused to do anything of the kind—I first had an intention of stealing after my interview with Lewis in March—I was an honest young man up to that time—a detective came to me on the 21st, and brought a list of names from the booking-office, and said, "You have sent parcels to those persons?" and I said, "Yes"—the curtains I sold at 6s. and 10s. a pair were worth £5 a pair—I sold lace ones for 3s. 6d. and silk ones for 5F; and 5s. 6d.—Defries lives at St. Mary Axe—I owed him about £3—I only sold him two old suits—I am giving my evidence to day in the interests of justice—I do not expect to get a lighter sentence.</p>

I am a cabinetmaker and upholsterer, of 7, Newington Green Road, Balls Pond—I have been there eighteen months on my own account—before then I was a journeyman in the service of Mr. Emanuel, of Crown Street, Soho, for fourteen years, and I was apprenticed five years to him—the prisoner Lewis is my father, he lives at Highbury with my sister—my brother Bertie lives in St. Paul's Road—I sleep at 7, Newington Road; I used to have my breakfast, lunch, and dinner at home—my father has carried on business at London Wall for three or four years, but I was not concerned in it—the drawing-room furniture was moth-eaten; there were some small chairs and a couch, and two arm-chairs to cover, and I told my father in March to have them done before the warm weather set in; he said he would get some patterns at Rotherham's, and I called at his place in the City that day and saw some patterns of tapestry on the table; I looked at them, and the bell rang, and Brett came in; he spoke to my father; he took up one of them and said, "If you want any of these I can get them cheaper for you; my firm does these," and he said it might do him some good—my father asked him if he could show him any patterns; he said yes, he would come on Friday—this was on Tuesday, about March 8th—I went there on the Friday, and Brett came in and brought patterns of tapestry and silk, and said, "My firm hare a remnant of this, 8 1/2 yards; I can do it cheap"—I knew that eight yards would do for the suite, but I had not mentioned the quantity which would be required—he said, "I can do it at 5s. a yard"—he did not begin at 8s. and come down to 5s.; my father said he did not think the quantity would be enough, and Brett said that it would—my father said that he should like curtains to match, but I advised him not, but to have light ones—my father asked him to get the silk—he said, "I must ask you to give me the money first, as I have to pay for it before I take it"—my father directed my brother to, write out a cheque for the amount, which he did, and my father signed it, and handed it to Brett in my presence—as Brett went out he said, "If you want any light curtains there are a few pairs of travellers' samples; they are only a little creased, and I can do the 13s. ones at 10s., and the 15s. at 12s."—my father asked him to buy him a pair—it is not true that on the Friday the eight and a half yards were brought to my father's office; when the money was paid the material had not been brought—I first saw the remnant at home on the Friday afterwards; it came by Carter, Paterson's on Friday night, the 18th, the servant took it in; I was there when it was opened; I measured it, and found only eight and a quarter yards—I got it a few days afterwards, and covered my father's furniture with it at his house—there was only just sufficient; I had to join it—it is tapestry, silk and wool—I removed it to my place to be polished, and it was there when my father was given in custody—I did not take it away for any improper purpose, but because my father told me to—my</p>

               <p>sister is not in good health, and is not able to come here—I remember another parcel coming to my father's house at dinner-time on April 4th; my father opened it—it was some cream guipure curtains—my sister said, "No, I do not want those; I want lace"—my father said, "As you go to Mecklenburg Street to-morrow you can return them, and say we want white lace," and next morning I took the parcel away, and on my way I saw Mr. Hart; he is a distant relation of my father, and lives at 2, Mecklenburg Street—I told him I was going to the City—he said, "I am going that way, I will walk with you"—we walked up Gray's Inn Road into Holborn, and I went into Mr. Kahn's in Andrew Street, leaving him outside—I asked for Mr. Brett, and said, "These are not the curtains my father wants; he wants white lace"—I returned the parcel, and Mr. Hart and I went on to Milk Street, Cheapside, where I left him—I do not remember the white curtains coming the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have not gone by the name of Levy for the last fifteen years—I have nothing to do with the money-lending business—I do not sell anything, I mostly do repairing; I do not buy or sell—I was going to buy stuff to cover the furniture, but Brett said he could do it cheaper—I did not know who he was; I did not listen to the conversation about the money—my father said that he was employed close by, and told me to come on Friday to see whether there would be enough—if it had been cut off a piece I suppose it would have been worth 10s. a yard, not 15s.—there was no question about the price—I advised him that it was worth 5s. a yard—the cheque was paid before my father saw the bulk—my brother Albert went out with Brett—I knew the same night that my father was charged with receiving—I went before the Alderman, but did not give evidence—Mr. Graves took my proof after the committal—I heard the evidence at the Police-court—the furniture has been taken back from my place—I did not hear my father say that he had received nothing at all, or that he was not quite sure whether one or two parcels came—I have only two brothers; one of them I think is a solicitor's clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My father has been kept in custody because the bail was put so high that he could not find bail, and I have had no opportunity of consulting him—I have had no interview with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Beresford Road—at the time of this transaction I was living at 33, St. Paul's Road, Canonbury—my father started in the money-lending business in 1888—I went to America, and returned through ill-health, and joined him at London Wall as clerk—the names of Fredericks and Lewis are on the outside plate, because there are two other persons advertising as Lewis as money-lenders, and so the name of Fredericks was adopted—my father banked at the London Joint Stock Bank as E. Lewis—I am acquainted with the money transactions between him and Brett—on 8th March, as near as I can recollect my father and my brother Edward were in the office, and the bell rang; I went out to see who it was, and it was Mr. Brett—I went to my father and said, "Mr. Brett"—he said, "Let him come in"—he ought to have paid an instalment that day, but ho asked him to pay the last due—he took up some patterns,</p>

               <p>off the table, and said, "If you want anything of this kind my firm do them; I can get them cheap, and it will do me a lot of good"—my father said, "If you can show me patterns at the same price you may do so"—Brett said, "I will, but I cannot for a couple of days, as we are busy, but if you can wait till Friday I will pay my instalment, and bring the patterns down at the same time"—he then left, and came on the following Friday, and paid me 10s., and then produced the patterns of tapestry—my father and brother both looked at them, and my father said, "If you can, do that one"—he said, "We have only a remnant of eight and a half, but being a remnant I can do it cheap, 5s. a yard"—my father said, "I don't think eight and a half yards will be enough"—I said to my father, "I don't know what you want the curtains for, we have always had white"—my father agreed to nave the eight and a half yards at 5s. a yard—it is not true that on that day the eight and a half yards were brought to the office—Brett said, "As I am only supposed to get them for my own relations I must pay for it before I get the goods; as you know I have not got the money; will you give me the money?"—my father directed me to write a cheque out, and I handed it to him, and he signed it, and I gave it to Brett—I had to go and see a man between one and two o'clook, and Brett said, "I will walk with you if you will walk with me as far as the bank; I will give you the 3s. you lent me; I am not going to buy the silk today, and I shall get my salary to-morrow"—he had borrowed 5s. on the occasion of the prosecutor's wedding to buy ties and gloves, and he repaid me—I have never charged him a halfpenny for interest—he came to the office again on the 14th, and I wrote the receipt for the 10s., and gave it to him—he said to my father, "As you are not sure the 8 is enough, I have brought you another of the same quality, but I can't do this at 5s.; we have a remnant at 16s. or 18s. a yard"—this is the pattern (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my father decided not to have it—I first saw the 8 1/2 yards on the following Friday, the 18th; it came to my father's house by Carter, Paterson's—if Brett says that it was brought on Friday, the 11th, that is not true—another parcel was delivered at my father's house on March 22nd—I was at home when it came—my father opened it, saw that it was a table-cloth, and directed me to do it up and take it back next morning; I guessed it came from Brett—I had not heard of any order being given for it—I took it down to the office, and Brett came, and my father said, "You sent mo a table-cloth"—he said, "Yes"—my father said, "I do not want it," and handed it to him—I know that my brother was told to take the first curtains back, and on the 5th Brett came and said he had sent another pair, and had paid 10s. for them—a parcel containing a hearthrug came on the 11th—we had been to the synagogue, and it had been delivered—my father said he did not want it; and I did it up and took it to the office—next morning Brett came at eleven o'clock, and said "By accident I sent a parcel to your house directed wrong"—I handed it to him; and he went away with it—I did not remove my moustache to disguise myself; I do it every summer.</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived at 2, Mecklenburg Street ten years—I am Lewis's second cousin—early in April Edward Lewis called on me about 10.30 a.m. by appointment on, a matter of business—we then walked to Holborn—he had a brown paper parcel with him, which he took down St. Andrew's Street and returned without it—he then walked with me to Cheapside till I turned up Wood Street, and we separated—I was at Mr. Lewis's office early in March about a monetary transaction of my own, and Brett called, but I did not hear his name—Mr. Lewis said, "You have not sent me on that silk"—he said, "No; that is just what I have come about; I have a couple of patterns here, salmon coloured and pink, sixteen yards, but I cannot let you have it at the same price as what you ordered"—this is it—it was shown round, and the general opinion was that it was too light and would fade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and Vestry Clerk of the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green—I have an office at the Vestry Hall—up to June, 1889, the prisoner was the collector for the whole of the East Ward; he was paid by commission, which would amount to something over £500 a year—in June, 1889, there was an alteration; his district was divided into two, and he had about half the work, and instead of commission he was paid by salary; he had then £180; it was a little while afterwards raised to £220—his son was elected to the other ward at a similar salary, which increased in the same way—these "Duties of and Rules as to. Collectors" were drawn up in 1889 and circulated among the collectors—the prisoner has told me he received one—a fresh rate is made at the beginning of each quarter—the collectors have to collect poor rate, general rate, and composition rate, and the sewers rate when levied, but that is only once or twice a year—there was no sewers rate for the last quarter of 1891—the composition rate is an ecclesiastical rate, and is paid to the churchwardens—it would be the prisoner's first duty to collect the rates in a lump sum—after the rate was made at the beginning of the quarter the prisoner would receive the rate-book for that quarter, with the names of ratepayers and the amounts of their assessments, and counterfoil receipt-books for that quarter, numbered consecutively, and this collector's cash-book—his duty was to enter daily the sums received, and pay them into the bank weekly—he would pay cheques received into his own banking account prior to the first or second of the days when he had to pay it over—it was his duty to attend the meetings of the Finance Committee, which were sometimes once a fortnight, sometimes once a month, bringing with him his cash-book and counterfoil receipt-book—I was almost always present at those meetings—during the last three months he has never brought his rate-book to those meetings—at the end of each</p>

               <p>quarter it was his duty to hand in balance-sheets; these are they for the quarter ending Michaelmas last; they show arrears of £261 11s. 10d. for poor rate, £233 1s. 3d. for general rate, and £24 0s. 5d. for sewers rate; in all, £518 13s. 6d.—at the meeting the amount of arrears was complained of, and this letter of October 14th was sent to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that it would be necessary that his cash-book should be completed and ready before the next Finance Committee meeting, and that he ought since the closing of his book to have paid in the arrears</hi>)—the rate for the last quarter of 1891 was allowed by the Magistrate on 17th October, and from that time the prisoner would begin to collect the amounts for that quarter up to Christmas—it was part of his duty to apply himself diligently to his collection—on 24th October, at the end of the week, the prisoner handed in to the vestry his <hi rend="italic">tab</hi> for that week, showing that he had paid in to the vestry's account, on account of the arrears of the previous quarter, £100 11s. 6d. for poor rate, £89 8s. for general rate, and £11 3s. 6d. for sewers rate—those sums were placed to the credit of the vestry—the prisoner's cash-book of the East Ward was made up and closed, and then he would start with a new page for the current quarter—on 9th December the collectors had to attend a meeting of the Finance Committee, and on 16th December, at a subsequent meeting, the prisoner's cash-book and counterfoil books were produced—we compared the counterfoils with the entries in the cash-book, and all the sums entered in the counterfoils appeared in the book as paid into the bank, and had found their way into the vestry's account—I noticed several blanks here and there, and I was directed by the committee to complain of the blanks and ask the reasons for their existence, and to require that in future a receipt, whether given or spoiled, should be produced—I saw the prisoner and asked his explanation, and he told me that the blanks represented spoiled receipts, and that no money had been received in respect of them—I also told him that in future the committee required that every spoiled receipt should be produced; that was on the following Saturday, I think—that quarter ended on 31st December—on or before the Wednesday morning before the first Thursday of a month beginning a new quarter, the collectors have to leave their balance-sheet for the quarter for the Finance Committee, and they have to pay on that morning, while the committee is sitting, the balance for poor rate, and bring the vestry's bank pass-book to the committee—that should have been done on 6th January—the prisoner was not present at the meeting on that day, and much surprise was expressed that he was not there—his balance-sheet up to end of the year was produced and examined; this is it; it shows a balance in the hands of the collector for poor rate of £773 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for general rate of £577 12s. 10d., and for the sewers rate for midsummer £12 16s. 11d.; that comes to £1,363 13s. 7d. as the balance in his hands, which should have been paid on 6th January—it was not paid, and I was requested by the committee to see him—I went to his office, and ultimately he was brought to me, and I asked him why he had not paid the money, and he shrugged his shoulders, as if something were wrong—I asked him if he had the money to pay, and he said he had not, he could not pay it; I think I asked why; he said it would be all right, or something of that kind, but I got nothing different from him beyond the fact that he could not pay—I reported the matter to the vestry, and the matter was discussed, and they ultimately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205230040"/>
               <p>resolved that a prosecution should be instituted—under the rules of the vestry a collector has to take out a policy of £1,000 as a guarantee; there was that policy with regard to the prisoner; it was deposited with the vestry, and on this deficit of £1,300 they claimed on the society, who paid £1,000—subsequent to that and after the prosecution had begun £344 was paid by the prisoner's solicitor into the vestry's bank, without any communication to me, on 21st April, I believe—that made up the total amount of what was due—there was a small sum owing to him, his quarter's stipend for the previous quarter—I find no such amount in the cashbook, prior to 31st October, as a cheque for £54 3s. from Kent, and no such amount upon counterfoils 143 to 148—I find Rooke and Son's cheque for £36 0s. 11d. on the counterfoil receipts 169 to 170; I find no entry of that amount in the book prior to 31st October—I find on counterfoil 102 "Wilson, £28 16s. 1d."—I find no entry of that sum in the book prior to 31st October—counterfoil 152 is a blank; there is no sum entered in the cash-book against that counterfoil No. 152—I find £90 10s. 5d. entered on counterfoil 674 as from Will—I find no entry of £90 10s. 5d. in the cash-book prior to 31st October—counterfoils 160, 161, and 162 are in the name of Colman, and together they come to £83 15s. 5d.—no entry appears in the cash-book of £83 15s. 5d., or of the sums making up that prior to 7th November—counterfoil 158 is in Field's name; 138 to 141, and 149 to 159 are in different names; none of the sums of money mentioned in those counterfoils, and together making up the £39 6s. 3d. paid by Messrs.

Burton and Sons in the cash-book—there is a sum of £1 2s. 3d. on counterfoil 10, and in the cash-book, but the balance £26 15s. is not entered anywhere prior to the 21st November—counterfoil 27 is for £7 0s. 9d.—the next entry in the cash-book after 21st November is £7 0s. 9d.; from the 21st to the 25th there are £3 6s. 8d., £2 4s. 6d., £4 18s. 9d., £4 3s. 10d., £5 11s. 1 1/2 d., and £9 5s. 2d.—£19 15s. 10d. appears to be paid into the poor, and £12 3s. 4d. into the general fund, as received between 21st and 25th November—from the 25th November there appears £7 7s., £12 19s. 3d., £7 8s. 2d., £1 17s. 1d., £1 17s. 1d., £5 11s. 1d., 14s. 10d.—there is no entry of Mr. Bowen's cheque for £26 16s. 6d. prior to 25th November—I find no entry between 25th and 28th November of £37 1s. 8d.—I found on counterfoil 776, £12 19s. 3d. entered; there is an entry in the cash-book between 25th and 28th November of £12 19s. 3d., but that is counterfoil 735, and that counterfoil is in the name of Lypman, not Malton, and shows only £2 6s. 1d. as received—that is the state of the book up to 16th December, entries 1 to 600—the book was given out afterwards to be continued; it was not given to the prisoner—long after 6th January it came back to the vestry entered up to 1,000, and then appeared some of the cheques which had been omitted before No. 600. there are entries of the £95 10s. 5d. and £90 10s. 5d.—they would have been entered after the book was delivered out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was elected some time after I was vestry clerk, but he has been collector these thirty years or more—his father was a collector for many years before and daring the prisoner's time—of late years the annual sum collected would be about £40,000; he was paid prior to 1889 by commission, which brought him in over £500 a year—after 1889 he was paid by salary, and his duties were reduced—the vestry thought they were paying too much—there was no personal reason for the reduction—the collectors paid the cheques received into their private banking accounts, and afterwards paid into the vestry's accounts, because a large amount of the payments were by cheques which had to be divided, part for the poor rates and part for other things; and the vestry's accounts for the different funds were at different banks—we have altered our system now, and only have one banking account—I cannot say without going through the cash-book if all the sums named in the indictment are now entered in the book; if they are they have been entered after the examination—I have very little doubt that the amounts named in the indictment are ticked off in the rate-book as having been paid to the prisoner; and the rate-book is the vestry's book, and they can send to a collector at any time and tell him to bring and show it—we should not have been able to see at once that he had charged himself with all the items in the indictment, because they are scattered all over the book, and you would have to go through the entries—I believe that at the end of the quarter, when he made up the rate-book, he entered it truly up to then—I have no reason to suppose that there are any omissions—it is for counsel to answer whether this charge is that he omitted to enter amounts at the proper time—I have not been in personal communication with the Guarantee Society, but I conducted the communications, and I received the £1,000—I understood there was something about the society wanting security before they paid; but I know nothing of the detail—in January and February the prisoner's willingness to pay the money to the vestry was talked of; it was suggested whether if he could get the money it would be accepted; that would be for the vestry, and it never came before them till long after this prosecution was started—they took the guarantee money, and the rest was paid into the bank without any communication with them; we have accepted the money—at a meeting of the vestry it was considered whether if the money was offered it should be received—thirty-eight were present; a letter was read from the defendant's solicitors: "We are pleased to inform you that £344, more than sufficient to cover the balance, was yesterday paid into the vestry's account," and it was accepted—there were only two dissentients—in addition there was a resolution, "That the vestry (if the Magistrate approves) do withdraw from the prosecution now pending against Mr. Snenton"—the Magistrate declined to interfere in the matter—from the time the prisoner wrote on 16th November, "I regret to say that my present state of health prevents my carrying out my duties without temporary assistance this quarter," his son was assisting him in his division as far as I know; he was away for a short time, but he was about doing his work—we had no suspicion of him till the balance-sheets were brought in about 6th January, and he could not pay the money; we had given him directions to proceed with more rapidity—we thought the amounts coming in were not quite the same as the average would be—when the balance-sheet came in he admitted he owed us £1,300 he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205230042"/>
               <p>ought to have paid in—no specific things were found out till the accounts were investigated by my sons and the clerks, and then it appeared to them that he was providing himself with funds to meet past deficiencies, and concealing accounts for that purpose—it might be six weeks or two months after the investigatian of the books that he said it was an error and that he would see we were paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After 16th November he was away for a few days, I believe—up to the last quarter the rate-books were always in the collectors' hands, and were never brought in until the Finance Committee day at the end of the quarter, when the balance-sheets were brought in—I have never known the rate-books produced for inspection at the Finance Committee meetings, and our collectors would know that—ratepayers in the parish would have a right to look at the book; and at the end of the quarter when it was made up it would show what sums had been paid and what sums were still due; and if sums entered in the rate-book as having been paid had not been paid into the vestry's account it would appear as a balance in the collector's hands, or as arrears.</p>

               <p>bother about that, not on my part—he never Raid to me that I had misrepresented the house, or threatened to prosecute me for false pretences—he did threaten me—I am still in the house I bought from Adams—I made no complaint about it till within eight or nine months after the transaction, when I mentioned it to him—I did not make any complaint against him with regard to the purchase of the house; I don't wish to make any complaint—I think I went to Hastings about eight or ten days after the fire; that was the first time I saw the ruined premises, and on that occasion I came to the conclusion that it was a wilful and malicious fire; there was no doubt in my mind about it—I did not go to the insurance office; they came to me about the insurance of the premises—I had moved all the goods but £10 worth—I had not made any claim; I never have made any—I did not tell the office that it was a malicious fire; I did subsequently—I had not been down then—I went to the office; I can't say who I saw, it was one of the officials; they gave me £10—I can't answer whether I believed Adams had some part in the fire; I formed no opinion whatever; I had no suspicion—I believed he had had a loss, that was why I gave him the £ 10—I am positive that what I have stated to-day as to telling Adams the fire was wilful is correct; I said it was a wilful case of fire against someone, but who I did not know—he replied he was very sorry; it was a bad job; he had lost what he had in his transaction with me and the £214; that is what it would imply, I imagine—I had not paid it up then, there was none due; I paid the deposit, and completed it after the fire, according to my agreement with Mr. Hubbard; he was the solicitor acting for Adams, and for me too, he should have been—I paid him £15 for his transaction in the transfer—I cannot say whether he acted unfairly or not—I was first spoken to about giving evidence in this matter by the Treasury about six months ago, as near as I can say—I said at Bow Street that I thought it necessary to give evidence so as to clear myself—I did not hear it rumoured in Hastings that I had had something to do with the fire—I never heard such a thing suggested; that was not why I said I wanted to clear myself.</p>

The interview with the two Beecrofts took place the day after the fire, before I went to Hastings—the conversation was not nearly all with Richard Beecroft; I asked him how the fire occurred—he said he did not know—he said, "I went to the Gaiety, and when I went to the house the officials would not let me in"—it was Joseph who suggested they should go to Mr. Hubbard's office; Adams did say so, but that was later on the same day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Since that day I have never seen Richard—what I said at the Police-court was, "What I wanted to clear myself about was the transfer of the business; I thought the fire occurring so soon after I left might lead to something against me"—it was to the Guardian Office that I gave the information that I thought the fire was an incendiary one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lodging-house keeper at Hastings; that is one of my businesses—the coffee-house, 31, Pelbam Street, belongs to me—in February, 1890, my tenant, Mr. Woodcock, introduced Joseph Adams to me as a person who was going to take the business—subsequently, in consequence of a letter from Adams, I agreed to accept Richard Beecroft as the tenant—Woodcock's lease was to be assigned to him—on the night of 18th March, 1890, about ten o'clock, I was called to the premises—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205230045"/>
               <p>was informed that they were on fire—I went there—I found. the front door fastened—with the assistance of other persons I forced it open and went in; I found the fire burning on the first floor landing; it was all ablaze—as soon as I got in I smelt paraffin—on the half-landing going upstairs I found a candlestick, with the candle burning, on the first step down—it was all one mass of flame—there was oil burning and floating on the stairs and all along the landing; it was flowing from a brewing can, which, I think, they brewed tea in—the tap was about half-turned, and paraffin oil was flowing from it; I saw that after the fire was put out—the can was standing on the floor on the landing—I also saw a big pan on the landing; there was something burning it—I afterwards went into the bedroom on the first floor, opening on to the landing; I there found a two-gallon stone jar lying on its side, with a little paraffin in it, and the carpet saturated—it was not burning then, it had been; something had put it out—I did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> into the room till the fire had been put out—the bed was burnt; the jar was near the bed—the fire in the bedroom must have been distinct from the fire on the landing; the one had not communicated with the other—there was nobody in the house when I went in—I saw nothing of Richard Beecroft then, or subsequently—I did not see Adams again until he came down with Woodcock, a week or two after the fire—they wanted me to purchase back the house—I ultimately agreed to take back the house, and to give Adams £80 for the fixtures that were left—I paid him down that £60—I don't remember saying anything in particular to Adams about the fire—I don't think he asked me any questions about it.</p>

I think I saw Adams twice in reference to this matter, once before Richard Beecroft was admitted as tenant, and once alter—he went into the premises on the day we arranged when he came down with Woodcock; that was after the fire—I think I never saw him on the premises after Beecroft came into occupation.</p>

Great injury was done to the house, the stairs were burnt down, everything had to be re-doner and a lot of the furniture was useless; still I thought it worth my while to get hold of the things and make a fresh start—I had to do the re-doing—it was insured—not only was Woodcock's furniture insured, but I had an insurance for the house—I was one of the first that went into the house—I went in with two policemen; the second door was half glass, and they smashed an opening and I went in—I rushed to the W. C., and opened the door and window, and then they were able to put out the fire with mats, and I went and got water in pails till the engine came—neither Richard Beecroft nor anyone belonging to the house came while I was there.</p>

I am a instable of the Hastings Borough Police—about five minutes to ten on the night of the 18th March, 1890,1 was called to the fire at 31, Pelham Street, Hastings—I followed Mr. Sabin in, and up the stairs—on the first landing I saw an earthenware candlestick, about three or four inches long, containing a candle about two inches long, which was burning—oil was running oil the landing, dripping down on the three steps towards where the candlestick was standing; the oil was alight, burning—further along the passage, in a corner, stood a tea urn with the tap partly turned on—it contained a small quantity of oil, which appeared to be paraffin—it had exhausted</p>

               <p>itself, but there was a little left—in the left-hand corner, on the same floor, stood a round earthenware pan; that was burning, but what it was I cannot say; it seemed like methylated spirits, I could not see any oil—in the bedroom, on the same floor on the right-hand side, was a large stone jar laid down on its side, about a foot from the bed; that was burning from the mouth when I went in—I extinguished that flame; I blew it out—the bed, which was close by, was saturated; it smelt like paraffin—the fire in the bedroom was quite a distinct and separate fire from the one on the landing; it could not be communicated from one to the other—after we came down, when the fire was put out, I found another stone jar, containing about two gallons of paraffin oil, under the stairs of the landing where the fire was burning, it had not reached there—I did not know Richard Beecroft at that time—I afterwards heard that he had been the occupier—our men were looking for him the whole of that night—search was made for him; he could not be found.</p>

I am now living at Greenwich—in 1890 I was employed as servant at 31, Pelham Street, Hastings, both before and after Mr. Woodcock left—I remember Richard Beecroft coining into possession on 1st March, 1890; he agreed to keep me there as servant—on Tuesday, 18th March, about half-past six in the evening, Richard Beecroft spoke to me—in consequence of what he said I went out for that evening at seven o'clock—I came home at ten, and found the place on fire—when I left I left Richard Beecroft only on the premises—he had the key of the door—he wished me to take it; I did not, because the door was a job to open—it was at his suggestion that I went out that evening; I had not asked to go out—I was to be back at half-past ten—he knew where I was going, home—I did not see him when I returned; I went to the Gaiety Theatre to look for him; he had told me he was going there—I did not find him there; I never saw him again—the brewing can, or tea can, was kept in a cupboard in the passage on the ground floor—I had seen it there that day; I moved it from the scullery into that cupboard—it was not used while I was there—I had been there about six or eight months, as far as I know; no paraffin was kept in it; there was none in it when I moved it—the large earthenware pan was in the same cupboard when I left the house; that was used for cooking purposes—we did not keep candles on the staircase; there were none there when I left—there was no stone jar in the bedroom with paraffin in it—paraffin was kept in the house, to burn in lamps; about two gallons was usually bought at a time; the last two gallons had come in on the Tuesday—there was some business done in the coffeehouse while Richard Beecroft was there; not very much—he had been</p>

Toplis and Harding—on 7th March a claim was sent to the office, under which damage to the contents was made for £703 2s. 4d.—that was a claim made by the valuer, F. C.

I mentioned the smell of paraffin at I once to Mr. Fiddiman, the surveyor—I did not form any conclusion as to whether it was an incendiary fire or not; it is not my place to form it, if I had—it would have been my duty to mention it to the Salvage Corps, and report it to my superiors—I should say this fire was caused very suddenly, from the way in which it travelled—I should say there was only one fire—I should say it was a very strong fire, from what I could see of it—there was nothing to create suspicion of anyone—I have known Adams since the Newington Butts fire—I have seen him several times since then—I have to keep a written report of fires—I was subpœnaed in this case at the time of the Bedfont case; that was about three years after the Newington fire—during that time I have seen Adams once or twice—I never had any suspicion that he had been engaged in anything of this kind.</p>

                  </hi>. In October and November, 1888, I was the landlord of 24, East Road, City Road, a coffee-house—in October Adams came about taking it from Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes for Fouraker—I told him if he got me a respectable and responsible tenant I would relieve Mrs. Rhodes of her tenancy; he assured me it would be the case, and gave me the address, 22, Blackfriars Road, as a reference for Fouraker—I was to be put into communication with Fouraker by addressing him there; I understood Adams was proprietor of 22, Blackfriars Road, a coffee-house; he said he had lived there some years; he told me Fouraker was a respectable hard-working man, who would suit the place—I afterwards went and looked at the outside of 22, Blackfriars Road, and was satisfied with its external appearance, and gave my solicitors, Billinghurst, Wood, and Pope, instructions to prepare an agreement, dated 30th November, under which I let 10, East Road, to Fouraker, at a rental of £75 a year—I signed the draft at my solicitors' office—I did not see Fouraker during the negotiations; afterwards I saw him at 10, East Road, he was pointed out to me as the new tenant; that was after the agreement was signed—I saw a fire on the premises a short time afterwards; I was only residing a few doors off—I went to the house next</p>

               <p>morning, and into the lobby, and heard of it—some time afterwards there was another fire, and next morning I saw the place was destroyed—I think I sent a notice to the Sun Fire Office on both occasions—on the second occasion I saw the building was in a very bad state, and I think I wrote to Messrs. Turnbull, and they said they would communicate as soon as a settlement was made—I had no communication with Fouraker after the fire; he still held the agreement, some considerable time; some time after the building had begun to be reinstated the agreement was cancelled, and a letter was received by Billinghurst and Wood from Hubbard, returning the agreement, cancelled, with a cheque for rent—I did not see Adams about the cancellation; it was done between Hubbard and Pope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the County Fire Insurance Company—in March, 1887, I received a proposal to insure the contents of Foxholme, Lower Norwood, for £500, for Joseph Adams,• these are the particulars—the insurance was upon furniture, musical instruments, greenhouse, garden implements, and rent—we issued a policy to Joseph Adams for that amount—on 23rd or 24th June, the day after the fire, we had notice of a fire at Foxholme, and a claim was afterwards sent for £404, which we permitted to be settled by payment of £266 11s. 6d., taking this receipt from Joseph Adams—beyond that sum a further sum was allowed for the greenhouse, the damage to which was not included.</p>

I am surveyor and assessor to the Liverpool, London, and Globe Insurance Company, in which Leech insured furniture and fittings at The Rocks, Bedfont, in June, 1891, for £550—this is the old policy; it was for £350, at High Street, Norwood, and there was a subsequent one increasing it to £550 in June, 1891—on 24th July, seven days after the fire, a claim was sent in by Leech in reference to the destruction of furniture in the premises, which totalled out at £790,1 think—the office did not entertain the clain, and eventually I offered arbitration, which was not accepted by the insurer, and while. it was under consideration the Treasury started the prosecution, and Leech and Cove were committed to this Court—after the claim had been made Adams came to my office in-support of it; he was accompanied by Leech and Mr. James Lewis—Adams said he had been a visitor at the house; he knew the furniture, and the claim was just and fair—whatever he said I took down in writing at the time—he said nothing about a fire he had had at his own private house—I only saw him on that one occasion—I was present at the investigation before the Magistrate and at this Court, and heard the evidence on both occasions—the defence to the case from the very first was that the destruction had been occasioned by a gas explosion occasioned by a gas-stove in the kitchen—that was</p>

               <p>conspiring to defraud the Liverpool, London, and Globe Office in connection with the Bedfont fire—I arrested Leech and Core; I tried to find Adams on 7th October, but I could never succeed in so doing—I went to his residence, which at that time was 142, Gipsy Hill, and 22, Blackfriars Road, but could not find him at either, and I never heard of him till I had the telegram from Truro—in the meantime Leech and Core were tried—after Beecroft's arrest on 1st April I saw him at Bow Street Police-station; he said he wished to tell me all he knew about the matter, and clear his mind—I said, "This is a serious charge against you, and I think it is my duty to caution you before you make a statement"—I cautioned him, and he then made this statement, which I took down in writing—every page is initialled by him, and signed finally at the end:—"lama coffee-house manager, at 228, East India Dock Road, where I keep the Ship coffee-house. About seven or eight years ago I was working for Messrs. Rowly and Brock, hatters, Cloth Fair, Middle Street, Aldersgate Street, £. 0. Henry Fouraker was also there then, and I was a customer at a coffee-house kept by Joseph Adams in Long Lane, Smithfield, and it was there I made the acquaintance of my wife. The business in Long Lane was sold to a Mr. Evans, and about the sametime Joseph Adams took a coffee-house at 22, Blackfriars Road. I frequently visited there, to see my present wife, and some time later, when had arranged to marry her (Miss Hannah Adams), Joseph Adams, her father, promised to put me into business, and a coffee-shop at Newington Butts, corner of Draper Street, was selected, as it was then his property. Adams asked me to go and stop at Newington Butts, and see how it wasworked. A man named Shirley was then managing the shop, and young Joe Adams had then left that shop and taken charge of another coffeehouse at 228, East India Dock Road, which I now keep. I had been there (at Newington Butts) about a week before a fire occurred. Herbert Reynolds was lodging there. There was a servant-girl named Ada lived on the premises (the cook lived out), and I myself lived on the premises. There was a fair business done there. On the Saturday night previous to the fire Herbert Reynolds and I were theonly two on the premises, Ada having gone home until Sunday night. She usually went home on Saturday night. On that Saturday evening I went to the shop at about six p. m, and had not been to the shop before on that day. Some time in the evening Herbert Reynolds was there; I remember Reynolds putting his under-linen to the fire. I did not request him to do so. I believe the gas was left burning in the kitchen; the fire was burning, it was a kitchener, closed in; one of the doors was locked, and I believe so was the other, but I am not quite sure; I went to bed first, and left Reynold downstairs, and he followed immediately after. We both slept in the same bed; it would be about 11.30 p.m. when we went to bed. In the early morning Reynolds woke me up, and I heard shouts of fire. We tried to make our way downstairs, and could not do so because of the smoke and flames. We then made for the roof of the house by way of a ladder which let through the roof; Reynolds was first out, and after I got out I fell through a skylight there. I got out again. We had no clothes on, but had our trousers in our hands; when I fell some money fell out of my trousers pockets, and I pioked some of it up. The fire escape arrived, and a fireman took Reynolds down on his back, and came<lb/>again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205230066"/>
               <p>and assisted me down. We went across to a shop opposite side of road, and got some clothing, and then went by cab to 22, Blackfriars Road. We knocked at the door, and several of the daughters and J. Adams, sen., looked out at the window, and the door was opened, I believe, by the kitchen porter. The old man Adams asked us how it occurred, and we said we did not know; he appeared upset. We slept there, and I went home to my father's in Lyston Road, Bermondsey. Two or three days later I went back to Newington Butts with Joseph Adams, and observed that a part of the under-linen was burned and scorched, and the lift was burned right away, and also the rod railing above the lift; nothing was then said as to the cause, and I have seen no one respecting the fire, only the police officer, who saw me on night of fire. A few weeks later I got married, and at request of Joseph Adams, sen., I took charge of the coffee-shop at 22, Blackfriars Road, and managed it for him, and did so for over three years. I then went to Bartholomew Close (a coffee-house), and took management of that coffee-house for J. Adams; it was in the son's name. I was there eight months, and he then sold it. I then went to 142, Gipsy Hill, Norwood, and stayed with Adams six or seven months, waiting for him to put me into business; this was last year, 1891. The arrest of Leech and Cove then took place, and he sent for me to go and see him at Brighton (no address—fishmarket). I went and could not find him and returned; walked back. My brother Richard went to Hastings and took charge of a coffeehouse there for Joseph Adams. Fouraker and my brother told me that during my brother's absence Fouraker was staying there and set fire to the shop. Fouraker stopped at Pearce's coffee-house, next door to Upton's; his name is in their books, and he came to London by last-train on night of fire. My brother came to London and told me of it, and I said the best thing to do was to clear out, and Adams paid his fare to Australia. Joseph Adams told me he bought the stuff, which was benzine, and took it there, 10, East Road, City Road, in a cab, and this was used in setting fire <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the coffee-house at 10, East Road, City Road; and he led me to understand that Fouraker had set fire to the shop. Adams called at 228, East India Dock Road, for a mat, which he put over the benzine cans to convey there. Abel Flack was then in charge of East India Dock Road coffee-house; this was second fire there (East Road). Adams also told me that Fouraker and he were to divide the amount of insurance money, which was obtained after Hubbard, the solicitor, was paid out. Fouraker also told me he set fire to the place, and also told Henry Cove so. The benzine was bought at an oil-shop other side of Canning Town Bridge, opposite fire-station, by Adams. I remember going to 134, Norwood Road, with young Joe Adams, on a Saturday in June, 1889. This was where old Joseph Adams was residing. We got there about one p.m.; Joseph Adams, sen. and jun., Mrs. Adams, sen., and myself were all there then. The old people went, I think, by a train, about four p.m., to Guildford, where he said he expected to meet Inspector Taylor (now stationed at Hunter Street). I took train, Tulse Hill to Elephant and Castle, and young Joe went away on his bicycle, and did not return that night to Blackfriars Road. On the following morning we went (Reynolds and I), as previously requested by old Joseph Adams, to 134, Norwood Road, to see if the place was all right; we found the fireman in charge. Fouraker</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189205230067"/>
               <p>has since told me, and I believe Reynolds also, that he had set that place on fire, and he also told the convict Henry Cove. He said the first attempt was a failure, as the door only was burst in pieces. Benzine was used in this case also, and bought at the same place as the other. The new suite of furniture was brought from Foxholme, 134, Norwood Road, to 22, Blackfriars Road, and the old suite that was there substituted; this was after settlement of insurance. Fouraker attended the sale, at request of Adams, to run things up in price. I remember a fire occurring at 28, Catherine Street, Strand. George Eccles was then in charge of the premises. I had been to that coffee-house several times, and the day previous to the fire I went there and fetched J. Adams, sen., away;, he was then drunk. We took him to 22, Blackfriars Road. Joseph Adams, sen., asked if I would set fire to that coffee-house, but I declined, and I afterwards heard he had paid Henry Cove to do it. I, at request I of Joseph Adams, sen., went with him to the oil-shop at Canning Town, where he purchased about three gallons benzine. There was an old lady in the shop, who I believe served him, and I accompanied him to I 28, Catherine Street, with the oil, and—he left it there. Henry Cove I took it in; that was on a Thursday before the fire occurred. I saw I Mr. George Eccles there at the time, and Cove took the oil upstairs. Adams had asked me to set fire to a coffee-house at Newington Green about the same time, but I declined, and Cove was also asked, but declined; he told me so. I remember a fire occurring at Bedfont, The Rocks, a house occupied by Convict Leech. I was invited and attended a party there soon after Leech took the house; Joseph Adams, sen. and jun., Henry Cove, Mr. Hiscock, and others were there, and we all went for a drive in a brake. I subsequently heard that Leech and Cove intended to stay behind and set The Rocks on fire. Shortly after this Leech asked me to go down to Bedfont; I did so, and stayed a night; he then wanted me to be a party to setting his house on fire, but I declined. Leech then had benzine there ready in a big jar to set the place on fire. He called me a coward, because I would have nothing to do with it. I heard of I the fire some days after, and was told that Leech and Cove had set it on fire. Leech and Cove both told me so. I believe the benzine was bought in Battersea by Henry Cove."—there is an oilshop at Canning Town opposite the Fire Station, kept by an old woman—there is a coffee-house called Pearce's, next door to Upton's, 6, St. George's Road, opposite the Elephant and Castle.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. Bush first told me that Beecroft wished to make a statement—I was at Bow Street then—I think he was Drought from the cells and taken into the room—I, Bush, and a plainclothes constable attached to Bow Street, whose name I forget for the moment, were present—the warrant against Beecroft was for conspiring to cheat and defraud divers companies—it does not mention the houses which it was alleged they had set fire to—I supplied the paper on which the statement was written; I had it in my bag, or I might have got it at Bow Street; I got it at Bow Street—he made the statement apparently of his own free will—I asked him no questions, and he asked no questions—as he made the statement I took it down—I went as far as telling him the addresses where the fires had taken place—I might have suggested to him the way the statement should be drawn up, the form it should take; about commencing at the furthest back fire, nothing beyond that</p>

               <p>—he did not say "I make this statement of my own free will, and without any promise or threat"; we usually put that down at the end; I believe I put it down and read it over <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him—I have seen Leech and Cove, the convicts, in connection with this case when they were in prison—I was with Leech for an hour and a half, I should think, and with Cove for a shorter time—there were writing utensils in the room, which I made use of—after I had seen them they came to the Police-court—this statement was not made by Beecroft in consequence of a promise that he might be called as a witness—I was with him an hour or more, perhaps, when he made the statement—I did not suggest, "Will you tell us all you know about it, and we may put you in the witness-box?"—I had taken the statement with the intention of putting him into the witness-box; I should have added, "I make this statement of my own free will"—he made it without any inducement whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. When I took Beecroft's statement I had held a warrant for Adams's arrest for some time, and had been seeking for him—I had a warrant in reference to this case, and another warrant for the original charge against Adams, Cove, and Leech; also for the fire at Bedfont—we are all desirous of promotion—I cannot say if the energy we show in arrests has anything to do with it—I wanted to do everything I could to arrest Adams and bring him to justice—I will swear I did not ask Beecroft to say all he could against Adams—I did not know where I could find Adams—I did not ask Beecroft where he was—Adams voluntarily surrendered himself; we never found out his address up to the time he did so, but we were very near it, I think—I did not name the fires to Beecroft, and tell him that we alleged that Adams had been connected with them all; I only mentioned the addresses to him; I did not tell him I wanted to know what Adams had to do with one or all of them—I swear he dictated the whole of this, with only that suggestion being put to him, and I wrote it—he put all these initials in my presence—I did not tell Adams that Beecroft had made a statement against him—I was present when the charge was made against Adams—Beecroft was then at Holloway, I believe—the prisoners were not all put together and this statement read—Adams has never been told what Beecroft said.</p>

When Fouraker was arrested he was carrying on business in the Hackney Road, where he and his wife have had dining-rooms for over a year—I went there and saw him two or three times before he was arrested—after Beecroft made his statement I arrested Fouraker—I believe Mr. Hubbard was only subpœnaed to produce documents—Sir John Bridge called for the subpoena, and afterwards insisted on Mr. Hubbard being sworn.</p>

Carbutt about two years—on the afternoon of 29th March I was set to work with other men to put the rice into sacks on a barge—whilst so engaged I heard Phillips snout "Look out!"—I turned my head to see what it was, and something struck me, and I know no more till the 4th April, when I found myself in the hospital—I remained there till the 15th of May, when I came out—I am still attending the hospital as an out-patient—I am still unable to work—I am married—the prisoner had not spoken to me in the afternoon when I went on to work.</p>

I live at 43, Queen Street, Bermondsey—I am a labourer in the employ of Carbutt and Co.—I was with Clark on the afternoon in question, putting the rice into bags—I was on the deck of the barge—I saw the prisoner on a sailing barge next to us, about twenty yards from me—I saw him throw half a brick; it went into the middle of the barge; it came through the air and hit dark on the head, and knocked him over, and he fell into the water—I was knocked on one Aide—I did not see what the prisoner did after he threw the brick—he had been in the employ for some ten weeks—Clark was picked out of the water and taken to Guy's Hospital—I saw Brookes pick up the brick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered practitioner and surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I received Clark when he was brought there on the 39th March—he was suffering from a severe wound of the scalp, exposing the bone—he was not insensible when brought in; he became so shortly afterwards—he was attended by myself and other surgeons—it became necessary to perform the operation of trephining the same evening—we had to remove a portion of bone from the skull; it is a very serious operation—he remained unconscious up to the 4th April—he continued an in-patient up to the 15th May—I was called several times at the Police-court to depose to the impossibility of his attendance as a witness—he is now an out-patient—I think he will recover—he is not fit for work now, and will not be able to resume his occupation for another month at least—his life was in danger for several days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman at Putney—on 2nd October, about a quarter to five p.m., I was standing on the rank in the Norreys Road, Putney—a van with a load of bricks, which Winslett was driving at between seven and eight miles an hour, came up the High Street into the Norreys Road, and ran into my cab—there was nothing to cause it; the rank was in the middle of the road—Constable Morgan, who stood opposite, saw him do it, and called for him to stop—Winslett started whipping the horse, and driving on faster—the constable got into my cab, and we went after them—we went three quarters of a mile before we caught them up; they kept crossing the road in front of us; one of them drove, while the other whipped the horse, and then they changed the reins—we got past them on the off side, and then Morgan got out on the near side of the cab—the prisoners drove from the near Hide to the off side, and as they drove across one of them said, "Let us squeeze him"—there was a third man with the prisoners in the cart; he sat still on the near side; the two prisoners drove in turns—Morgan clung on to my shaft to prevent them squeezing him, but his legs gave way and my wheel went over him, and the off hind and fore wheels of the prisoners' cart went over him, and they went galloping on—when he was hanging on to the shaft there was nothing to prevent them pulling up, and avoiding the damage; they had plenty of room—I called to a man to look after him; another constable stopped them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I started after them they began driving across me to stop me—I passed them on the off side; they were on the near side as I pulled up and the constable got out—they pulled across and tried to squeeze the policeman between the cab and their wheel—I was anxious to catch them—I was not excited—the words were not, "Let us squeeze out of this," but "squeeze him"—Winslett was driving when the constable was knocked down—he was sitting in the middle of the van, Hayler was on the off side next to me, and the other man on the near side—the van was loaded with bricks which were about one and a half feet higher than the van—the men were sitting in front of the van—the van was longer than my hansom cab—the prisoners immediately drove off—the men were sitting in front of the bricks; they could see over them if they wanted to.</p>

               <p>come into Norreys Road, in the middle of which there is a cab rank—they drove into the hansom cab without any reason; there was plenty of room for them to pass—Winslett was driving—I called to them to stop; they whipped the horse up and galloped away—I got into the cab and with the last witness followed them over Kew Bridge and along the Upper Richmond Road, for a quarter of a mile it might nave been—as far as I could see the prisoners changed reins, one driving at one time, and one at another, and one used the whip while the other drove; they kept driving across the road from one side to the other to prevent us coming up—ultimately the cab sot in front on the off side of them, and I was getting out, when one of the prisoners, I do not know which, said, "Let us squeeze him"—seeing them drive their horse against the cab I got my back against the share; they drove on and holloaed, and caused the cabman's horse to go on, which threw me down, and the cab went over me; and directly, after as I lay in the road, the van went over my foot; and I remembered nothing more till I was having my tunic undone—the van was close on to us when I fell down—there was plenty of room for them to have kept on the near side of the road; they drove deliberately for me—I was taken to St. George's Hospital, where I remained till the 23rd March this year—I am still in a convalescent home.</p>

On 29th April I was at the station when Butler and Gande were brought there—I asked them what authority they had to collect money—they handed me these two documents purporting to be signed by Ramsdale's authority to collect for the Local Fire Brigade for the week ending April, 1892—I asked where the station was; they said Elden Road, West Norwood—they were afterwards charged and searched—I found on Butler two collecting books, showing subscriptions amounting to £170, and four collecting books on Gande, showing £436 12s. in subscriptions, making £600—I found a form of receipt similar to this (<hi rend="italic">pro duced</hi>), and part of a report of the Local Fire Brigade—Butler gave his address, 12, Valentine Road, South Hackney, and Gande, 154, Gleenard Bond, Clapton, about ten or twelve miles off—I made inquiries at Norwood, and traced the fire-escape to the Park Tavern; the doors were locked outside and chained inside—the landlord Went round to the back, and took the chain away—when I got in I found two <hi rend="italic">very</hi> snappish doge—the escape has been correctly described—on 4th May I saw Ramsdale at the Police-court; he made a voluntary statement, which I took down—I took him in custody on 10th May, at 60. Glyn Road Clapton; and read the warrant to him—he said, "Why didn't you take old Raspberry?"—I said, "Who is old Raspberry?"—he said, "Why, a man named Samuels; he is superintendent of the Fire Brigade at Kentish Town; he has men collecting for him; he does not do any work; he keeps a woman, though he has got a wife and family; Gande has done very well out of this: he has been able to pay off the furniture, and stay out all night and semi oysters home to his old woman"—I found two collecting books on him amounting to £78 4s. 3d.—on the same day I arrested Mrs. Orchard on a warrant at 43, Mayall Road, Brixton, which is five or six miles off—she said, "If they do not send me to prison this time I will get rid of the escape; I should have done so when Ponsford was taken ill, but Ramsdale add the others came to me and said it was a good thing, and that they could work it all right"—she was too ill to go to the station—she made a voluntary statement, in which she said that she had given £16 for the fire-escape, and her profit in six years was £200, and she had to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> for the lot—a man named Noble said that he was connected with the brigade; he was a collector at Lambeth—he was taken before Mr.</p>

"Nobody saw me in Falmouth Road"—I took him to the Policestation, where he was placed with eleven others—the prosecutor and his daughter separately identified him without hesitation—I found in the prisoner's inside pocket this knife, which is much used at the edge—I have examined the window—in my opinion this would be just the kind of instrument to open it—I noticed that a patch was torn out of the seat of the prisoner's trousers—when charged with this attempted burglary he made no reply.!</p>

We went out at six o'clock in the morning, and when we got to the River Wandle, near to Merton Abbey Railway-station, Love took the knives and the screwdriver, and threw them into the Wandle. He said, 'We shan't b——want them again"—I made a search, and found these two knives in the Wandle, where Ewing told me they were thrown; the prosecutor has identified them—on Sunday afternoon, 1st May, at a quarter to three, I arrested Love—I said, "I shall take you into custody for being concerned in breaking and entering the Congregational Church, Morden Road, Merton, with Ewing"—he made no reply—I took him to Wimbledon Police-station, and placed him among five others, and Mrs. Ewing identified him as having stayed the night with her husband—I conveyed him to Mitcham—on the way he said, "There is where Ewing placed the fork and spade" (they have nothing to do with this case), "I know nothing about the knives; the screwdriver was left in Ewing's house"—when charged he made no reply—Ewing also said to me, "We went from Mitcham to Tooting Junction, where I left him; I then went back to Wimbledon; I had the sole-leather in my pocket; I got drunk, and laid over in the fields at Merton Park"—the shoe-leather has not been recovered—Ewing said, "I believe Love did it; I waited outside"</p>

                  </hi> (494 <hi rend="italic">V</hi>). About quarter to two a.m. on the 12th I was in Dent's Road, and saw the prisoner coming towards me, creeping very close to the garden rails and, hedge—I stepped back into a gateway, and waited till he was close to me, and then I stepped out and asked him, "What are you doing here this time of the morning?"—he said, "It is all right, sir; I am on the road"—I said, "What have you been doing down here?"—he said, "I have been doing a sleep about two hours in the front garden"—I said, "I don't believe your statement; what have you got in your pocket?"—I searched and found this knife in his inside pocket—I said, "What do you do with that?"—he said, "I eat my food with it"—I said, "I don't believe you; I shall take you to the station"—as I was saying that I heard a whistle blow twice from a house down the road—I said, "Come down with me and see what is the matter down here"—when I got to the prosecutor's house, which was about thirty yards from where I stopped the prisoner, the prosecutor had his head out of window, and he said, "Someone has broken into my house "; he said he had got in at the kitchen window—I told the prisoner I should take him to the station—these three boxes of matches and a piece of indiarubber were found on him—I saw marks on the window.</p>
