I am a plumber, of 17, Carthusian-street, Aldersgate-street—on 31st October, about 10 o'clock, I was passing through Newgate-street, and, as it was raining, I turned into Queen's Head-passage for shelter—I had a purse containing two half-crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went just into the passage and the female prisoner came up and requested me to stand treat to her, which I declined—I then went to the further end of the passage to get out of the way, and she came up again, and requested me to stand refreshment—I declined, and she stood talking two or three minutes and then ran away—she had been very close to me—I directly felt in my left-hand pocket, mis<lb/>sed my purse, and went over to a constable who was standing opposite—I went with him to Angel-street and saw the two prisoners together—I saw Edwards fling the purse into the road—a little boy picked it up—I took it from him and gave it to the policeman who took the prisoners into custody.</p>

On 31st October, a little before 10 o'clock, I was on duty in Newgate-street, on the opposite side to Queen's Head-passage, and saw Edwards walking backwards and forwards—while he was doing that Smith left Queen's Head-passage, Edwards joined her, and they crossed the road in a hurried manner close by me—I looked to see which way they went, and soon afterwards Mr. Benham came up and made a statement to me—I went with him down King Edward-street, and saw the prisoners at the corner of Angel-street—I got close to them and heard the <hi rend="italic">jinking</hi> of money—they were both close together—I ran and secured them both, and Edwards immediately threw this purse into the road—it was afterwards given to me—I had to get assistance to secure them—Smith was searched by a female searcher, and only a latch-key found on her—I searched Edwards and found two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, in his right-hand trousers pocket, and in his coat pocket two half-pence, a small memorandum book, and these keys—this pair of woollen cuffs dropped from him at the station house.</p>

From some information, I went in search of the prisoner on 2d December—I found him at 7 o'clock in the evening in Orange-street—I told him I was a detective officer and that he must come with me to Mr. Forster's—I told him that he knew very well what it was for, and he said, "For robbing of him"—he used the word "Mr. Forster"—he said, "I have robbed Mr. Forster, and the reason why I did it, was, I was mad drunk; I did not know what I was about;" I had the cheque and Post-office order—I asked him whether he sent them to his wife, and he said "Yes"—he said that if Mr. Forster would take him into his employ again, he would pay him so much a week back—I asked him what he had done with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the gold in the parcel—he said that he got drunk on the Monday evening, and was robbed of them; that they must have drugged him, and that the pass book and all were stolen from him—I took him to the station—I searched him and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, a tobacco box, three receipt stamps, and two knives—I got the cheque and Post-office order from the prisoner's wife—that was not in consequence of anything he said—I had them previous to taking him into custody—I had been watching the house.</p>

I know nothing about any van; I have not been in any van to day, and I have not been at work to day"—I took him to where the van was stopped by another officer, and told the elder Bird that I should also take him in custody for stealing wool from the van—he said that he knew nothing at all about it—I told him I must take him to the station-house, and took him there—Bird was on the box driving, at the time the van was stopped—he pulled up long enough for them to get down; about half a minute—the van was loaded three or four feet above the rails.</p>

I am a merchant of 18, Mark-lane—on Saturday-after-noon, 3d December, I was getting into an omnibus in Gracechurch-street—I had missed the twenty-minutes before 5, and had to wait for the 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—when the omnibus turned round another man, who undoubtedly belonged to him, prevented us from getting in—I stood where the conducter stands—the prisoner stood by me, and I felt a tug from his hand, and said, "You vagabond, you have got my watch"—he ran twenty or thirty yards, and fell down, or I should not have caught him—I laid hold of him—he wanted to get into Leadenhall-market, but there was an omnibus in the way—my watch was worth forty guineas—I have never recovered it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. William Mc Cullock, and another, 95, Bishopsgate-street, chemists—the prisoner was in their employ—on 29th November, the prisoner came to the chemical room where I was working—the other young man had left the room as did I, and on my return I saw the prisoner take a four ounce bottle of oil of cloves, and put it into a box in which he was in the habit of carrying empty bottles to the rack—he went out of the room with it, and I followed him down to the lower warehouse—he did not leave the bottle there, but he went up stairs, and I went and gave information—I was returning, and he was coming down from No. 3 Store-room with the box in his hand, and the bottle was not there.</p>

I am the wife of William Turner, 17, King's-head-court, Long-alley—on 23d November the deceased, Mary Ann Moore, took apartments in my house—she was alone—she came with her husband, the prisoner, the next night, Thursday, 24th November—I knew nothing of them before—they went on very quietly and comfortably indeed, for two or three days—the woman appeared to be at home and very comfortable—I did not see much of her, the time was so short—the prisoner was in and out—on Monday morning, 28th November, T got up at a little before 8 and had just lighted my fire when I heard a great screaming in the first floor front room, which they occupied—I went up, knocked at the door, and tried to open it, but could not—the noise still continued, and I beat violently at the door and said, "You villain, are you going to murder the poor woman?"—I said that several times but got no answer—the screaming continued, and I told them I could not put up with such a noise as that—it was the screaming of a woman—I heard a scuffling and knocking about of the fire-irons as if they were knocking them together—I told them I insisted on their leaving my house, and that day too, as I could not put up with such a noise, and I called to my children to fetch their father or a policeman, and from that time the noise ceased—I called loudly—I then went partly down stairs, and as I came up again I could see under the door where there is a space, and I saw that there was a chair placed against the door—at that time all the noise had ceased—I went up and spoke to him again, and said that I wished him to leave the house—I went down stairs again and all was quiet—I had my breakfast, and between 9 and 10 o'clock I heard the door closed—I did not go into the prisoner's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief usher at the Worship-street police-court—on the afternoon of 28th November, a charge was made against the prisoner of having murdered his wife—I went to the house at King's-head-court, and went up stairs to the first floor—the prisoner followed me, and the first thing I saw on opening the door was the body of a woman without a head, partially covered with clothing—the neck was lying close to the skirting-board—I placed my hand on the body, and found it quite warm—this was between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I pulled the remaining portion of the clothing partly down, and saw a gash right across the abdomen, about six inches in length—the body was lying quite flat on its back, and perfectly naked—I then observed that three parts of the room had been recently washed, and was quite wet—a little child about two years of age was there, with his head resting on a pillow—Haynes took it up—I removed the pillow, and then I saw the head of the woman lying in a basin, with about a pint of blood in it—the eyes were quite open—there were three large open wounds about an inch in length, on I think, the left side of the skull—the body evidently appeared to have been washed—it was smeary, as if it had been smeared with blood and water—the prisoner was standing by me all the time—he made no observation then, but I took him to the other end of the room, and on looking at his trousers, found marks of dry blood on one knee—I found it to be wet with water, and as if it had been rubbed—it was white—I then took off his coat, and examined his hands and shirt, but saw no blood—Haynes said to him, "Why, you have got a clean shirt on"—he said, "I have not; it is a dirty one"—it was a clean shirt—there was a pail containing blood and water and rags, or some particles of linen; also a basin and a pan—while I was looking at them, the prisoner said, "I hope they will not make it appear that I have done it"—he then said, addressing me, "I wish to speak to you, Sir, and tell you what I know"—I said, "You had better be very cautious what you say to me"—he said, "I wish to tell you"—I then asked him if I should write down what he said—he said, "Yes"—I then took out a bit of paper and a pencil that I had in my pocket, when he stated this—(<hi rend="italic">Reads:</hi> "About half-past 7 this morning, I left home, leaving my wife and child in the room, getting breakfast ready. I went out to look after business. Between 2 and 3 this afternoon, I returned home, and knocked at the street door twice; a little girl answered the door; I don't know her name. I came up stairs and looked about, saw things looking very strange. I pulled the clothes off and found a body lying on the floor, as it now is; I immediately went down stairs, and asked who was the landlord; the landlord came up stairs with me. I then showed him the body, and asked him who had been in my room during my absence; I asked him to get a police-constable; I then went with the landlord to the police-court. The body I know to be that of my wife, Mary Anne Moore. I know nothing more about it. On Wednesday last, I left Hoxton-house"—I asked him if he would sign that, and he signed it thus, "James Mo—," and then left off; whether the pencil would not mark any more, I do not know—the attention of the officer was then taken to him; I believe he would have signed it, but Haynes, the officer, at that moment picked up the fire irons, and that prevented him—Haynes and I took the prisoner to the station—I afterwards saw inspector Bricknell take some clothes from a pail.</p>

               <p>the scull; I think they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a blunt instrument, such as a pair of tongs or a poker—I then felt the body of the woman that was lying in the room; it was still warm—I can't say exactly how long the woman had been dead, but I should think about six or eight hours—the head was completely severed from the body—it was a clean cut with a sharp instrument—it was not done with one cut—there were no wounds at the side of the neck—there was a circle round; the integuments were cut all round first—I have no doubt that the body must have been quite still at the time, in order to have been cut as I found it—the blows given on the head must have stunned the woman, and I think the head must have been cut off almost immediately afterwards—I am led to that conclusion by the dilated state of the pupils of the eyes, and coagulation of the blood, and the sheets of the arteries having retracted—there was also a wound on the lower part of the abdomen, and the bowels were, partially protruding—the wound commenced in the left groin, and was carried across the abdomen to the right groin—I do not think that wound would cause immediate death—I think it was done after death; it might ultimately have caused death—I think that death was immediately caused by the severing the arteries—I have seen a razor that has been produced—the head might have been severed with such an instrument as that—there was a small portion of steel found imbedded in the muscles of the neck, and close to the bone—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is a small speculse of steel—there are several small notches in the razor—the bones were not violently severed—the incision was made right through the articulations of the bones—I have seen the trousers that the prisoner had on that morning—there was blood on them—I afterwards saw a poker, and a pair of tongs; one leg of the tongs was besmeared with blood—I was at the police-court on the following day, the 29th—the prisoner said something to me there; that was before the witnesses had been examined, before the case had been introduced to the court at all—he stated that he wished to have a private conversation with me—he hesitated to speak because the inspector was there—I said, "Oh, you may consider the inspector nobody, of course, as he must be here," and then he spoke, and in a very familiar manner he said "I suppose you are quite aware, Sir, of what is going on in my inside; I have had some substance there for a long time, and have been examined by several doctors"—I said, "Does it affect you much now? he said, "No, not just now, but it does sometimes affect my liver a good deal"—he could not think what it was; it was like a ball or a tumour full of wind—he said something else about steam, but I did not catch what it was—I examined him at the station with reference to the state of his mind; I led him as it were, into a conversation—I did not wish him to know that it was an examination; that was on the evening of the 28th—I did not come to any conclusion as to the state of his mind—he was perfectly rational—there was no difference whatever in his manner the next day, the 29th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have every reason to believe it is a regular plot to make use of me as they have done for the last two years; to throw me into a lunatic asylum again. I cannot see but that I am quite capable of work, and getting my living; but if people choose to follow me, and take my character away, what am I to do? I do not know what my wife has been doing for a living during the last two years, since I have been absent. I can't say who she has been with, or how she has been going on. All that I can state is that three weeks ago, I came out of Hoxton-house, and I was only five days altogether with my wife. I went out and came home again. I gave a correct account of my time, and all this row took place in the house, and everybody was fetched, and I bear all the blame; and I can't give a full and correct account of myself without I am brought in an insane man; whether it is to put me back again to that place, I can't say; or whether my wife has any grievance, or was keeping company with any one. I can't say. We never had any quarrel; we may have had a word, now and then, but nothing to speak of. When I was away, six years ago, my wife was ill used, and torn about, and when I came home she denied having been in any row, until I was told by my neighbours that two women had been and torn and scratched her all about the body, but she was frightened to tell me what had transpired during my absence. I don't see why I was taken to that asylum to be treated as a prisoner and a slave. I should like to know in what I am deficient that I am not in my right mind. I wanted work, that was not given to me, and I complained of my diet; what they gave me did not agree with me, and it was not likely that I should take it. I went on bread and water from two to three months, all to get justice. Why should I have an instrument passed into my inside, to be made a plaything of?</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you not in a little error about the time the unloading was completed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not; the finish of the discharge was between four and live—the reloading sometimes commences before the cargo is out—I do not think the vessel had to leave next day—I do not think she had any regularly appointed time—Edmunds was on the deck when he was on duty—he was on duty at this time—it was his duty to be by the fore hold and the main hold to see the cargo—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is, as far as it goes, a pretty correct plan of the ship's deck, but there are a great many things left out—it is a correct representation of the main hold and the fore hold and the windlass, but here is a distance marked of three feet one and a half inches from the crane to the hatchway—I think that is not correct—I have measured some parts of the deck, and from the break-handle to the combings of the hatchway; it is not three feet one and a half inches as described here—I make it two feet one; and if you put the man's elbow and arms when pressing on it, you will find there will be hardly any space at all—I did not measure the distance from the side of the vessel to the combings—the steam crane occupies a very large space—I should say it is five feet in circumference—I cannot say the length of the vessel from stem to stern—with the exception of the place where the steam crane is there is nothing between the combings and the side of the vessel at that</p>

               <p>particular place—there is a passage on the other side of the vessel, from the companion to the aft—there were a great many people about on this evening taking in rice—there is a hand crane on this side of the deck, a permanent structure—it is opposite the steam crane—with the exception of the steam crane on one side, and the hand crane on the other, there is, I believe, no permanent structure on the deck—there was a gangway from one end to the other—I have not measured the height of the combings, but it does not exceed four and half inches—I will swear it does not exceed eight inches—I will not swear whether or not there were ring-bolts along the deck by the side of the combings—I believe the vessel arrived on Sunday, and this was Thursday—there were lighters at the side of the vessel with cargo for the ship; I cannot say the number.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long does it take to put on and remove the hatches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not half a minute putting on and off—the steam crane is on the larboard side—I made a drawing at the time, but not a very perfect one—there is not room, when the steam crane is at work, for a person to pass along the ordinary gangway between the hatchway and the bulwarks, without great inconvenience—it is a traversing crane; it swings out and in with the cargo.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a custom-house officer—I was on board this Teasel on 24th November—the captain went on shore about half-past-three or four o'clock and came back at very nearly seven—I can swear there was nothing in the fore hold after four o'clock; I looked in—they began to load cargo in at half-past 2 the following morning, and I took an account of the goods that were put in—I recollect the deceased going to the water closet forwards, about six o'clock—he spoke to me as he went—the steam crane was not in motion then though the steam was up—they were just going to commence loading some goods—we commenced working almost immediately he passed me—I afterwards saw him in the hold and assisted in getting him out—I did not see him fall—after he had been removed in a boat to the hospital I called to the prisoner and said "Will you have those hatches put on?" he said "No I will not"—I said "Why?" he said "Because we are going to work there"—I said "When you begin you will have sufficient time to do that"—I have no control over them, but I said that for the sake of humanity—when he said "No, "I said "Will you put a light there?"—he did not put a light for an hour afterwards, when there was a dim light hung in the foremast.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>that I could not even see the steam-crane—he could not take the port side, because the steam-crane was at work—he came the other side to avoid it—there was not ample room for three or four men to walk abreast between the hand-crane and the combings; not for one—whether there was room to go between the combing and the crane would depend upon which way the crane was swung—I cannot say whether there is room for two or three men abreast when the crane is not at work—during the progress of loading and unloading I have never seen the hatches stowed away—to get them away they are laid on the deck close to the hatchway—I do not know whether they would be in the way of people who are walking up and down—I never saw any hatches moved to another part of the deck—there is no rule not to go across the hatches when they are on; I never heard of it—it was so dark this night that you could not see whether the hatches were on or not—I have walked across the hatches ordinarily—the deceased could not have gone any other way—the cargo was not loaded until half-past 2 next morning, I do not know whether it was on board the lighters next to the vessel at the time the accident occurred—it was not my duty to go and see what lightens were alongside—Mr. Wilkins is the tide surveyor, having the supervision of myself and my brother officers—he did not say that he would go and inspect the hold, and request that no cargo should be put in until he had inspected it—I heard nothing of the kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the Customs—I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> on 24th November—they began to load the fore hatch about half-past 2 the following morning—they had left off discharging the fore hold somewhere about from 4 to half-past 4—I did not see the deceased go forward to the water closet—I was not on board at the time—when they are not loading or unloading from the hold, it is usual to put the hatches on; or if not, to place lights on to keep from danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a lighterman—I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> when they found out this accident—I assisted in lifting the deceased up from the hold—I had 500 bags of rice there to load into the vessel—they began to load the fore main hold about half-past 6—I don't think there was anything put down in the fore hold at the time I was there—it is usual to keep the hatches on when they are not loading into the hold, or to put a light on—I was very nearly falling down this same hold—the only light I saw was under the larboard deck, and that was about as much as a three-farthing rushlight—it was not sufficient to show whether the hatches were on or off—when I came back from the hospital after taking the deceased there, I asked the prisoner why he did not put the hatches on then—he made no reply—he did not put them on.</p>

               <p>and evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had been under the bows—I had got my cargo alongside—it was to have been loaded that very evening—I am not aware that that was not done in consequence of Mr. Wilkins, the superior, officer stating that he would come on board—I saw Mr. Wilkins there about two hours after the accident—there were only two other lighters at the same side of of the vessel that I was, but on the other side' there were 15 or 16, con<lb/>taining different goods for the vessel—it was after the accident to the deceased that I was nearly falling down the hold—it was a greasy night; the decks were very slippery—it is a rule among persons on the decks of vessels not to cross the hatches if they know that they are off, but it is optional on your own part whether you think proper to do so or not—a man might take that route, instead of going round the combings, to make a short cut of it—I know the vessel; I have occasionally gone on board her—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>) I think this is right—I think one crane works into the fore main hold, and another crane works into the bows—I don't think there is sufficient room for a man to pass with safety between the combings and the crane.</p>

I am a custom-house officer—I was on board a ship loading near the. <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> that night—I heard one of the witnesses crying out for a sculler and went on board—there was no light at that time that would throw a light on the fore hold—there was a very faint light under the bridge—there are block-houses amidships—a person could not see by that light whether the hatches were on or off—I have had 18 months experience of the loading and unloading of cargo—it is usual, if you are not going to work, to keep the hatches on—I can't say when I went on board whether these hatches were on or not.</p>

I am clerk to the Commissioners of Land and Assessed Property, and Income Taxes for the Tower division—the defendant was appointed assessor by a precept delivered to him, and he acted as assessor of that division—in the ordinary course forms are sent to persons in trade to make a return of their profits—these forms ought to be returned to the assessor for the district—I have the original assessment of this district from April, 1858, it is signed by the commissioners—on this original assessment being signed, a duplicate is made out—this original assessment is signed by two general and two additional commissioners—I know the hand-writing—a duplicate of it was made out; I produce it—this was delivered to Jay, and I received this document from him—this is the appointment and warrant, and would be his authority to collect the different amounts charged against those persons—it is signed by two of the commissioners for general purposes—on the defendant receiving this it would be his duty to collect the sums mentioned in this assessment—(<hi rend="italic">The warrant was here ready</hi>)—on the defendant receiving this it would be his duty to send a notice to the persons of the amount at which they are assessed, and to call at the houses, collect the money, sign a receipt, and give it to the person paying the taxes—I got this duplicate from the defendant—I called at his house in Pearson-street, Kingsland-road—I saw him and told him I had come by direction of my Board to take away the duplicate, and that he was suspended—he gave me the duplicate, and schedules A and B for the land and assessed taxes for the year 1858 and 1859, and stated that he had destroyed the others; and he said it was a bad job—I told him he was suspended on account of some irregularity in his accounts, and having received money that was not in the assessment—he was ill, and he directed his wife to go into another room and fetch them—he said it was a bad job and that it was through Mr. Levine—Mr. Levine was the crown surveyor of the district—I don't know what has become of him: as far as I know he has absconded—the duplicates which the prisoner said he had destroyed ought not to have been destroyed certainly—they ought to have been brought into the commissioners' office—commissioners are appointed who are called commissioners for general purposes; and they appoint assistant commissioners—the assessment is made and signed by the assistant commissioners and the general commisoners, and then it comes into the hands of the persons who collect—in this duplicate here is the name of Mr. Rose, of Holy well-street, grocer—the amount due from him under schedule D, is 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from April 1858 to April 1859—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185912120033"/>
               <p>the defendant would not have to collect a larger sum than this mentioned—here is no assessment of Mr. Stevenson—there is no duty payable by him—this duty payable by Mr. Rose is on 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—there is the name of James Hill, of Holy well-street, tobacconist; due from him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is on 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is the name of White Brothers, of Holy well-street, tobacconists, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that would be the duty on 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the instruction is to collect these sums half-yearly—Mr. Rose's would be collected in two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that the defendant has been twenty years collector of the land and assessed taxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and of the income tax since 1842—with regard to the land and assessed taxes, I know of no complaint against him—Mr. Levine was the person appointed by the Board of Inland Revenue as surveyor of the districts; he had authority to overlook and supervise the collectors in reference to these taxes, including, of course, the income tax—the course of making an assessment is that parties liable to be assessed are to be returned, and for that purpose papers are sent out—I believe Mr. Levine to be out of the way—I don't know whether there are any proceedings depending against him, I have no means of knowing—Mr. Bunn was a collector of the adjoining district of the parish—he was suspended at the same time that the defendant was—I don't know whether there are any proceedings against him—Mr. Garnett, the Inspector General, is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing any alteration takes place as regards the duties of the collector, besides this duplicate, does he receive instructions to collect from Mr. Levine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; as far as my knowledge goes, he ought not—Mr. Levine was in the habit of attending at our office before the com<lb/>missioners constantly—it was part of his duty—he had not the power of suspending a collector; certainly not—the practice was for the assessor to deliver a schedule wherein the person makes his return, and the assessor ought to bring it into the commissioner's office, but it is the surveyor's duty to see that it is returned—when all the returns are got in, they are in my custody, but they are never all returned—if he does make returns they are finally in my care—these duplicates are made in my office and sent out to the collectors—I may deliver one if the collector calls, but as a general rule I do not deliver them—additional duplicates are issued in cases where the parties liable to be assessed have been omitted altogether—I have not known instances where the amount ordered to be collected has been less than the amount that ought to have been—I am not down in this duplicate as liable to pay—I am not in that district.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many collectors were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From recollection, I should say ten or a dozen—the only one in Holywell was the defendant—Dunn was in the adjoining district.</p>

Police!" and as I opened my door, I saw Patrick Lanagan, the deceased, and Collins, just passing—when I got to my gate they had passed me about ten yards—I stood at my gate; I did not move—when they were about twelve yards off they had apparently got hold of each other—I cannot say whether Collins had hold of the deceased or the deceased hold of Collins; they were both together—Collins suddenly snatched himself away from Lanagan—Lanagan turned round directly, saying, "You are not a going? you are not a going?" I could not tell whether the man had got hold of him, but all in a moment the deceased fell—I could not see whether he was struck—it was a very dark night—there was a struggle, and he fell—I did not move from my gate—the prisoner came past and spoke something; I did not understand what he said, but I knew his voice—he then went away.</p>

               <p>more on the left side, with discolouration—there was no mark of violence on the head—I could detect nothing externally—afterwards, upon examina<lb/>tion, I discovered a large clot of blood between the muscles, and upon washing that away I discovered a fracture of the skull, more on the left side, with rupture of the arteries, which ramify internally—the cause of death was compression of the brain—that resulted from the fracture, which was the primary cause of death—such an injury might have been caused by some direct violence—it could not have resulted from a blow from the fist—the blow knocking the man down on the kerb stone, might account for the fracture—I am of opinion that the fracture arose from an external blow—he would become insensible immediately from such a blow—the extravasation of blood would so have crippled the brain that he would not have power over it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

He was very dangerously ill at 20, Bull's-gardens. A little after 10 I had occasion to go to the water-closet which is in the front garden; after I came out I heard a moaning noise and I went outside the gate. When I got out I saw a woman lying on the ground, with her face on the ground, very drunk; I lifted her up and asked her where she lived; she told me Caroline-place. I led her a few steps, and let her go; I stood; she went about twenty yards, staggering along, and fell down again; I lifted her up and led her five or six yards; she said she was all right. She went along; I stood and watched her till she got to the corner of Caroline-place, Bulls-gardens; she fell down then in the middle of the road; I picked her up again, and was carrying her to the footway to inquire of the neighbours; with that this man (<hi rend="italic">the deceased</hi>) came up and struck me on the side of the head. He had not spoken to me nor I to him, and I had never seen him before. He asked me what I was doing with that woman. He was about to strike me again, when I put up my hand to save myself; he still kept hold of my arm, and shouting out, "Police! police!" I wished him to leave go of me; I told him to leave go. He would not, and I gave my arm a wrench round to get away from him, and down he fell, and I went away back to my father's house. I stopped with my father all night, and I delivered myself up on the Tuesday."</p>

I live with my aunt, Charlotte Rowler, who keeps an eating-house at 4, Belvidere-road, Lambeth—on Thursday, 1st December, about twenty minutes or half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop and asked for a pennyworth of pudding—I served him—while I was serving him another man came into the shop, spoke to the prisoner, and said, "Halloa, mate, where have you been to?"—the prisoner said, "I don't know, about; I am now going home to bed"—I served the prisoner with the pudding—he gave me a shilling in payment—I gave him a sixpence, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in change, and he left the shop—I laid the shilling that I had received, on the counter—when the prisoner went out the other man remained in—he asked for some pudding also—I served him—he gave me a shilling in payment—I saw that it was a bad one—I bent it in the de<lb/>tector, and gave it back to him—he gave me a penny in payment for his pudding, and then left the shop—before the second man left the shop I took the shilling that the prisoner had given to me, off the counter, and on examining it I found that it was bad—the second man when he left, went in an opposite direction to that which the prisoner had taken—I came outside the shop, and looked after the prisoner—when I got to the shop door, I could see nothing of him—shortly afterwards I heard a whistling in the street—I then saw the prisoner—he was coming towards me so as to go the way that the other man had gone—the other man was in sight then—when I saw the prisoner going after him, I went up to the prisoner and laid hold of him—I said, "You have given me a bad shilling"—he said he had not; that he had never seen me before—I said, "You have, and not five minutes since"—he said that he was going after his mate—I said, "Yes, I know you and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185912120041"/>
               <p>your mate also gave me a bad shilling"—I said, "If you do not come in and give me a good shilling for the bad one I shall give you in charge"—he came in and gave me a good shilling—the other man was then a very little distance off; I cannot say how far—the prisoner said that rather than have any bother he would give me a good shilling, but that he had never been there before—I gave him back the bad shilling that I had received from him—when I did that he put his left hand close to his side, and from it dropped a paper—when he dropped it, he moved his head about as if looking for something—when he left I picked up the paper and examined it, and found that it contained four bad shillings—I crossed the road and gave the paper and the four shillings to a police-constable—I gave information to the constable, who shortly afterwards brought the prisoner back in custody—the prisoner said he was innocent, and had never been in the shop until I fetched him in—he asked me to let him go—I declined to do so, and the policeman took him to the station.</p>

I am a carman at Cornwall-road, Lambeth—on 1st December I was in a parlour behind Miss Kidder's shop, with the door open—I saw the prisoner served with some pudding; the other man came in before the prisoner was served—I saw Miss Kidder bring the prisoner back into the shop—he said, "I have not been in the shop at all, you must have been mistaken, but rather than I would be detained from where I was going I will give you a shilling out of my pocket, than have an accusation against me," or something to that effect—he gave her a good shilling, and took the bad one—I was close to Miss Kidder when she picked up a small parcel containing four shillings—the prisoner had then scarcely got out at the door—it was close by where he had been standing—he was brought in directly afterwards by a constable—I looked at the money and said, "What have you done with the other shilling"—he said, "I have thrown it away."</p>

               <p>shop at Coburg-place, Rotherhithe—on Tuesday, 29th November, the prisoner came to my shop between 8 and 9, and asked for a strip of fancy work—I served her, and she gave me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; I examined it and saw that it was bad—I gave it to a little girl that was in my house at the time, and sent her to her father to see if it was bad—she brought it back bent—a police-man was passing, and I gave the prisoner in custody—the little girl gave me back the florin, and I gave it to the constable—before the prisoner came into my shop this night, a man came in—I did not serve him with anything—he left the shop and joined the prisoner outside, and then I saw her come into the shop—when the man joined her outside they passed my door, went a little way along, and then came back, and then I served her as I have stated—the little girl is here.</p>
