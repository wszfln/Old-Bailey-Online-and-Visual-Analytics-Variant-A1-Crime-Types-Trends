He laid hold of my husband's feet when he lay in the kennel and said get the stick from the b - r; I saw Driscoll put his hand into my husband's pocket; I did not see him take any money out; my husband cried out thieves, he had been robbed; I got up when Conner's wife let go the hair of my head; she let go when a woman came up on my behalf; I went into my own door and my husband came into me; when he got up out of the kennel, Driscoll and Conner walked away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people where there about the door when this happened - A. There might be ten or twenty, they were chiefly women; that is all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your husband stay in the house before he went to go on the watch - A. He went and lost his duty; he came back and said there was a man in his place; I think it was about twelve o'clock when he came home, he then went to bed; the next morning he went to Lambeth-street office and laid an information against the man that had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay an information against one man or two - A. He laid an information against two, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your husband had any money in his pocket - A. Yes, he had a one pound note, a half crown, and half a guinea, to the best of my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mrs. Conner very well, did not you - A. She has lived nigh us very near a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been good neighbours together - A. We quarrelled once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of Conner wanting your husbands stick and abusing him, do you know - A. My husband and I had a few words when he was going on duty that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a few words, was that at the door - A. No, in my own house, and when my husband was going out of the door Conner was whistling and singing; I said

             you should not try to make words between man and wife; I told him if he could not make peace he should not try to irritate; he called me what is not proper to express; I said nothing; my husband came out, he said good night Ann, and he got hold of my husband's stick.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Conner came to your door whistling and singing you thought he was interfering between man and wife - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Driscoll - A. He was standing at his own door, he did not come up with Conner at that moment, but he did soon after; Conner told my husband that I had been doing clandestinely; I said nothing; after my husband got up out of the kennel, he said he was sorry that he had not killed him, and after my husband came home and said he could not get upon the watch Conner came up and put his fist in my husband's face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You told my lord that there were a number of women, there were some men were there not - A. No, none except what were belonging to the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you leave your own door and tell your neighbours that your husband had been robbed - A. The inhabitants are very poor people, and they were all in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was robbed about ten then he went to his watch - you knew he had been robbed why did not you call some of your neighbours or the watchman - A. There was no watchman then; when my husband got up the next morning, he went to Lambeth-street office in our parish; and Conner, when he got up, he went to Shadwell office and took my husbands stick there. As I was going along with my husband an officer met me; he told me he had a warrant against me, he took me in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. You were taken up I suppose upon the charge of Conner - A. Yes, and Conner and Driscoll were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any charge against Mrs. Conner - A. Yes, for pulling me by the hair.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took charge of the property you found there - A. Mr. Skinner; I know nothing of the articles; I was not at home at the time; the prisoner was taken to Tothill-fields prison.</p>

            . Q. Were you one of those that were at the apprehending of the prisoner - A. Yes, I keep a broker's shop in the same house where the prosecutrix lived; the prisoner on the day mentioned came into the yard to me and asked me if I was the person belonging to the mangle; I told her no, the person belonging to the mangle was in the kitchen; she went down into the kitchen; I know that person was the prisoner perfectly well, I never saw her before. They came up together; Mrs. Lovegrove asked me if I would give an eye to the kitchen; while they went for a basket of linen; the prisoner came back again in about five minutes, after leaving Mrs. Lovegrove; she told me that they had forgot half their errand, they had not took with them the mangling things; she said Mrs. Lovegrove told her she was to go down stairs and I was to give her the things, but I did not give them her; she went down stairs and took them before I could get into the kitchen; she told me that she must make haste and overtake her or else she should not be able to give her the rest of the mangling things.</p>
               <p>Q. What other mangling things - A. There were none, that was only her false pretence. Mrs. Lovegrove came back and told me there were no mangling things at No. 30; I saw no more of the prisoner; I told Mrs. Lovegrove that I had given her the things. We found the prisoner eight days after at Tothill fields</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of May, I apprehended the prisoner very near Tothill-fields-bridewell; I was informed her apartment was in Orange-court, Drury-lane; I went and searched it, and found some articles that Mrs. Lovegrove identified. I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found her in the room on the 13th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, she was dressing herself; I had a suspicion of the woman that lodged with her, and they put her down in the dust hole.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day that person lost the things her husband came down to where I lodge in Orange-court, Drury-lane; I was sitting at the window at work, he then enquired for a woman with a cast in her eye, of the name of Goodwin; in the evening I was in a public house in Drury-lane, he saw me there and took no notice of me. On the Sunday morning the woman that I lodged with said there is somebody lifting the latch of the door; I said it is the same man that came before. On the Monday I went to Constitution-hill, I saw him, he took no notice of me. On the Sunday week following I went with the woman I lodged with to see a man in Tothill-fields-prison for quarrelling; these two women stopped me and said I was the woman that took the bundle and ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know a field near Holland Park that was in possession of Mr. Lomas - A. Yes. On the evening of the 19th of this month I was on duty, it is a regular rule to fire a piece off at eleven o'clock; I got there a few minutes before the time; when I got out of Holland house, I heard something crushing like wood a breaking; I fired the piece off at eleven o'clock as usual; I went nearer and nearer to where I heard the noise, to the gate that leads out of Mr. Lomas's field; I was on the other side, I heard a person or persons talking to a horse or mare; there was an hedge and a gate to it that leads to Mr. Lomas's field, I found that gate unlocked; I went on forward, where I knew there was another gate, that gate I locked on the 19th of this month, there I found the lock as I put it on; there was another gate that leads into the Hammersmith or Bath road, that gate I saw shut, I live just at the point of it. I went into my own yard, I had not been there a few minutes before I heard the chain of this gate unloosed; I heard a horse coming along, I did not see it; I shut my own gate and rather hid myself behind the paling, I expected the horse would be brought through the gate by my house; instead of that it turned off to Kensington, I expected that gate to be locked; I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260007"/>the gate shut after the horse went through; then I went after it as quick as possibly I could do, and when I met the gentleman with the horse it had an halter and a bridle on, and a coat and bag strapped on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. At last you found the person with the horse - A. Yes, about twenty or thirty yards off the gate that leads into the Hammersmith road.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a lane that led from the place where you found the gate open - A. Yes; I went up to him, I asked him where he was going that way, he said he had lost his way, he wanted to go to Uxbridge; he made a stop, I asked him whose horse he had got there, he said it was his own; I told him I thought it was Mr. Lomas's, therefore I could not let him go until I knew whether it was Mr. Lomas's or not. The gentleman said he was very agreeable to go with me to Mr. Lomas, and he led the horse or mare down the road very quietly. I hollaoed out to the watchman, I could not make him hear; I hollaoed out again as hard as I could, two men came to me; I told them what I thought. One of the men took the mare out of the gentleman's hands, and I took hold of the gentleman by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was took hold of the mare - A. No; two men came up, I could not see which of them it was, the person led the mare; I had hold of the man and followed; the man and the mare were taken to Mr. Lomas. I had the mare in sight all the time before we came to Mr. Lomas's; in Kensington-street we met the watchman, I told him, he went with us to Mr. Lomas's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday June the 19th, 1809, I was coming from Kensington road to Uxbridge road, in the way to Camden Town about ten o'clock; in the common path for travellers, and at the time people were passing and repassing, I met with a horse with an haltar on his head, and the other end entangled about his legs; I foolishly took the halter from under his feet, and led him towards the houses at Kensington, some man behind me told me to stop, I did, and gave him the horse without a word. It was in a common road, and many people were passing at the time; I had no thought of stealing the horse. I am a native of Plymouth; the time I have been here is so short, I have no friends in this part of the county.</p>

On the 26th of May, between one and three o'clock, I saw the prisoners together in the shop, I was at the distance of between eight and ten yards; I did not hear what they asked for, they left the shop; a man came up to the door, and said we had been robbed. I pursued them; they crossed Bishopgate-street, and were a little way up Union-street before I got up to them; my shop is opposite of Union-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company - A. They did; one was stopped when I went up, and the other was coming up to her; I pulled Cooper's cloak of one side in Union-street, and saw the muslin under her arm; she dropped it, I picked it up, and desired her to walk in with me, she did; and the other was brought after her by Baldero. I sent for an officer; we examined them, nothing else belonging to me was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon examining that piece of muslin, did you know it to be yours - A. I did, it had my shop mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You served them with nothing that day, did you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them how they came by it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pretend that they had bought it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you serving in the shop that day - A. Mr. Baldero and two others; I could not be certain that my boy was in the shop, the other young man was I know.</p>
               <p>Q. And Baldero is the only person of the three who is here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prime cost of that muslin - A. Half a crown a yard; there is fourteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>- BALDERO. Q. Are you a servant of Mr. Styles - A. Yes. On the 26th of May, I was serving in the shop, I saw the two prisoners come in as if they came in together; they immediately followed each other, they took no notice, nor did they speak to each other during the time they were in the shop.

               <p>Q. Were there any pieces of muslin on the counter near where Cooper stood - A. There were several, and this amongst the rest; I saw it about a quarter of an hour before; in a few minutes after they left the shop from information I followed them, and when I first got sight of them they were near Union-street; they both took up Union-street; I detained Cooper, requested her to go back; she hesitated and appeared not willing to go back; Mr. Styles came up, took hold of Cooper's cloak I saw the muslin under her; I took hold of Brown, requested her to go back with me; she did, I followed her; they both came back to the shop. Sapwell was sent for, he examined them; Mr. Styles charged him with both of them, as they were together at the time of stealing it; they said they had no knowledge of each other. I am quite sure the muslin is my master's property.</p>

She was out of my sight in the alley; I went to the top of Sun-street, and met the two prisoners coming out of the top of the alley; they were together in company with a man; the young man that gave me the information, followed them up the alley, and pointed out the one that took it; the two prisoners and the man that they were in company with were all talking together, they all three went into the liquor shop together; I left the young man to watch them while I went for Sapwell, and when I came back the prisoners had come out of the liquor shop; they were all going into Mr. Styles's, the man went in first, I went further on for Sapwell, he not being at home, and when they came out of Mr. Styles's the young man that gave me the information went in and told Mr. Styles.

            . I live in Mitchell-street; I am an apprentice to Mr. Sherfleet, a cabinet maker. As I was coming down Sun-street, I saw a great many people going into Mr. Styles's shop; when I got to the pavement by Mr. Styles's door, I kicked my foot against something, which afterwards turned out to be lace; I took it into Mr. Styles's shop, and asked them if it was their lace, I gave it into Mr. Cooper's hands, he was in Mr. Styles's shop; he claimed the lace. The women were in Mr. Styles's shop when I went in; I know nothing of their taking it. Mr. Sapwell had the lace.</p>

            . I am a servant, I live near the Halfway house, Cottage-lane, I saw a mob of people. A young man took hold of Brown in Union-street, I followed her; I saw her drop the lace down, Mr. Baldero laid hold of the tall woman, Brown; he took her into Mr. Styles's shop, Brown had her hands in the pocket hole of her gown, I saw it drop from her clothes; this young man, Cox, was coming by, he picked it up just at Mr. Styles's door; I followed the young man into the shop. I saw Cox give that which he picked up to Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I never saw the lace if I was to die before I go down the steps, before I saw it in the gentleman's hands, then it was all in a whisp, it was not as it is now.</p>
               <p>Cox. At the time I picked up the lace, it was all in a lump.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was delivered to me in a ball, it was squeezed up, I could hardly get it out again.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. I was going down Sun-street the same day I picked up this bit of lace, in the same manner is the boy said, when this gentleman to his shop I let it drop; I went into the wine vaults, I had a glass of peppermint; ever so many people followed me in. I never saw this woman to my knowledge before that day.</p>

            . I am a widow. On Monday morning the 19th of June, between seven and eight in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18090626-11-crimeloc63">Newgate market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18090626-11-crimeloc63" type="placeName" value="Newgate market"/>

                        targets="t18090626-11-off60 t18090626-11-crimeloc63"/>, I had the box and money safe in my pocket; I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket; I clapped my hand to my pocket, and found that I missed my box; I laid hold of his collar, I said you villain, you have robbed me, he said me, I said yes, you, and if you do not give it me, I will lose my life before I will lose my property; he slipped it out of his hand on the top of a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body close by you at the time you felt his hand in your pocket - A. Nobody but him when I catched hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed him near you before that time - A. I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing at the time you thought you felt his hand in your pocket - A. I was under Mr. Cope's shop, a fruiterer's shop; I was bargaining for some cucumbers at the time he put his hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he secured then - A. There was some little tustle till I got my property from him. Immediately the clerk of the market took him, I did not wish to prosecute him on account of his family; I have since heard that he has a family.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not upon that account that you let him go at that instant - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he is the same person, though you parted with him - A. Yes, he is the same man that I laid hold off.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the man before, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not know any thing about his family at that time - A. No, only what I have heard since.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the contents of your box - A. A one pound note, thirteen shillings in silver, a bad shilling, and a foreign farthing; I have the box, the money I was obliged to make use of. I saw him slip the box out of his hand on the basket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Do you mean to say that you saw him distinctly put it out of his hand on the basket - A. Yes, I clasped my arms around him, and when I turned round I saw it on the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had got him in front, you could not see through him - A. I turned round and saw the box that he put on the basket, I said you dropped it; a woman said she saw him put it out of his hand. The prisoner and I fell down in struggling; that was after I had my box.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there when this happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260010"/>- A. A great number; but there were no person by when I felt his hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not believe the clerk of the market interfered till this man was pretty well mauled about - A. Yes; a whole mob set about him, and then he run till he got him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, I am taken at a nonplus for character; I have nobody here at present; if it was referred till tomorrow I could have many.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a watch and a key and a pair of shoes - A. Yes. On the 12th of this month; I was not at home at the time they were taken. The shoes was in the room where he slept, and the watch was in the room where my wife slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house - A. Yes; he took the lodging on Saturday the 10th in the morning, and came in the evening, about half after eleven o'clock. He took it by the week.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you had seen the watch - A. I wound the watch up before his face, and lay it on the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both use the same sitting room - A. Yes; at the time I wound up the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave the house on the Monday morning - A. I told him I should leave the house about three o'clock; when I got up I heard the chimes go a quarter after three; he was awake, he asked the time; I said a little after three. I went down stairs and called my wife up; she let me in; I told her not to lock the door, I should be back in about an hour and a half; I returned about a quarter before five; I went to feed my birds before I went to the warehouse. In consequence of what my wife said I found my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner gone too - A. He was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the shoes - A. I had seen them on the Sunday morning. He said have you a shoemaker here; I said no, they have been hanging there three months; he took them off the nail and said they would fit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he might have taken them away on the Sunday - A. No; they were in the room on Sunday morning; on Monday morning they were taken away, I had seen them on Sunday afternoon at four o'clock, I did not notice them when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On Wednesday, about seven o'clock, I then said to him, Reed, you thief, you are the man that I have been looking for ever since Monday morning. He never returned, nor had I sight of him till I took him, and then he turned as white as ashes; he did not say a word. I told him what he had stole; he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch or your shoes - A. No. I had another lodger that slept in the room where I did, he has been with me two years; I never lost a halfpennyworth by him; he lives with me now.</p>

I endeavoured to seize the hand that kept the watch, I was afraid that she was going to drop it on the flags; I had not a moment to spare. By her halloaing out a man came up, I was hussled about by him. I secured her. I said my good girl you shall not part with me till I give you into custody. I took her to the corner of Hart-street, there I saw a watchman coming towards me, I gave her in custody; she struggled, but it was useless; I brought her to the watchhouse in Covent-garden along with the watchman; he had one arm and I the other. When she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260011"/>came into the watchhouse; the constable of the night searched both her pockets and her bosom. I told him I suspected that she had not my watch, I thought the accomplice took it from her because I was dashed against a pile of bricks against the box door of the theatre, under the piazzas. The constable found no watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man - A. He vanished from me. I never let the prisoner go till I gave her into the charge of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This was at one o'clock at night - A. It wanted twenty five minutes to two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober - A. I drank a little; I was hearty and perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many women under the piazzas, were there not - A. I did not see one; I was not with her two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that she held you in a manner that you could not extricate yourself - A. No; not till she pulled my watch out with her left hand, and slung it behind her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time she took your watch she had only one arm on you - A. When I was first seized she had both her arms round me; she disengaged one of her arms to take the watch from me; I secured her when I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you first spoke to her was there a man in company with her - A. No; nor woman neither.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came up, I ask you upon your oath, did you say one word to him about any man assisting her. Did not you mention it first at Bow-street, and not at the watchhouse - A. Her accomplice came up and hustled me, and then it was he look the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that after the officer took her in custody she was searched for the purpose of examining whether she had the watch or no - A. Truly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, what was that done for, if you knew at the time that the man took the watch from her - A. I was quite sensible after the hustle she had lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were it not at Bow-street the next day you stated that the man assisted her and took away the watch - A. I stated at Bow-street that her accomplice came up, and I suspected that the accomplice had taken the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was at Bow-street and not at the watch-house, the first time you mentioned it - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending the evening - A. I had been on a party of pleasure; we had two pots of beer; we went up in a boat to Wandsworth.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen the watch from that time to this - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time seeing the prisoner - A. Yes; I saw him on Whitsunday night, between ten and eleven o'clock; I was going home; I had been to Stepney.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to your own door - A. I was just upon the steps, I was going to open the latch of the door to walk in; this man pushed me and took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he push you - was he walking along - A. That I do not know. I was just going in doors; he gave me a push and took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he came from - A. He came of my side with one hand and pushed me on the left breast; I take it to be his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what it was, only that there was something pushed you - A. Yes; and then took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel your watch go - A. Yes; it was in my watch pocket; he got hold of the chain, turned round and began to run.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you - A. No, he did not. I halloaed out stop thief, and ran behind him. The watchman as he came along fell down; he got away. Mr. Griffiths, the officer, took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes; he has walked about my door many times in the day; I know him by sight. I have never seen my watch since. It was a silver watch; I had it three years; I gave four guineas and a half for it; there was a chain, seal, and a little hook to it.</p>
               <p>- GRIFFTHS. On Monday the 22nd of May, I received information of the prosecutor being robbed of his watch, and by the description I found the prisoner at the Star, in Mount-street, where he lodged; I told him I took him in custody for robbing a man in Wentworth-street. I took him to the office, and the prosecutor came and swore to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime. I was at Epsom races; I was not in town that night till half after twelve; Mr. Griffiths took me out of the public house, he said for a highway robbery; I said I would go immediately, I was innocent of the robbery; the gentlemen has sworn falsely.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any books from your shop, and when - A. On the 12th of May, a book called Walton's Angler; that is the only book that I missed till I went to the pawnbroker's, then I found five others.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had that book been kept - A. It was on the counter in the shop for sale among others; I had seen it three days previous; I gave fifty shillings for the book; I do not mean to say that is the value; I saw the prisoner in my shop on the same day, and on the 19th there were nobody there but him and my mother; the moment I came in he went out. On the 22nd of May, two persons called on me late in the evening and gave me some information; in the morning of the 23rd I went to Mr. Gordon's, the pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane; he shewed me Walton's angler and others; I knew them when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Q. Whoever took them books from your shop if they were not sold might not they take them at separate times - A. I cannot answer that they were all taken at one time; I have often been robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you the last person that was up - A. No, I was not; the two children went to bed first, I went next; I secured the doors before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors to the house - A. One front and one back, and one back and one front in the area. I fastened the front area with a key, and bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the front door fastened - A. The key turned, and the bell put up, and the two bolts bolted; the back doors were both bolted and barred.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the house - A. My master and two sisters, no other servant but me. I went to bed before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed in the night - A. I was not; I got up between four and five, my master called, it was quite day light then; I went down stairs, the first I observed was, the bar was down; I saw the watchman holding the prisoner in the parlour; I went and called somebody else a few doors off; I came in again and turned into the parlour the second time; I saw four silver tea spoons and the sugar tongs, which I know to be my master's property in the watchman's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the door or the house when you first came down - A. When I went out I saw the door open.</p>

               <p>Q. That is where Mr. Warner's house is - A. Yes; his house is No. 7. On the 31st of May I entered my duty, and as half past four o'clock in the morning on the 1st of June, I was calling the hour of half past four, I perceived Mr. Warner's gate, No. 7, open; it is a fore court; I suppose it is about twenty yards distance from the house; I shut the gate again, I thought it was left by accident, it was day light. I went from there and called the half hour up to the end of my beat; I then called a gentleman at No. 21, I returned to my bar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260013"/>I then stripped off my coat, my cutlass, and pistols, and left them; I locked up my box, I went up the beat, and called the hour of five o'clock; it wanted then a quarter to five. I came to Mr. Warner's, I found the gate open, which I had shut at half past four, and I found some spots of ink on the pavement, which caused some suspicion in me. I then entered the gate; I went up to the area, I saw the shutters cut to pieces; the chips were on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they inside shutters - A. Inside shutters; the windows were thrown up, and some chips laying on the outside pavement, and the bell was on the pavement, it was taken out of the window. Then I tried the door, I put my hand to the door, I found the street door open; I could not get in the area, it is a very deep place; I pushed the door open; I found a coffee urn, or a tea urn laying in the passage ready to take out; I went in, I holloaed out who is here, nobody answered; I went on to the parlour door, I then saw the prisoner packing up linen in a gentleman's shirt; I said, sir, what are you doing, he stepped up to me, and said he had a brother that lodged in the house; I said you are a thief, you are robbing the house; I at the moment catched him by the collar; he struggled a little, not much; I then rung the bell which lay opposite of the parlour door, in the street, and Mr. Warner came down; I begged of him to look in the kitchen to see who was there, he looked and said nobody was there; I said you may go up and dress yourself, I can take care of this man; he came down again; we searched the prisoner, we found a pen knife, and some trifling things; Mr. Warner searched his breeches pocket; found four tea spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs, I saw him take them out; he delivered them into my hands; I searched his other pocket, I found a large knife, I took it from him; Mr. Warner picked up his hat, and took out a dozen of doyles from the crown of his hat; Mr. Warner took up an instrument which can be produced by Mr. Armstrong; I asked the prisoner whether it was his or not, he said nothing, he did not deny it; after we had searched him, I had every thing in my possession. I took him to Worship-street, there was no magistrate sitting; I took him to a young man, he put irons on his hands. I took him down to Mr. Armstrong the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine the house more particular to see whether there were any other things in the kitchen - A. There was a quantity of damask table linen packed up in a shirt to a great amount; I catched him in the fact; he then said I have got a brother in the house, I am doing no harm.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office; the prisoner was delivered into my custody by Harris, the watchman; he delivered four tea spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, twelve doyles, and this centerbit. I put the prisoner in the watchhouse. I called up two other officers, and we went to Mr. Warner's house that morning. In the kitchen this centerbit had made the impression; I fitted the centerbit to the hole, it fitted the hole, there was a hole in each shutter; we went over the fields, we could find nothing else of the property. I found three duplicates on the prisoner, it did not concern Mr. Warner. I took the prisoner before the magistrate, he was committed. I searched his lodging, I found nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the doyles - A. There were a dozen of them, they are my master's to the best of my knowledge, they are not marked, they were bought new three or four days before; they are worth three shillings, or three shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else that was moved at all in the house - A. There was a number of things taken out of the kitchen drawers and put on the dresser. In a few minutes afterwards, I went into the kitchen, I saw the table cloths and course cloths that we used to wipe hands with, and two tea cloths, and two of my gowns taken out.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any other things that you missed from any place that you knew to be in the house the night before, you went to bed and that you missed the next morning - A. Nothing more than the writing desk, that was in the parlour on the sideboard the night before; that was gone; I should value it at about ten shillings,</p>
               <p>Q. What else was there - A. Three table-spoons; I believe one was in the kitchen and the other two in the parlour to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot say; the day before I had cleaned them; I believe I had washed two of them among the dishes and put them in the kitchen cupboard. I know they are my master's; I cannot exactly say what is the value of them; there was a salt spoon that was taken off the sideboard in the parlour, I value that at about sixpence, there was a castor stand worth about three shillings and sixpence I should think, a damask tablecloth taken out of the parlour about two shillings, a cream pot about one pound; I am no judge of these things; a silver wine strainer about eighteen shillings; the tea urn I saw at the front door when I came down, that had been left on the sideboard in the parlour; I cannot say what it is worth, I am no judge in these things.</p>

               <p>Q. to Watson. You prove the signature of the first marriage - A. Yes, and the second marriage is her signature; I lived fourteen years with her at my grandfather's; I have seen her write many times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will consider the character of my prosecutor; I brought him up from ten years old, gave him education, and put him out apprentice; I paid a person two pounds ten shillings; he made the person pay the penalty of the law because the receipt was not on a stamp.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

On the 14th of June I was in the house, about ten o'clock in the forenoon. I observed the prisoner, he was standing about the window looking into the street; he was first looking one way and then another; I was going up stairs to fetch some clothes for my baby, I looked to the shop to see all was right, on my looking towards the shop door I observed the prisoner looking to see if any body was looking, I did not observe that the window was broke; in two or three minutes I observed his hand within the window, I saw him moving some silver thimbles with his forefinger; the silver thimbles were in a drawer close to the window. I went out and took hold of him by the collar; he pushed me back against my left breast; I let go my hold, he ran away across the road; when he got of the opposite side he attempted to go down Feathers-court, a woman sat there with a fruit-stall he could not get down; he turned back, ran a bit and then walked slowly: I holloaed out stop thief all the time; a gentleman in a chaise or gig jumped out and ran after him; he was never out of my sight till the gentleman took him; I was standing at the corner of the pavement opposite of my own house; in a few minutes he was brought back again; then I looked at my window there was a piece of glass entirely out. It was cracked a few days before, it was broken about five inches in length and two inches in width.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before you saw the man standing at the corner of the shop was it that you had observed this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260015"/>pane of glass, so as to know whether it was whole or any broken out - A. A very little while before; the shop was not open till near nine o'clock; I put the jewellery between nine and ten in the window, there was no hole then only a crack; the thimbles were not half an inch from that window; if the window had been broken I should not have put the jewellery there. I am certain there was six silver thimbles and a silver shield gone out of the tray, they were laid upon pink cotton wool. When the prisoner was brought back he was taken into the middle room; he was searched, not one of the articles were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his pockets - A. Not till after he was searched, I observed the lining of his left pocket sticking out, I saw a little of the of the pink cotton wool sticking to the lining of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any pink cotton laying about your shop - A. None, except behind the counter, no one could get at it except myself.</p>
               <p>MR. HOPKINSON. Q. Were you in Holborn on this day that the last witness spoke of - A. Yes, I was coming down Holborn along with my friend; I saw the prisoner struggling with the last witness, he broke away from her and ran across the street; I kept my eye upon him and seeing nobody stop him I jumped out of the gig and stopped him; I am sure the person that I saw struggling with the last witness is the person that I stopped; I brought him back to her shop. I got away as soon as I could; I just observed the pane of glass was broken as I passed the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Martins in Fields. On Friday night last, about nine o'clock, I took the prisoner in custody at the Lemon Tree, out of the pretended custody of a man that pretended he had a bastard child; he had this bundle of things and going away from his lodging with them. On Saturday morning I made enquiry about the pawnbrokers; I went to Mr. Cordy's, I found that the watch had been pledged and taken out from there; I went to Mr. Solomon's I found that he had bought it out and out; Solomon lives in Vinegar-yard, he is a clothes salesman; I got the watch from Solomon, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Donaldson, was not I in charge of another constable - A. You were in charge of a pretended constable, who let you go away with me; I told him he was no constable; I put him of one side directly and took you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I going to take my clothes away - A. I took you with the bundle; I asked you what you were going to do with the things; you said you were going to your washerwoman; I said are you going to have your shoes washed; they were all the things that you had in the lodging, you were taking them away. I delivered you the things up before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. How soon afterwards did you examine his lodging - A. In half an hour afterwards, and then I only found a phial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I taking my clothes out of the house, or not - A. Yes, you were; an old shirt, a pair of shoes, a parcel of cuttings and shears, all the moveables that you had in the lodgings; you were going out with them when I stopped you.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner before - A. I saw him last Friday, about four or five o'clock, he came to my shop and told me he had a watch in pledge for two pounds, and asked me if I would buy the duplicate; I told him I never bought duplicates; I bought the property, I could not buy it without seeing it; he said he would sell me the watch if I would go with him to the pawnbroker's and pay the interest; I asked him how much he paid for the watch; he said six pounds. We went to the pawnbroker's between four and five in the afternoon; I asked him the watchmaker's name, he said I should see the watchmaker's name when I saw the watch; he lived over Blackfriers-road, and he bought the watch over Blackfriers-road. We went into the pawnbroker's; I paid the pawnbroker two pounds for the principal, and eight pence for the interest, and took the watch out. When I came home I asked him what he asked for the watch; he said three pounds ten shillings; I told him I would give him no more than three pound. We bargained for it; I gave him one pound, he gave me sixpence for the interest. Three pounds and two-pence I paid for that watch: when I brought the watch home the box was open; I asked him where the key was belonging to that box; he told me he lost it; then he took the money and went away; the watch case, if you examine it, is broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mrs. Ryder, look at the watch and the case - A. This is the watch and case; I know it.</p>

On Sunday the 11th of this month I was sitting in the lodge, I was looking out of the window; I took notice of the prisoner and two men; I saw the prisoner in company with two others, as I was in the lodge at the entrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of the men - - A. The prisoner was one; the other men I did not take particular notice of; they seemed as if they came to some gentleman; the prisoner passed the lodge window and returned, the others went further up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have any thing with him - A. He did not appear to have any thing with him at all as I saw. The window stands in the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he was going out, do you - A. There was no passage that way that he was going.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, in consequence of one of the laundresses speaking to you, you pursued the prisoner - A. She called me from the lodge; I went up stairs to No. 5, there I perceived the door of the chamber had been broken open, and some mischief had been done to these chambers; I went in pursuit, and I overtook these men in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. That was soon after you first saw a chamber that had been broken open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that you followed these men - A. Yes; I overtook the prisoner in Chancery-lane, he was one of the three; they were going towards Holborn; they were walking; the prisoner had a bundle in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him at the time - A. No; I did not take the bundle from him; he surrendered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perhaps open the bundle at that time - A. No, I did not; I held him there till I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him and the constable any where - A. I did; to the Roll's watchhouse in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two men - A. They went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. At the Roll's watchhouse did you open the bundle - A. It was opened; I saw it opened; there was a time piece, and tea chest rolled up in a dirty table cloth. These are the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. - . Q. The New inn is a public thoroughfare - A. I do not know how far that is to be described a public thoroughfare. We are in the habit of locking up the New inn.</p>
               <p>Q. A number of people pass through, do not they - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in the three men - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take particular notice of people coming in - A. Not particularly; I was sitting in the inside of the lodge, looking out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that the prisoner at the bar was one of the men passing by - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray whereabouts is the chamber that was broken open - A. On the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him go towards that place - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards when you seized the prisoner with the bundle - A. About half an hour, on three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it within an hour - A. I dare say it was.</p>

There was a bottle like that; I saw it when I went out, I mentioned it to Mr. Bundell at the office, he told me that he had got a bottle of rum, and that was a bottle of rum that I saw at the chambers.</p>

            . Mr. - . What are you - A. I am a taylor. I live in Charles-street, Bridgewater-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near Chancery-lane on the 11th of June last - A. I was there last Sunday was a fortnight, I cannot remember the day of the month; it was near six o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where were you going, or where were you coming from - A. I had been to Covent Garden to see the play house, and from there to see Drury-lane play house that was burned down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come to from thence - A. Into Drury-lane, to Wych-street, out of Wych-street, into some square, I cannot exactly tell the name of it. Then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260019"/>I went along two or three courts, and just before I got out of the court, I saw a man pick up a bundle just by the passage by a dead wall; it was a white parcel, what was in it I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. - . Did you take notice of that man - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know him again if you saw him - A. Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar - A. That is the man, I saw that man pick up the bundle, he stooped once, and then he stooped again; he turned round, looked me hard in the face, and I looked at him hard in the face, and then he went along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man in company with any body - A. I did not see any body with him at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Which way did he go - A. He went along the next street, after he got out of this court to where Gulley lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Gulley - A. Why the fighting man, he keeps the public house, the sign of the Plough; he went along that street, I turned to the left, and went the other way from him; I did not see him any more after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the man before that you saw pick up that bundle - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know who he was at all, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stop to look at the bundle, to see what it was - A. No, he did not, he went on with it, he was walking alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of this, what time did you say - A. Near six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it was near six - A. Because I had been at a public house; I took notice of the clock before I went from there.</p>
               <p>Q. How near six was it then - A. I do not know to a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from thence - A. I went home then to where I live, to Charles-street, Bridgewater-square, by Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of these things that you saw laying on the pavement - was it on the foot pavement, or the horse pavement - A. On the foot pavement, it laid by a dead wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Were many people passing - A. No, I do not recollect I saw any person passing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a street or in an alley - A. In an alley by a dead wall.</p>
               <p>Q. But you do not know what street or alley - A. No; I am not used to that part of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. But you know this house where Gulley lives - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of that street - A. I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the name of that street - A. Yes, I know it, I cannot think of it just now.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have not seen that man since that time he picked up the bundle, till you now come in court - A. Yes, I saw him down Mutton Hill on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going down Mutton Hill on the Monday morning - A. I was going to a lady's house, that keeps a broker's shop. I saw him going along with the officer, he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you - A. No, not then, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he nod or bow to you, or any thing - A. No, I was standing looking at him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he see you - A. I do not know, he would not know me most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should not he know you as well as you know him - you said he turned round and looked at you, when he stooped and picked up the parcel - where was he taken to - A. He was taken to Hatton-garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the office - A. No, I did not, I followed him into the yard, into a place where they put them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear what he was charged with - A. No, not before I asked him; I asked him what his name was and what he had done in the yard of Hatton garden office; I was told that he picked up a bundle at such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you - A. The prisoner told me.</p>
               <p>Q. What by accident, not knowing that you were the man that saw him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that as soon as he was taken into the yard - A. It was not long after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he with in the yard at that time, was he loose walking about, or was there an officer with him - A. There were two or three people with him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not at large - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him what he was there for - A. Yes; he told me for picking up a bundle; I told him I saw him pick it up, if I could do him any service at any time, I would come forward on his behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was all that passed - A. Yes, and then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then in the yard of the office at Hatton-garden to which you had followed him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he ask you to go to the magistrate that was sitting then - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor call the constable - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's business - A. I do not know nothing at all about the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what his business is - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been to the New-inn perhaps that day - A. That was the place I went to.</p>
               <p>Q. You went through the New-inn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go through the New-inn - A. It was very near to six o'clock; I cannot tell to minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was walking along with you - A. A lady, a couzen of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Any gentleman - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you stop any time in the New-inn - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never saw the prisoner before that day - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw him pick up that bundle, now do you mean to swear that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mins. Do you know that man - A. This man is very much like one of the men that was with him, but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of either of them that was walking with him in Chancery-lane - A. There was one man walking with him, much about his size.</p>
               <p>Q. to Matthews. Were you with him when he was brought to Hatton-garden office - A. I was, along with the jailer.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that person, the last witness - A. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260020"/>was never in the yard at all; I saw him about the door of the office in the street, and four others; I saw him on the Monday while the examination was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the prisoner in custody - A. I had; it was outside where the prisoner was kept.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner and he could not speak together - A. I am certain of that, because I was outside of the door during the time the prisoner was locked up; we never suffer any prisoner to be in the yard at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room when the prisoner was examined before the magistrate - A. I was there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken from the office to the prison - A. He was delivered to the jailer at our office, I went with him when he was committed to the jailer of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever tell you that he saw a person that saw him pick it up - A. No, he never mentioned a thing of that kind at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of himself - A. None at all; there was a person that attended for him, told him to stop his tongue; I took notice of the persons about the door; they are persons that used the

On the evening of the same day they had occasion to put up a further quantity, when there appeared but seven sticks remaining; suspicion arose, in consequence of that, that we had been robbed, and I ordered the whole of our men, three in number, to be called into the accompting house; I informed them what we had missed; they all denied any knowledge of it; I immediately ordered their persons to be searched; the prisoner was the last person searched; he had on a smock frock at the time, which he was desired to take off, in the act of doing which, I evidently perceived him shifting something that appeared not to be perfectly easy in his small clothes; being satisfied that he had something about him that did not belong to him; I did not proceed to search him any further, but directly sent for an officer; that officer searched him and the two sticks of distilled verdigrease, in question, were taken out of his breeches.</p>

On the 23rd of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, Whetstone came and asked me if I wanted any more sweepings; I told him no, I had not half burned those I had bought a fortnight ago; and my husband said I had given more than they were worth; they were so small I could not burn them; he replied these were a great deal better than the others; I should have a better bargain; he had picked the chief of these up on the wharf, and he had the sweepings of the barge; he brought three bushels, he shot them in the back kitchen; I asked him what I was to pay, he said five shillings; I gave him four, I was to give him the other shilling when my husband came home; he said, very well, mistress, I will call again between this and the evening; he was gone down stairs about a minute; Mr. Stapleton came and said has the man brought you any coals; I said yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are those the coals that Mr. Stapleton saw - A. Yes; I looked out of the window and saw Whetstone was in custody; I called to him to come up and answer for himself; I asked him how he could tell me that he picked the coals up, and that he had the sweepings of the barge; he asked my pardon. Mr. Stapleton sent a man to take the coals away.</p>
               <p>Davis said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Whetstone's Defence. I swept the barge up; it is a a rule, and what they all do in the trade; I did not know but what I might have them.</p>
               <p>Kilbrath's Defence. After we had filled the sacks we cleaned up the barge, they were in the barge after we cleaned it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stapleton. They were part of the bulk; the sweepings are dust.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the girl who took the stocking with the pocket book, and money out of the knapsack - A. Yes, I am sure of it; I gave the description of her to the officer, who took her at the girl's room; the other girl had two letters on her arm; this girl gave her name of Suckey and the other Ann.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what manner of a house this was - A. No. The pocket book was found afterwards with my discharge in it, and nothing else in it; the money was all gone; when I lost it a five pound bank note, four one pound bank notes, and the change of half a guinea was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see this girl - A. I did not see her till I went to Woolwich to get a copy of my discharge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I have no doubt that you lost your money. I am very sorry for it; you employed a boy to get a lodging for you, it turned out not to be what you thought it was; it was late at night when you cast anchor in this place - A. About half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems you liked to have something to drink among you - A. I never had a drop.</p>


               <p>Q. That was very unsocial indeed - A. I cannot drink liquor, it does not agree with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you mean by that, a little liquor soon makes you drunk - A. I cannot drink liquor since I have been hurt; I was quite sober that night, I was advised not to get drunk for fear I should lose my money; they advised me for my good.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that you came to town, you attempted to drink a glass more than you ought - A. No, I did not take a drop.</p>
               <p>Q. At half after ten we all know it is is very dark - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This boy took you to a lodging were there were two women - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there turned out to be two men there also - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave a description of the person having T. H. on her arm - A. No, I did not; I told them the girl that took my pocket book was a smallish girl; I told them the girl marked T. H. on her arm was united with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You were tired after your journey, when you went to bed you soon fell asleep, did not you - A. No, they did not give me time to go to sleep; it was done in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was done in a moment, you had not much opportunity of knowing the person again - A. Yes I had, by her being in the room before; and I wanted the key of the door, they told me there was no key to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you will not take upon you to say that poor girl was one that you were in company with that night - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260022"/>Q. It is a very hard thing for you to swear to that poor girl whom you never saw before - A. Sir, you must think it is a very hard thing for me to lose every farthing I had in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. You described the other girl that had the letters on her arm to have remained in the room - A. Yes, but she was not the girl that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remain there all night - A. No, a person for safety took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to sleep before you went to the watchhouse - A. I went to bed, but I never closed my eyes.</p>

               <p>Q. When did this happen - A. It was on Monday last, it was near Tuesday, two o'clock in the morning; I was passing down <placeName id="t18090626-24-crimeloc141">Ludgate-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18090626-24-crimeloc141" type="placeName" value="Ludgate-hill"/>

I had on a pair of trowsers which had no pockets except the fob; in consequence of that, I put my pocket book into my inside coat pocket; I put my hand to my coat to ascertain that I had my purse about me, which I know I had, by feeling the bulk of it; the next motion I made was when I put my hand down again I missed it, they were then going away: I said before you go away, be so good as to return me my money; one of them drew me as it were towards her, and then I think it was that my purse was taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. What do you mean as it were - A. She drew me towards her.</p>
               <p>COURT. At that moment you think you lost your purse - A. I think I did; because I put my hand down afterwards and missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they wanted to go - A. Yes, I said before you go give me my purse, you have robbed me of my purse, they said we have got no purse; I immediately called the watch, and raised an alarm, the watchman came up, and they were taken in custody; they were not searched on the spot; there was nothing found on them at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that drew you towards her - A. Yates, she pulled me towards her; she stood on my left side, the side that my purse was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she saw you feel your pocket - A. Most undoubtedly she did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had better told her of it - A. Perhaps I had better made her a present of it. I never saw the purse again. I did not see them searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Mr. Malpas, where had you been till two o'clock, it was not term time - A. No, it was vocation, as we call it.</p>
               <p>Q. Vocation as it were, can you tell me in fact, what time it was you left Mr. Cummins's office - A. Half past ten; a young man came to me, and we went to the Castle in Portugal-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get in Portugal-street - A. I cannot say, I did not draw my watch; it could not be eleven o'clock, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink when you got there - A. I think we drank three pints of porter between two of us.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you consume the whole of the time there in the house in Portugal-street, and drink no more than three pints of porter between you - what time did you leave the house - A. More than half past one.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were you going to get on Ludgate-hill - A. I walked with the young man down Ludgate-hill, I lived in Serjeant's-inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to Mr. Cummins's, it was a late hour in the night - A. It was an early hour in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do on Ludgate-hill at that time in the morning, you should have gone home if you had been my clerk, I should have thought - A. I did ring at Serjeant's-inn gate.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had rung at the gate the porter who attends the gate would have opened it - what had you to do on Ludgate-hill - A. I walked up there with no intention.</p>
               <p>Q. You having alarmed Serjeant's-inn by ringing the bell, walked up to Ludgate-hill with no intention - A. I pulled the bell, I will not swear that I made the bell ring; I took a stroll up Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank nothing else but the three pints of porter - A. I drank a glass of rum shrub, besides the beer.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I saw the women when I called the hour of two o'clock, they were coming down Ludgate-hill; after I had done calling the hour, it was not above five or six minutes before this gentleman called out watchman; when I came down he gave me charge of these two women, he said they had robbed him; I took them in charge; there were three or four men behind the women, as close as possible to them. I looked on the ground with my lanthorn, I could not see any purse; the men pretended to look, after that I took them to the watchhouse, and the men followed us; and on going up Paternoster-row, into the court where our watchhouse is, the men were missing; the constable of the night and the superintendant of the watch searched them, nothing was found.</p>

            ; the piece was sticking out at the end of his coat; the other was not walking far distant behind him; my comrade and I proceeded up the lane after them; they turned their eyes upon us and hastened; we followed them up the lane into Skinner-street, and they went down Snow-hill; I halloaed out halloa; he threw down the piece and made his escape; Dennis, that was walking behind him, went immediately and picked it up; I ran up to Dennis, who had picked it up, and collared him; he immediately struck me and dropped it; I called for assistance; my comrade picked up the piece and followed me on the other side; some person standing by said do not let him go; there was a constable fetched in a minute; the constable came and took him to his house; he asked me to put my name to the piece, which I did; he then took him to the Poultry compter. After we took the prisoner to the compter the constable went to a place with an anchor over the door, at the bottom of Fleet-market; I believe it belonged to them; we were going home; we met Dunning that had the piece first in Cloth-fair; we followed him till he halted at the Catherine Wheel, Bridgewater-gardens; my comrade kept sight of him while I went for a constable.</p>

            . I am a drummer in the royal East London militia.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with Mumford - A. Yes; we were both together. I can only state what my comrade has stated; I know that to be truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. Between five and six o'clock, on the 3rd of this month; as we were coming down Fleet-market, I saw these two men coming across the green market; the prisoner Dunning, in the blue coat, had the piece under his arm, he was making towards Turnagain-lane; I said to my comrade, look here; we followed them up Turnagain-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the men - A. Yes, I am certain these are the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the property drop - A. Yes, and I saw the other pick it up; my comrade ran towards him that picked the quilting up and collared him; he dropped the quilting, and struck my comrade in the face; my comrade called for assistance; some gentleman called do not let him go; I picked up the piece of quilting; a constable came up immediately. We afterwards met Dunning in Long-lane, we followed him till he went into the tap-room of the Catherine Wheel, Bridgewater-gardens; I kept him in sight while my comrade fetched a constable; I am positive that is the man that threw the piece of quilting down, and the other man picked it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 4th of June, of his desiring any thing with respect to moving your bed - A. Yes; he desired me to bring the bed up stairs; I had removed it down on account of the bugs, he desired me to bring it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 5th of June, did you take the bed up stairs - A. At ten o'clock in the evening he said there was no occasion unless I had a mind to it, nevertheless I said I would; we supped together in the bed room, the prisoner, his wife, and all the children; two boys besides the sucking child; we all supped together, and went to bed in the same room. About four o'clock the next morning I awoke, they were all asleep; I got up and looked out of the window, and as the prisoner had no sleep for a week past, I thought I would not disturb him.</p>
               <p>COURT. How do you know that he had no sleep - A. Because he was laying and talking all night long; I went to bed again and I went to sleep; when I awoke again, I think as nigh as I can recollect, it was about a quarter after six; I lifted up my eyes, I saw he stood up by the bed side, I do not know whether he was dressed or not; the first thing that I saw was the infant's head all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the infant that was in bed with his wife - A. Yes; then I looked and saw that his wife was bloody; in my fright I turned the two other children down stairs, and told them to call somebody; he told me to go out of the way, he did not want to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What age are the children - A. One is turned eleven, and the other about six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand - A. I believe the hatchet was in his hand; I had a struggle with him, and got the handle of the hatchet out of his hand, leaving the other part of the hatchet in his hand; then he pulled up his wife in bed, and said let me put this poor creature out of her misery; then directly upon that I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughter then, when he pulled her up - A. Yes, I saw her then, but she had her head wounded before I awoke.</p>
               <p>COURT. That you cannot tell - A. I saw her blood on her head, I left the room, I saw she was bloody and wounded; I saw him give her one blow just before I took the hatchet out of his hand, I think with the head of the hatchet on the side of her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come into the room again - A. No, not till after she was dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did Davey say any thing after you came in again - A. He was taken away then.</p>
               <p>Q. For some time before this, in what state of mind had this man been in - A. Why sir, he has not been right since last May five year; he has been twice in St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been particularly low spirited or uneasy just about or before this time - A. Very low sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to observe that his insanity was returning upon him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your daughter make any observation of the same effect - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing particular in him about the month of June - A. He was always worse in that month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in general a kind and affectionate husband before - A. A very kind husband, and a very good father, ever since he has been out of St. Luke's this last time, he never offered to insult any of us.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say that he has not been in his right mind for near these five years last May - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to him then, had he any blow or accident - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ill at that time, five years ago - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his illness - A. I think it was rather a family disorder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any fever - A. No; he was apprenticed to the sea, when he came home he went to live with his sister, who is in the same way now; she lives in Kentish-town now, she has some property; she is in her own house, and she is taken care of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260025"/>Q. You say he became in the same way five years ago - was he in confinement any time - A. It was five years ago the first time, then he was very bad, he was in confinement in St. Luke's; there is a paper that gives an account; as soon as we could get a letter to get him in; we got him in, there he was for four months; afterwards he came out of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue before he came bad again - A. He was never right after he was taken out the first time; he was always talking or singing, but did not do any mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. He followed his business and did no mischief - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he became ill again so as to occasion him to be confined again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long after that was - A. No; there is a certificate of that; he was twice in St. Luke's. It was four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke just now of a week that he could not rest - A. Yes; he was talking all night, and could not rest; he was complaining of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was no quarrel whatever between him and his wife - A. No.</p>

            . Q. You are a butcher in Skinner-street - A. Yes. On the morning of the 6th of June the two boys were crying about; my daughter came and told me. As I went up stairs Mrs. Blackburn bursted the door, and forced the door in the wrong way; I instantly ran up stairs; she kept the door from him hurting her; the door had a chair against it. As I went in the first thing I saw was Mrs. Davey sitting up in bed with her head and face all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. That was when you looked in - A. Yes. I could not get into the room then. Instantly I put my head in, I saw him standing by the bed side, the bed was lying on the ground; I said Davey, Davey, what have you done; he had a lapstone in his hand, what he used in his trade; he said immediately, Mr. Davis, you go down stairs, or else I shall kill and murder you; I instantly pulled my head back, thinking he might throw the stone at me, or cause him to do his wife further mischief; there was a crack, I looked through; he hit his wife over the head; she cried, oh! down she fell immediately; as she fell down with her head on the side of the pillow, he hit her over the head with the stone; I could see the blood go all over the room; he instantly turned himself round by her head; by the bed side was a razor case; he took it up sharpish; he opened the case and took the razor out, looked at me, and put his head out; he took the razor and did so as though to cut his own throat; I ran down stairs and gave the alarm; he put the razor down.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not touch it - A. No, he did not touch it; it was within two or three inches of his throat. That is all I saw of the murder being committed; he was secured instantly; I got into the room, the infant lye as if it had been suckling; the mother was groaning; at the same time the brains came out of the hair of the child. The child, when I took it up, did just make one gasp.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner before this - A. I had lived there very near sixteen months, I lived next door then. Instantly I laid the child on the pillow I put my arm under the wife, lifted her up, and asked a person to give me some water; she drank a little water down her throat; she made a terrible noise; I kept her so till the doctor came.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that you had known the prisoner sixteen months - A. Yes. I have no doubt but he was out of his mind, but he was not mischevious; he gave incoherent answers; I never heard an angry word between him and his mother or his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was secured - A. Yes; I got into the room just at the time they secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance - A. I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wife after she was dead - A. I did.</p>

            . Q. Were you called in on the the 6th of June to see Mrs. Davey - A. I was; it was near seven o'clock in the morning; the child was dead; I found the woman with a large wound extending from the near corner of the right eye to the back of the head, over the ear; I did what appeared necessary to be done at that time. It had penetrated the scull, I felt the brain, it was protruding at the back part of the head; there were two wounds in the back, between the shoulders, which apparently had been done by a knife, like stabs; I was not there at the time of her death; I was there a few minutes after her death.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt what was the cause of her death - A. No; the wound in her head was the cause of her death.</p>

             called my brother and challenged him then, when he would fight, and called him a great many names; I was not with him, the young man is here that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us what you saw - A. He was at the Gibralter then. Ayres's mother died at three o'clock on Saturday morning; my brother heard that Ayres was at the Gibralter playing at skittles; my brother went to him, and said, I suppose you will not fight at all as your poor mother lies dead, I suppose you do not to fight; Ayres said to him, what you want to off as you have all along, we will have it out to morrow morning, to know who is the master; my brother said if you are determined we will have it out to morrow morning. About half after three on Sunday morning Ayres came with all his mob, about thirty of them; he called my brother a cowardly b - r, and a great many names; why did not he come and fight; and at half after five they came again, with a great many more with them; they throwed up mud and stones at the windows a great many times, while me and my brother were in bed; my brother jumped out of bed to see who they were; he saw Ayres, then my brother dressed himself, and went down to my mother, and told her that he could not stand it, go he would and face them; he went and left word with my mother not for me to come, but my mother would make me go; I went into the yard to wash myself, and when I came up my brother was gone; I put on my coat and went after him directly; I overtook my brother going to the field. When we came there there was Ayres and Robinson and all their companions, upwards of an hundred of them; they were all three before we were; Ayres as soon as he saw my brother, went into the field and chucked off his coat and hat; my brother went into the field too, they both shook hands together before they began to fight. When they had four rounds my brother wanted to leave off, he said he would not fight any more. A brick maker that was at work in the field, snatched a bottle away from a little boy, went and got some water and washed my brother's face, and said my brother should fight; he drove my brother in the ring, he fought ten rounds; after that the brick maker said he should fight, for he was just getting the better of the battle; he washed my brother's face and the other's too. The last round that they had, my brother missed his blow, Ayres struck him at the back part of his ear, they both fell together; they were both picked up; Ayres put on his coat and went away; my brother went to pull off his waistcoat that he fought in, he fell with the waistcoat in his hand; he said oh, his head, he never felt such a pain in all his life; he fell backwards with the waistcoat in his hand; he began to alter very much, and stretched himself out. We went and fetched the surgeon as soon as we could; I and another lad fetched the surgeon, the surgeon came and bled him in three places; he said he could do no good for him, he was a dead person. He did not live five minutes from the time he was struck, till he was dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understood you to have said that your brother said if he did come over, fists and bricks should go to work - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. So then afterwards when they met to fight the fist fight, they shook hands and to it they went - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They both fought the best they could - A. I dare say they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother said he would not fight any more, but the brick maker made him; they were both of them willing to leave off - A. No. Ayres would fight, he did not want to leave of.</p>

               <p>MR. BRADEWELL. Q. You are a surgeon, are you - A. Yes, I was present upon this occasion; he was apparently dead when I saw him; I opened his jugular vein, and did every thing I thought needful.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the body after his death - A. Yes; he died of an injury that had been offered to the head from some blow, the effect of that blow was a quantity of extraversated blood upon the membrane of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt from what you observed, that that was the real cause of his death - A. I have no doubt whatever.</p>

            . Q. Did you stop the prisoner in Duke-street - A. Yes; I only know that he was pursued by a hue and cry; I gave him the coach way. I begged him to stop; he begged, me to let him go on, he was only pursued by a press gang. I took him to the marshalman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming from Islington on Friday the 16th, a gentleman came up to me and put this in my arms, and told me to carry it to the Swan and Two Necks, he no sooner gave them to me then he left me; that gentleman came up and laid hold of me and ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know her person - A. Yes; I know her to be the same person that came in our shop on June the 10th, about twelve at noon, she came to purchase two caps, they were hanging at the door; she bought the caps, paid for them, and look them away. In the course of five minutes she came in the shop again and said the caps were not the same as were hanging at the door; I convinced her that they were the same; she then took several muslins in her hand and asked the price, which I told her; she bid me within a shilling or eighteen pence a yard of what I asked her; I told her I could not deal with her in that way. There were other customers in the shop; she desired me to attend them, and she would wait. In the course of five minutes I had served the other customers, I told her we had got some remnants cheaper; I took her to another part of the shop and shewed her the remnants, which I sold to her for four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260029"/>shillings; I then told her we had some cheap stockings and very good at two shillings; she looked at them, said they were too coarse, if I could shew her some very good for three shillings; I looked down, I saw her folding something under her gown; I said what is that; she said nothing; I said you have stole something; I looked over the counter, I saw the five yards of printed cotton come from some part of her clothes; it dropped from under her clothes on the ground; I saw it two minutes before on the counter close by her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You were of the other side of the counter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that whatever view you had was from looking over the counter - A. Yes; I was not of the same side of the counter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether you are correct in saying you saw it fall from her, depends upon whether you were correct in your view - A. I saw it drop from her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body in the room with you but the prisoner - A. Not when we went in. I suppose we laid down on the bed both together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue asleep - A. Perhaps an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you fell asleep did any body else come in the room - A. No; she was with me when I fell asleep. when I awoke she was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Then was there any body else in the room - A. Yes; there was a girl that belonged to the house; I was awoke by the person that kept the house. I had lain down in my clothes; when I awoke I missed my watch, and the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the watch - A. I felt it in my pocket when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did you happen to feel it in your pocket - A. I saw the watch hanging down when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after you awoke - A. I asked them if they knew what had became of it; they said no, I never had one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that you never took the watch out before you went to bed - A. Yes; I am certain that I never took it out.

            . I keep the Round-house, I have the charge of all the prisoners; when the last witness was brought to the watchhouse, he said he had been robbed of his watch at the house; he described the woman that he had been with as a tall woman that spoke hoarse. We knew the woman, we went out but could not find her that night. On the next morning, about eleven o'clock, a person came and told me where she was: I went to the place and found her, I asked her for the watch; she delivered it up to me directly; she said she was very tipsey, or else she never would have taken it; I took her and the watch to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prosecutor appear to you, as to sobriety - A. He did not appear to be very sober, but the woman of the house, and her brother had ill used him, which rather made him more flurried than he would have been.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house any time - A. Yes; about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he lodged there had you any transaction about a draft or bill - A. He ran up a bit of a score, about fifteen or sixteen shillings; he wanted to run more on, I told him I could not think of letting it run on any longer. In consequence of that he told me he would pay me in the course of a few days. On the 9th of May be brought me a bill, while he was lodging at my house; he gave me the bill, and told me that I could see that he did not wish to defraud me out of the money, for the property that he had. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260030"/>the bill, he wanted to have seven or eight pound on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say so - A. Yes, he gave it me for that purpose; I told him I could not let him have it; I had paid my brewer that day, I had not a farthing in my house except a few shillings; in consequence of that he begged for ten or twelve shillings in silver of me; he had ten shillings in silver of me, and three shillings in halfpence, he called for a pot of ale, he told me he would be with me on the next morning, to go with me to the bankers to receive the money of the bill; I kept the bill, he left it with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say you should keep the bill - A. He gave it me, and told me to keep it, he would go with me in the morning to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give it to you for - A. He said as a security for the money I had lent him. He never came the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he lodged with you up to that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not sleep with you that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any property or clothes at your house - A. I never saw any property that he had. On the next morning as he never came, I was rather dubious of the bill; I went to the bankers with the bill, it was not paid. The officer has the bill, he had it at the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give the bill to - A. I gave it to the officer at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after that, he did not come on the next morning - A. No, I never saw him till he came up to Queen-square; he was taken up on the 10th, I think this was the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took him the day after he gave you the bill - A. No, it was the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what you are talking of - A. On the 9th of May he gave me the bill, he said he was to come the next morning to go to the bankers; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him - A. At the Crown and Cushion, at the foot of Westminster bridge, in the afternoon of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him - A. Yes; I told him I thought he had used me very ill, and that he was my prisoner; I sent to Mr. Astley's immediately for two officers, from that he was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you lent him some triffle of money - A. Thirteen shillings altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the bill as a security with you - A. Yes, he would leave it with me for the money that he had of me.</p>

               <p>Q. to Fairfax. You said that the prisoner lodged at your house some time - A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by - A. By the name of Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what christian name he went by - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But he went by the name of Sinclair - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him write perhaps - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know his writing - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you talk with him at all when the bill was given you - A. No, no great deal; there was no conversation at all, only he said he would come in the morning, he did not wish to defraud me out of the money; nothing else, only called for a pot of ale; he said he had just received it at the pay office.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said that - A. Yes; he said he had just received it at the pay office; he did not say any more, nor did I ask him any more about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was no more conversation with him on that bill, than there would be with any other bill - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said he had just received it at the pay office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I have but lately returned to England; I have been <rs id="t18090626-35-deflabel207" type="occupation">employed in the naval service of his majesty</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18090626-35-defend426 t18090626-35-deflabel207"/>. I was coming home late to this man's house in the evening, I found the bill; I did not offer it to him in payment, I asked him to lend me a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260031"/>shillings on it; he said he was very sorry I had not asked sooner, he would have given me the full amount; I told him I only wanted a few shillings; had I known this to be a forged check; I certainly would not have tendered it to any man that knew me. In the second place, I would wish to state, since I wish to make myself the amienable victim of the laws of my country. When Mr. Fairfax came to me at the public house, I wanted then to have paid him the money; I was anxious to pay him, it was in my power but he would not accept of it. Instead of his stating what he has to your lordship, that I wanted seven or eight pounds, I asked for seven shillings, he said I might have seven or eight pounds. My lord, I have been to all parts of the world. I have been a number of years at sea; it may seem rather strange that I have not brought some person or persons to my character; at such a time as this, it is a very pleasing circumstance to have some person forward; but having been in the major part of my life at sea; I am only known by the officers, and I was about returning to my ship when I was apprehended; that ship has since sailed. Had that been in England, the officers would have come forward and have given me a character. If I had been the culprit that my prosecutor has represented me to be, I am amienable to the law. What he has stated does shew the ungenerous disposition of that man; it was over the water where he first saw me. He has stated that he first saw me in Queen-square; he first met me over the water, I was going to the theatre that night; a young man whom I did not know, asked me to go to the theatre, I agreed to go, as I was about in a few days going to return to my ship. On that evening I was going over Westminster bridge, I met a soldier, he knew Fairfax, I had seen him at his house; I asked him if he would have any thing to drink; we went into a public house, I told him my intention was to go to the theatre, that I would wait till eight o'clock to go in at half price. That man was employed by Mr. Fairfax to look after me, or I do not know why Mr. Fairfax should know I was going there; this soldier went out and brought Mr. Fairfax. When he came in he wished me good evening, I returned him the compliment, I told him I was very sorry I had promised to have called on that day to have paid him the thirteen shillings and had not, he must certainly doubt my veracity in coming to pay him; I would then pay him; as such I put my hand into my breeches pocket, took out the money to pay the debt that I owed him; he for a moment paused, and at length he said, I shall not take the money, I would rather drink your blood than have the money; I said if you must be so, and you are determined to send me to jail, this money will be of service to me, because if I pay you it will strip me of every farthing I have. My lord, I am guiltless; I am bound to plead I am guiltles from the natural impulse of my nature. I am doubly bound to plead that I am not guilty, because I am not guilty; and if I was guilty I should rather have gone to a stranger, and not to a person I knew.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you lost this saddle of mutton - A. On the 9th of this month, about three o'clock in the morning. The prisoner came and looked in Mr. Rutter's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Rutter - A. He is a wholesale butcher in <placeName id="t18090626-39-crimeloc230">Newgate-market</placeName>

He walked about a yard from the door; he turned round and went into the shop; he went of the other side of the shop, to where I was, there were three saddles of mutton hung up, he took one of the three, brought it to the window with him; and was coming out of the window the same way he went in, and as he was coming out of the window he hit his head against the rails, where the lambs hung, and dropped the saddle of mutton on the window. When he got out of the shop he made a stagger and walked away round the corner; I called him, he would not come.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he done with the saddle of mutton - A. The mutton laid on the window. I called him again; I said, George, if you go to Hell I will have you: I collared him; he said let us make it up; he offered me a seven shilling piece; I said I would not take it. I knew him before, he had worked for Cornick, in Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when he came in at the window - A. I was watching the shop; I stood behind the shop; he could not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he could not see you how came he to leave the saddle of mutton on the window - A. When he hit himself against the rail, he espied me then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to watch him - A. I had reason to watch him; he came in so soon in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no quarrel with him - A. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you not remember that Mr. Wright used to say that you lost things, and that this man was wicked enough to surmise that you had taken them - A. He has said, Sam, I have lost such things out of the shop; I said I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him to the watchhouse did you charge him with stealing a saddle of mutton - A. I gave charge of him for getting into Mr. Rutter's shop; I did not say a word about the saddle of mutton at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the mutton down - A. I did; I saw him take it off the hook.</p>

            . I am a servant to the East India company. On the 7th of June I was coming along Sun-street, I stopped to look at some second hand books; there was an elderly woman on my right hand; she was muttering he will have something soon; when I lifted up my head she spoke in a louder voice, and pointed the prisoner out to me; I kept my eye upon him till he went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the man come from - A. He was loitering about the window when she first saw him; after a little time he began to go slowly from the window; he was looking in the window; he went away as if nothing was the matter; I saw him take nothing, it appears he must have took it before. The young man came out of the shop and laid hold of him; he was willing to get back as soon as he could, as the shop was exposed to every body. I saw the prisoner drop it in the street. The prisoner went down upon his knees in the shop and prayed to God to strike him dead if he knew any thing of it.</p>

I ran out of the door and saw the prisoner wrestling with two or three men; they charged him with the robbery.

I was at work in this month, I cannot recollect the day of the month; there was an alarm that there were some lobsters taken out of the boat; I was ordered to stop the prisoner, he was coming from the King of Prussia; I stopped him, and seeing the lobster's claw through the hole of the coat; I told him that he had got something that did not belong to him; he said it was nothing to me, they did belong to him; I told him he should not have the property. I knew there were no other lobsters there but my master's. He made a great deal of altercation, said that he should keep them; he knew a great deal more about it than I did; he got on the ladder; I hove my basket of lobsters on my head and followed him; I laid hold of him at the top of the ladder, told him he should not have the property, otherwise he must go up to Mr. Creswell and explain how he came by them; he said he would do so. I went on with the load on my head, our house is No. 3, and just as I got to No. 4, somebody halloaed out he is run away. I put the basket of lobsters down in the middle of the market and pursued him into the Darkhouse, Darkhouse-lane; I there told him to give me the property and go about his business; he would not. He put the coat with the lobsters in it on the seat and set on it; he told me I should not have it. I took the coat and lobsters from him by force, told him if he followed me it should be the worse for him; however he followed me to Mr. Creswell's house; he was then given into the hands of the constable.</p>

            , one of my clerks. The prisoner slept out of my house. On the next morning I placed myself in a situation that he should not observe me where I had a full view of the counter and the till.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did the prisoner come the next morning - A. About seven o'clock. When he came in he immediately went to the till; he took a key out of his pocket and opened the till; I saw him take out some money; he then shut it. In about half a minute he came to it the second time and took some more money. I sent for an officer of Bow-street. When the officer came I charged the prisoner with having robbed me; he first denied it, but when I gave Mr. Bacon an order to search him he confessed it; he said he had robbed the till but once, and begged I would forgive him; I told him it was too late now, the law must take its course. I charged him with having robbed the till twice; he said he only opened it once; he begged pardon, said he would not do it again; he pretended to be very ill, and fainting, and very much agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you afterwards went to his lodgings - A. Yes; in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane; we took the prisoner with us; there I found a variety of articles that had come from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find among other things a picture - A. Yes; which belonged to me.</p>
               <p>- BACON. I am an officer. On the 20th of May, in the morning. I went to Mr. Akerman's, when I got there the prisoner was sent for from below. When he came up Mr. Akerman said he had lost some money, together with a key which opened Mr. Akerman's till. He begged for mercy; I took the prisoner to his lodgings; Mr. Akerman followed. In his lodgings I found these things.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did he make any application to you on the 24th of April - A. On the 24th of April he spent the evening at my house; he wanted the loan of seven shillings, he said at first; he then consulted himself, he said that was not sufficient; he applied for more, he asked me if I would give him the discount of a fifteen pound note, drawn upon Messrs. Masterman and co. He had spent his evening down stairs, it was past eleven o'clock at night. Then he produced that bill, he asked me to give him the money for it; I should be sure of getting the money for it; they were his bankers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say on whom - A. Messrs Masterman, Peters, and co. I went to my almanack, the Commercial almanack, I there proved there was such a bankers. He gave me the draft; this is the draft. I held the ink stand in my left hand when he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him sign it - A. Yes, he wrote his name on the back of it in my presence; I should never take a bill of this description without seeing a person write his name on it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have no doubt at all that this is the bill that he presented to you - A. I have no doubt of it in the least; I told him that I had paid away my money that day, as I do on a Monday; I said if he was a mind to have two pound he might have it, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260036"/>rest if he would call the next day. Indeed I had no doubt of the goodness of it. I let him have two pounds; on my keeping the bill he seemed satisfied; I told him if he would come on the next day he should have the remainder, as he was in the habit of coming mostly every day.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him have two pounds - A. I did, and he went away. I sent the bill to Messrs. Masterman's by a person of the name of Fisher; I told him to go to Masterman's, and tell them to give the money for that bill; he went and brought me a fifteen pound bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you, or did you understand from him that he was to call the next day - A. I left it to his option to call when he liked, when I had the money there it was for him. He did not call the next day; I sent after him frequently, and had heard of him; he did not come for near a month.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come - A. That I cannot be positive. He came on a Wednesday, about one o'clock, I must not be positive whether it was in May or June, I think it was in the latter end of May; thinking every thing was just I did not notice it. When he came in again I asked him why he had not called for the money of the bill; he with an oath said he did not know that he gave me the bill, having many of them in circulation about, perhaps I dreamed of it, or he had drank too much that night, and did not recollect it. Very little passed more than that; I said I had sent to him by various people; he said they had told him of it, they came to him the night before, and he had then come for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say upon a former occasion you advanced him two pounds - A. Yes, and on the Wednesday I paid him the remainder thirteen pounds in bank notes - in two bank notes.</p>

I shall make a few observations with regard to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260037"/>Wilson; I do not know what Mr. Wilson means to insinuate, that I forgot to call, or did not call upon him for a month after I tendered him the bill; I mean to say when that bill was given to him; it was given to him for him to keep it till the two pounds was paid, not to after it upon his peril. He said I have been every day at his house, I have not; he keeps an Odd-fellow's lodge; as he kept an Odd-fellow's lodge, I went there on the Monday. I am well aware of his inviduous temper; if I shall lose my life, I shall not merit it at his hands, though I shall not be the first life that he has lost. My lord, I beg pardon, I hope that you will not think that my disagreeable situation makes me have any antipathy against him as a man; no, but as a man, he ought to have said nothing more than the truth. What could he mean by saying I had more in circulation, but that it might prejudice the jury against me. I did not intend to make another observation; Mr. Mc'Inerkery made an observation, to say that I called on him in December, I beg his pardon. I was cast away with captain Bartan, in the Crescent, on the 14th of September. On the 8th of January, I was appointed gunner of the Wrangler, gun brig; I could not be there in December. With regard to Blackman, the laws of the country requires that witnesses should speak the truth; why not he speak the truth, as well as any other man. He said when he took the paper from me, I said I was afraid I should be hanged; why should I be afraid I should be hanged; when I am tried by a liberal and impartial jury. I have been ten years in the navy, and three years in the light dragoons. I have always conducted myself as a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. You received some information - A. Yes, from a woman; she said the woman that I had just served, had taken a cloak from the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

I throw myself upon you sir, and the gentleman of the jury. I am innocent.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260038"/>at the bar - A. Yes, I lodge in the same house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of April last, did he give you any animal to sell - A. Yes, two horses; I cannot tell the date of the month; it was on a Tuesday, almost three months ago; they were delivered to me at Bethnal-green; I was not in the house, the prisoner took the poney out of the public house at Bethnal-green; the gentleman's name that keeps it is Green. It was in the forenoon I took them to Mr. Dixon's in Barbican; and I received one of his son; that third horse I was stopped with.</p>
               <p>Q. You received two horses of the prisoner, and one of his son - A. Yes, this last horse, there is no owner for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the two that you received of the prisoner, that you took to Mr. Dixon's - A. I was to do nothing, but to put down my name. A boy rode them up there.</p>
               <p>Q. What boy is that - A. I do not know, some boy in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot describe these two horses by colour or any thing else - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the one that you received of the son carried to Dixon's too - A. Yes; that was the last one that I was stopped with, that happened about a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pollock. When you took the horse that the son had given you, you was stopped - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But the horse that belonged to Mr. Pierce was not that horse - A. No, it was one of the other two; they were both brought out of Mr. Green's house in Bethnal-green. I took one to Mr. Dixon's, the other horse a man rode it there; they both went in Mr. Dixon's about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were both left, one by you and one by the man the same day, are you certain of it - A. Yes; I only booked one, I know nothing about the other; I received the money for the one I had booked in my own name on the next sale day. I received two pounds one shilling; I gave the money to Mr. Thurston in Barbican; he and his son came up to me there; and Thurston went to Barbican at the time I took the horse there, and his son was with him. I received the money for another horse, not the horse that the man rode the same day, it was another about ten days afterwards; I received for that eleven pounds two shillings.</p>

On the following Saturday morning I went to No. 15, Montague-street, White Chapel, by the direction in Mr. Dixon's book; I could find no person there of the name of Harding. On Tuesday following, I attended at Mr. Dixon's repository; the woman came in, I apprehended her the moment I saw her I told her I knew the rest of the parties.

            . After we had been in the park some time, looking at some men playing at skittles, I heard a gun go off; I went up to the place from whence I thought it came; I saw the place where the ball came through the pales. I then went up to

I should get over the paling and take the gun away from her. She then asked the servant what fellow that was; the servant who was with her said she did not know; she then said she would take the liberty of firing at me; I said she might if she liked, I should not move. I did not move, she presented the gun towards me in a direct line, and snapped it three times; it did not go off; she then took the gun from off her shoulder, she had forgot to prime it; she asked the female servant for the powder horn, the servant gave it her, she poured out of the powder horn into the pan of the gun some gunpowder, and shut the pan down again.

             was at the side of me, he begged me to get behind a tree, or else she would shoot me: I got behind the tree, and after I had been there a few minutes she held the gun towards me in a direct line, I poked my head out and looked; she discharged the gun as soon as she saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. All the time you were in Kempton park - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Rolfe - A. I understand he is her uncle. I got over the poles then, we went up to her and took the gun from her; we then went to the place where the ball came through, and she followed us.</p>
               <p>Q. You went back to the place where you thought the ball had come through the paling - A. I am positive the ball came through the paling, because there was a hole in the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. That might be made before - A. I do not know; I did not see the ball come through. I told her that I should go and get a warrant: she said I might go if I liked; if she had the gun she would as leave shoot me as not; I went down to Mr. Cowey, he was not at home. On the Monday morning I came down to Bow-street to get a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gun go off when she pointed it at you when you stood behind the tree - A. Yes; it did go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the tree afterwards - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only saw her put the powder into the pan to prime it - A. There were shot in the gun; I saw her put them in; she asked her servant for the shot belt; she poured them in without measuring them. That was when I was talking to her, before the gun was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the prisoner since she has been apprehended with this warrant - A. No, none. I never saw the prisoner before nor since. (A model of the spot produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now Mr. Coombes, you are a fishmonger, are you - A. I am. My father is a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. You carry fish about to sell with a horse and cart - A. Yes; every day.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you played more than you worked - A. No, sir; I have to work to support my aged father.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were taking a walk in Kempton park - in Kempton park there is a fence like this, is there not - A. Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. That fence is five foot six, is it not - A. It is not so much. I never measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will prove that it is four foot nine inches; the close part of it, and the other railed part is five foot six - were there any trees - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up to miss York was not she in Mr. Rolfe's premises - A. Yes. I was on the other side, where there are large trees.</p>
               <p>Q. The place where you say the ball went through was three hundred feet off - A. No; I think it was about ten yards round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. I will prove that it was two hundred and forty feet off; she was on Mr. Rolfe's side of the pales, and Mr. Rolfe's servant with her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She put the powder in the gun - A. I did not see her put the powder in; I saw her put the shot in.</p>

               <p>Q. And up she put it to you - A. She said she would shoot me; I said she might if she liked.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you got behind the tree - A. Yes; after she snapped the gun three times at me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not offer to run away - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that tree from the place - A. Which I stood behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes - A. I never measured it. About three yards and a half from the pales; she was about six yards from the pales; I think I was about fifteen yards distance from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are quite sure that you saw her take a powder horn and put powder in the pan - A. I am sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as correct in that as you are in the rest of your evidence - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, the next day you went to Bow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the next morning you sent Parker to her - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you and Parker meet on Monday morning - A. Parker and I went to Bow-street together; we met at the George, public house to come together to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to Bow-street did not you send Parker to her to tell her that if she did not give you some money you would go to Bow-street - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you do not know that he went - A. No; if he went he never told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. That same evening after this was passed you got over and took the gun from her and struck her - A. No, I did not strike her; I took the gun from her, and went away with the gun to Mr. Cowey's.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the gun to the George public house and sat there drinking and smoking, and Parker with you - A. Yes; I came back and took the pale down which the ball came through and put a fresh one in its place.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the pale where you said the ball came through - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you used no bad language - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not throw something at her - A. I believe I took down a piece of the paling and threw at her; in order to prevent her from loading the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street the next day, Monday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was she taken to Bow-street - A. Tuesday morning. We were to appear afterwards on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260040"/>Q. On Friday you came to town - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I understand that something passed, you went away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you did not go before the magistrate on the Friday - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You got some money of somebody not to go - A. No, I did not; I never received a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Your companion, Parker, got none, I suppose - A. I do not know; I am sure he never received any while he was in my company.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go home - A. Through Hammersmith, and Hounslow Heath.</p>
               <p>Q. In your going home, did you quarrel about the money - A. No, we had a quarrel; I did not want any money; I did strip to fight, but not about the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray do you ever lay wagers - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much have you laid about hanging Miss York - A. I did not know that ever I laid any thing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an odd sort of an answer, I should know if I had or had not - A. I laid a wager with Mr. Harmer, the shoe maker, I have laid a pot of six-penny with him, that if Miss York was found guilty of the capital, that she would be cast for death.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, you laid a wager that if she was cast for a capital offence, she would be guilty of a capital offence - A. I laid a pot of six-penny that if she was found guilty, she would be east for death.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the interval from her loading the gun and firing it off - A. As quick as she could, after her priming of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. When she presented to you three times, how came you to stand exposed to her as you did; why did not you seek for some shelter, after she had snapped it once - A. I do not know, I was not frightened at the time particularly; I would sooner lose my life than be frightened by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it makes no difference to you, whether you are shot by a man or a woman - A. I would be sooner shot, than run away from a woman firing at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what made you run behind the tree - A. I did.</p>

            . I live at Sunbury. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Kempton Park along with the last witness - A. I was in Kempton Park at the time this transaction happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Miss York - A. Yes; when I saw her first, she was holding a gun to her shoulder; she took the gun from her shoulder afterwards; her servant maid then came up to her with something in her hand, I did not know at the time what it was; she then seemed to be priming the piece; she then put the gun to her shoulder again. I went to walk down by the side of the road, to see what the lady was at, and the piece went off; the ball came through the pales about two or three spaces before me. I then saw the ball strike the gravel road, at least the dust flew from the ball falling on the gravel road. I went up to the boys that were standing at the pales, I asked them who the lady was, they told me it was Miss York, that she was firing at them. I asked Miss York who she was firing at civily, she told me it was no business of mine; I told her she had like to have shot me on passing the road. She was loading the piece again, I saw her put the powder in; she said if I interrupted her in her private walks, she would fire at me. A great many people were coming up after the alarm of the first fire; I holloaed out for them to go back; she catched the piece up in her hand. I directly left the lady, and went behind the tree; she put the gun down again, and asked for the shot belt; upon which the maid came to her again with the shot belt; she poured the shot out of the shot belt into the muzzle of the piece; I still stood behind the tree, she seemed to be in a great passion.

             was, her servant replied that she did not know. She then said that she would take the liberty of firing at him however; he told her to fire if she liked; she took up the piece, and snapped it at him three times; the piece did not go off. She took it from her shoulder, and asked her servant for some powder. She primed the piece and put it up at him again; and levelled it at him again. I said, for God Almighty's sake Robert move, she will certainly blow your brains out; he then moved to the next tree to me; he was in a great rage on seeing the gun pointed at him; he made a bit of a move, she then presented and fired at him directly; upon that he went and got over the pales, and took the piece from her. In his getting over the pales, a piece broke off; he took it up and threw it at her. I asked him for the piece, he gave it me. I asked her why she fired the gun at people, she told me she fired the gun at him for tresspassing. I would have given the lady her piece back again, but she still threatened that she would do it again, if I gave her the piece back again; when I found her so rash, I kept the gun, and left the lady. I then went and applied to Mr. Cowey, the magistrate of Sunbury.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen her two or three times since - A. I have seen her twice at Bow-street. Mr. Saunders came to me to see about making the business up; I went to her, she asked me what I would do in it, I told her I could not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she come to you - A. At the Nag's Head, Covent-garden. We went to an inn at the top of Bow-street, by the theatre, I did not observe the sign; we went into a back room; she asked me if I would make it up, I told her she should have done that before; she said, do not tell me of before, tell me what you will do now; I said I could not give any answer at all, she must apply to Coombes, the prosecutor. Mr. Saunders called Coombes into the room; I did not hear what passed; I went and stood at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Then after you and Miss York at this house in Bow-street, could not come to any accomodation, Coombes was fetched - A. He was fetched in the room while I was there; I leaving the room while he and Mr. Saunders was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When this happened, were you walking with Coombes - A. No, I was not; I was on Mr. Hill's side, where the trees were; she was putting the shot in before Coombes came up.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a carpenter, you can pretty well tell me what is the height of this paling - A. About four feet five inches from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the dimension of the trees, are they not three feet diameter - A. I cannot say; they are large trees, large enough to protect a man of the size of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260041"/>Coombes, if he stook behind it. She was about twelve yards from the paling, and Coombes three yards from the paling on the other side; the shot went above a man's height to a tree, it may be forty yards off. I had the bows that were shot off in my hand, the people were there and saw them fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect pointing out to Mr. Rolfe, the tree were Coombes stood - A. I did; I have examined it since, not with Mr. Rolfe; I did not see any shot in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the paling - A. I did, with Mr. Rolfe. I found no shot in that part of the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this young lady say that she would not have fired if it had not been for his expressions - do you recollect Coombes calling her any bad names - A. Certainly there were such things passed, that was after the piece was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there on the Monday morning to Mr. Rolfe's house - A. I did; I saw

Miss York asked me what I wanted, I told her I understood from her servant, that she accused me last night of robbing her fish pond; she begged my pardon, and said if I was not the person she was very sorry for it. I went to her to take the piece, thinking it was a rash action; thinking she would take the piece, and think no more of it. I told her that Coombes had taken a chaise to come to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, and unless they would give a sum of money, he would come to London - A. No; I went to Bow-street; I told Coombes on the road that I had seen Miss York.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went on Friday, were you examined on the Friday - A. We went to Bow-street on the Friday; I was not examined, Mr. Saunders sent a person to baulk us. I will swear that I took no money at the time, nor no other time; the money was sent to my wife; I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you receive a sum of fifteen 
pounds - A. I did not; I refused a note.</p>


               <p>Q. You and Coombes did not go before the magistrate that day - A. I did not go because of this business, I would not agree with what they would give us. Mr. Saunders wanted to give a draft upon Mr. Rolfe, to pay our expences; our expences were calculated by a person that pretended to be a friend, and who was not a friend.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who stood upon the highest ground when this piece was fired off - A: Coombes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the tree that was struck was forty yards off you - A. I think it was, I did not see the shot strike it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish where the tree had been hit, supposing it to be hit by the shot - A. Sixteen or eighteen feet up the tree. The tree stood upon rather higher ground than where Coombes stood.</p>

            . I live at Sunbury. I was in Kempton Park at the time this happened; the first that I saw was the report of a gun; I ran up and saw Miss York, with the gun in her hand; Coombes asked her if she was going to fire again, she said she should take the liberty of firing at him if he insulted her; several words passed; she loaded the gun, Coombes made his escape behind the tree; she put the gun up to her shoulder, it would not go off; she put it down by her side, whether she primed it or no, I do not know; Coombes looked from behind the tree, she fired at him. He went to jump over the pales, it came down. Coombes took the gun from her.</p>

            . Q. Were you in Kempton-park on this day - A. Yes; I heard the report of a gun. I stood my ground till I heard the report of a second gun; I ran up, I saw Coombes pull part of a paling off, and threw it at Miss York. I was about an hundred and fifty yards off; he and Parker jumped over and took the gun from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home with Coombes and Parker from London - A. I did; on the Friday. Coombes stripped to fight; I saw him strike Parker; they both accused each other of having sworn falsely. Their conversation was, there were ten pounds given to Parker's wife, and Coombes wanted half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not point the gun at Coombes, nor did I intend to hurt them; they had used very gross and insulting language to me; I did it with intent to frighten them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being out with her on Sunday the 14th of May, the evening of the firing - A. I was out with her on the Sunday, but I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the firing of the gun the first time, had she any powder and shot - A. No, she asked me, I fetched it; the shot was in a belt; I brought the powder out in a bit of paper. She put the powder in the gun with her fingers, and she poured the shot out of the belt. I never saw her put any paper in, nor did I see her use the ram rod to ram it down. Coombes popped out from the tree, and said she could not fire, it had nothing in it; she said if he would stand she would show him; she pointed towards the tree; I was a little distance of one side, I could not see so well as though I had been level with her. I saw Coombes getting over, I went away then.</p>
               <p>MR. ROLFE. Q. You are uncle to the young lady at the bar - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the height of the lower close paling - A. Four feet nine, and the upper part, including the rail, is five foot six; the beech trees are three feet six, and some of them four feet in diameter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the distance between the trees - A. Thirty-three feet; the branches very near meet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, with Parker, examines the pales - A. I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260042"/>Q. Did Parker point out the spot to you - A. He did. I examined the two trees, I examined the tree that Coombes stood behind; I found no shot marks in the trees nor in the pales.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was any trees shewn you beyond where they stood that received the shot - A. No; nor is there any tree near that any shot could have reached.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that by Parker or any body else at the time when they were examined before this day - A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. ROLFE, JUNIOR. I do not think there is any tree near this part, less than an hundred and fifty yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner rent the whole house - A. So she informed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you searched her house - A. The 13th of June, about two o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the husband at home at that time - A. I saw a man there at dinner, I asked her if that was her husband, she said no, her husband had gone in the country to work at the harvest, he was a labouring man; she told me this person I saw there was a lodger, in the man's hearing; the man said he was a lodger, he worked for a stationer. On the right hand side of her kitchen I found the plates that are stated in the indictment; I took down twenty six plates with the name of Hale and co. stamped on the back of them, we have them manufactured for us. In that room we found some butter boats, they are marked; under the bedstead, in this room, the kitchen, was an old drawer containing a number of knives and forks, they are marked as before; and up stairs we found in a box that was broken a parcel of our knives and forks; the decanters and glasses were found in the kitchen; I asked her how she came by these things; she told me she purchased them when she took the house and furniture; she said she could not exactly recollect the person's name; she had the house about twelve months, and that she had given twenty two pounds for them things.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the worth of the things that were marked with your name that you could swear to - A. Rather think the knives and forks cost two guineas a dozen, the plates about five shillings a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this woman been in the habit of coming backwards to your house - A. About five months; she has been in the habit of coming for the servants clothes.</p>

            . I live in Bowling-alley, White-cross-street; I am a married woman, my husband is a sailor; before this woman came into the house I was a lodger of the man and his wife that she took the house on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you lodged there - A. Six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that kept the house when you lived there - A. One Collins.</p>
               <p>Q. Not Holland - A. It was Collins; he was a labouring man; the prisoner was a sober, honest woman, and always bore a responsible good character. When she took this house she bought every thing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260043"/>was in the house, and some of these things were in the house when she took it; the plates and glasses, I have seen a great many of them there, they were a kind of china plates. She paid twenty two pounds for the beds and all the things that were in the house. I lodged there six months when Collins kept it; I have left it about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes a twelve month altogether - did you ever go with this woman to the London tavern - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Collins do any thing at the London tavern - A. His wife had washing from some tavern, I never enquired into what tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. How many plates were there with Hale and co. on them - A. Not above half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there particular that should draw your attention to the name being on the plates - A. Why I was looking at them one day I came down there; I asked her what these plates were a piece; Mrs. Murphy said she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days was that before you went away - A. I went away that Friday night that Christmas was; this was on Thursday, the day before I left the house; it was that I remarked the plates, I had seen these blue ones when Collins lived in the house; it must be upwards of a twelvemonth ago when I saw them in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Collins and you intimate - A. No; I had no dealings with him, no further than going through up into my own apartment; I never visited her, nor dined with her, nor drank tea with her.</p>
               <p>Q. It was rather taking a liberty, you taking these plates down - A. I did not take them down. I saw them on the mantle piece; they were facing of me just as I went in the door; the front of the plates were towards me.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you saw the name of Hale and co. upon the fronts - A. Yes, I did; the letters were large enough for any one to read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let me see one of the plates, were they coloured letters or plain - A. They were coloured letters.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tipper. Are there any such plates there - A. No; we found no plates with coloured letters in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Traile. When was you called upon to give evidence upon this occasion - A. Mrs. Murphy sent for me this morning. And what I saw in the house, I speak to no more. The plates were larger than them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these plates and tell me whether there are any with coloured letters - A. No.</p>

She had lived with me about eight or ten months; she had got into another service, she lived at the White Horse, Fetter-lane. I took with me Bray, Tipper, and Sherrin, I went to search a house, No. 13, Bowling-alley, next door to the other house, we found none of my property there.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you this property safe about you - A. I know it was safe about me at the moment of my partly undressing myself, and going into bed in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. That is a point that no man says he is drunk, you know; I believe I was sober, from my recollection of every circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you begin to spend your evening, and where was it - A. I spent my evening with a friend, at the Coach and Horses, opposite of Southampton-street, in Holborn.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were you employed by to work at that time - A. By the London water work company; I had been there merely iniating a young gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out that evening - A. I believe about the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from between the middle of the day, and eleven o'clock at night - A. I had been over the water on different business till nine o'clock, it was near ten I think; then I went to Mr. Hobson's in Bloomsbury-place; I drank beer there, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. At eleven o'clock you went to the Coach and Horses - who was this friend of yours - A. Mr. Walker, the printer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. I rather think he is gone out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been drinking from eleven till two - A. Beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in Marchmont-place - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Dyot-street was not in your way home - A. No. Persons often wals this way or that way, without any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260045"/>specific reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not drunk - A. I do not feel that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you were you not drunk - A. I do not think that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get to Dyot-street, and when did you get there - A. I got to Dyot-street partly by being accosted by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was two o'clock when you arrived at this house in Dyot-street - what time did you leave this public house - A. I judge from the period of time that had elapsed, from my leaving that house; I judged the prisoner being with me could not be more than an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you look at your watch - A. I did not upon that occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner - A. In Holborn, I do not recollect the spot; she accosted me, the tenor of which was to go home; I refused. Her manners were civilised; in her appearance she was different from that sort of persons about the street; she continued to solicit in a manner that excited my curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect you are upon your oath - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did your curiosity lead you up into a garret in Dyot-street - A. Yes, I went up into a terrible place.</p>
               <p>Q. So then if this was a terrible place, you were determined to undress yourself - A. Yes; in part it was my curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that you undressed yourself in part from a motive of curiosity - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. No mortal being can believe that which you have sworn to - that a man goes into a terrible place with a common prostitute, and proceeds to undress himself out of curiosity, that you have sworn, and therefore you are totally unworthy of belief - did you get into bed, sir - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that out of curiosity - A. That was part of the thing that was in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Wicked enough! And you went into bed with a common prostitute, out of curiosity - A. Not with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you undressed yourself, got into bed in a most terrible place, along with a common prostitute - did you go to bed out of curiosity - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say you had about you when you went into this room - A. I had my watch, and its appurtenances.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it gold or silver - A. Gold; a gold chain, seal, and key; seven one pound notes, and eight or nine shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in this room - A. It must be a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman undressed - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You undressed and got into bed there - A. There was more than one bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other respectable lodger of that house in the bed - A. I saw no other person there.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, you got into bed, where did you put the watch - A. I put the chain into the fob pocket; the woman took my breeches and put it under my head; that is to say where I was to lay my head. I never solicited for her to come to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to bed there for - A, Curiosity,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman stay with you - A. She staid a very short period.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when she left you - A. The act of plunder took place; then previous to her leaving the room, she made a small stir, passed towards the door, and went out; the instant she was gone, I started up, and put my left hand under my head for my clothes, they were gone. I immediately passed into the street with my drawers and under stockings on; I saw one of the patrols. I told him I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you sober enough to know that was the woman that was with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the room - A. There was a glimmer, a poor kind of light from a candle, during part of the time; the candle was withdrawn when she left the room.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards was the woman laid hold of - A. Almost instantaneously.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch found - A. It was found; I have seen it since. I went back and found my clothes scattered about the room.</p>

            . I am patrol in the parish of Bloomsbury. I know the prisoner, she lives in Phoenix-yard, Dyot-street. About three in the morning I saw the prosecutor in the street, in his night-cap.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How came you with a night-cap, did you take the night-cap in your pocket - A. I found it in the place, it was furnished by the establishment.</p>
               <p>Brewer. I found him in the street, in his night cap and drawers; he appeared to me has if he had been drinking. There was another patrol standing at the gate when he came out; he asked him if had seen a woman come by, he had been robbed of his breeches. I apprehended the woman immediately; she was within sight of him all the time. When I laid hold of her, I found the gold watch, seal, key, and chain, in her right hand; and nine shillings in her other hand. I took her to the other patrol; he found five one pound notes, and I afterwards found this old purse, and two one pound notes. The prisoner said she picked this gentleman up, that he said he was short of money, he could not afford to give her any more than a shilling; he was to pay for the use of the bed; he gave her the property for fear of being robbed; and when he got up in the morning, she was to give it him. She was going to get some gin.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met this gentleman at the corner of Plumb-tree-street, Bloomsbury, he told me if I would take him to any place, he would pay my lodging; we went to No. 14, Dyot-street, they had no beds; from there we went to Church-lane, they were shut up; we went to Phoenix-yard, there we got a bed; he began to pull off his things; I said, you had better not pull off your clothes, he said he had some property about him, he would trust me with it; he gave me seven one pound notes, and the watch; he went to sleep, and when he awoke he was thirsty; he asked me to get something to drink, I told him I thought there were no houses open; I went to Church-lane to see if the house was open; the gentleman ran down and said I had robbed him; the patrol asked me what I had robbed him off, I said nothing but what the gentleman had given me; I gave them up immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any cloak being in that box - A. I put the cloak in the box myself that morning; one was a tabbinett cloak, and the other was a black gauze. There was eighteen yards of lace on the tabbinett cloak, I paid six guineas and a half for it, I only wore it a few times. At six o'clock on the same day I went to the box for my cloak, I found they were both gone; I never saw the cloaks afterwards; I got a part of the lace from a person at Poplar.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he come - A. Between the hours of five and six; I was not there when he came; I saw him there about nine o'clock, when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the lodging - A. My wife gave him no final answer till I came home; he said he had come from a long voyage. He was to bring his things from out of the dock.</p>
               <p>Q. He proposed to lodge with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he propose to go up to any room for his lodging - A. No; for the first night, as there was no room up stairs, he slept in the kitchen, down stairs, for that night only, as there was no bed ready.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. Before four o'clock. I perceived the door open from between the curtains at the bed foot; then I got up: I said to my wife, both the doors are open; I went and shut the door, I looked in the bed where he slept; I found he had left the bed, and his shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bed shew that somebody had slept in it that night - A. Yes; it laid open, and he was gone, and his old shoes and stockings lay on the floor by the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he brought any of his things with him at the time that he took possession - A. No. He accosted a porter, he told him he would give him five shillings to bring his things the next morning. He had nothing with him but what he had on him. When I found he was gone I took hold of my breeches which I had left on the table, I found my watch was gone, and my hat from off the same table; my wife got out of bed and missed the pile of clean linen that had been ironed on that day, they were on a table in the kitchen, where he slept, and the shoes and two waistcoats, a pocket handkerchief, and neckcloth; they were clean and ironed; also there was a bundle in a handkerchief that belonged to an Italian, that handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been delivered by the Italian to your wife to wash - A. Yes; in the afternoon of the over day, when he came. Among the other things which were in the kitchen four of my shirts lay there, and several other things besides; the rest belonged to other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260047"/>people; the two waistcoats and the shoes belonged to a lodger in the house, I was accountable for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any shoes - A. One pair which hung on a nail, close by where he slept, and the silk hat was on the top of my clothes, the first thing by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your watch - A. The watch cost seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. To you - A. Not to me; it cost me five.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the house secured when you went to bed - A. The door was locked; I locked the door, and took the key out of the back door that he passed through, and it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the rest of the house with respect to the fastenings - A. There were no fastenings on the glass door, between the kitchen and the parlour; the outer doors were both locked; the front door was locked and barred; by that reason I suppose he went out of of the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any fastenings broken - A. No. The first thing I did I applied the key to the lock; the key traversed the lock the same as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. When you locked the door the night before are you sure that you applied the bolt - A. I locked the door as I did nights before, as I always do, and took the key out, and then the bolts went in easy; I hung the key up in its place on the mantle shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the prisoner any where in the house - A. No; he was gone. The rest of the lodgers were within. I enquired after him at the Kettle Drum, in Ratcliffe Highway, there I heard his character in full length.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with him there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to hear his character - A. About seven o'clock in the morning I heard of his being seen in Tooley-street with two white bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him yourself - A. No; I had been after him every day. On the Saturday following, about nine o'clock at night, I met him by Salt-petre-bank, in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the robbery on - A. The Wednesday morning I missed him; this was Saturday evening, June the 3d, I met him in Rosemary-lane; I knew him; he passed by; I turned round and he turned round, he crossed the lane three time, I following of him, that I might be sure he was the same man; he had the same hand in his pocket: I saw my hat on his head; he made a stand by a public house door, I came up to him, spoke to him, and collared him, and took my hat from off his head; he said he would go along with me any where, where I pleased very well, said I, step into here; he went into the public house, the first man I saw there was Densy, I asked his assistance; he knew I had been robbed; I asked him to go for an officer for me, he told me, no. Upon that the prisoner got obstreperous, Densy said let him go, and get a proper officer and take him. Between the prisoner and the landlord of the house I was turned out of the house, he bit me here in the hand, here is the incision of his teeth now in my hand; by him and by the mob I was like to be torn in pieces; in the hustle I lost the hat off my head, but kept hold of the hat I took off the prisoner's head. He made his escape from me then; the next morning I called at Mr. Buston's to know whether I could get any account of my hat; I got no information; he said he would charge me with an officer for disturbing his house. I called again in the afternoon, the landlord very politely gave me the hat out of a closet by the bar. On the 8th of June, in the morning, I got fresh scent of the prisoner; he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the prisoner at the bar is the same man that came to lodge with you, and served you so as you have stated - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of the linen - A. No; he had one of the shirts on on Saturday; as I had hold of him by the collar, the shirt was open behind in the collar, and he had on a pair of grey stockings when I had him in my possession until he was rescued from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them stockings - A. I had not much time to observe them, I was all in a hurly burley; I got my leg cut in two places.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOX. Q. You are the beadle of St. George's, you are the person that apprehended the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes; on Thursday the 8th of June I received the silk hat from Mr. Hollywood; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at this hat - A. I know it to be my hat, it always pinched me when I put it on; it is too little, there is the maker's name in the hat; I mentioned the maker's name before I examined the hat; in the felling of the lining there was a knot, I cut that knot off that it should not hurt me; here is the end of the thread where it has been cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime; I know nothing of the hat. This man took another black man one night. He took me up in Carey-street, Ratcliffe; I was charged with the robbery; I would not go to the office with the officer because I did not know what I had done.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you take up any other black man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take up any other man upon that charge - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you part of a diamond bandeau - A. It has been delivered; I marked it before I delivered it. The lady has got it, she is in Scotland. At the time it was delivered to Cathery's master; this young man was not taken up at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. However you had a part of a diamond bandeau brought to you - A. Yes; it was offered on the 29th of May, by a servant of a lady of the name of Berresford. I know her to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of a bandeau was it - A. One entire link; consisting of twenty five stones, there might be more; I lent him five pounds upon it. She said it belonged to a gentleman of the name of Hazelhurst, I gave a duplicate; that was on the 29th, in the morning. Marsden brought the ticket the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Marsden before - A. I had seen him in that neighbourhood before, I did not know him by name; he acknowledged that the woman pledged it with his consent; he said he would wish to prevent them from getting it out, he would have two pounds more on it. He brought the duplicate and had two pounds more on it; and had the duplicate in the name he gave me, Hazelhurst, not in his own name. I gave him the other two pounds. We received the duplicate the next day of the master of this young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the young man present - A. I believe he was; I delivered up the link the next day to Cathery's master.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that the link was worth more than seven pounds, as you lent that upon it - A. It was worth three or four and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. On the Friday following he was apprehended, at No. 8, Suffolk-street, nothing was found upon him; he is the same man. He and the woman that sent it in the first instance; Mrs. Berresford and he were found together.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Berresford you knew - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She pledged at your house, and you knew the person that pledged it for her - A. Yes; because I was in the habit of taking things in pledge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when the duplicate was found - A. I believe it was sent to Cathery.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Were you present at Mr. Dobree's, the pawnbroker, and saw the same link - A. Yes; I went with my master; I saw it in my master's hands. I was in the shop, when it was given up to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. to Farrer. Do you recollect whether you produced that link to his master - A. I saw it produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that is the same link, that was produced to his master, that was received from Berresford's servant, and afterwards was claimed by the prisoner - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And that young man was in the shop at the time his master had it - A. Yes; I was present. I am sure that is the same we received from Berresford's servant; and afterwards was claimed by the prisoner. We had but that one pattern in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Did your master take with him a duplicate at the time you went to the pawnbroker's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, where he got that duplicate - A. Yes; it was sent home to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought it home to you - A. No, I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first information you received where it was - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see your master looking at the link, at the time you were in the pawnbroker's shop - A. I saw him look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not this property produced - A. It is returned to the owner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have they applied for it - A. Yes, my master has applied for it, he cannot get it; my master told me he had applied.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take this - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you say was the first time you missed it after I was gone - A. About half an hour; I believe it was nine o'clock.</p>


               <p>Q. What time did I call upon you - A. About eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. I called upon you at eleven o'clock in the morning; I drank some ale with you, and then went away - A. You did call at eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out with you, and had some ale, and afterwards you went away.</p>


               <p>COURT. Did he come to you again in the course of the day - A. Yes; about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that link of the bandeau after he called upon you in the morning - A. It was a link that I was not at work at.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it in your possession - A. I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your lodgings - A. Yes; I saw it on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had seen it in the morning, after the time that you went out to drink with the prisoner - A. I cannot say, now.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw it that Sunday morning at all - A. Yes, it lay on my work board.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect whether you saw it on the work board, after coming home from going out with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body called on you afterwards in your room that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come with him in the morning at eleven o'clock, when he came and asked you to go out and drink with him - A. Yes; it was the same person that called with him in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether any body else had called after you came home, till eight in the evening - A. No, nobody else, while I was at home.</p>

               <p>Q. But you had been out, had you not, who did you leave in the room - A. Nobody; I left my room door locked, and the key in the door; when I came back I found the key in the door, and the door locked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who did you first issue out this warrant against - A. I had it for you, and that other young man; I do not know his name, nor nobody else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in a course of intimacy with Cathery for seven or eight months back; I was unfortunately arrested for debt, he came to see me in Newgate; he gave me an invitation to come to his place when I came out, if I had no other place to go to; I told him I should be out on Friday, I wanted some money to supercede my action; he sent me one pound ten shillings. I went to live in Vinegar-yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260049"/>at the back of Astley's theatre. On Sunday morning I called upon him, I told him I wanted some money, to go and see my friends; he lent me some shillings; I called again in the evening, he told me that he had no money by him, he would call upon me in half an hour, tell him any place I would meet him; I told him I should be in Vinegar-yard; he there came to me, told me he had no money; he lent me the diamond bandeau. I was to bring it him on Tuesday morning; he called on me on Tuesday, he asked me whether I could take it out, I said no; he said I must send him the duplicate, he must take it out. I sent it to him in a two-penny post letter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Did you know this prisoner any time - A. Yes; I have known him about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lent him any money - A. Yes, I have often lent him money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he asked you to lend him any money about this time - A. He asked me to lend him some on Sunday morning, at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lent him any - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he want you to lend him some more money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more money to lend him, if he had wanted it - A. No; only a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, mind you are upon your oath - did you give him the link of this bandeau, for the purpose of him raising some money upon it; and that afterwards he should return it to you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. For him to pledge it, and to take it out in the course of a day or two, if it should be wanted - you are upon your oath. - Are you certain that you never lent him that link of a bandeau, to go and raise money upon it - A. I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to him to a house in Vinegar-yard at the back of the play-house - A. Yes; I went after him there, after I missed it. I found him there after I missed the link. I asked him if he had the link, he said he had not; and if I would go home, he said I should find it on my board. I went home; I looked for it. I could not find it. On Monday evening I received the duplicate, it was enclosed in a letter; I have the letter here; there was nothing written in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He offered before the magistrate, that if I would pay the expences, he would let me off.</p>
               <p>Cathery. I said if I had my property, it was all I wanted of his friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is Mr. Johnson that heard the same.</p>

            . I formerly was clerk to Messrs. Bennett and Greaves. I have chambers at present at Staple's Inn. I am assisting a friend of mine, who is an attorney.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner - A. I have seen him while he was a debtor in Newgate; I was requested to attend before the magistrate at Marlborough-street, by some friend of the prisoner's; I attended there, that if I could assist the prisoner, I would. I heard the prosecutor say there, that he did not wish to prosecute if he could have his expences paid, that he had been put to; and the expences of the office. In fact, I saw the prosecutor yesterday; I asked him if he was of the same opinion to let the prisoner off, if it was possible, he said yes, if he had the money, he did not wish to prosecute; a bill of exchange of ten pound, to pay the expences, and the taking out the diamond bandeau, is put in some person's hand to know the event of the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Has a bill been put into your hands in order to pay the expences - A. There is a bill, it was given to Mr. Magnes, a surgeon; that if the prisoner was acquitted, I was to be paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed to give such a bill - A. The prisoner's friends. I always said that if I had my property, I did not wish to hurt him.</p>

Taylor went out, and sent the prisoner with the books; he had twenty one tied up in a handkerchief, and one Taylor brought is twenty two. The prisoner pulled this bit of paper out of his pocket, and said this will show how many there is; I told him the paper did not tell the number of them, it only mentioned what they are. On the paper was Whitfield's life, in boards, three shillings; he asked a pound for them. I kept the label and the books, they have been in my possession ever since.

We had something to drink at the White Hart, the corner of Well-street; he put the question to me - did I know any body that I could sell them to; I told him I did not know, I would go and see; I took them to a person facing of Mr. Mercury, he went over with one book to him, he came back and said he could do nothing with them; I went over to him, he took me up.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Mary-le-bone parish.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 13th of May, between two and three o'clock, you went your round in Durweston-street; Mr. Sitwell's house is No. 12 - A. Yes; it was exactly twenty minutes after two when I heard the crush.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in Durweston-street, you heard a crush - A. Yes; I thought the carriage steps were let down suddenly. When I was coming nigh the door, I saw the tall man, White; I was about eight or nine yards off; I saw him come from Mr. Sitwell's door, he was just off the door, getting on the foot path; I told him to stop, I said, my friend, I see what you have been about. As soon as I spoke, he ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is Clay-street - A. Opposite of Mr. Sitwell's house; he went into Clay-street,</p>
               <p>Q. Dorset-street is at the end of Clay-street - A. Exactly; it runs parallel with Durweston-street; he turned out of Clay-street, into Dorset-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into Baker-street from Dorset-street-A. He did; from Baker-street into Blandford-street; he went down Kendall-mews, and turned into George-street. I saw him apprehended by another watchman, at the end of George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from you during this period - A. About thirty yards; till he got to Kendall-mews, there I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all, from the time he left Mr. Sitwell's door, to Kendall-mews - A. I lost sight of him when he turned the corner, when he got into Kendall-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was running down Baker-street, before he arrived at Blandford-street, did any thing occur - A. The street was silent; I saw nobody in the street but him and me; when he turned out of Clay-street into Dorset-street, I heard something fall; it had a hollow sound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear any thing else - A. No, that was the only noise that caused my attention, till he was taken into custody at the end of George-street, when he was apprehended. I took him back again to Mr. Sitwell's house; I went up to the very same door and took him in.</p>
               <p>Q. On your road to the prosecutor's house, did you find any thing - A. Not at that time; in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I went back the same way that I ran after him. I found a knife in Baker-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the line that you followed him - A. Yes, as near as I could judge. That is the knife, there is White upon it; I picked up the dark lanthorn, I opened it in his presence; there was a wax candle in it, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was White - A. I am positive of it; he had a long body coat on, I took him for a coachman when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. At the instant when you came up to him, did you recognize him, or had you any doubt - A. I told them it was the same man that came out of No. 12 or 13, I could not say which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was it a light or a dark night - A. Dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the lace of the person, I take it for granted - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turnings might there be before you saw him apprehended by another person - A. Five turnings.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you did see him, he had been apprehended before you came up to him - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called to by the watchman to see him after he had taken him - A. Yes; he told me he had taken him.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came up, you said he was the person - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing particular about him then, excepting he had on a loose long coat, like a coachman - what sort of a coach was it - A. It was a long body coat.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see the colour of his coat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have produced a knife - did you take any notice of the name on it - A. I did not look to see if there was any name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the officer this knife in his possession - A. From the Tuesday till the Monday. I am positive it is the knife.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there the same appearance of writing upon it when you found it, as there was when Foy produced it - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say it was a dark night - A. Quite dark at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw him before you came up to the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance - A. About ten or twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the night so dark that you could but just see him - A. It was just break of day, but it was so dark I could not see the colour of his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you see it was the same man - was it from the observation of his person or his face - A. His face I could not see, nor the colour of his coat I could not see.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of his running, could you distinguish him while he was running by the length of his coat - A. Nothing else.</p>

I went into Kendall-mews, the man got into Kendall-mews, out of Blandford-street. I followed him through the mews, and when he got out of the mews, he turned into George-street, he turned to the left; I lost sight of him for the length of time he might have got across the street; I perceived him that instant I got out of the mews; another watchman who stood in the middle of the street, cried out, I have got him; I came and assisted him; his name is Jeffreys.

               <p>Q. In consequence of the discovery having been made of this transaction did you go with that crow, and when, to Mr. Sitwell's house - A. I went on the same day that the people brought the crow to our office, about five or or six o'clock in the evening, I took the crow along with me, when I went I found a hole had been bored under the lock large enough to admit the arm of any man. it appeared to have been made with a center bit, so that any person putting his arm in could either unlock the door or turn a small chain off, and likewise unbolt the bottom bolt; it appeared by several marks that were made at the top bolt, that they had been trying to force that bolt back, to which marks I fitted this crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that crow perfect at the end - A. There is a piece out of the end of it, and it exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say it must be a large center bit - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. to Waugh. Did you look at the door at all - A. I saw a place was cut out, and I saw the top bolt had been forced.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you fastened the door that night, was it locked, and the chain put up - A. Yes; and the top and the bottom bolts were bolted.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, impressed with deep respect to this honourable court and jury, before whom I am tried; I accepted of his majesty's most gracious pardon in admitting me to go for a soldier. I do solemnly declare that had I been dealt with in that kind of way which I was at first, I never should have thought of returning until my time was out. When I consented to go for a soldier I understood it to be for seven years; when I came to the prison ship of the Isle of Wight I was told that I was to be a soldier for life; I had no idea that his Majesty exercised his prerogative to make me a soldier for life. I never was sworn in for a soldier, that part was omitted in my case, and is with most unfortunate men in my situation. Finding I was to be a soldier for life I resolved upon coming to London again; I was not taken in any felonious act, nor did I intend to shun the laws of my country. If unfortunate transports are to be made soldiers for life, why are they not told that they are to be soldiers for life. I humbly implore the mercy and tenderness of the court in my favour, that if I am sent for a soldier, to have no longer period to serve than I was led to believe at first, and I will ever pray,

On the next day, after I had seen him in the bed room, he came down in the kitchen when I was there, he had a bundle in a handkerchief; he said he had done his work in the sugar-house; I told him to leave his bundle and come with me, I would show him something he had not done; he would not put the bundle down, I took the bundle from him, I opened it, it contained a dirty shirt, and sugar wrapped up inside of it; he said he meaned to use it with his tea; the foreman told him he was allowed sugar as well as the other men, he had no occasion to take it. We never use that sugar, we always use the best sugar. I delivered the sugar to Mr. Wiedner, the foreman.</p>

The king's Arms is not in the city. He then took the bag of canary seed out of the corner, put it on the table, tied the mouth up afresh, took it on his back, and went out; I followed him into Long-lane, that is in the city; he went into Davis's, a little seed shop, he pitched the bag among others on the left hand side of the shop; I was looking through the window; he talked with Davis about three minutes, he came out in the street, I took him in custody, and took him into Davis's shop again; I said where did you come from with this; Davis was then in the shop, behind the counter; he said I live with Mr. Reynolds, I was to bring it here; I told him that was wrong, he had robbed his master of it, and I should take him to the Compter; he then begged his master to be sent for, upon which I sent for Mr. Reynolds. When Mr. Reynolds came, he said. I have found you out at last, you have been robbing me for nigh ten years; he said it was the first time; consider me and my family master. I delivered the seed to Eldridge.</p>

On Sunday, the 28th of May, in consequence of information; I went to the King's Arms public house, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260054"/>Cartwright has spoken of, I saw this bag of canary seed; I examined the bag, and the seed; the bag belongs to Mr.

             a lighterman, who had left it in my house with a quantity of malt, about three weeks ago. I afterwards looked in my house and found this individual bag missing. I have examined the canary seed, I have no doubt it is mine. I saw the prisoner in custody in Davis's house; I said I have got you at last, I have been looking for you a great while; he begged I would forgive him; he could not conceive what possessed him to do it; it was the first time, and if I would permit him to take the seed back, I should not be the poorer; he would never do the like again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This person has been a soldier a long time, he has been serving abroad, he has a wife and children, you did not prosecute Davis - A. No, the magistrate discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had better made this man a witness against Davis, and prosecuted him - A. That was what I meaned to do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

In the afternoon he came again; he then told me he wanted to go to Moorfields, to purchase a box to put a hat in; I told him I thought we had a box to suit him; I asked him three shillings for it, he said he liked it very well, he would go and see whether his hat was done at Mr. Hudson's; he asked me if I could give him some tea; he said he could not get change for a pound note without taking so many halfpence; he told me to bring the box down; I told him he need not fear, the box would suit his hat. He sent me up stairs to get the box, when I came down he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. The room which you left him in, was it the bottom part of the house - A. No, the one pair of stairs; I left him in my room, when I went up to get this box which he said he would buy of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a watch there - A. Yes, I had observed it when I went up stairs, it was hanging in a buffet; I looked at it, it was exactly half after three. When I came down in the room, I said there is the box; I turned my head, and found the prisoner was gone. I looked in the buffet, and the watch was gone. The watch has never been found. I never saw the prisoner again till he was taken up. It was a silver watch, my husband had it about fourteen years. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

On June the Ist, in consequence suspicion, I called the prisoner into my parlour; I told her I was convinced that I had a thief in the house, she must be searched; she said she had no objection; she turned out her pockets, and the other servant did so likewise; nothing was found in their pockets; I told them I must search their boxes. We went up stairs, the prisoner turned out the things that were in her box, on the bed; the articles that I indicted her for. When she took them out, I asked her whose property they were; she then pleaded for mercy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted, you did not take her without a character - A. We received a good character with her, she tells me she has three children.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Hatfield-street, Black-friers-road. On Monday the 26th of June, about halfpast eleven at night, I came from a benefit society, held at the Goose and Grid-iron, St. Paul's-church-yard; I was in company with Robert Lilly. At the corner of Creed-lane I was accosted by this woman, and

             was accosted by two others. The first question they asked, was whether we would give them something to drink; we asked them where, they said down the lane; pointing down <placeName id="t18090626-63-crimeloc370">Creed-lane</placeName>

We had not gone above half a dozen steps down the lane, nor I had not been more than two minutes in their company, before I felt a hand in my breeches pocket. I felt her hand, I supposed come out of my breeches pocket, which induced me to put my hand in immediately, where I keep my money. I found it was gone, and my pocket unbuttoned. Before I was accosted by these women, my money was safe, and my pocket buttoned. I found all my money was gone, except one piece, which from the smoothness of it, I supposed was a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other women near you at the time - A.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260055"/>They were; I suppose about four yards across the road, not within the reach of me with the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you when you went into the Goose and Grid-iron - A. I had seven pounds twelve shillings and six-pence; but there I paid twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it made up - A. A five pound note, two guineas, a seven shilling piece, and two or three shillings and six-pences. I paid away a guinea, and a seven shilling piece; I had the change out of the seven shilling piece. Upon my finding the money was gone out of my pocket, I accused her of robbing me, and instantly seized her hand; in which she had got the property; she not having time to convey it away. I found it was in her hand; I asked her whether she was not ashamed of herself, she said she was exceeding sorry, she did not know it; she turned it out into my hand, I said I would charge the watch with her, to see whether I had got all my money; I called my friend, who was about four yards off; I told him I had been robbed by this woman, he advised me to call the watch; I called the watch. The constable has the five pound note; the other money I have made use of.</p>

            . I live at 34, Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. I am in the service of Mr. Dawson, ship broker, Tower Hill. On the 1st of June, about half past eleven at night, I was going to Mr. Dawson's, to see if a box of linen had come there that afternoon. I was three parts down the Minories, between George-street and the Crescent.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had this money about you in the <placeName id="t18090626-64-crimeloc376">Minories</placeName>

I was at that moment putting the half crown out of my right hand pocket into my left pocket; I felt the money in my pocket. The prisoner accosted me at the time I was putting the money in my pocket; she met me right in the face, she was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that she is the woman - A. I am quite certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she a child in her arms at that time - A. No, she asked me where I was going, I told her I was going straight home, she said I had better go home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her - A. No; she met me, turned back, and went in the direction I was going; she laid hold of my arm, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to shove her off - A. No, she was not five minutes with me, I did not stop with her at all; she suddenly started from me. I was then close by the Crescent when she started the other side of the way; no familiarity passed between us. By her suddenly starting from me, I thought she had taken my pocket handkerchief; I found the left hand pocket of my pantaloons, turned inside out. She was at my left side when she started from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your notes and silver all there - A. Yes, in my purse; I pursued her, and called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When she asked you to go home, did she tell you where her home was - A. No; I was very near her when I followed her, and the watchman stopped her; she was searched in the watchhouse, and the money was found in her mouth; the notes on one side of her mouth, and the silver in the other. The constable has kept it ever since.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is at Sparrow-corner, at the end of the Minories. On the 1st of June, about half past eleven at night, I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner was running, and the prosecutor after her. I stopped the prisoner, the prosecutor came up directly; he charged the prisoner with having robbed him of his purse, containing cash and notes. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, there I searched her; I found upon her two one pound notes, and four shillings in silver in her mouth. I never found the purse. I delivered over the notes and the money to Kinnersley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the woman - A. No, I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Kinnersley. The money and the notes were delivered over to me; they were taken out before I came.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. I suppose you had no marks about your notes or money - A. I know the numbers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not rob this gentleman of his money; I went to look after my husband, he stopped out later than usual; coming back I met with this gentleman, he asked me to have something to drink; he intruded upon me to take six-pence to get something to drink, I told him I dare not go to any house with him, for fear my husband should come home; I happened to stoop down to tie my pocket up, I saw something white, I picked it up; the notes and money were wrapped up in paper. The gentleman came to me in Rosemary-lane, he struck me; I did not know the gentleman again; he did not say he had lost any thing, he called out stop thief, I called out murder. The money was found upon me. When I was in the Compter, he said he would not hurt me if I would make up the money; he had lost two guineas, and a guinea for his loss of time; I told him my husband was out of work, I could not raise above two guineas; he told me I should pay for Kinnersley's loss of time, and the watchman's loss of time. Mr. Kinnersley told Mr. Elder that he should not take the money, without paying for his time.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is there any truth in what she has said - A. I begged the lord mayor not to prosecute this woman, upon account of the child; the husband wanted my address, I gave it him; I never went to the Compter to take any money of her. I never made any proposal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260056"/>that she should pay the watchman and Kinnersley.</p>
               <p>Jury Q. to Maberley. Did the prosecutor describe to you the number of the notes - A. He said he had lost two notes, he said they were both running numbers; he did not make out the number of the notes; before he saw them he described the quantity of silver, he mentioned one foreign piece, or pocket piece, which there was amongst it.</p>
               <p>COURT. to Kinnersley. Do you know the person of the woman - A. Yes.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of June, I in company with Vickrey and other officers, apprehended the prisoner at the White Hart, Stoke Newington, upon some other charge. We went in company with Mr. Pratt, a miller at Tottenham, to search for something else; on searching the bed room, we found this sack at the head of the bed; it has the mark of King, Ware, Herts. The prisoner said he had found this with five-others, six years ago.</p>
               <p>MR. PRATT. I believe you are a miller at Tottenham - A. I am; the prisoner lived in a house near me; on account of my being robbed, we suspected him to be of the party. I and the officers went to his house, we there found the sack as described by the officer.</p>

About half an hour after eight o'clock in the evening, I was standing a little within the door, with my arm upon a pile of goods; this pile consisted of several bundles, containing from ten to twenty pieces, each tied round with a string. A gentleman came to the door, I went round to the desk with him; I had not been there two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this printed linen within the shop - A. Yes, just within the door; every part of the goods was within nine inches of the threshold of the door. The next witness, Roffey, ran in and asked me if I had lost any goods.</p>
               <p>Q. On turning your eye to the pile of goods, did you percieve the pile was diminished - A. Certainly, it was diminished one bundle. I ran to where the prisoner was reported to have gone. and found the goods at Mr. Dobson's.</p>

Such part of the goods that were found, are here. The goods were delivered over to me at Mr. Dobson's. I took them to Worship-street office myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Dobson's - A. About fifteen doors from my house.</p>

Yes; I saw the prisoner at the bar take from the pile of cottons at the door, a bundle; he reached within the shop to get at them; the cottons were within the door; I believe he did not put his foot in.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him do it, did you - A. Yes; he walked gently off the pavement with the cottons; then he began to run gently about ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire in the shop whether he had any right to take them - A. No; I holloaed out stop thief, then he began to run as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Still keeping this bundle - A. Yes, I pursued him with the cry of stop thief; he turned down Finsbury-street; as he was running down there, he was knocked down by some man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him knocked down - A. Yes; he dropped the bundle of linen there; the prisoner got up, and ran again; I pursued after him, I never lost sight of him at all; he ran down Finsbury-street, then he ran through a court; I do not think it was altogether five hundred yards before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thoroughfare in the court - A. Yes; he crossed the other street, and went into a kind of a stable place; he was taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that he laid hold of the goods, to the time he was taken, had you ever lost sight of him - A. No; immediately he was secured, I went and gave information at Mr. Titford's shop.</p>

Yes; he got about two yards before me, When I heard the cry of stop thief, I pursued after him, and knocked him down; he ran half way down Finsbury-street; a pawnbroker's boy went to stop him, he struck him on the eye; I cast my foot before him, he dropped down with the bundle, and I dropped with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the bundle in the same package as when it was taken - A. No; the strings were across each end; there were as many again of them when taken, packed up; there are nearly half of them gone. I am sure it is the same bundle. These are the whole that I recovered; there were a part of them lost, I look upon it; there were half as many again; I value these at eight pounds; they could not be bought for eight pounds.</p>

One of the officers took the sack of flour, and the other took Blain; I went to Shoreditch church and got a coach; we took Blain with us; before we came to the White Hart, this side of Newington-green;

               <p>Q. Did he mention the sack of flour - A. No; he mentioned on the Friday night that he should not stop any longer than Saturday week, or if I pleased to get a man, he would go the next day.</p>

On Friday, the 9th of June, about three o'clock, I saw a cart drawed down the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings gateway, to the stable door; the man who drove it took off the tarpaulin, and took out a sack of flour and carried it into the stable; he covered up the cart and drove it away. I supposed it to be Mr. Pratt's cart, from knowing it going up and down the road; I did not take notice of the man who drove the cart.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Saturday the 10th of June, I, in company with Bishop and Armstrong, went with Mr. Pratt to the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings, Kingsland-road, I went into the house and asked the landlord for his ostler, he pointed out the prisoner Blain, who was standing in the yard; I told Blain we had come to look over the stable for a sack of flour that had been stolen; Mr. Pratt came up, the prisoner Blain addressed himself to Mr. Pratt, said I have a sack of flour that was left here yesterday by your man. We went into the stable, and on the right hand side of the stable, by the corn bin, stood the sack of flour, covered over with a matted basket, and by the side of it was a truss of straw; I told the prisoner Blain that we must take the sack of flour and him before the magistrate, we got a cart, and sent the sack of flour with Armstong. Mr. Pratt got a coach for the purpose of finding Taylor; Mr. Pratt had two men of the same name. We went to the White Hart, Newington; at the door stood Mr. Pratt's cart, loaded; we saw Taylor, Blain pointed him out, at the public house door; I told Taylor he must come to his master, who was waiting in the coach for him; he came along with me to the coach, Blain then said that is the man that left it with me; I then said we have found the sack of flour in the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings stable belonging to Mr. Pratt, where did you get it from; he replied, I brought it from my master's mill in a mistake.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. When I loaded the flour it rained, I drawed the tarpaulin over them as I laid them; I laid one sack on the top, as I always did, to keep the horse from hanging. When I was four miles from home I found I had one sack too many I asked this man to let me leave it; he said I might if I liked; I drawed down the yard and pitched it in the stable.</p>
               <p>Blain's Defence. I stood against the door way when this man came by, he asked me to let him leave a sack of flour, he had one too many; I told him he might leave it till he came back.</p>

            . I was in the house with Mr. Edwards on the 22nd of June; I saw Mr. Edwards give Chappel a twenty pound note, a five pound note, and half a guinea, he wrapped the notes up in a bit of brown paper, and put them in his inside breeches pocket; he asked me to accompany him to the Robin Hood, in Skinner-street, in search of a silk handkerchief he had lost the night before; we went into the tap-room, called for a pot of porter; the prisoner was in the taproom; he came to Chappel and said, I can inform you how you can find your handkerchief; Chappel and I went out, we went to Merchant Taylors Hall; the prisoner followed us. I left Chappel and the prisoner together.</p>

            . I am a soldier. On Wednesday afternoon I was passing through Bishopgate-street, I saw Chappel; a person came up and persuaded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260059"/>him to go to the Robin Hood; we went there; he took out a paper containing notes, the notes fell out of the paper, he picked up the notes; I said you had better leave the notes in the landlord's hands; the landlord read them, he said there was a twenty pound, and a five pound note. We had two pots of porter; Chappel's hat fell off his head, I picked it up; I said you have lost your handkerchief, he said no, it is in my hat; I said it is not, he turned his pockets inside out; I said you are in a house that is not safe, quit the house and let that be the first loss; with that he got up and drank a glass of gin, and gave me one. At the time I was telling the landlord of his losing the handkerchief, this lad came in and went out again; I persuaded Chappel to go to the sign of the Buffalo. I told his wife where he had left his money; this lad abused me for saying that his handkerchief had been lost; he said he should see me another time, he would close my eyes. This man's wife, and Chappel, returned to the Robin Hood, and received the notes; the prisoner saw them receive the notes; they were left in the hands of Mr. Edwards, at the Buffalo, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. At what public house did you lose the notes - A. The Prince of Wales, in Wentworh-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been helping my father to move till four o'clock in the afternoon; I went down to the Robin Hood, Skinner-street, that gentleman and that one were standing at the bar drinking; that gentleman was very much intoxicated, he challenged a soldier with taking his silk handkerchief; I said, if I were you, I would go and clear myself; he said he would. I went out of doors; that gentleman in Skinner-street, said, what are you following of me for; he said, you rascally villain, if you follow me, I will charge a constable with you. When he had abused me, I went down Skinner-street, into the Buffalo, and had a pint of beer; from there I went into the Robin Hood. Mr. Chappel and that gentleman and his wife came in and received the money. The next morning I went to the Robin Hood, in came Mr. Chappel and that gentleman; I asked Mr. Chappel if he had heard any thing of his handkerchief, he said no; I said if I could get any thing out of the girl that was in the house, I would tell him. I went down Threadneedle-street; he went into Merchant Taylor's Hall; me and this gentleman went into a public house; when Mr. Chappel came, he asked him to lend him five shillings; he said he had lost twenty pounds, he would not lend any more; they parted. I went with Mr. Chappel into <placeName id="t18090626-69-crimeloc407">the Prince of Wales, Wentworth-street</placeName>

They all came round and shoved me away; he said, let me see if my money is safe; he could not find it, I said, let me feel; I put my hand into his fob, took out the notes, and put them into his hand; he told me to put it into the fob, I did. I said if you do not come out of this place, I shall bid you good bye. I immediately came out, and the servant of the house is witness that he saw me put it into his fob.</p>

            . I am a gardener. On the 22nd of May, in the pleasure ground of Mrs. Fisher; behind the shrubs I found a bag. I opened it; it contained a quantity of netting; supposing it to be stolen I set a man to watch it, to see who came to fetch it away. The man went at five, and watched till seven in the evening; at seven o'clock I went to see whether the man was where I wished him to be. During the time I was there, the prisoner came and tried to reach the bag over the pales with a hook stick; not being able to draw it, he got over the paling and picked up the bag; I asked him what he did there, he said he had come for that bag, he thought he could make a shilling of it; I told him he must go with me; he begged that I would look over it, and let him go, he was very sorry for what he had done, it was the first offence; he was a poor man, and had been out of work all the winter. When he was before the magistrate, he said the net belonged to Mr. Wells, and hoped they would be merciful to him. We tracked him from our paling, across the grass, to Mr. Wells's shed.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

I pursued him through Spital-square, into Elder-street; I went to catch hold of his accomplice, he said I am not the man, and cried stop thief; the prisoner was foremost; he was going to turn the corner of Flower-de-luce-court, a man was close to him, I desired him to stop him; he did, and delivered him into my custody; I brought him back to Mr. Cotton's; the other made his escape.</p>

On the 10th of June, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner went into the parlour, he called for a glass of ale, my daughter served him with it; he had a second glass of ale, and stopped as long as he thought proper; the girl, as he was going out, went into the parlour and found the candlesticks missing; I followed him up the hill, and said to him, I presume you have something about you that is not your own; he looked very stedfastly, and said, sir; I have? I took hold of him by the collar and said, you must go back with me. I took him back, and took him into the same room from whence he took the property; I said, deliver what you have, or else I shall be under the necessity of searching you; he took one candlestick out of his coat pocket, and another out of his hat, and gave them me. I took him to Hatton Garden. He said it was distress that made him do it; that could not be the case; the officer searched him and found five shillings and sixpence in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Is not he capable of getting his bread - A. No. He was sent to us as a person incapable of getting his bread; he has lost the pallet of his mouth. Being a bricklayer I sent him on the top of the house to do some repairs; I was at the door of the workhouse, I saw him turn down an alley which is at one end of the workhouse, and perceived a bundle under his coat; I sent one of my people to order him back again, in order that I might see what he had got; she returned and said she had missed him. When he returned I asked him where he had been; he told me next door; that I knew to be false; I asked him if he had taken any thing; he said nothing. There was one of my people that I saw him more intimate with than others; I suspected that he knew something of what he had been about; he came to me and said I understand you are angry with me; I said I am; you know what he was about; he said he did not, I had better go up on the top of the house, there was something in the blue pigeon way.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by the blue pigeon - A. Something of lead. I charged the prisoner with stealing the lead off the top of the back of the workhouse; he denied it. I threatened to take him to the watchhouse; then he took me into his room, unlocked his box, and shewed me the lead, which I have here. That lead I took out of his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he taken that lead from before it was in his box - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not match it - A. No. When I took it out of the box, I said Remmington, this is not all, what have you done with the rest; he said he had sold it in Brick-lane; I said come along and shew me; we went to an iron shop in Brick-lane; I asked the man if he knew the prisoner, he said, yes; he had bought a little old lead of him; I then said, can I see it; he said it laid behind the counter; he removed a sack from off it, he said that was the lead that he bought of the prisoner; he asked me if it was my property; I said no, it belonged to a house that I had the care of. The iron shopman then begged me to hush it up, I told him I could make no promise of that kind; I had seen the lead, that was all I wanted to see. I then came home and acquainted the churchwardens, they ordered him to be taken in charge; he was taken before the magistrate the officers told me I had done wrong. When they went with a search warrant to the iron shop the man and the lead were both out of the way.</p>

On Monday the 26th of June, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came in the shop, and requested me to show her some men's broad ribbed cotton stockings; I reached about five or six pair of of the window, which I shewed her; a gentleman came in for a pair of dressed gloves, I left the prisoner to attend the gentleman; after the gentleman was gone, I went to the prisoner. I thought there was a deficiency in the number, though I did not know positively the number, whether it was five or six. She requested me to put up one pair in a piece of paper, as she was going to call at a shoe maker's shop, she would call for them as she came back; I told her that we were about to close the shop, and she had better take them with her; she said she should not be long, and if she did not call for them in the evening, she would send a little girl for them in the morning. I I went round to the window to replace the stockings, she dropped her pocket handkerchief on the ground; it appeared very large; she took it up and put it into her pocket; she went out of the shop; the porter came in just at the time. I went out immediately after the prisoner; instead of her going into a shoe maker's shop, she went into a public house in a court in Shoe-lane; when the prisoner came out of the public house, she asked me whether I suspected her guilty of stealing stockings; I hesitated, and said her conduct seemed strange; she left me, I followed her into New-street-square; I then told her I should be glad if she would go back with me to the shop; we went immediately back to the shop. I told her I suspected her of stealing stockings; she pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket, then another handkerchief, and then she took the stockings out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them to be your master's - A. I could not swear to them, there was no private mark; they corresponded with the pattern of the stockings that I had shewn her, and she offered to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty, that there was a pair of stockings missing - A, I cannot say that there was a pair of stockings missing.</p>

On the 9th of last month, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was informed that the prisoner had taken a pair of boots away, that hung outside of my shop window. I pursued the prier, and came up to him in Little George-street, in the Minories; he was walking pretty sharp; the man informed me that he put the boots under his smock frock. I seized a boot from under his smock frock; he then drew up, as if he was going to strike me, but ran off; and he either threw another boot from him or dropped it. Several people laid hold of him, but he got from them. I saw him turn round the corner, into Mitre-court. I was anxious to go home; I picked up the boot and went to the shop; I saw the prisoner the next morning at the Mansion-house. I believe he is the person; the boots are worth thirty-shillings.</p>

I saw Mr. Heath tustling with him in Little George-street; Mr. Heath had taken one boot from him; he got from Mr. Heath, and ran across the way; I pursued him, and never lost sight of him. I then saw him drop or throw one boot away from him in the street. When I laid hold of him, he said nothing; he was quite in confusion; bringing him to the watchhouse, an elderly gentleman said, I saw him cut the boots down with a knife. I searched him at the watchhouse, and found this knife.</p>

Yes, he never attempted to get in; he went to Mr. Jones's, there he attempted to pick the locks, they were all in Newgate market, and butter shops; having seen him at these three, I thought it my duty to take him in custody. I was forced to have a great deal of assistance, he drew a knife upon me. I never saw him before.</p>

Yes; I saw this man on Tuesday morning, I saw him again with Peppercorn; I thought he was in a state of insanity, but I wished for another day to be more satisfied of his conduct; I had that opportunity. I reported to Mr. Alderman Smith, that he was under the influence of insanity. I asked Mr. Tegg, the keeper of the Compter; he informed me this man had been there on former occasions, as an insane man. I had him remanded for one day, because I would make up my mind.</p>

On Sunday the 28th of May, I met the prisoner in the broad part of Holborn, about eleven o'clock at night; she ran after me, took hold of my arm, and asked me if I would go home with her; she had a nice room to accommodate me; through her persuasions I went with her, to <placeName id="t18090626-82-crimeloc482">No, 4, Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay with her - A. I staid in the room all night; she left the room in about three quarters of an hour; she went out and locked the door, she said she should be back directly, she was going in the yard; I said very well, make haste back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suppose that your watch was safe when you first saw that woman - A. When I first went into the room, I felt the watch and chain in my pocket; I put my hand into my pocket to give her the seven shilling piece, I pulled out the guinea with the seven shilling piece; I gave her the seven shilling piece, and put the guinea safe into my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she left you, had you undressed yourself - A. No, nothing but my breeches were off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she left the room, had you any suspicion that your watch and the guinea was gone - A. No, not till she double locked the door; I then looked in my breeches; the watch and guinea was gone. It was a metal hunting watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to get out - A Not then; I thought she might come back again. I staid till four o'clock, and then I 
               <persName id="t18090626-82-person877">drew</persName>
             the staple off the door, and went out to my stable, and did my horses up. I made no alarm that morning, I thought it was better to come and catch her in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that this is the woman that you was with then - A. Yes; on two o'clock the same day, I went in company of a young man, of the name of Templeman, to this room; she was lying upon the bed; I charged her with having stolen my watch; she denied it. I told her she had better give it me, or else I would fetch an officer; she said she did not care for the officer nor me, Templeman went for an officer; and while I staid with her, she got a poker, and said she would strike me on the head; she did strike, but I kept the blow off with my hand; then the landlord came up, and asked me what was the matter; I told him this woman had robbed me of my watch; he took the poker from her, and directly she took a pewter pot and attempted to strike me; the landlord made her put it down. Before the officer came, the landlord said that if I would call again the next day at twelve o'clock, and leave him five shillings, he would take care and find the watch, and restore it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not to prosecute her - A. Not by that, but still as I had been robbed, I wished to have the law as far as I could. I went down stairs to see if I could see Templeman, I met him with an officer; he went up stairs, and then the landlord produced the watch; he said he found it in her cupboard, under a dish.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked in that cupboard while she was out - A. Yes, I searched the room, and the cupboard, and turned every thing up that was in it. The watch is in the landlord's custody now.</p>

I searched the woman I found nothing; I opened the next room door, there were two children in it, one of the children told me that her mother put it in the cupboard.

I went immediately to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your going there were four sheets gone - A. Yes; three blankets, a liquor machine, more than twenty brass cocks, and more than three handkerchiefs were taken away; and a vast quantity of other things. The liquor machine cost ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this man - A. He used to come in and out with Mrs. Townsend and Mrs. Williams, they were lodgers in the one pair; he used to come every evening and have a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. What lodgers did you see in it - A. Moggy Williams, Mrs. Williams, and Townsend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire the constable to look after this man - A. Yes, I went with him, I apprehended him; and then I called him in. I charged him with robbing my father, and breaking open the house; he said he had not done it; he was searched, and these handkerchiefs were found on him; two in his hat, and one in his pocket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

            . On Monday the 26th of June, between three and four in the afternoon the prisoner came into our shop, he asked for some pearlash, for which the person that was serving him had to go down stairs; knowing him as a bad character, I watched him; as soon as the person had gone down stairs for the article he asked for, he looked across the counter to see if any body was noticing him; he stood with his back towards the street, put his hand over the counter and took up a five shilling paper of halfpence that was tied up; he was not dressed as he is now; he had not that long coat on, his jacket was lose; he put them in his waistcoat pocket. I then came from where I was, at the back part of the shop, and pulled him a yard from the counter. I said to him, I was glad we had got him at last; he took the halfpence out of his pocket and gave them into my hands. I directed another young man in my shop to go out, in order to prevent his making his escape; he saw him take it likewise, he went out for that purpose.</p>

I went in between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I got some tea, sugar, and some soap; I went home and got my breakfast; I went into Whitechapel; I got a bit of meat to make a drop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260065"/>of broth; I went to Mr. Tilby and changed half a guinea, I left two shillings with my landlady; he gave me five shillings in copper. I told the prosecutor to ask the gentlemen whether he did not change me a half guinea; I went into that shop, I called for a quarter of a pound of Scotch barley; my wife was going to washing, she told me to bring some pearlash; the other shopman went to get the pearlash for me; that gentleman ran up stairs; he came down and said he had got me. I put the five shilling paper of halfpence on the counter; he took it up and marked it. I was going to pay for what I called for out of the five shilling paper. There were a good many five shilling papers on the counter; I do not say but what the gentleman might think it was his, but I took it out of my pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 29th of May, I was crying half past nine in the evening, I saw two men lurking at No. 19, in Henrietta-street, I made over to them; one was outside the railing, and the other withinside, close up against the house; the prisoner was the man that was inside the railing, I saw him busy at the wall; as soon as the man outside espied me, he made off. I thought I could make sure of one. The prisoner had hold of the lead.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him - A. Yes. When I came within three or four yards, he came out from under the rail, I seized hold of him by the collar with my left hand, and sprung my rattle; I took him to the watch-house, one of my fellow watchmen followed so close that he could not get away. The lead has been twisted off, not cut.</p>

            . Q. Did this lad at the bar lodge at your house - A. Yes. He worked at Day and Martin's manufactory I missed a number of things, in my house. On the Sunday morning, I said I would search his box, he said I was welcome to search his box, he had nothing but what was his own. He ran up first, he opened his box and took out articles of linen, and said is this yours, and when he came to the bottom of the box there happened to be a drinking glass, a looking glass, and the clothes brush; they belonged to me; the looking glass was in his own room, but the last time I saw the clothes brush was in the bar. He never asked me for the clothes brush; the drinking glass I did not miss, I had so many.</p>

Sometimes gentlemen give me a dog to keep.</p>
               <p>Q. A hog is not a dog, you know - A. I asked him who the gentleman was; he said he had lost the direction, I gave him leave. I never had any before in my life. I immediately gave the hogs some clean water and some corn; he told me he would come again presently. After that he came again, he brought two large knives, and a thing that they scratch the hair off, he asked me to let him kill the pigs; I told him I was afraid these pigs were stolen; he offered me a guinea if I would let him kill them in the place; I told him I would not let him do it. I went to Gillmore, I told him I had two hogs, I suspected they were stolen.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Queen-square. On Tuesday, the 27th of June, Rowley came to me and related to me what he has related to your lordship, that he had two pigs, he suspected they were stolen; in consequence of which my brother officer and me went up to the place and saw the two pigs. As soon as we saw the pigs we saw the prosecutor in search of them, he said they had been stolen from his premises that morning. Rowley gave the description of the prisoner; he lived in Church-lane, Dyot-street, just by Rats Castle. In the evening we apprehended him. When I got him in a coach bringing him to Tothill-fields, I told him I apprehended him in consequence of two pigs he had taken to Rowley that morning; he then said he did not know Rowley, nor Mill-bank neither; he had not taken any pigs from any one; he would make me pay for his loss of time in taking him up; he had not seen any pigs of any body's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. He is a man that goes about with a boar. The next morning Rowley brought me these things, which were brought to his house; I asked him if he knew these things; he said yes; and he recollected Rowley; then he said these things were his the two knives, the skuttle, steel, and three or four hooks; the prosecutor saw the pigs and identied them to be his property. They were the same pigs that I took away from Rowley.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were my pigs; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Between the hours of six and seven o'clock I was going to a gentleman's house in Sun-yard, a man at Charing-cross met me, Appleby was coming past, he said, Jones, I wish you would drive these two pigs for me: he gave me the whip, told me to drive them to Mill-bank, Westminster, he would overtake me; he did, by Pit-street, he told me to go to Rowley's with these pigs, and to tell him I was come from Appleby; Rowley asked me three times over did Appleby send me with these pigs. When Appleby came he went and had some gin with him; he told him he would bring the tubs; he did; he said to the publican can you let me heat your copper; he said I cannot. Rowley said if you want a good joint of pork we can let you have it. I went to the Two Brewers with my hog; when I came back I went to Rowley's, I took my two knives, the scuttle, and two gambles; I said to Rowley, where is the man, he said he is gone; I said if the man is gone I shall not haul these pigs about myself, I am not able, and he may get somebody else, or I will come in the morning. Mr. Rowley saw him last.</p>
               <p>Rowley. He had nobody with them but himself.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On May the 20th, a little before nine o'clock at night, Crocker, another patrol, and me were on duty; going up Middle-row, Holborn, we met the two prisoners in company together, in the narrow way, they passed us; we watched them to Mr. Craig's shop; Davis stopped at the window, looked at a remnant, and pulled it off the rail inside of the window; she then walked away from the window; there were several people standing close to her; she joined the prisoner Johnson, they were about a minute in conversation; and Johnson came up to the window, he took hold of the piece of printed cotton.</p>

               <p>Q. Then she only pulled it down from the rail - A. Only pulled it down from the rail, and left it on the window frame; he took hold of the printed cotton, but a person coming up he was prevented from taking it. He then went to the place where he had been standing before; the prisoner Davis crossed the street to near where I was, in order to see whether any one was near the window in the inside of the shop, and then went to the window; stooped down and took up the printed cotton, put it in her apron, and walked away. I then crossed the street; I saw Johnson run down Southampton-buildings; I secured the prisoner Davis, and took her back to Mr. Craig's shop; she had the property in her apron; I am sure she is the person, I knew her before. Johnson was taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. What that man has sworn is false, he is a perjured man. I know nothing of the prisoner. I was taken up on Whit Sunday, and accused of taking this. I am innocent of the crime. I never was down Holborn for nine days, I had the rheumatism so bad.</p>
               <p>Davis's Defence. I know nothing of the prisoner; there was not a creature along with me on the morning of the day that I was going down Holborn; in the evening when they took me up, I received a letter of the death of my father. I had a child bad of the smallpox; I had a letter to go down in the country; I was going to the Bull and Mouth Inn. I had a petticoat of my mother's, which I could not match. I stopped at the shop to look at a pattern that was like it. I never went in the door, nor never had the cotton in my hand.</p>

I gave each of them a glass of gin, and I had one; they asked me what o'clock it was, I told them it wanted about a quarter to twelve; Cartwright asked me to let her look at it, I told her I would not; she put my thumb back and forced it out of my hand herself; I asked her for the watch, she would not give it me; she put it down her bosom, and said she had it not; I said if you do not give it me, I will charge the watch with you. This happened just inside the door; the door was bolted when we were inside, because they shut up a little after eleven. Kite and Barrett unbolted the door and ran away. I had hold of Cartwright's hand; when the watchman came, I took her to the watchhouse. When I went to Marlbourough-street, Kite and Barrett were there. I told the constable to put them in; one of them struck me and gave me a black eye; the other would have struck me, but the people prevented her. I knew them all three before. I am sure of their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the watch been found - A. No; because these two other girls ran away directly. I gave two pound for the watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I was crying the hour of twelve o'clock; the prosecutor gave me charge of Cartwright for robbing him of his watch; the others were not there, when I came up the watchhouse keeper searched her; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Cartwright's Defence. I know no further of the women than living in the neighbourhood. I am an unfortunate woman. I told Johnson he had better go home, he said he would go home; he said if you do not go home, I will charge the watchman with you, for being out in disorderly hours; he caught hold of me, put his hand in my bosom. I was searched in a most clandestine manner, on account of that they could not find the property on me. He never asserted that any person was with me at office the first time, no person was drinking with me but him. I was outside of the door when he said I had got his watch; lord, says I, do not say that, the watchman will take me to the watchhouse. The justice asked him if there was any accomplice, he said no; I put the watch in my bosom. The moment he accused me of it, he gave charge of me to the watch directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Did you say before the justice that there was no more than that woman - A. No, I said there was three in company.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this man quartered at your house - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose two bottles of wine - A. I did, on Monday the 12th of June; being quartered with us, he assisted us, and we treated him as one of the family. In the evening he was there drinking; he went down to the privy, I supposed, he could have no other purpose of going down there, he was gone some time; we went down, he was not in the privy; we concluded he was gone. Some little time afterwards the cellar door opened; it goes with a pulley, it made a noise; my wife heard the jink of the bottles, she called to me; I was sitting in the parlour adjoining. I immediately jumped up with two others, and secured the prisoner with the two bottles of wine in the street,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any marks on your bottles or your corks - A. No, not then; I have marked them since. They were in a hamper of wine. I happened to send for half a dozen of sherry wine, it was in the cellar; I looked at the hamper, it was deficient three bottles; I cannot account for the other bottle; he acknowledged that he had robbed me of the other bottle three weeks before. I said when I caught him, Dick you are the last person that I should have thought would have robbed me; he said he hoped I would forgive him, he had never robbed me but once before; he and his comrade that has gone off with the expedition; he confessed it upon his knees: afterwards he ran away; he was taken by the people that are here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that drawer near the spot where Stredder worked - A. Yes; he was mostly in sight of the drawer, except when he was sent out of an errand, which was not often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that drawer kept locked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were there any other persons working in this room where the drawer was - A. No; Stredder was the time keeper, he was not a labourer; he had to keep the men's time, and to take care of many articles; and among other these crank winders; the workmen had no business there unless they come to Stredder. I examined on that day and missed six. In the course of that evening Brewer came, he brought three dozen and a half of crank winders; I examined them, they were brought as new goods; I paid him seven seven shillings and six-pence a dozen for them. On my examining of them, I found half a dozen of them with marks, which I myself had put. These are them, it is a little nick with a file.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did this man used to be paid upon delivery - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your discovering that these were half a dozen that you had marked, what did you say to him - A. I said nothing to him, I went for an officer; I left him with Mr. Bound, and when the officer came, Mr. Bound gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever give Stredder leave to lend winders to Brewer - A. No, I forbid him to lend them to Brewer or to any other person; the reason was that Brewer two or three years back was in the habit of borrowing; when I had a partner he might have the liberty of my partner; he used to say they were returned; probably they were not returned; consequently I forbid to lend to Brewer for two years back.</p>

               <p>Brewer's Defence. Mr. Bound has frequently lent me winders; I have worked for him twenty years. I never asked but he always granted my request. Mr. Bound says he refused me two years ago, he has only dissolved partnership since the 1st of January last, since then I have borrowed of him, I always returned them. I asked Stredder to lend me half a dozen; he lent them me; I told him I would return them the next week Mr. Bound cannot say that ever he heard the least slur upon my character.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you know of this transaction, or was any application made to you by Stredder or Brewer - A. None at all. The partnership has been dissolved since January last; in Mr. Greensmith's time I gave positive orders not to lend.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bound, you have lent me within this six or seven months yourself - A. That is not so; I have forbid Brewer myself of having any lent.</p>

               <p>Q. What work was he to do - A. To finish a teapot; for that purpose I delivered him a piece of silver plate; I marked it with a diamond punch, in that part that was to be cut off; at six o'clock he left his work, then I looked in his apron, I found materially less cuttings than I expected, the piece that I had marked was not there; I went to the accompting house, where he then was being paid by my father, I went in and shut the door, and told him he had in his pocket what he had no right to; I told him it was not the first time; he said it was the first time, and then produced the silver cuttings, an ounce and fifteen pennyweights. The silver is the property of Mr. Gerrard; here is the marked piece; the cuttings are the produce of that day's work.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen it before you missed it - A. Not above two or three minutes before, because I had just looked at it, it was on the mantle piece, by the side of a medal, in my sister's apartment; it was my sister's watch, she was gone out; she had nothing to do with it; she worked at a shop in Cranbourn-alley, and her husband lived with the Prince of Wales.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the apartment - A. No; we were there because we had taken a room on purpose to sleep in, and we used to go there of a day to get our breakfast, and every thing in her apartment was left in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch did not belong to you or to your husband - A. No. I had gone into the next room on purpose to get air, I had not been gone above two minutes to the most, when I came to the door I saw the prisoner turning round from the mantle piece, he was coming towards the door; I thought he might be one of the lodgers; he then got to the stairs; I cast my eye to the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, as this house is let out in lodgings, the street door is generally left open - A. Yes. When I cast my eye to the mantle piece, and missed the watch, the man was got to the top of the stairs; I said to him you have got a watch; I instantly called out stop thief, the lodgers all then came about; he got down all but three stairs; I was close to him; he said d - n you, I have got no watch; he attempted to throttle me. He threw the watch over the bannisters of the stairs, and broke it, ran out, and shut the door; I went out, I catched sight of him in the court; I called out stop thief, I did not see him stopped; I thought I had better go back, as I had left the property in the passage. He was brought back; then he said he never had been up stairs; I charged him with being the thief. He was secured; my husband and a young man took him to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a plane maker, I live in Mercer-street, Long Acre. I was in St. Martin's-court when two boys cried out stop thief; that man has stole a watch; I turned round and followed the prisoner, he was stopped by several people besides me; I took care that he should not go away; he said I have not got a watch; I did not steal the watch; the boys said you did steal the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say from what place he had stolen it - A. Yes; I said if you have not stolen the watch, why need you be afraid of going down with me to the woman; he hesitated, and at last he said he would; I took him down; she was in a great passion with him; she immediately declared that he was the man that stole the watch; he said she was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the boys were calling after him was he running or walking - A. He was running; I took charge of him, and took him to Bow-street with the woman's husband.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have had the watch ever since; it is my sister's watch; it has the marks of violence upon it, the inside is quite beat down; I valued it at thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, I think it was in Bear-street, leading to the King's-mews, a person stopped me and told me I had stole a woman's watch, in some court; I said I had not stolen a watch. I am innocent of the crime. I declare to God I have not the least knowledge, nor was I ever nigh the court to my knowledge; the prosecutrix swore that if I had an hundred necks she would hang me; she struck me. I never did any thing of the kind in my life. I have a situation in the Custom house, and at this time on the eve of promotion; I should be very sorry to be guilty of any thing of the kind.</p>

On the 13th of June last, about half past ten in the morning the prisoner came in and asked for half a pint of porter, it was drawn for her; she put down a penny piece, and then put her hand into her pocket to look for a halfpenny or a farthing as I supposed. I knew the prisoner for some years past; she has offered me base coin frequently before. I have taken three altogether of her, two before this. The half pint of porter came to one penny farthing; instead of her putting down a farthing, she put down a shilling; that was not the first time nor the sixth time that she had served me so; she took up the penny piece, I took up the shilling and walked out of the bar to a better light; I looked at the shilling, I saw it to be a bad one, such as she had offered me before. I sent for a constable and had her taken up; she was searched in my presence. I had the shilling in my hand, and the two shillings that I had taken of her before, I had spoiled by making a hole through them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the shilling she gave you on the 13th - A. I kept it and delivered it to the constable; when she was searched she had seven-pence halfpenny and a farthing in copper money, penny pieces and halfpence; she had a farthing.</p>

I said it did not stand to reason, that if I had a bad one I should offer it to him. I can assure you, since the hour I was born, I never entered his door before. He said he would make an example of my country he would hang every man and woman of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260072"/>contry.

            , esq. to be left at the coach office Lynn, with a ticket attached to it of the charge of five shillings and eight-pence; that is carriage five shillings and two-pence, and porterage six-pence; and the direction says</p>
               <p>"by the Newcastle coach, to the Angel Inn, St. Martins-le-grand, London". This was brought to me by Satchell; I paid Satchell the five shillings and eight-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way in which parcels are brought to you daily - A. It is the usual custom of business, where parcels go through London, to pay the carriage of the coach that comes to London; then we charge the parcel in the country that carriage and our carriage. As soon as Satchell had left the office, I opened the parcel, and found nothing else than two sheets of brown paper covered with cartridge paper; as soon as I found the parcel contained nothing but two sheets of brown paper, I sent my porter up the yard to bring Satchell back, he did so. On Satchell's return, he laid the five shillings and eight-pence down; I said you are a pretty fellow, Satchell put the money in his pocket again by my desire. I sent for Sapwell the constable. Satchell, and Sapwell, and I, went to the Magpie, in Newgate-street. I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait before you saw the defendant - A. I waited I suppose twenty minutes, and then I left Satchell and Sapwell; having to go to Somerset-house upon some business, I left the Magpie about one o'clock, and returned about two o'clock. Wade then was there in company with Satchell and Sapwell; the moment I came in, Sapwell desired me to call a coach, and take the defendant before the lord mayor; I took a coach and took the defendant before the lord mayor. Sapwell informed me on my return, that Satchell had paid the five shillings and eight-pence into the hands of

               <p>Q. What passed when Wade gave it to you - A. He said he had got a couple of parcels, he said take them one for the Gloucester and the other for Lynn; I took them. I had known him three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to do with the money - A. He was to meet me at the same house at twelve o'clock, to receive the money; I asked him where I should see him to give him the money. He was to meet me at the Magpie at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you to receive any money for these two parcels, or either of them - A. Yes; five shillings and eight pence, I think; I am sure of five shillings and eight pence for the Lynn. I carried the parcel for Lynn, first to the Bull; I delivered the parcel and received the five shillings and eight pence; I came out of the office, the bookkeeper sent a porter after me to call me back again, I came back, I laid the five shillings and eight pence on the bookkeeper's desk; on the gentlemen saying this is all I have got for my five shillings and eight-pence, he shewing me the parcel. I saw it contained two sheets of brown paper with cartridge paper. I then told him who I had it of, and where I was to meet the person I had it off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then did Sapwell and the bookkeeper go with you to the Magpie - A. Yes. We waited at the Magpie some time, Wade did not come in, we had information that he was at Warwick-lane, we went to Warwick-lane, and there we met him; Mr. Sapwell was on one side of the way and I on the other; I said to him, John, here is your money; I gave him five shillings and eight-pence for the Lynn parcel; he said where is the other, I said you must ask that man for it, pointing to Mr. Sapwell. Mr. Sapwell took the money from him, Mr. Sapwell then took him; he has the other parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he gave you the parcel and you took it, did you believe it to be a parcel going to a gentleman, or did you know it to be those two pieces of paper - A. I knew no more of it than a child unborn. I thought it to be a regular parcel; I knew where he did live, and I had known him three years.</p>

I took him in custody; I took him to the Magpie, and from there to the Mansion house. This money has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Satchell give you the other parcel that was to go to Gloucester - A. He did.

               <p>Q. Is your son a soldier in one of his Majesty's regiments - A. Yes; in the West Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at any time at home and absent from his regiment - A. Yes; he deserted from his regiment; he was at home with me in last December.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all desirous that he should be released from being a soldier - A. No; otherwise than this man said he could do something for him. I never saw him before he called upon me on the 1st of December; my son was in prison for desertion, and the defendant found me out, he told me he had heard that I had a son in trouble, and that if I would give him a little money he would stop my son from going back to his regiment; he told me thirty shillings would be as much as he should want; at that time I gave him one pound note, I told him I had no more change then; I believe he said he would call on the next day for the remainder. When he went away I said sir, I hope you will not deceive me, as you are a stranger; no, he said, he would not; he called again on the next day at an earlier hour than he did the day before, he told me he was short of money, he should be glad of the other ten shillings; I told him I hoped he had done something that would be of use to the lad; he said, oh, yes, he had, and that Mr. Trott had got a detainer to lay against the lad; I advanced him the other ten shillings in silver; he said he could got my son discharged. I never saw him after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son go back to the regiment, notwithstanding all these promises of his - A. He was taken to the Savoy; Mr. Pringle did nothing for me, he was sent to the regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this man next - A. I seeked after Mr. Trott, the officer of Hatton-garden; he said he knew nothing about it. Mr. Trott took him up by my description.</p>

On the 1st of December the prisoner came to Mrs. Miller's house, 24, Harp-alley; he said I hear you have a son in a little trouble, and for a little money I will hinder him from going back to his regiment; she asked how much money, he said thirty shillings; my mistress gave him a one pound note, and said she had no more change at present; and then she said, I hope you will not deceive me, as you are a stranger; he said no, he was well known by some creditable people. He came again on the 2nd, on the next day; and said I am come for the other ten shillings, he was rather short of money; my mistress said have you done any thing towards being of use to the lad, he said yes; that Mr. Trott of Hatton Garden had got a warrant or detainer, and at three o'clock the business will be settled; my mistress then gave him the other ten shillings; the prisoner came alone.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen, I was applied to by Mr. Brooks, who desired me to call upon Mr. Smith, a pauper in Newgate, to do some business; I called upon Smith, who introduced me to Miller, who was sentenced to go in the condemned regiment; he desired me to go to his mother, said she would not mind what money she paid. I said in that case we must get a copy of the commitment, and afterwards a copy of the conviction; humbly hoping that his Majesty would be pleased to let him go in the regular regiment instead of the condemned regiment. I went with a messenger who introduced me into his mother's company; she said how much money, I said about thirty shillings for the copy of his commitment and the certificate of his conviction, and the preparing the petition. She gave me one pound; I called the next day and received the ten shillings. I immediately applied at the clerks office for a certificate to prepare the petition; when I was informed that the prisoner Miller was to be sent to the Savoy. I called upon Miller, said to him, that I found his crime was worse than he represented; he having deserted from the condemned regiment; and as that was the case, I must decline having any thing more to do in the business; as the time would not permit the result of a petition; I would return the thirty shillings to his mother; notwithstanding the trouble I had been at. A few days afterwards I sprained my ancle; was confined in my room, and attended by a surgeon.</p>
