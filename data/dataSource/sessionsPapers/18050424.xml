             sworn. - I am journeyman to Messrs. Yates; when the prisoner was brought back, after he had been out of my master's house, I searched him, and took the pewter out of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose metal it is? - A. I believe it is my master's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Stringer.) Look at that piece of metal; Is that the piece of metal you saw the prisoner take? - A. It is like the same piece of metal.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Do you know the piece of metal? - A. I never saw it before I saw it come out of the prisoner's breeches; it is the same that we have melted, and I believe it to be the same sort that another man was casting in the same kind of a mould, and this was what remained.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to the hole to put some tobacco in; the hole is open to every one; the piece of metal was given me by another man in the shop to cast, and it was not good enough, I did not cast it; I was going out to dinner; the door was locked; I waited till the door was unlocked and then went out, and my master hauled me in and insisted upon searching of me; I opened my waistcoat and my breeches; my breeches were broke, both between my legs and both my knees, and when I sat down I picked this piece of metal up; I did not have it when I went out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I took him out in the street, and saw the metal taken from his breeches after I had followed him out into the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it that you found this one pound note? - A. Exactly where I stopped the man; I told Mr. Taylor's people, that came down, that I had got the note, and I begged of them that they would not let the man go; the prisoner was taken to Mr. Taylor, and I asked him if he had lost a note; he said, yes, he had sent his little girl out to get it changed; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house. I produce the note; I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Had you any mark on the note by which you could know it again? - A. No, not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The charge that is alledged against me I am innocent of.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you all went to this Caroline-court? - A. Yes; the bottom door of the house was open, and I went up two pair of stairs and found the two pair of stairs room door open, where the prisoners were; when I came into the room, the prisoner Pagett was sweeping the room with a broom; the prisoner

             was standing by the side of the table; I went to read my warrant; Mrs. Pagett said, warrant or no warrant, you are welcome to search; the man being by, we searched him, but found nothing on him; I then proceeded to search the woman's pocket, and on her person I found nothing but good monies. In a place by the side of the window, I found this cannister, which I opened, and I found this bag, which I have in my hand, in the cannister.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the contents of the bag? - A. I did, it contained some file-dust and six iron punches; this I found by the fire-side; I found another bag; it is a leather bag, like a powder-bag which a hair-dresser uses.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these in the presence of both the prisoners and the officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that which you took out of that bag? - A. It is a quantity of counterfeited blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. They were in that paper then which you now produce, and in that last bag? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How many counterfeited blanks were there in that leather bag? - A. There were fifty-nine counterfeited blanks; they were not coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. If coloured, they would be called shillings; they were round blanks, not coloured; they were the size of a shilling? - A. Yes, they were small round blanks which would in time be coloured into shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Which might be in course of time? - A. Yes: in the same leather bag was a small quantity of waste, or sissil; it has had these holes punched in them; this we found in an arm chair by the fire side; I found these two pair of pliers, a piece of cork, and some sand paper; this sandpaper has been used which I now produce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did it appear to have been recently used? - A. I could not discern that.</p>
               <p>Q. You produce the piece of cork, is there any observations that you can make from that cork? - A. It is an article that I have found at such places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular respecting the seat of the arm chair? - A. We lifted up the seat of the arm chair (as a great number do), and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240005"/>there I found the articles I have before described; these I secured in the presence of the prisoners and the officers, and I took them away; they are all which I found.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been an officer for a great many years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have attended upon the examination of coiners a great many years; do you know the use of the different articles? - A. The sand-paper is used to rub the metal; the sissil remains as it appears now, after the punch has struck out the blank from that sissil.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blanks appear to have been struck out of that sissil? - A. There are four or five appear to have been struck out of this.</p>
               <p>Q. What metal is that sissil? - A. It is a composition with some silver in it.</p>
               <p>Q. The cork is usually used - A. The cork is, I believe, used to smooth the blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a quantity of file dust you produce? - A. That is from the edges of those blanks, I presume.</p>
               <p>Q. The pliers for what purpose are they used? - A. I should believe it is to hold them (to hold them this way) to rub them with either sand-paper or cork.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to have been used? - A. I believe they have been used, by the brightness.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got a punch? - A. There are six.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one I would wish you to notice? - A. Here is one with the letter S.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a considerable number of blanks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the letter S found on those blanks? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That does not correspond with those you now produce? - A. Not with my blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any blanks that your brother officers have, that correspond with that letter? - A. I believe they have some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you produce any cup? - A. I have a cup; I cannot tell in what part I found it in the apartment, nor I cannot recollect whether I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it in the apartment of Rothwell and Pagett? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew them before? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come acquainted that this was their apartment? - A. I heard Mrs. Pagett say, take care of my goods; I believe those were the words; that was after we had made the search; I think Rothwell said he was unlucky that he had just come up.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Rothwell said that? - A. During the time we were in the room; the man and woman knew me, and I knew them; they were very civil; there was not the least hindrance of our search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The place where you found this, the house is kept by a woman of the name of Bromage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the door open below stairs, and the door up stairs also? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No communication whatever appeared to you that they had been at work? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined her hands, you found no marks of aqua fortis on her hands? - A. No, I only examined the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any aqua fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Without aqua fortis they cannot extract the silver out of the metal to the surface? - A. No, they cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. That, therefore, is an indisputable ingredient in the process of colouring? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I find you do not produce any files? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not files also a necessary instrument - a file is exceedingly necessary, that the instruments should be complete for the purpose of preparing these blanks? - A. The edges have been smoothed in a lathing wheel; the plate itself is sufficiently smooth; there was none there that I found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Of course in the process of colouring, a file would not be necessary.</p>
               <p>Court. It would be necessary to render the edges smooth, for the purpose of circulation? - A. That is what Mr. Alley means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. To be sure.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are they finished? - A.There were either three or four, at the time I took them, that were fit for circulation, and I believe they are now; I do not exactly know whether they were in this piece of paper; they were in a tea caddie in the window, in a piece of paper, but I believe I took them out of that piece of paper; after I had searched different parts of the room, I went to a little table that stood at the left hand side of the fire place; on that table stood an old looking glass, and in the frame was this little drawer: I took it out and found it contained a different quantity of bad coin; there were thirteen counterfeit half guineas and fifty two seven-shilling pieces; I think there were three counterfeit half crowns, two counterfeit dollars, and ten counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state were the counterfeit shillings? - A. Some of them were fit for circulation and quite finished, as I supposed; in the same drawer were seven counterfeited sixpences.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Upon finding it, what then? - A. Under those rags was a great deal of dust and ashes, and upon all was a washing-tub containing dirty water; I shewed the bottle to the prisoner Pagett, and she said it was a medicine from the doctor; Rothwell tried to lay hold of the bottle; he put his hand out, and tried to take it out of my hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he express any thing when he put his hands out? - A. He did; he said, let me look at it, which I would not; that is all that I found.</p>
               <p>Q. On your refusing to let him look at it, did he do any thing? - A. He made an attempt to come towards me, once or twice; I told him I would not suffer it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that attempt made for the purpose of getting it from you? - A. I think it was; I refused to let him have it.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose is it used? - A. I should believe that the metal is held on it by pliers, and worked with either sand-paper or cork, or any thing as they please, in rubbing that way (describing the manner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that produced by the other witness, the aqua fortis; is that aqua fortis? - A. I have no doubt but that is aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Q. Would aqua fortis be a necessary ingredient for colouring? - A. Aqua fortis is what brings the silver out of the metal to the surface.</p>
               <p>Q. And without which the purpose of colouring could not be effected? - A. I should believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is some vitriol found likewise; is vitriol an ingredient necessary to be used in that case? - A. In that case, I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have not made any experiment upon those blanks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not possible for you to say, whether by a repitition of this vitriol and aqua fortis any thing could be produced, so as to give them the colour and appearance of silver? - A. I have not made any experiment with aqua fortis upon these blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether these blanks, by the assistance of aqua fortis could have produced on them the colour of silver you cannot tell, as you have not tried? - A. I should be afraid to dare practise that without permission of the Court or the master of the mint, because I might bring a crime on myself.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you are clerk to Mr. Burnham, the solicitor of the mint? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been so many years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any experiment, with respect to any of this money that has been produced? - A. I have on two of the blanks which I received from Armstrong, I have tried an experiment, and I found that there is a considerable portion of silver in the metal, and that aqua fortis alone will give them the appearance of silver.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have tried them with aqua fortis? - A. I did; these are the two blanks (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Are these two you have put into my hands fit for circulation? - A. I did not not take pains to finish them, but merely to see whether aqua fortis would produce the effect; the files are not necessary in this case, the edges of the blanks, in the present instance, are turned with a lathe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is in your judgment? - A. I have no doubt of it; nor would files be necessary<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240007"/>for preparing the surface for colouring.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why? - A. Because the metal is sufficiently smooth, by the operation of the flatting mill, in flatting the metal, from which the blanks are cut; the sand-paper and cork would be alone sufficient for the smoothing of the surface.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you made an experiment, and you found that aqua fortis produced this colour; you did not do it with the aqua fortis found at the prisoner's lodgings, but with some you got elsewhere? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Aqua fortis by itself, without a particular preparation, will not have the effect? - A. It is too strong without being diluted with a little water.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean nothing else but water? - A. Nothing else; it would be too strong of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that cream of tartar is not necessary in raising the colour of silver on the surface? - A. Cream of tartar is often used in rubbing it to take off the blackness which is on the blank.</p>
               <p>Q. Without the assistance of cream of tartar or blacking, it would be impossible to give it the appearance of silver, so as to deceive the public? - A. It might be done with common salt only. I produce the two shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. That metal has a quantity of silver in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I find that these shillings you have been speaking to are very bad indeed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible that any man that has eyesight to take them for good shillings? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say it is impossible to be deceived by them? - A. They might take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say any man in his senses would take them? - A. Not if he looked at them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The question is whether a person might not take them without examining them? - A. They might.</p>

             Did you let this apartment to the prisoners? - A. I let it to her and another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom? - A. To Elizabeth Pagett, and I believe the other person's name was Brown,</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen that man there? - A. I have seen the man there, and other men there with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Every day? - A. No: I had not seen him there for a month or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you first let the lodgings to her? - A. I cannot say; it might be eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with her at the time of her hiring the lodging of you? - A. He was not, he came soon after I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after you saw him, he was not with her then? - A. No, it was only her and another woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. She worked in the box making line? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not live there, he only came there to see her? - A. He came there; she was often out; I have seen him there at times when she was at home; I know nothing of the man living there; the room was taken by that woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Armstrong.) Produce the fifty-nine shillings? - A. There are fifty seven there, and two Mr. Powel had.</p>
               <p>Vickery. I produce this one I hold in my hand; it has the letter S upon it, and I have got the punch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Which are the shillings that has been coloured? - A. Those three, they only want the blacking.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found seven sixpences, and three of them finished? - A. There are the three finished sixpences, they were with the other blank sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To the Jury.) These, gentlemen, appear to have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Vickery. They all looked much better when taken than now they have been handled by the officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I propose to shew the Jury the two shillings where the experiment has been made by Mr. Powel.</p>

               <p>Court. These two shillings were two of the shillings taken from the blanks, which have been coloured with aqua fortis; that is to shew you that aqua fortis will produce that colour of silver; not with the aqua fortis found in the lodging, but with aqua fortis of his own producing. (The whole of the articles found in the prisoner's lodgings produced in Court.)</p>

               <p>Q. When they surrounded you, do you recollect what they did, or what they said? - A. No, only that some women surrounded me, and soon after I missed every thing; I lost a parcel of Banknotes which I had in my pocket (they are not all mentioned in the indictment), and a gold French watch, a gold key, a gold mourning ring, a silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, a silver snuff-box, and a gold broach. I pursued after the women into Charles-court; I thought they went into a house with a large passage; I saw no more of them that night; I went in the morning to Bow-street, and to Queen-square: and there I heard my gold watch had been stopped by Mr. Courtney, shop-man to Mr. Wright, a pawnbroker; I went with Hobbs and Donaldson, the officers, to a public-house, the corner of Seymour-court, Chandois-street, and while Donaldson was gone to make inquiry three women came into the liquor-shop to have some gin; one of them had a silk handkerchief in her hand; she said it was going to be mangled, her name is English; I said immediately that that was my handkerchief; I desired Hobbs to take it from her, and look at it, and he would see the initial letters of my name.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the initial letters of your name found in the corner? - A. They were, and the number; Hobbs asked her where she got that handkerchief; she said she got it from her landlady, Mrs. Hartley; we detained her; there was another woman in company with her, and we went immediately down to English's lodgings, to the apartments of Mrs. Hartley.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house is that apartment in? - A. Mrs. Murphy's; we left Hobbs with English and Hartley: we searched the apartments and then searched her; in the pocket of Hartley was a pair of men's gloves; she said she had had them a fortnight in the house; I told the officer they were my gloves, for they were of a particular manufactory; they were made for my partner; they were too large; his name is Brown and on the inside was written Brown; Hartley said she had picked up the handkerchief at the door of her lodging the night before; she admitted that she had given it to English.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch, gloves, and handkerchief with you, when you met these women? - A. I had my gloves on; I am sure I had my watch and handkerchief, for I looked at my watch when I came out of the Blackjack at Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you put it in your pocket again? - A. I am sure of that; they took a gold ring off my finger, and my gloves from my hands; I believe English had no concern with the robbery from what she said at the time.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On Saturday, the 6th of April last, I with four others of my fellow servants, and a City constable, apprehended the prisoner in the neighbourhood of Angel-alley, in the parish of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate Without; I think it was in Read's court where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take him up on another charge? - A. Yes, we took him on another charge; I had received information that he had come from Botany-bay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had my pardon to go on board a man of war; I was salivated on board that man of war, and lost all my teeth and my lower jaw; the captain told me to go on shore about my business, when the ship lay at Cawsand-bay; they put me on shore at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any officer seen him before? - A.(Armstrong) I did; I saw him about a month before this time, and I left him in the care of the Compter; he was discharged for that offence.</p>
               <p>Vickery. I heard of this offence, and took him into custody; I had seen him before that morning, when I went to get two others.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prisoner.) Have you got any witness? - A. I wrote a letter down to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer; how came you to run away? - A. I did not run away.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked off? - A.They put me on shore; I lost my lower jaw and my teeth.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you purchased any sugar lately, previous to the time of finding this? - A. We had purchased a ton of sugar on the Tuesday previous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it turn out to be a part of that which was sold to you on Tuesday? - A. It did; we found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240011"/>it hid in some clover-hay in the lost; two two-gallon casks of rum, a stone bottle of rum, and several other bottles with shrub, and others with gin, and a tap-tub, were covered over with some rubbish.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had the controul and the key of the stable? - A. He had the key of the stable, and there was no other key, except one that was locked up in my desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding this, I presume you apprehended the prisoner? - A. I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass then? - A. Nothing but his saying he was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This man has lived with you so long a period as eight years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had a good character with him, from the master that he lived with before? - A. I had a good character so far that he was a good horseman.</p>
               <p>Q. The assistant had access to the stable the same as he had? - A. He was sent by the clerk to forward his horses to the time to go out.</p>

             sworn. - Knowing that we had lost a much larger quantity than we found in the hay-lost, on the 12th I went into the prisoner's lodgings with a warrant, and while the constable was searching the lodgings, I occasionally put my hand upon the sugar-bason, and found these two pieces of sugar, which I am as confident, as I am standing here, was part of the parcel that was taken away. (The two pieces produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Hubert.) Q. Will you have the goodness to look at these two pieces? - A. I believe them both to be the sugar that we sold to Messrs. Langdale.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. By what sugar-baker was it baked? - A. By Gibson and Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240012"/>Q. Has Gibson and Co. a patent to bake sugar different from all other sugar-bakers? are there no sugar-bakers that have sugar of the same quality? supposing that you had heard nothing at all of this charge, and I had met you any where, and I had shewed you this lump of sugar, should you have been able to say that they were of the parcel of sugar that was stolen from Messrs. Langdale? - A. Only by comparing them with the same sugar we had sold to Messrs. Langdale.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the first sugar whatever made of that quality? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sold from Gibson and Co. sugar of the same quality with that in your hand? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not every sugar-baker in London bake sugar of the same quality? - A. It is likely.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the quality and the mode of baking it, you believe it to be the same? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langdale. With respect to the key of the stable, I, on the Monday had occasion to go to look at the horses; the man was at his dinner; I could not get in, I have had an hundred quarrels with him for taking the key of the stable with him to dinner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The evidence has said it was generally open in the day time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langdale. With respect to the rum, I have tried them, they are of the same quality with that in the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the affair; my master has a key of the stable, and I have a key; sometimes the stable door is locked, and sometimes open.</p>

            ; two of them lived at Manchester, and one at Bethnal-green; I was the only person that kept the house: On the 18th of March last, about half past six, I was just come from my tea, the accompting-house is up one pair of stairs, I was about to go down stairs to shut the street door; I heard a gentle rustling of the straw in the passage, I suspected that somebody was at the packs, which stood in the passage; I came gently about half way down stairs, and saw the prisoner at the bar with his hands upon a pack of goods: I quickened my steps, and he turned from me and went towards the door; as I went down I perceived lying upon this pack, two white pieces of calico; I immediately ran and seized the prisoner; I asked him what he had been doing, he said he had been inquiring for a situation, I told him he had been cutting open that pack; I called for assistance to a person in the court; I returned to the pack, and found it had been cut open, out of which the two pieces before-mentioned had been taken, and a third piece was about half way out of the pack; I of course concluded that the prisoner was the man who had cut open the pack, and meant to take them away; I sent for a constable, and had the man immediately taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that they were removed from the place where they actually were? - A. The pack was cut open with a knife, and these things were taken from the inside, and laid upon the outside wrapper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time this transaction took place you were not a partner in the house? - A. No, I had no interest in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner saw you, he told you he wanted a place? - A. He asked me for a place; I said, I have got a place for you, and took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the goods were separated from the rest of the parcel? - A. The bale was really open, and these two pieces were separated from the rest, and a third piece was partly out.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable: I produce two pieces of calico; I saw these two pieces lying at the top of the pack, on the outside of the pack, and another piece was half out of the pack; I took him into custody and searched him, and in his left hand pocket I found that knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You found that knife in his pocket, so you might in any other man's pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Jones.) Q. Did you contribute towards paying the rent at that time? - A. No, except by my service.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You, I believe, are a city constable? - A. Yes: On the evening of the 15th of March, about ten minutes before nine, I met the prisoner going up Fish-street-hill; he was coming away from Thames-street, with a cheese under his right arm, supported by his smock frock; I tapped him on his shoulder, and said, my friend, what have you there; he looked at me, and seemed a little struck at first; he said he had a Cheshire cheese; I told him I saw it was a Cheshire cheese; I said, you must excuse me asking and stopping you, but I must know how you came by it; he said he was going up Fish-street-hill with it, he did not know where he was taking it to, but a man gave it him to carry; I asked him if he should know the man again; I said you must find the man that gave it you, or I shall not let you go, nor the cheese; he said he could find him; he then took me to Mr. Smith's, the prosecutor's shop, and either he or I knocked at the door and went into the house; there was nobody at home but the servant maid; I went then with the prisoner to his master, an orange-merchant just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that was his master? - A. Yes. In about five or six minutes I went again to Mr. Smith's, Gardner was at home, and Mr. Smith had just come in, he immediately saw Gardner, and I said, where is the man that gave you the Cheshire cheese; he said, here, that is the man that gave me the cheese? he saw him sooner than I did; Gardner was then coming down the stairs; I said, Gardner, was it you that gave this man the cheese; yes, he replied, I sold it to him for eight-pence a pound; Mr. Smith said what did the cheese weigh; I asked him that too; he said, 28 lb. Mr. Smith said, are you sure of it, he said, I am sure of it, Mr. Smith then asked him how he came to sell it; he looked round, and said, because he was a fool; I then took him into custody. I have had the cheese ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Then immediately when you went back to Gardner, and you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240014"/>asked where was the man that sold the cheese, there was no hesitation that he had sold it to the other prisoner? - A. He said he had sold it, and for eightpence a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time do you shut up the warehouse where you keep the cheese? - A. At eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person after you had locked it up, get at any cheese? - A. No, I had a partition erected for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the constable bringing any person to your house? - A. My father sent for me, I was at my house; I know no farther of my own knowledge; then the prisoner Gardner said, when I came to the warehouse, will you take the money, sir; I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the cheese to be your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark on it; what is the value of it? - A. About eightpence a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Then eight-pence would be the regular price that you would sell it for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Gardner was the person who regularly served as porter? - A. He has sold cheese; he had no right to sell any thing of that kind at that time of the night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is there any entry in your book of any cheese sold that day? - A. No; there was a cheese on that day sent to the Lord Mayor; that was thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have said, that he has sold cheese during the time of business, and he has accounted for it to you? - A. Yes, he always was to leave the money to another to take; he had no authority to put it in the till; when I came in and he was in custody, he offered me the money but I would not take it then; he had no right to sell at that time.</p>
               <p>Gardner's defence. On the 15th of March, about half past eight o'clock at night, Rawlins called at my master's warehouse, and said he wanted to buy a cheese, and there being two cheeses left under the counter, where the cheese stands in the day for sale, I weighed him one, which weighed thirty pounds; after I had weighed it, he said he had not got the money he would call the day following; I knowing the man, and where he worked, let him have it; I was not afraid of the money; I have been used to sell cheese, and firkins of butter, and sides of bacon, upwards of seven years, for Mr. Smith, and never had any fault found; if he was out of the way, I gave him an account of it when he came in, and if it was not paid for, he book'd it, or otherwise I gave him the money; it was not a customary thing to sell cheese so late at night as that, but sometimes I have sold cheese later than that by half an hour, when customers have called in, and never had any fault found about it.</p>
               <p>Gardner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Rawlins did not say any thing in his defence, not called any witness to character.</p>

            , jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner was in your employ; were you present when the prisoner's box was opened and the cheese found? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that cheese? - A. It has our mark; I took the officer down into the warehouse, to shew him the mark of the same dairy.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold any cheese of the same dairy with that mark on it? - A. None but what was shipped in the country to Kent and different parts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How many persons do you keep serving in your shop? - A. Only my partners, myself, and Gardner.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whether your partners had sold it to the prisoner you cannot tell us; it is single Gloucester? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of cheese of the same dairy had you left? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been ill just at this time? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He had made no application to you for any cheese? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he board in the family? - A. Yes; he had the same cheese and the same joint of meat as the family had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have no private mark on that cheese? - A. It is marked with our factor's mark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240015"/>which we can prove; it is marked with W. S. No. 2.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That other people may have as well as you? - A. There are no other people have cheese with our initials; our factor's name is Groom.</p>
               <p>Jury. I can vouch that Groom does not mark any other person's cheese with W. S.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been, for several winters past, troubled with a bad cough; on the 26th of February last I complained to my young master, Thomas, of the cheese that I eat; it was strong old Cheshire cheese; it made my cough much worse; I used to eat cheese twice a day, and on that day he cut that cheese, and gave me that which is now produced, and said, put it by, let nobody see it, and you can have a slice when you please.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>

These things in the basket, and the two tea-trays, have been sworn to by my prosecutor; I married on the 1st of April; Mr. Burn gave me leave to go out, and the wife that I married, her former husband was a tea-tray maker; he made these trays now in question; he has said he found these things about me; he only found three wine-glasses; he took the milk-pot off the desk, and then he put a private mark on them, and said he could swear to them, after he had put a private mark on them; they were on the desk.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On Monday, the 25th of March, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; I searched her, and found a duplicate, dated the 2d of February, for a shift, 2 s. 6 d. pledged in the name of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The day that she said the shift was lost in the evening, she asked me to get on as fast as I could with the ironing; I was never out of the house from the morning to the evening; Mrs. Jones said, there were four shifts, and you have taken in only three; she has sworn to that shift which I had last July, when I had a bad leg; I saw only three.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pawn it? - A. I bought that shift above ten weeks before I left Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know it by the stain; I had it to wash for a woman who had a bad leg and died; and the stain would not come out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Jones agreed to settle the business with me for a pound, for her husband's loss of time and her's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Is that true? - A. No such thing; there never was a word of that kind mentioned.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you occasion to go on board again on the 3d of March? - A. I had; the vessel then was in the dock; I unlocked the door of the cabin, and I found the prisoner at the bar standing in one of the lockers, that holds bottles for wine and other things: I seized him, and told him to come up; I took him out of the place where he was in and came upon deck; I let the prisoner go, as I was certain he would be stopped; seeing some persons at the Dock head, I called to them to stop him, which they did; I saw him searched, and there were sugar, chocolate, and some castors found upon him.</p>

Yes: on the 3d of March, I took the prisoner into custody within the Dock gates; I heard some person call out, stop thief; I being inside of the gates saw the prisoner; he seemed to be in a hurry to get out; I said, what have you been doing of; his reply to me was, I am very sorry for what I have done; I took him into an office inside of the gates, and searched him; I found four pounds of sugar, one pound of chocolate, and four small castors. (Produces them.)</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Was it part of the ship's cargo? - A. No, ship stores; it belonged to the shipowners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time I might have committed this I was in a state of insanity, which respectable people will come and prove. I have been commander of a ship these twenty years. Had I been in my proper senses, had it laid in the street, I should not have stooped to pick it up. I have a wife and children. Here are people who will prove that I have laid violent hands upon myself. It is a thing that I despise more than any thing in the world. I hope you will have compassion on me.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you heard nothing all the time of this transaction, and you were in the front room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of your property the next morning? - A. Yes; I left a pattern of the gown at a pawnbroker's, and I had not been home above half an hour before I received information from Mr. Clareson, the pawnbroker; I went to his shop, and there I saw the gown, and knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person at the pawnbroker's? - A. Yes, Sarah Archestone; she told me that it was another person that gave it to her to pledge and she would take me to the place; I went with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240018"/>her and Hobbs, the officer, to

The officer put down the bedstead to see for the bed, and my bed was there in her room, upon her bed; I know it was my bed by two pieces that I put on myself, and which I can swear to by those pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said then about the bed? - A.She said it was a strange person that brought the bed; the blanket was there likewise, and the skirt; the blanket was on the bed, the skirt was at the side of the bed; she said that

               <p>Q. Your front door was not locked or bolted? - A. No; I sell a little milk; the door is generally open in the day, but generally shut in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The window of this room you found open; it would have been difficult for any woman to have got over the paling of the yard; whether any man got over you do not know? - A. I do not think that any man could get over.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner Baker, after Archestone had got the gown, she told you she had got it, together with a bed, from a man of the name of Brown; not that he was a stranger altogether to her, but that his place of residence she was a stranger to. Is your bed a heavy one? - A. It is rather heavy, a woman was seen with it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker's servant, in King-street, Westminster: In consequence of Mrs. Smith's information, and she leaving a pattern of a gown, about a quarter of an hour afterwards, when the prisoner Archestone came to our shop, with a gown to pledge for eighteen pence, I compared the pattern of the gown with it, and it matched exactly; I then sent to Mrs. Smith, and detained Archestone; she said she was sent with it by another person; she did not say who the person was then; Mrs. Smith came and owned the gown; Hobbs came in a little while afterwards; I kept the gown, and he took Archestone into custody.</p>
               <p>- HOBBS sworn. - I am an officer: Smith gave me information the evening before: between eleven and twelve o'clock the next morning, I received information that a woman was stopped with the gown, at Mrs. Barry's, in King-street; I ran down and Archestone was in the shop; I asked her how she came by that gown; she said that a person had given it to her to bring it there to pledge; I asked her who the person was; she said she would not tell me who the person was, but she could take me to the woman; I and Mrs. Smith went with her to No. 33, Great St. Ann's lane, Westminster, up two pair of stairs, in a back-room, and Baker was sitting in the room; she said to Baker, I am stopped with your gown that you sent me with, to which Baker made no answer; I asked Baker how she came by that gown; she said it was brought there last night by a man; that is all she said at that time; I began to search the room, and pulled down the bed; it was a turn-up bedstead, and I found the bed and blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than one bed on the bedstead? - A. There were two beds on the bedstead, this lay uppermost; I found the skirt by the side of the bed on the floor; I asked her what became of the pair of sheets; she said she did not know any thing at all about the sheets; I asked her how she came by the bed; she said they were brought there by a man last night; I asked her what man it was; she said it was a stranger; I told her it was very unlikely that she would take a bed in of a stranger; she said she had seen him a few times, but not very often; he had called there sometimes to see her; I asked her where he lived; she said she did not know; she had heard him talk that he lived somewhere about the Bun-house, Chelsea. I took them both into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention his name to you then? - A. Not then, she did afterwards at the Office, before the Magistrate. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever been married? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Ray. On coming along, she acknowledged that she had lived with Mrs. Mordaunt, but she had never robbed her of any articles; I took her to the prosecutrix, and she said that was the person that had robbed her; on Monday I went with the prosecutrix, and there the things were found.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the door of your house left open? - A. Yes, the door is generally kept open till ten o'clock at night, I <rs id="t18050424-24-viclabel138" type="occupation">kept a pork-shop</rs>

                        targets="t18050424-24-victim287 t18050424-24-viclabel138"/>; I had a painter at a job at my house, and he went to the Office about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pipe brought to your house? - A. Yes, on the next morning, Harper, the officer, brought it, and it matched with what was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing about the prisoner? - A. No; I knew the pipe again by one joint that came out in the yard, it had been cut off before by a person unknown; I took a hammer, and beat it up, I know it by that; it matched with the cistern, and with the hole where the pipe had been beat up; I have no doubt in the least it is mine.</p>
               <p>- HARPER sworn. - I am an officer of Worship-street: On Friday, the 1st of March, I was walking about Shoreditch, at half past eight o'clock at night; I came up to the prisoner at the bar, and saw that he had something under his arm very heavy; he was walking from Norton-falgate to a house that buys all so its of goods; I took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240021"/>under the gateway of that house; before I took him, I saw the ends of the lead sticking out, wrapped up in a bag. When I stopped him under the gateway, I asked him what it was, though I saw it before; he gave me no answer about it at first, but at last he made answer that it was lead, and that I knew; he said that he bought it of some man, and gave eight shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the name of the man? - A. No; I think he said he had bought it that evening on Saffron-hill, I am not sure; I took him and the lead to the watch-house that night, and he was taken before the Magistrate the next morning; there were six pieces of lead pipe, and the cock fixed to one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been recently broke, or cut? - A. It appeared to have been fresh done.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to inquire about this lead? - A. There was a dispute about the lead between the prosecutor and the painter; the prosecutor suspected the painter. The painter came to the Office to clear his character, and then he heard of the man being taken with the lead; he sent the prosecutor to the Office, and soon after the prosecutor came to the Office; he said it was his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time go to Butcher's with the lead? - A. I did, and the prosecutor compared the lead before my face.</p>
               <p>Q. From that comparing, did it appear to have been taken from his cistern? - A. It did, to the best of my knowledge; it weighed fifty-six or fifty-seven pounds, the lead and cock altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it, when you first saw it, from the prosecutor's house? - A. About two hundred yards, and within fifty yards of the old iron shop, where they buy it; I produce the lead.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have not the least doubt in the world but it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Harper took me with this lead, as I was coming from the other end of the town; when I was coming home, I met with a man that had an ass, and a pair of panniers on its back; I had some broken glass that I purchased on my back, I purchase old metal and other things; I put down my glass on the ground, on the man saying to me, Jew, do you know where to sell any lead; I told him I did know where to sell it, and if in case he had any to dispose of, I would purchase it, if it was honestly come by; he told me that he purchased it in the country. He took it out of his panniers, and I looked at it, there were two different parcels of it; accordingly I asked him what he asked for it a pound, and he said, twopence farthing a pound; I told him I would give twopence; he told me he thought it was rather too little, but the person he used to deal with was dead, and he did not know where to sell it at that present time; I asked him what quantity there was of it; he said, to the best of his knowledge there were fifty-one or fifty-two pounds of it. I then told him I could not give more than twopence a pound for it; he said, you shall have it; I made answer, it is the best job we can do to get it weighed; he told me that it was not convenient in any shop to get it weighed, as they would not be troubled with it; I took the lead in my hand, I thought there was the quantity; accordingly I paid him 8 s. 6 d. for it; I paid him for the odd pound, and fifty-one pounds I paid him for; it was tied in several parcels. I took them, with my bag under my arm, as far as one Mr. Smith's, a china and glass shop, in Clare-market; I took the glass there, and disposed of my glass; I took this lead, I did not conceal it in my bag, and put it outside of the bag, not knowing that it was come dishonestly by, or was stolen by any body; if in case that had entered into my mind, I certainly should have concealed it inside of the bag. I made the best of my journey from Clare-market, to Mr. Revell, in Shoreditch, where I sold copper and brass; I am a man that was never before a Justice, nor any gentleman or constable; no man has seen any harm of me; at the time I was taken up I had only been in London three weeks; I came from Bristol, where I had lived twenty-one years; I am as innocent of the charge that is laid against me as the child from its mother; you may depend upon it that I really am; it is a thing that I was never guilty of in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harper.) Fix (as nigh as you can) the hour you saw the prisoner? - A. About half an hour after eight, not ten minutes over or under. He told me at the time that his father or people belonging to him lived at Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got an old father and mother in London; they are very old; my father is 92, and my mother is 72.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) When did you wash your hands last at this cock? - A. About seven o'clock; a gentleman came to me, and I looked at my watch to see what o'clock it was; it was as nigh seven as possible.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Harper.) When he was walking with the lead, was his direction from Clare-market? - A. He was walking the way as if he was coming from the prosecutor's house, and going to the house to sell the lead; that is the direction exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. It could not be that the lead had been to Clare-market and back again; the lead was safe at near seven o'clock, and at the time it is found on the prisoner it is half-past eight; when he is met at that distance from Clare-market, at Shoreditch. you know what a way that is from Clare-market,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240022"/>if it had been any way about Lincoln's Inn fields, he could not have come from Clare-market with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know these things? - A. Yes, I know them all to be mine; they were taken out of my back yard; they were put there to be cleaned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home from dinner to my work, and saw these things lying; I just took them up, and he said, what are you going to do with them; I said, if I find the owner of them, he shall have them. It is all done out of spite.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Shallard.) Did he tell you he had found them? - A. No, he said he was going to his master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before? - A. I have known him for these twenty years.</p>

               <p>Johnson. I know it by three marks, and likewise by the brass being broken at the bottom; I have seen it in the hot-house since his father has been dead; here are three marks that I cut off the degrees. I am sure it is Mr. Cockerill's.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday, the 10th of April, about eight in the evening, my wife hung out a counterpane on a pulley-line near the window, where I was sitting; she desired me to sit to watch it a little time, as it was a fine moonlight evening; I saw the pole rise the line; the line was fixed to each side of the window; I saw the prisoner in the act of taking the counterpane; I knew his person before; I was not above three yards from his head; I got the patrol to go with me to his house (he lives about three or four doors off), and we took the prisoner to the watch-house that night; in the morning his wife brought the counterpane back to me; this is the counterpane his wife brought back to me, and it is the counterpane he took off the line.</p>

Inquiring how he came by my property, he looked at me, and replied, your property! and violently struck at me with his fist; I then raised a hue and cry of stop him, or stop thief; I then got on my feet and ran and took him.</p>

             and another man; I had suspicion that they were doing something they should not do; I was on the watch, and saw them go up Galley-quay that leads to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other man at that time? - A. No; about the middle of the gateway, on the left hand side, there are steps that go into the warehouse; there is a side-rope, and the man that was with Anderson took hold of that rope and pulled it three or four times - whether it was a signal to any body inside I cannot tell; he then went up the gateway, and I saw no more of him;

            , the prisoner, placed himself nearly opposite to the loop-hole, at a cellar-window, nearly opposite to where the coffee came out; in a few minutes afterwards I saw this coffee in a bag thrown out of the loop-hole; Anderson then got from his station, where he was placed, and took the coffee up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Anderson so placed that he could see any body in the loop-hole? - A. Yes, and the man at the loop-hole could see any person facing it, and you could not see him where I was; Anderson was in a manner waiting for it; then I followed him immediately, and he turned on the right hand into Thames-street; he passed one gateway, and went down Brewer's quay gateway; he went to the water side and made a turn round, and came back and went to a jigger, or a capstan bar of a vessel; I stopped him in the crook of the lighter, and asked him where he got that coffee; he said out of a lighter; I told him he did not, and if he would go with me, I would shew him some more of the same sort, which he refused to do; after some little altercation, I persuaded him to go with me into the gateway; I desired him to put the coffee down, and compare it with the coffee on the ground, as the apron it had been tied up in had spilled some on the ground; I compared it, and the comparison was exactly alike; he would not give up the coffee to me, nor would he go away from the place; I then told him I should detain both him and the coffee, until I could get another officer to relieve me; in a few minutes a Custom-house officer of the name of Harding came, and I gave the prisoner in charge to him, the coffee lying then on the ground; I gave both to him, and remained on the quays watching; when Mr. Deer came from dinner I informed him of the circumstance, and he agreed to make a general search; it might be near half an hour before we made the search.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did any body come out of the warehouse at that time? - A. No, I was the person that locked it up; I stopped there to guard the warehouse; I watched it all the time I was there; I stood on the stairs; nobody could come out, and when it was unlocked I unlocked it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Anderson. Q. Pray, Mr. Wisdom, could you see the loop-hole from where you stood at the time the coffee came out? - A. I cannot say I could exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any place that it could come from but that loop-hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time you saw him pick up this coffee to the time you apprehended him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Anderson. Q. I went down Chester-quay gate with it? - A. No such thing, you passed Chester-quay.</p>
               <p>Q. I went to the lighter and picked it up - Did you find the coffee on me? - A. Certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. All the coffee that is in that bag? - A. That will be brought to light by the next witness.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you given in charge of the prisoner Anderson? - A. I took him in charge and the coffee, and lodged it in the King's warehouse till the Commissioners were gone; after that I have had it in possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing at the time when you apprehended him? - A. He told me that he would enter an action against me for his apron, and when I lodged the coffee in the King's warehouse he ordered me to put his name to it, as part of his seizure; I told him to go about his business; I said, you rascal, you are not worthy to come into such a place as this; I went into the warehouse, and I took charge of the prisoner myself.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took charge of him you told him to go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You took charge of the coffee and discharged him? - A. I did not discharge him, he followed me with the coffee.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He might have gone away with the coffee if he pleased? - A. No, he could not do that, because I took the coffee from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the man that you had with the coffee? - A. He stood on a lighter.</p>

               <p>Q. How could you find out the right of it to let the man go; I hope they will not keep you in the Custom-house any longer - At the time you did not keep the prisoner in custody, he remained on the quays? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You went up into the warehouse with Mr. Deer? - A. I did; when Mr. Deer opened the warehouse, he said, their he lies.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Hudson - Did you take him into custody? - A. Yes; he was lying on a kind of shelf, that had some tiles over it, facing the roof in the warehouse; I kept him there while Mr. Deer searched to see if he could find any picklock keys; I told Hudson that Peg-leg (Anderson has a wooden leg) had the coffee, and it was in my possession; he said he would give him a good basting for it; Mr. Deer came and said to Hudson, my good fellow, how did you get up into this warehouse; he said he walked up; Mr. Deer said, you had better tell the truth; then he said, Peg-leg told me, if I came up here, I should find some coffee; I brought him down stairs, and hand-cuffed him, and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have not told us when you took Anderson? - A. In about half an hour afterwards; I knew him perfectly; he was what we call a scuffle-hunter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A frequenter of the Quays? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you took him afterwards on the Quays, on Mr. Deer desiring you to do it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you notice any of the bags? - A. I found that a bag was cut; I have every reason to believe that the coffee came out of that bag.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. During the time I was in Mr. Newcomb's employ, I was in the habit of working at home, doing jobs and likewise new work; I have taken gold as part of payment, and I have bought gold of the refiners. In regard to that cloth found in my pocket, I had brought it from home, with intent to go to the flatting-mills with it, not having fire enough at home. I suppose some of Mr. Newcomb's men had a little spite against me, and they had said something to Mr. Newcomb that made him search me, and finding these things about me, he might think them his own. As to Mr. Newcomb's, jun. seeing me file metal into the tray, it is very common, we use metal in our work.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect ever being present at any church where she was married? - A. Yes, on the 4th of October, 1799, at St. George's in the East, I was witness to the marriage of a man of the name of Hamlyn, and the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long is it since you have seen Hamlyn? - A. I saw him to day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How were they married? - A. They were married by licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she an English woman? - A. I believe she is; I saw her married to that man; I believe you will find my name in the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Where did you come from now - You have just come from the New Inn? - A. No, nor the Old Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a little in the sun? - A. I have not seen the sun-shine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as sober as ever you were? - A. I believe I am.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a great many years ago? - A. Not quite seven I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to recollect the time - You do not know what this woman was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Hamlyn? - A. He was a baker by trade, and is now, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How came you to recollect the year and the day? - A. Sometimes one makes a memorandum of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you make a memorandum of the day and the year that this woman was married? - A. It is at home, I suppose; I have not got it here; I can recollect such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I am afraid you have been drinking; I will not have any flippance in witnesses - How came you to recollect the day? - A. Very well, your Worship; likewise I have it in the register, in my own name; I have a memorandum somewhere, if I have not lost it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When were you applied to, to become a witness? - A. On Tuesday night last, between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the woman, from the year 1799 to the Tuesday night after she was in custody? - A. I have seen her for three or four years since.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have seen this memorandum since Tuesday last, or how came you to recollect the day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Because that would refresh your memory? - A. I have said all that I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason that you recollect it at all is, you had made a memorandum of it; you were not applied to till Tuesday last; how did you know when you were applied to on Tuesday last what day it was; did you look for the memorandum? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How came you to refer to the memorandum in the first outset of the business? - A. I recollect it very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. We have no doubt at all that she is the woman that was married to the man at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she call on you? - A. No, only where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying only, are you married to another? - A. I said only at our house; she did not come into my room, because I cohabit with another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you indicted her for marrying another, and you cohabit with another yourself? - A. She married another.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays the expences of this prosecution? - A. The first husband, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does he pay you? - A. He pays me nothing; I come of my own free will; he applied to me to prosecute; he found out where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Or else you would not have prosecuted? - A. I do not know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife has left you, and you are living with another woman, that is the history, is it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A very pretty history too; when did you come from sea last? - A. In November about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You were married in the year 1802? - A. I was married about three or four days after I came from sea.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you persuade her or she you? - A. She persuaded me as much as I did her; it is so long ago I cannot hardly say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live together before you were married? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire about it, whether she was single or married? - A. I never inquired about it.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom? - A. To Mrs. Senor.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom do you expect to get that? - A. From Mr. Hamlyn, to pay my expences for attending here, and neglecting my work.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a tool-maker to Messrs. Bateman; they are silversmiths in Bunhill-row? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing, and what? - A. I believe it was the 12th of March, on Tuesday; I was looking out of the back window which looks to the North, I was looking there two or three minutes, turning aside from my board; there was something attracted my sight; I returned back, and turned my head again, and looked more steadfastly towards the window, and by the reflection of the sun I could see some round pieces, but I could not tell what they were; the window where I saw this was in the one pair of stairs, and I was in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know who lived there at that time? - A. I did not; I turned my head, and saw that, and I made it my business to look more minutely into it, and I saw several pieces lying on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240030"/>the table, but I could not distinguish what colour they were, but apparently they were white; the window was very dirty; that was the first day, about half past twelve; the business was carried on between eleven and one. On Wednesday I happened to look again, as I had suspicion, and I saw the same business going on; the different pieces apparently were shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was these shillings, as you supposed them to be? - A. Laying on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with them? - A. The prisoner at the bar; he was sitting at the side of the table; I saw him rubbing them with something, but I could not tell what; he appeared to be rubbing these pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him on the 12th and 13th, so as to see he was employed? - A. Yes, each time I saw him, and every time after he had done he washed himself, and scoured his hands a great deal indeed. On Thursday I saw the same process again, and rubbing and washing his hands, and two basons and a phial stood upon the table, and also the pieces were on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he rubbing then? - A. Yes, I saw him rub them between his finger and thumb, and after that I saw him shaking the pieces in something, but I could not tell what; I saw the phial on the table, and I saw him pour part of the contents of it into a bason that stood on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the pieces? - A. They were put into a bason, and shook about; they were after that taken out of the bason, and put into a cloth, and they were shook about.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shook about in the bason, or in the cloth only? - A. In the cloth only; this was on the Thursday, and I think it was on that day that he washed himself very minutely, I believe all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe at all the colour of his hands? - A. No; I could see the soap on his hands when he was getting the dirt off; on the Friday there was much the same process, and he engaged in the same way, and on Saturday likewise. On the Saturday I communicated to my master what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you communicate what you had seen to any Office? - A. I did, to Mr. Moser, the Magistrate, in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that communication, did you go with the officer afterwards? - A. The officer appointed a house to meet me afterwards, and Ray was with me at my own shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that Ray was with you at your shop? - A. On Monday, I took Ray up with me to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see on Monday the same as you saw before? - A. I did; the business then did not begin till past one o'clock; I saw it after Mr. Ray went; on Tuesday, Mr. Ray came up into the shop, and he was satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday did you see with Ray what you had seen before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Ray was satisfied with what he had seen? - A. Yes; then the officers went; I was in the room just after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed them where to go? - A. Yes, they went backwards, over the premises of my employer; two of them did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have said there was some dirt about the window; was there enough to prevent you from seeing the colour of the pieces? - A. Sometimes the window was open; then I could see distinctly the white pieces of some substance or other.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Tuesday, the 19th of March, the information I had from the last witness led me there; about half past eleven o'clock in the day, I went into the work-shop with the last witness, Ware; I was looking out of the window up two pair of stairs, and I had a full view of the prisoner's room, which is only one pair of stairs from the ground; the first sight that I had of the prisoner was on his coming to the window with a bason, and something in it, which he threw out of the window, and then pulled down the window, and he went by the side of a table, I saw that very plain; I then saw him with something in a coarse towel, which he was shaking backwards and forwards; sometimes I saw him put it down on the table, and it seemed to me like round pieces of metal; he opened the cloth, and looked at them, and what was in the cloth appeared to me like round pieces, resembling shillings; he then put them in the cloth again, and kept on shaking them backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might this last? - A. About four or five minutes; when I saw that the second time, I was satisfied; Armstrong, Vickery, Mason, Bishop, and Kennedy, were in waiting very near to the prisoner's apartment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you point out to them what you had seen? - A. I went and communicated to them what I had seen, and they immediately repaired, some to the front of the house, and I and Bishop went through the back of Mr. Bateman's place, to the back of the prisoner's house, and we got over the place; Armstrong had got into the front before we got into the back part of the premises; the prisoner was secured, and then the other officers proceeded to search; I secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing took place on securing the prisoner? - A. That the other officers will explain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was there any other person in the house? - A. Not in that room; in the house there was a shoe-maker, at the bottom part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240031"/>house, at work; I am positive of the man, I knew him before.</p>

             sworn. - I and Vickery went up one pair of stairs, and I put my shoulder to the door, and opened it; I believe Vickery had his foot in the room before me; when I got into the room, the prisoner stood with his back rather sideways; I went round, and caught hold of his hand, and said, Mr. Field, is it you, and I secured thirty counterfeit shillings and nineteen sixpences in his hand only. When I called him Field, his hand opened, and some of them dropped, and I picked them up, I have them here; I then put them on the table, and wiped them, they being wet, in the presence of the prisoner and the officers; they seemed as if they had just come out of liquid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe of what nature the liquid was? - A. I could not; I then desired the officers to look particularly to his hands, and I did so too.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of his hands? - Exactly in that state as if he had been using aqua-fortis; it colours the fingers ends; the nails will turn yellow, and the flesh will turn black.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen hands at first after using aqua-fortis, so that you know it produces black on the flesh, and yellow on the nails; had it that appearance? - A. Yes; I then looked to the fireplace, and by the fire there was a pitcher of cold water; by the side of that laid a phial, which had been recently broken, some of the pieces laying on the hearth, and some on the fire-place; I then went, and searched the other parts of the room; the prisoner said, Armstrong, you have got all; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to see what liquor it was that was spilt? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went with Armstrong to the front of the house? - A. Yes, I was the first in the room, the door was on the latch; I believe the prisoner was standing with his hands behind him, and with his back to the fire; Armstrong caught hold of him by the left hand; he looked in his face; I took him by the right hand; and when he said, Field, at that time five of the blanks dropped on the floor, directly he let his hand go; Armstrong called him by name, and he took this money from him; he had nothing in his right hand. I proceeded to search, and I found this piece of rag, it has been opened; here is a bit of woollen cloth, and a quantity of base metal that was in it, twelve counterfeit shillings and four counterfeit sixpences; three of these shillings appear to have been quite finished for circulation; on a shelf close to the back of the prisoner was this piece.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a shilling of another kind? - A. It is entirely brass, it is a blank; upon the same shelf I found another shilling in this piece of paper; it appears to be finished for circulation; in another part of the room, from behind a picture, this dollar fell; this has been recently finished.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is a counterfeit dollar; is that coloured in the same way? - A. Yes, by the same process; this apron he had on, with the wet marks on it; it is mouldy now, but it had white places on it, as if he had been using cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. Yes, this cloth was laying, part in a pail and part out, close to where the prisoner was standing, and there were visible marks, where blanks had been shaken in this bag with cream of tartar; there were places that was quite wet, of a whitish colour; there was a phial that had been broken by a fall, and there were some pieces laying on the ground, and I saw one piece by the fire, that was the neck of the phial; I saw Bishop stoop, and taste that on the fire, where there were parts of the broken phial, and by the side of the fire stood a large stone pitcher of water, and a bason of water on the table, which tasted saltish; it was either salt water, or salt used in it. After we had secured the prisoner, he begged that his landlord might be sent for, and the landlord was sent for to come up into his room; he desired Armstrong to take his keys out of his pocket, and to take half-a-crown out of his chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the landlord? - A. I believe his name is Sword; he said that we had got all; he was perfectly civil, and did not make the least resistance in the world.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. When I went into the room, I observed a phial had been broken on the hearth; I put my finger to it, and tasted it, and I found it was aqua-fortis; I took up a little bit of glass likewise, and tasted that, and that was the same, it was a strong acid; the prisoner said it was only a gin-bottle that had been broken there; I know aqua-fortis both by taste and smell, I have no doubt of it; on the shelf I found this horn, which contained some blacking; in the cupboard I found a punch, with the impression of a star; in the same cupboard I found this sand-paper, or scouring-paper, and a piece of cork; in a little box in the cupboard, I found two papers, each containing cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not bring any part of this before the Magistrate, to prove that it was aqua-fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Armstrong.) Look at the sand-paper? - A. It is a thing that is always found under these circumstances; cork, blacking, and cream tartar, is always used; the aqua-fortis always brings the white colour first; the cream of tartar is used after the aqua-fortis and the blacking; they are all such things as I have found in these places</p>

               <p>Q. What is the use of aqua-fortis; what does the operation of aqua-fortis produce upon the blanks? - A. It destroys the base metal, leaving the silver particles on the surface, and it is that by which the colour of silver is produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what is the use of cream of tartar? - A. In cases of this fort it removes the blackness which remains, and the acid of the cream of tartar takes off the aqua-fortis that is left there, and fixes the colour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is performed by rubbing them in a cloth? - A. That is to dry them, after they have been immersed in this sort of pickle; after they have been coloured, they are put in cold water, and after the aqua-fortis has done its office, they remove what is left by washing.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen your cellar - do you know what state it was in? - A. I saw it every day and every evening of my life; I saw it an hour and a half before that, and it was all safe, and perfectly right.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked for that purpose? - A. I look every night of my life, I never miss; after he had made his escape through the window, I turned into the kitchen; there is an entry into the street; I went into the street, and desired somebody to run and fetch the peace-officer directly, there being a number of people about the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look and see if there was any thing left there? - A. Yes; there was a kind of an old lantern, a bag, and a chisel.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there when you were in your cellar before? - A. No, no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your cellar? - A. I cannot say, there were such a number of things; the moment I got up, I sent for a peace-officer, and the moment the peace-officer came, I desired some of them to go and search his house.</p>

I saw in his basket the handle of a a tool; I said, Smith, you have got some tools as well as chips; I must search your basket, and see what you have got; he said I should not, and resisted me; I pulled the basket from him, and turned out a large axe concealed among the wood; on my examining it, he took up the basket and was going off; I said to him, I shall see the bottom of it; he said there was nothing in it but some wood; on turning out what was at the bottom of the basket, I found four pieces of leather; I said it was very much like my harness that was stolen last night, you shall go with me, and we will compare it with that which is left; he said he would not, and we had a scuffle; he kicked, and tried all he could to get away from me; he said he had got a wife and six children, and begged I would not detain him; I took him by the collar, and brought him home by force, and examined the pieces; they tallied with what was left in the stable, and I have no doubt but they are part of the same harness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came from Rumford at almost half an hour after six o'clock, and was going round the premises, when I was told to take the bits of wood up, and among the rest I took these bits of leather, which the man gave to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is that man? - A. I never saw that man before; he appeared to be a carpenter.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 10th of February you observed the Maria cutter, and afterwards you went on shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wren, another officer, commanded another boat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going in the execution of your duty, to search for the supposed cargo of the Maria? - A. I did, and when I went on shore, I heard several musquets fired; there were not any shots in the musquets; I did not hear any shots whistle.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive from whence the firing came? - A. Yes, from the village.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it near the place where you found the casks piled up? - A. Close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many reports of pieces were there? - A. About half a dozen or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Fired at once or successively? - A. At different times, and several stones were thrown at me and my crew just after we landed.</p>
               <p>Q. When the stones were thrown at you what number of people were there? - A. I could not see many of them just at that time; they all ran away, and went behind hedges or corners of houses; there might be half a dozen or more.</p>
               <p>Q. The stones were thrown at you, and some of your men were hurt by the stones at that time? - A. I ordered my men to return the fire, to clear the beech.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to intimidate and clear the place, your men fired? - A. Yes; I made a seizure of one hundred ankers that lay on the beech, below high-water mark, very near where I landed first, and after that I found out three hundred ankers on the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you made the seizure of the first hundred were the other three hundred on the quay? - A. Not a stone's throw.</p>
               <p>Q. At the removal of the one hundred towards the three hundred what took place; where you interrupted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were altogether afterwards; how-many of your men might there be about the four hundred that surrounded the quay at this time? - A. I had thirteen men and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was it when you secured the hundred to the other three hundred? - A. About eight o'clock in the evening, on the 10th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an evening? - A. It was rather a close evening but a very good moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was not totally dark? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place when you were there? - A. After I secured the seizure, I hauled my boats up, as there was a great deal of sea running on the shore, to secure them from the surge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you returned of course to protect the seizure? - A. Yes; in the course of the evening there were several men came down that appeared to be smugglers, while I was taking care of the seizure, one of which was a tall man, of five feet ten, with a whip in his hand, a great coat, and boots; he insinuated to me to give up half the seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. That you refused to do? - A. Yes; Joseph George and his wife came down frequently, and informed me that the smugglers intended to attack me, and rescue the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife come down with him the first time? - A. No.</p>

             came down to apprize you of their intention? - A. Yes; the smugglers came down often from eight o'clock in the evening till one o'clock in the morning; about one o'clock in the morning they began to attack us with firearms and stones in great numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many fire-arms might be discharged? - A. A vast number; I suppose thirty or forty musquets, distinct musquets, and several discharges.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of your men hurt with the discharge of the first firing? - A. The very first fire of the musquets one of my men was wounded in the head.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having received their fire, what was done by you and your men? - A. Then we returned the fire as fast as we could; they were behind the boats; we could not get at them, only when they came down in numbers upon us.</p>
               <p>Q. So that they fired upon you from sheltered places, from behind the boats and houses - How long might this sort of work continue? - A. Upwards of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a constant firing kept up by you for the course of an hour? - A. Yes, we fired upon them the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they first come on upon you? - A. They came upon us in a large number, huzzaing.</p>
               <p>Q. During this were any more of your men hurt than you have described? - A. Four more wounded, three dangerously.</p>

               <p>Q. For what did you send him towards them; with any instructions? - A. I did it in order to intimidate them, if he could, to secure the seizure, and if it had not been for him we should have lost the seizure, and been fairly beat; he contributed very much to our help.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent - Was his wife near you at the time? - A. She was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any other woman in the course of the night, that there seemed to have been amongst the parties? - A. There was a pike brought down called one of the fencible pikes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that? - A. Mrs. George brought that to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any offence committed upon you at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning you seized the goods and carried them off? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you had an opportunity of making any observations on the prisoner at the bar (look at him) prior to the skirmish? - A. I saw him there; he solicited me to give up his boat, which was seized some months prior to the 10th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seized any boat of his some months before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he applied to you on this occasion for the return of the boat? - A. I told him I could not do any such thing; he might ask Capt. Stoneham in the morning, if he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear satisfied or not with this answer? - A. Not perfectly, I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue or stop talking with you? - A. Some little time, and then he went away; I do not know where he went.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot identify his person as being one of those who assaulted you and Mr. Wren, who are commissioned officers of the Excise? - A. Mr. Wren is not a commissioned officer; he is a cutter's mate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is conferred on him by the Excise? - A. Yes, he is one of the crew of our cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more than three people at the time this firing was? - A. I could not see the musquets, they were out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear their explosion, so as to be satisfied there were more than three people at that time? - A. Certainly there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgment of the number that were there that fired? - A. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Just tell the number of reports there might be? - A. Half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see three men at a time that were there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the firing was such, that it was impossible that all that firing came from one or two musquets, successively used? - A. There might be more than two.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the whole firing could not proceed from two musquets? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment of the number of people that were collected at the time the firing ceased? - A. About fifty; they come down with a party of twenty or thirty men with stones, and the firing lasted at intervals for an hour; at one o'clock it began, and continued for an hour, and then it ceased.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He employed me the next morning to get a boat, to assist to carry the goods off on board the cutter.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you sent to? - A. To assist Mr. Parry; by the signal that we had, we thought he was on shore; we pulled within a mile and a half of the shore, and we met Mr. Parry in a boat; we went from Mr. Parry, and pulled round the bay, to see if we could find any thing, and then we pulled back again to <placeName id="t18050424-38-crimeloc223">Selin Cove</placeName>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by flashes from the shore? - A. From arms, or from musquets or pistols, we could not tell which; we hailed the shore, and some person answered, which we took to be Mr. Parry, and from that we pulled on to the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went on shore, had you observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240036"/>any thing? - A. No; when we came on shore, the first thing we saw was about an hundred ankers, as nigh as we could guess; Mr. Parry ordered us to carry those goods on the quay; we carried them upon the quay, and after we had done that, we hauled our boats up, and form that we stationed ourselves (by Mr. Parry's orders) each side of the goods, keeping guard over them; the people came down, sometimes ten or twelve, and sometimes three or four at a time, from eight o'clock till one in the morning; they came in different numbers, at different times.</p>

               <p>Q. What people do you mean? - A. Men came down; they had nothing with them as we saw; they kept coming down from that time to I suppose about a quarter before one; there was a good many came down and shook hands with several of us, and said, if you behave civil to us, we shall behave civil to you, and then walked away, and one of them said; d - n him who turns Judas, and walked up to the mob, and whether that man was the first that spoke to us I cannot say; they then said, one and all; they gave three cheers and fired one musquet, or something was fired, and by our officers orders, we returned the same and the cheers also, and so it continued, with heavy firing, with stones between, for ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the firing proceed from more than one gun in the course of ten minutes? - A. I suppose there where two or three musquets firing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be firing from different musquets? - A. There was a man got between the boats, and he kept a continual firing upon us, not above a stones throw from us; he fired small shot; by the appearance it was a musquet that he had got.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he firing at the time, while the firing was going on, when you said there were two or three musquets firing? - A. Yes; one of our men presented to him, and fired at him but missed him; this man continued firing from this time a continual firing; the other part of the mob throwing stones as well; I suppose a quarter before one, I received a full charge of the slugs and shot; I had one in each hand, two in my side, and one in my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe you to be lame at this time? - A. I have one in my knee at this time, near the bone; I have the shot to shew now which was taken out;

               <p>Q. You saw the hundred ankers on the beach; did you see any persons with fire arms there? - A. I saw three musquets, just after we got on shore, in the hands of three different people, at the time we went on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these persons near one another, or were they at a distance from each other? - A. One was further over the quay, and one from the window of a house, and the other was further in among the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house is it? - A. It is a kind of a dwelling house, but there is no person living in it; it is a store house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that all you saw, just three and no more? - A. I did not see any more than three.</p>
               <p>Q. After you saw these three what did you do with yourselves? - A. We carried these goods up from the beach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry them to? - A. Up to the other ankers.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there did you see any people there? - A. There were a great many at first, but they went away then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they continue quiet for any length of time? - A. Yes, they were very quiet for a long time; they began to molest us about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place about one o'clock? - A. There was a man that came to us and shook hands with several of us, and shook hands with me in particular, and said, men, be honourable and we will be the same to you; then he went away, and said, d - n and b - r the first that turns Judas, and went up the hill to the mob, and gave three cheers, one and all, then they began heaving of stones, and fired one musquet in the first place.</p>
               <p>Q. Any firing afterwards? - A. Yes, there was firing afterwards at different places, at a corner of a house, and then again between the boats.</p>
               <p>Q. How many musquets were there firing at that time - did you apprehend six or eight? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there were more than three? - A. The firing was in three different places; there certainly must be more than three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more than one gun fired off at each place? - A. There certainly must be more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one at each place do you mean? - A. Yes, I think there was.</p>

Ten or twelve shillings; there were twenty-three casks of Scotch raw spirits there, in hogsheads and puncheons; I took him to the Excise watch-officer at St. Dunstan's hill, and after I had him and the great coat up, I heard something drop; I picked it up, and found it was a large rusty gimblet; I searched him, and found four spiles that had been used and two that had not been used, and two corks; he downed upon his knees and begged for mercy; he owned he was guilty.</p>

             sworn. - On the 11th of March, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise, apparently in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240039"/>one pair of stairs room, which Mrs. Grace rents of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason to know that that was the precise time? - A. I know that was the time, I looked at the clock; I went up to the landing-place, and I found the door was broke open; I did not like to go any farther; I put my finger to the door, and it came open; then a man sprang from the landing-place of the two pair of stairs, and asked me if that was Mrs. Grace's; I charged him with breaking the door open, and sent for a constable and he was searched; we found nothing on him but a direction from Mrs. Inch; he said he had come from Mrs. Inch, and that was the direction from Mrs. Inch, who had been nurse to Mrs. Grace three weeks before; the prisoner said that Mrs. Inch had sent him there to call on Mrs. Grace, to make up a quarrel that had been that day between Mrs. Grace and Mrs. Inch; the padlock was found the next morning in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mrs. Grace? - A. She was gone out that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come into the house? - A. My door is always open till nine o'clock, my wife being in the milk business.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the door being shut? - A. She told me so, and gave me charge; the next morning an iron crow was brought to me found on the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the clock in order to know whether it was the time of night to get the reward? - A. Far be it from me; my wife desired me to look at the clock, because I might be brought to a farther account.</p>
               <p>- GRACE sworn. - On the 11th of March I was obliged to go between six and seven o'clock to Mrs. Gray, that I wash for; I had not been there long before I received information that my room had been broke open; when I came to the lodgings I found the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No; I know Mrs. Inch; she was sister to my husband; she was with me in the afternoon; he came with the direction; he communicated to me Mrs. Inch wished to make it up; we had quarrelled a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have never seen Mrs. Inch since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went to enquire about Mrs. Inch? - A. No, I think she is too wicked a woman for that young man to have any connection with.</p>
               <p>Q. What wickedness do you know of her? - A. She was very good before my husband died; after that she behaved very uncivil and cross.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds as well as the last witness? - A. I do not know the meaning of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.At the time you searched him, if he had any of these things about him you must have found them? - A. Yes.</p>

Not hearing him knock, I stood and listened, and heard him coming down the garret stairs, (I live in the kitchen, and sleep in the garret), I ran up stairs, and met him; I went into the garret, and missed my cloak; I called out immediately to the gentlemen to stop him; I said, he has got my cloak; they stopped him, and took the cloak from his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- SURMUDO sworn. - I heard Mrs. Peters call out, stop him, he has got my cloak; I immediately jumped from my desk, and asked the prisoner what he wanted, I saw that he had a bundle; he turned round, and was walking down stairs; I laid hold of him, and pulled out the cloak from his breast.</p>
               <p>(The cloak produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, with permission I will make bold to speak, to acquaint your Lordship that an old ship mate of mine told me there was a merchant lived there, who wanted a cook to go out with him; I will tell you my Lord, that I went into the gateway, there was a woman coming out, and I saw that bundle lay on one side of the door; accordingly I picked it up, but never opened it; I went up stairs, and came down again; I do not know whether that is the woman, or not, but a woman halloaed out, they have got it; I picked it up at the door. I am a seaman bred and born; I have been in his Majesty's navy fifty-four years, and have received several wounds in his Majesty's navy; in the wars I have stood in my blood, and lost my flesh, and lost the use of my arms; I have failed round the globe, and have been in every action at sea almost for fifty-five years; I could not go before the mast now, but I would endeavour to go as cook, as old as I am; I was seventy-seven years of age last Christmas-day; I am not able now to hand a top-sail, or reef a top-mast, but I could cook for all hands; I have spilt my blood against all usurpers and tyrants, like Buonaparte; I was at the Nile with Admiral Nelson, when he took, sunk, and destroyed the French; I call God to witness that is the way I came by it; I found it at the door.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Peters.) Was your cloak down stairs at all? - A. No, it was up in the three pair of stairs room; I found the drawer open when I went up stairs.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are overseer to Mr. Dewick, of course you know the prisoner's name? - A. I always understood his name was Johnson; I did not know that he assumed any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recommend the prisoner to sell any property to Mr. Thompson? - A. Never. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I carried these articles to the house of Mr. Thompson, for the behalf of the widow of one Simpson. This Simpson had the same access to this property as I had, provided it is Mr. Dewick's property; he was employed by Mr. Dewick to melt a quantity of old metal, and to cast them into types of different descriptions; Mr. Dewick has delivered a vast quantity to him at various times; there are a great many of these that are used in printing-offices in town; there is no private mark can be on them; how can Mr. Dewick swear that it is his property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is the widow? - A. She is gone home to her native country; she is a native of North Britain.</p>
               <p>Dewick. A man of the name of Simpson worked in my house for two or three days; I never sold him a single letter or metal of any description; that is two years ago; here are letters in this box that have been cast for me since the death of Simpson; he died in May, 1804; this property was sold in December, 1804. He never occupied any thing but a garret; it was not likely he should have this property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were a great concourse of people? - A. There were.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Between eight and nine is a very busy time? - A. Yes. we had a number of customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might your position be from the shop door? - A. Three yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons standing at the door, you could not see when they were stooping, at that distance, what they were doing; you were busy; it might be an act of picking up, instead of putting something down; had you any steps? - A. Two steps to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of course from the descent you could not see the level of the street? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent indeed; as I went into the shop I saw a woman coming out; the shop was full of people; there were as many as eight or ten people, and they said I was not the woman; there were hundreds of people round the watch-house, crying out, shame on him, and said they would come if they were wanted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What was his way of life? - A. He came to town <rs id="t18050424-57-deflabel326" type="occupation">to learn the art of shoemaking</rs>

               <p>Q. On Sunday, the seventh of April, had you fastened your bed-room door? - A. Yes, I was the last person that was in it; we have our candles in a large box, in that same room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to bed then? - A. No it was before bed time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you fasten the door? - A. Between the hours of seven and eight, then I fastened the door; I had a candle in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. It was hardly dark then? - A. It was very near; I had a candle in my hand; that was not the door that was broke open, there were two doors that went into the room; that one was nailed up which was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the door by which you usually go into the room that was broke open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that door that was nailed up, so as to see that it was safe? - A. When I went up stairs to fetch the candles, I shut the door and locked it, and I saw after that all was safe myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in his lodgings at that time? - A. He was in the tap-room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the bed-room door open? - A. About eight o'clock, or some time after, the prisoner asked me for a candle to go to bed, and went up stairs; between that and nine he came down again, and brought the candle down in his hand, and said to a lodger of mine he would go and see Mr. Staggs, meaning the man who was learning him to make shoes; he went out and stopped till between ten and eleven; he returned with Staggs and another man, and had two shillings worth of gin and water; then Staggs said he would go home and go to bed, and get up early in the morning; he had some work to finish to go home to shop; the prisoner said he would take a walk with him; I persuaded him not to go out any more that night, if he did, he would be locked out; Staggs said he thought he had better go to bed; with that I reached a candle off the table and the prisoner and I went up stairs together; Staggs went away, and the other man; I and the prisoner went up to bed; I staid in his room till he went to bed; when he had nearly undressed himself, he unlocked his box, he shoved down a canvass bag, with a quantity of penny-pieces and new halfpence, which gave me suspicion that he had done something that he ought not to have done; going down stairs I saw my room door broke open that was nailed up; I went down to the bar, and got the key of the door, by which we used to go into the room; and when I went in I missed my tea-chest off the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the tea-chest placed there? - A. On the table in the bed-room; I went down stairs on missing it, and asked Mrs. Tillett if she had moved it; she said, no; I then went into the adjoining room, and there I saw most part of the tea-chest, it was broke open; I found some in one place and some in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lid broken off? - A. Yes, it was broken into pieces very much; I went into the adjoining room up two pair of stairs, adjoining to where he slept, and there I found the prisoner's knife and one part of the tea-chest, and a small old chopper</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's knife? - A. I really believe it to be so, for I saw that one, or one like that, in his possession, on Sunday morning; I then went down stairs, and said to Mrs. Tillett, I will go to Lambeth-street, and fetch an officer; she said, pray do not go out now, you had better stop, and let the watchman go; I called the watchman in, and asked him if he could take the man up; he said he could, as well as any officer in England, and I gave the prisoner in charge of the watchman; when he got up, I said to him, what do you do with that nightcap; he pulled it off, and threw it between the head of his bed and his box; we took him to the watch-house and searched him, and nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned and came back with the watchman to the room; how long were you absent from the room? - A. I look upon it about half an hour; we searched the box first, and found eleven shillings and nine pence in penny-pieces and new halfpence, in a canvass bag; then I picked up the night-cap, and in the night-cap we found a 5 l. note, a 2 l. note, and six 1 l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of these notes? - A. Two of them, the five and one of the ones, by the names that were on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240047"/>Q. Do you know how many notes there were in this tea-chest? - A. I cannot take upon me to say how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of this tea-chest; who put them in? - A. Sometimes I put them in, and sometimes Mrs. Tillett, just as it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever any opportunity of seeing you open that tea-chest and take a note out? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you took him? - A. Yes, he asked me what was the matter, and where he was going; I said you will not go far; he said, if I am to stay out all night, I'll put my gaiters on. On the Monday morning the prisoner sent to me at the watch-house; I had not an opportunity of going to the watch-house; I went to the office in Lambeth-street, and saw him in the lock-up room; he there begged of me very much to send him to sea; said that it was the first offence that ever he had committed, and he hoped I would forgive him; I told him that I had given him up into the hands of justice, and I could not think of doing any such a thing. I then asked him what he had done with the remaining part of the notes in the chest; he said, how many have you got; I said, I have only got thirteen pounds; he said, if I was to die, there were no more than fourteen pounds at the time I broke it open, and one I changed at Mr. Miller's; I asked him what notes there were in the chest; he told me there was a five, a two, and seven ones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You know I went up stairs with one of the lodgers; you have said I went up to bed? - A. You were gone near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I went up stairs to light Mr. Maynard to bed, he being drunk; I was not above a quarter of an hour up; the night-cap was not mine? - A. I can take an oath that it was on your head.</p>
               <p>Q. You have taken an oath of it, therefore I cannot help myself.</p>

               <p>Q. You were with Mr. Tillett when he searched the night-cap? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found there? - A. Six one pound notes, a two pound, and a five pound note; I saw him pull off the night-cap, and throw it on the ground, and it laid on the same spot where he threw it, when Mr. Tillett took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny the night-cap; it was not mine; it is very hard that I am to be accused of these things; there are other lodgers in the house</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Campbell.) Was this night-cap picked up before you went to the watch-house or after? - A. After.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should be more satisfied about it if they had examined me before I went out of the room; the next day they said they found the notes in my night-cap; it was not my night-cap.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Were there other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes, there was one lodger, who was asleep when I took the prisoner, and when I came back I awoke him.</p>

               <p>Q. How is your entrance into the shop? - A. By a door out into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Crosby or his family enter by the same door? - A. No, the shop is separate from Mr. Crosby's house; it was once one shop, now it is parted into two; there is no door out of our shop into any part of his house; On Sunday night, the 31st of March, about three in the afternoon, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240048"/>went out, and locked the door after me, and carried the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your shop-window? - A. There is one window in Pear-street, and another in Charles-street, Manchester-square, it is a corner shop; I did not return till about half past ten o'clock at night, and when I returned I took the key out of my pocket; I had that in one hand, and a candle and lantern in the other, and when I was stooping to put the key in the key-hole, I found the door a little open.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had left it locked? - A. Yes, and finding the door a little open, I directly looked behind, to see if there was any body there to knock me down; I did not see any body in the shop, the windows were all safe; afterwards I put the key into the key-hole, and the key went very free; I thought it had been done with a pick-lock key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing at that time? - A. I looked round, and saw there was above an hundred and fifty pounds worth of goods gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of goods? - A. Three shelves of gloves intirely stripped, and all the gloves in the window were gone, excepting some coarse tanned leather; they had taken all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had these articles in your shop when you left it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you inhabited this shop? - A. Six years, on the 1st of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. And slept in it all that time? - A. No, I have been ill part of the time; then my partner slept in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after this, see any part of the property that you so lost, and when? - A. On Saturday last, at Messrs. Chrees and Lord's, wholesale glovers, in Newgate-street; I saw there fifteen doe-skins, and the butts of two doe-skins; that is all I have seen of any of the property that I have lost; we lost about forty buck and doe-skins together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any means of knowing that the articles which you saw at Messrs. Chrees and Lord's, were your property? - A. Yes; one of the skins I had wrote upon, and two skins my partner had wrote upon.</p>

                        targets="t18050424-58-defend598 t18050424-58-deflabel333"/> to Mr. Row, a linen-draper, in Queen-street: On the 19th of this month he came to inquire of me if it was in my way to purchase buckskins, and I told him it was not in my way; I then asked him if he had any to sell; he said, no, but he knew a person that had; I asked him if he could procure me a sample of these buck-skins; he said he could, and he did; he went and fetched a sample in about ten or fifteen minutes; he brought one skin, and I felt it, and it felt very stout, (witness being blind); I found it a very good skin; I then inquired what the person asked for them, and how many there were; he said, there were seventeen, and the person asked six shillings a skin; I then asked him, if I purchased them, how much he should expect for his trouble, and he told me, a shilling a skin; I then questioned him if he was certain they were come honestly by, and he said, he had no doubt of that, for he had them of a respectable man; he had not purchased them himself, for he did not know the value of them; I told him I had a friend in the leather trade, and if he would bring me the whole lot, I could very easily know what they were worth; he then went, and fetched the skins; he brought sixteen, besides the one that he had brought; I felt them, and found there were more skins, I did not count them; I had been out for about an hour; I did not see him bring them; my people informed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with those skins that you understood he had left? - A. I then sent to the house of Messrs. Croft and Newman, leather-sellers, in Bartholomew-close.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the skins brought back again? - A. They were, in less, I dare say, than a quarter of an hour, I felt them when they were brought back; Mr. Croft said he would call in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call in the prisoner's absence? - A. The prisoner called in the afternoon, after Mr. Croft was gone; I then told him that I had sent the skins to the house of Croft and Newman, and that Mr. Croft had said the property was stolen; he replied, he was very sorry for it, he was sure that he came honestly by it, and that he had the skins of a respectable man, and a house-keeper in the neighbourhood, the master of the Swan public-house, in Skinner-street, and his name was Couling; he said he would go out, and fetch him to me. He then went out, as I expected, to fetch Mr. Couling, this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; he returned again, and told me that he could not meet with him; he left word, as I understood, that he would come again the next morning, and about twelve o'clock he came; I was in my accompting-house; I had understood that the house of Rolls and Clutterham had been robbed, and I had a letter written to them, to inform them that some skins were at my house, and requesting their attendance to identify them; Mr. Rolls came the next morning, and I inquired of him if he had lost any buck-skins, and if he had any marks by which he could identify these skins, if he saw them, and he described the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when Mr. Rolls came? - A. Mr. Rolls came first, and looked at the skins, and said he would swear to some of them; by this time Mr. Croft came, and then the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240049"/>prisoner came; Mr. Rolls sent for a constable, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. After you told the prisoner the goods were stolen, he came to you several times? - A. Yes; there was a hand-bill left at my house, saying that the shop had been broke open</p>
               <p>Q. It was publicly, and in open day, when he brought these skins to you, when several of your servants were in your house? - A. I believe it was about ten o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether he was not consistent in every part of the story he told you, in the course of this transaction he had with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- CROFT sworn. - On the 19th of April, I had fifteen skins sent to me - bucks and does, and two butts from Mr. Chrees, to be examined; I suppose there were ten of them that I would give fifteen shillings a skin for; there were several private marks on them, that breeches-makers do not know themselves; there were two marked with the letter M on the neck; I have no doubt but some of the skins cost the breeches-maker twenty-two or twenty-three shillings a-piece; I tied them up, and told Mr. Chrees's young man that I would be there in ten minutes, and he took the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Chrees? - A. I did, and I saw Mr. Chrees and his partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when the prisoner came on the next morning? - A. I was there before he came, and Rolls was there before me; when the prisoner came, I took upon me to ask him some questions respecting the skins; I asked him how he came by them, and he told me that he had them from Couling, at the Swan public-house; I asked him if we should send for Mr. Couling; he left it for us to do as we pleased; Freeman, the constable, was there, and he said we had better take Gegg to the counter, and the skins were left at Mr. Chrees' house till the constable returned, and then the constable had the charge of them; Mr. Freeman went and told Couling what charge had been given against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley Q. When you saw the prisoner, and asked him how he came by those skins, he told you he had them from Couling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Couling taken into custody? - A. The constable and I went and told Couling, and Couling said he would come down.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take charge of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not let him go away? - A. I must say that I looked after him, I did not wish him to go away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the other man? - A. No, I do not. About the hour of eleven o'clock they had a pint of ale, and after being in conversation about ten minutes, they came up to me together, I was at the bar, and the other man who is absent, said, landlord, I shall leave a parcel in a few days, which you will give to Gegg when he calls for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew the name of the prisoner? - A. Yes, Gegg was with me at the time at the bar; I told him, very well, I would take care of it, and on Thursday morning following, the other man then in company brought the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gegg with him at that time? - A. No; he told me to take care of it, and give it to Gegg as soon as he called for it; I told him I would, and on the Friday morning, Gegg, the prisoner, called and asked if a parcel had been left for him; I told him, yes, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the parcel wrapped up? - A. In a green bag apparently.</p>

               <p>Q. When it was in your possession, could you form any judgment what that bag contained? - A. It appeared to me to be leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep it till you delivered it to him? - A. In the two pair of stairs front room; I generally keep the small parcel below stairs, but this being a large one, I took it up stairs; I have generally fifteen or twenty parcels left at my house in a week, being near an inn.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to employ a solicitor to attend for you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You, going to be a witness, employed an attorney? - A. When I heard the charge that was against me, I thought it necessary to have a gentleman of the profession; I was recommended by Mr. Kirby, who knew me well; he said that it was very necessary that I should have somebody with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any individual here to-day, which saw you give the bundle to the prisoner? - A. Not any body at all.</p>

               <p>Q. You said it was a large bundle, what was it covered with? - A. A green bag.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had not the curiosity to look into the bag to see what was in it? - A. I could see what was in it, because it was in such a state that it did not cover it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was leather, because the bag did not cover it - do you recollect that you said you thought it was leather, now you say you saw it plainly, because the bag did not completely cover it - you knew that this man was a porter to a linen-draper, in Queen-street, Cheapside? - A. I only know that he had lodgings in a street near Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it an extraordinary thing, that a man should bring a bundle in a bag to be given to a man that was a servant to a merchant in the City? - A. No, because I am in the habit of receiving so many parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you are - did you put it in your bed-room? - A. No, in the front room, up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason you tell us is, because it was a very large bundle, and not very well packed - the prisoner did not say when he was to call for it, nor the man that left it did not tell you when the man would call for it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was in your house every day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it up stairs, because you thought he would not call for it directly? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the prisoner had the parcel from you was it, when the prisoner told you that he suspected it was not come honestly by? - A. He asked me whether the person was there who left the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that that parcel which he got of you was not come honestly by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house after he had been there? - A. I staid the whole of the day, I only went to market.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly after, or any time after he went out? - A. A short time after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240051"/>Q. Did you happen, after he was there, to take a small parcel out of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the house, directly after the prisoner was there, did you not take a bundle out with you? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day? - A. Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose that if I was to ask you whether you said to the prisoner that, as he had mentioned your name, you would deny ever having given it to him? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you find at Mr. Chrees's? - A. Mr. Chrees, Mr. Croft, and the prisoner, and the bundle was there.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was secured, we understand? - A. Yes; I produce the skins.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rolls.) Look at these skins, and see whether there are any that you can identify? - A. This skin has my own hand-writing on it, which I made when I bought it, it is marked G and R. I have had this skin above two years; the other is my partner's hand-writing, and this white skin is a particular skin, it is watery in the inside; I know it by these water marks, there is a stamp with the letter L. I bought that skin of Mr. Law, he stamps them with that letter; here is another with my own mark, and here are likewise two butts; I cut a pair of breeches from them myself.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH - sworn. - I heard a noise in the shop the time this robbery was committed, about half past nine, on Sunday, the 31st of March; I rent the kitchen of Mr. Crosby, it is under the shop; I said to my husband, Mr. Rolls is going to-bed early to-night, it being rather an earlier hour than he usually went to-bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Couling offered me some skins to sell for him; he asked me if I was a judge of skins, for he expected some in the course of a day or two; I told him I was not a judge of them myself, but I would take them to a gentleman that I thought was a judge; he told me the price would be six shillings a piece; I took them to Mr. Chrees, and that gentleman asked me what I expected profit on them, and I told him, a shilling a piece; I took a sample of them, and he desired me, if I could get the whole of them, to bring them, and he would send them to a gentleman that was a judge of them, and I took the whole of them; I called again afterwards to know what they said about them, and when I called, Mr. Chrees said, they were stopped; then I went to Mr. Couling's, but he was not at home; I went back again to Messrs. Chrees and Lord, and told them he was not at home, and likewise I called again on Mr. Couling, and then he was out; I went back again to Messrs. Chrees and Lord, and I left word I would call again; I called at Mr. Couling's on the next morning first; he said, you have not given my name, he said if I had, he would deny ever having them, and immediately he went up stairs, and took a bundle out with him, and said, if I came back again there, I should be transported.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever live as a servant with you? - A. Yes, as a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character for honesty? - A. I had a good character with him, and in my own opinion he is as honest a man as any living.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, on the 31st of March, where the prisoner was in the evening? - A. Perfectly well; I went out to take a walk from my house, between five and six in the evening, and I returned about five minutes before eight; I had with me my two brothers, who live shopmen with Mr. Roberts, a grocer, in Fore-street; they are obliged to be home on a Sunday evening by nine o'clock, they supped with me; we supped at eight o'clock, on purpose to accommodate them; the prisoner waited at table, and removed the cloth also, and was in my house the whole of the evening, and never went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for thinking so? - A. Because I saw him; soon after supper I went tobed myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About ten o'clock; I have one of the gentlemen who dined that day and supped with me here; if he had not have borne a good character, I should not have took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him guilty of falsehoods? - A. No; I would take him again with pleasure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time do you suppose the supper took up? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to inquire for him, from the time of removing the cloth to the time you went to-bed? - A. Yes; I suppose about nine o'clock we wanted some hot water to make some brandy and water; then I saw him, and I saw him just before I went to-bed; I have every reason to believe that he slept in my house that night; I have asked my servants, and they say he did.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this you were attacked by any person? - A. The 8th of April, about half-past one o'clock in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the morning of the ninth? - A. Yes; I was coming from <placeName id="t18050424-59-crimeloc338">Long Acre</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. I had two pints of beer; I had the share of seven pints of beer with my mate and another man; I was sensible of every transaction that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all intoxicated by liquor? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you coming alone? - A. Yes; as I came out of the end of the court, there came four or five men and seized hold of me, and threw me flat on my back; they thrust their hands into my left hand pocket, and took six shillings and sixpence out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of your clothes? - A. My breeches, which they tore in taking the money out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men - Were these two men at the bar either of them? - A. Batters held me by the collar, and endeavoured to hold me down by one hand, and with the other he held my mouth and throat. I with my right hand several times drew his hand from my mouth, and called out for assistance; I called out, watch, and I called out, murder; Freak, the other prisoner at the bar, was endeavouring to take this watch out of my pocket that I hold now.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the shorter man of the two? - A. Yes; he endeavoured to take the watch out of my pocket, and in trying to take it out he tore my breeches at the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it out? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of either of them? - A. I laid hold of that gentleman there with the blue coat, and held him fast till such time as Kelly, the watchman, came up to me; I did not loose him before I asked Kelly twice if he had got him safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner? - A. Yes, by endeavouring to take the watch out of my pocket; while I was endeavouring to give Batters up to the watchman, I cannot say what became of him, but I saw him the next day at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. I am positively sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Freak offer you any money the next morning? - A. Yes, he offered me the money that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer it you for? - A. If I would not say any thing before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take it? - A. I took it in fear, because I was rather afraid of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were all in custody of the peace-officer at that time - What did he offer you? - A. A seven-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took it? - A. I took the seven-shilling piece into my hand, and gave it into the man's hand at the watch-house, and he gave change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You took 6 s. 6 d. and gave Freak the sixpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your reason for doing this was because you were afraid? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Batters. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, when we were first examined, that we were all drinking together? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And when we were coming out of the public-house, we began fighting one with another, and the watchman came and took us altogether? - A. No such thing, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did; then the Magistrate said he would put us all three back till he inquired into our characters, and then you said you would tell the truth? - A. It is false.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you known them before? - A. I never saw the men before in my life, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember hearing any body crying out? - A. Yes, I heard somebody crying murder; I was in my box; it was just by St. Giles's pound, opposite, in the back passage.</p>
               <p>Q.With that what did you do? - A. I was not in a hurry; it was some time before I went, being in a different parish, and thinking it was some of the bad girls (the girls of the town) because they kick up a cry among themselves; I did not go till I heard the voice get slower and lower; then immediately I made my appearance, to make out what it was, and when I had got out of my box, I met with Butler, a watchman of St. Ann's watch-house; I asked him to go, and he went along with me; I took the lead of him and came up first.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to where the voice directed you, what did you observe? - A. I caught Batters over the head and shoulders of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prosecutor situated? - A. He laid upon his back between the men, and Batters was on his head and shoulder; they were busy about his small clothes, but what they did I cannot say; I was in a flurry, as well as him; the other man made a start to run away, but Butler popped on him, before he could get away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Freak doing of before he made a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240053"/>start to get away? - A. I cannot tell; I had hold of Batters; he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Freak over Jaggers? - A. Yes, he was over him all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. It was Butler that took Freak? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got them into custody you took them to the watch-house - You are sure these two men are the men that you took? - A. I never left them, they were never a yard out of my sight; there were two more, but they ran away when they saw the lantern come with me; they could not see me till I popped upon them and smashed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a hat? - A. The hat I know nothing of; Butler is the man that knows about that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoners being brought into the watch-house by the watchmen? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hat brought in that night? - A. The man said he was robbed of a hat and six shillings and sixpence; it was impossible for me to get at the rights of it, there was such a bustle and noise; I left it to be adjusted at Marlborough-street the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take possession of that hat? - A. Yes, last Monday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jaggers.) Look at that hat - Is that the hat you wore that night? - A. Yes, I will swear to it.</p>
               <p>Wygate. That is the hat; Jaggers changed hats with me on Monday at the attorney's office.</p>
               <p>Jaggers. The hat that I lost I picked up from the ground; I heard the watchman say, whose hat is that; I picked up that hat the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. And the same night that the watchman pointed out to you the hat, then on the ground, you knew it to be your hat - Was that the hat you wore till you went to the attorney's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the hat that you picked up at the time this happened to you you wore till last Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wygate.) The hat you now produce is the hat you received from Jaggers at the attorney's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Butler.) Q. What happened about the hat - You have said, after you stopped him, I saw one hat on his head and one in his hand, and the other in his hand which he held, you asked him whose hat that was, Freak said, I do not know, it is not mine, and immediately threw it down - Did you see what became of that hat? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Batters's defence. I had been to my uncle, and was coming home to Cumberland-street, Tottenham-court-road; I heard a noise, and saw three or four men together; I had not come up two minutes before the watchman came up, and laid hold of me by the collar.</p>
               <p>Freak's defence. I had been to Paddington to supper, and coming back down Tottenham-court-road, there were some people knocked my hat off, I cannot tell by whom; I was taken into custody by that man who stands there; I went to the watch-house very civilly.</p>

               <p>Q. About nine or ten o'clock at night did you go any where? - A. Yes, we went to a cook's shop, No. 18, Butcher-row, East-Smithfield; we had a bason of soup each of us; I put my hand into my pocket to haul out my money, and I hauled out a five-pound note; I laid it on the table to get at the silver; they were both in my waistcoat pocket, the note was uppermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Bank of England note? - A. Yes, I had received it as a Bank note at Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it when you laid it on the table? - A. It dropped on the ground by my putting my arm on the table; the prisoner at the bar stooped down and whipped it up, and ran out of the door; I called to her to stop, but she would not: I called to the landlady of the house, and told her that she went away with a five-pound note of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240054"/>mine; I ordered another bason of soup, but did not wait to eat it; I thought if I stopped she would be out of the way; I found her at Mr. Houghton's, the Golden Anchor; I tapped her on the shoulder, and I said, Rosey, give me that five-pound note which you ran away with from me; she said she had no five-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched? - A. Not then; I gave her in charge of the watchman; she was searched in the watch-house and nothing found upon her; I gave her in charge of the officer of the night, and he discharged her in a few minutes; she was taken again the next morning about eight o'clock; I rapped at the door where she lived, and she lifted up the sash and looked out; I told her she had better give me up the note before I would go and have her taken up; she said she had no note, nor never took any from me; then I went to the Flying Horse, Lambeth-street, to Mr. Griffiths, and he came and took her up before the Magistrate, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than one Bank note in that pocket? - A. I had four ones; they were by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that the one you put on the table, was the five-pound note? - A. I opened it, and looked at it before I laid it on the table, and saw it was a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Are you a scholar? - A. Not much.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read so as to know whether a note is from one bank or another? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only supposed that this was a five pound note because you received it from Somerset house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been from sea five weeks, how long might you have kept company with this girl? - A. About ten days; I lived with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any little pet, a little jealousy, take place between you and her; there was a young man along with her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of a young man being along with her, did not she and you quarrel; she charged the watch with you? - A. Yes, and I charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, your friendly intimacy ceased; you separated from her? - A. Not then, we slept together till she took the note from me at the soup-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober or drunk at the time? - A. I was as sober as I am at this time, I had drank nothing to do me any hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire the landlady of the house to look for it? - A. No, I told her of it; I said there, the note dropped down at the end of the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you assist the landlady in searching the place for the note, after the woman had gone away? - A. I took the candle in my hand; she asked me where it dropped, she looked round, I said it is of no use to look; I saw her take the note away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen her since she has been committed by the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not told her, if she would come and live with you, you would not prosecute her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been to Newgate to see her? - A. I did not go to see her; she came in the place; I told her to keep away; I said to her, I do not want to have any thing to say to you.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask you whether you saluted her there, and put your arms around her neck, do you mean to say you pushed her off; did not you drink with her? - A. She drank out of the same pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you call that drinking together? - A. Of course it was drinking together; I did not give it her to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not go to see her there, were you unlucky enough to have another acquaintance in prison? - A. I went with a woman of the name of Neave.</p>
               <p>Q. She is an acquaintance of this girl; she went to see this girl? - A. I cannot say whether she did or not.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 18, Butcher-row; I keep a cook-shop: On the 15th of April, between the hours of nine and ten at night, the prosecutor called for two basons of soup; the prisoner at the bar went out; I heard the prosecutor call, Rosey, come back; she did not return; he called for another bason of soup; when I brought it him he had four one pound notes on the table; he had been looking under the table with a candle, to see if he could see the five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him look? - A. I did not, my partner did; she is not here; he had the candle in his hand when I served him the second bason of soup; he asked me to look for it; he said he had lost a five pound note, and the girl had gone out with it; I looked for it, and I shook the tablecloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor appear to be sober? - A. As far as I saw he did.</p>

               <p>- WARE sworn. - I am a carpenter, I live at No. 25, Willow-walk, Curtain-road, Shoreditch: On the 8th of March, about a quarter before one, I was coming from my master's shop, in St. Mary axe; I was tired with my boards, I set them down to rest myself, and a man came by with a bag on his back, he ran down Great St. Helen's; as soon as he turned down there, the carter came by and asked me if I had seen any man with a bag; I told him, yes, (there were two men with him); I went with him, the prisoner is not the man that came by me with the bag at St. Mary Axe, but he had the bag on his shoulder then, and he threw the bag down, seeing we were in pursuit of them, and run away from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him before he threw the bag down? - A. No, the other two men that were with him saw the carter and me running after them, and then he threw the bag down.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that this is the man that you pursued, and that had the bundle on his shoulder? - A. Yes, he is the man that we pursued from the Flower-pot, in <placeName id="t18050424-61-crimeloc351">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say I was not the man that passed by you with the bag? - A. No, he was a stouter man than you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that he was the man that threw the bag from his shoulder or me? - A. It was you.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 18th of March I was going down Bishopsgate-street to the East-India-house, to get a ship; as I was going along there was a mob of people running on the other side of the way; I ran to see what was the matter, and there was a man they said had stole something, but what I could not tell; presently afterwards a gentleman said he was a constable, and stopped me; I was taken into a public-house, and the next day to the Mansion-house; I never saw the bag before I saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you feel it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an upholsterer and cabinet-maker: On Saturday night, the 23d of February, a quarter before eight o'clock, I had just paid all my men but one cabinet-maker, he observed two ill-looking chaps lurking about the place; with that this one came up to the door, I went out to see who this man was, he was peeping with his head round the corner of the street, as if he was watching who came out of the shop; I immediately went to observe what he was doing of, and he went from the corner of the street and made to my house directly; I went out immediately, I came up to him, I collared him, says I, I dare say you are the thief that has robbed me before; he wanted to know what I wanted with him; I told him I should soon let him know, I would take him down to Marlborough-street; I was going to Marlborough-street with him, a gentleman came up, and said, what is the matter? I made answer, here is a thief, and I will take him to Marlborough-street. Finding I was determined to take him, I observed him taking something from his breast; he threw out this piece of print, as hard as he could throw it, into the middle of the street; O, says I, that is the case, is it; I insisted on his coming along with me to pick up the cotton, not knowing what it was, and when I picked it up, I saw it was a piece of cotton; when I came to the watch-house with him, Bates said he was only let out of prison at three o'clock that day.</p>

I am an assistant to a wholesale grocer, in Lower Thames-street, the corner of Boss-alley: On the 25th of February, in the evening, when I went through the back door, which leads about a yard and a half to where the pipe was cut, I saw the prisoner; he was rising from off his knees quite near to the pipe, he passed me shutting a knife, I believe; I then went round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240057"/>the corner, and looked at the pipe; I found the pipe bent down to the ground about four or five feet, and that was just the spot where I saw the prisoner rise from off his knee. Seeing the pipe in that situation, I followed him, and catched him directly; I brought him back to where the pipe was; I saw his hands were dirty, and the pipe was cut about a yard and a half; I asked him if he knew any thing about it, I could get no answer, he only muttered; the constable said he spoke to him a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these premises? - A. Yes, they belong to the Coal Exchange; the day after I shewed the pipe to Mr.

               <p>Q. Why? - A. Because I wanted to make it a capital offence.</p>

             sworn. - Q. How old are you? - A. I am fifteen years; I am apprentice to Mr. Charman; the prisoner at the bar came one day into the shop (I am sure he is the man), and asked for a gold double-bottom hunting-watch; we had not one, but we said we would get one; he went out, and said he would call again the next day; he called again on the next day, and Mr. Pugh shewed him one; he looked at the watch, but did not take it; he asked to look at some other watch; I believe Mr. Pugh took that watch out of his pocket and shewed it him, and the prisoner said he wanted just such a watch to give to his brother; he said he would take that watch which Mr. Pugh shewed him; Mr. Pugh said he had better not take it, as it did not go well; he said he did not mind that; he would bring it back the next day; then he asked to look at the chains and seals that were in the window; we shewed him them, and he agreed to take these two seals and a gold chain; he took a bill out of his pocket and left it as security that he would bring the watch and seals back again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill that you hold in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you understand that he took this watch and seals? - A. To shew them to his brother; Mr. Pugh let him take them; he never came back again; I never saw him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch, chain, and seals, again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He told you he wanted a watch for the purpose of giving his brother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He would take the watch and shew it to his brother, and he would leave that bill in part of payment? - A. No, he would leave it as security.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember it was in part of payment; was not you very attentive? - A. I was not very attentive, for Mr. Pugh attended to that; I was doing something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there might something pass that you did not hear. -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. All that passed when you were present I understood you to say was, that he did not buy them, he was to bring them the next day, after he had shewed them to his brother, and he left this bill for security till he returned them? - A. Yes.</p>

I cannot tell the day, he came in first to look at a gold double-bottom hunting-watch; we did not happen to have one in the house at that time, we promised to get him one to look at, if he would call in a day or two; he called in a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. That is the man; I put the day down in the day-book, I cannot recollect the day, it was in November, rather towards the latter end.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not a customer of the shop, that you had knowledge of him? - A.

               <p>Q. The purchase at this time was not complete? - A. No, the price of the watch, chain, and seals, was twenty-four pounds and odd shillings;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240060"/>the bill is thirteen pounds eleven shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come again? - A. No, I never saw him again from that time till I saw him at Hatton-garden. In two or three days after I took the bill to Basing-lane: it is directed payable at Messrs. Carpenter and Co. Basing-lane, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any gentlemen of the name of Carpenter and Co.? - A. I could not find any such parties.</p>

               <p>Q. It was two or three days afterwards when he came again, therefore you had an opportunity of going to Mr. Marsh, to know if it was true or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when he came the second time to purchase, for which he presented you a bill in part of payment, he wanted a watch to give to his brother? - A. No, he did not give it in part of payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that he did not give you that in part of payment - He said he would call the next day and pay you the rest? - A. I am sure he said nothing about the part in payment.</p>
               <p>Q. That bill you gave him; I see here is a gold seal, four guineas and a half; a small seal; and then there is a silver double bottom hunter, ten guineas. That bill you gave him for all these things? - A. That is not the bill, it is a memorandum, that he might know the price.</p>
               <p>Q. It is one of your shop bills? - A. He asked for a memorandum, and we always write upon bills. I never thought any thing of it, but that it was entirely lost, after the bill was not payable and Carpenter was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were afraid the whole of the money was lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he was not to have called the next day, and have paid the 11 l. and odd shillings? - A. He said nothing about paying the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that what you understood, that he was to call the next day and pay you the 11 l. and the other shillings? - A. He was to call the next day to let us know whether his brother liked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Charman was in the shop, did she take any part of the transaction? - A. She looked at the bill; I do not recollect that she said any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give credit to the bill for what you received? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the purchase of the watch depended upon his brother's liking it; was the chain and seal for his own use? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he did not want his brother's approbation for them? - A. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that this bill was not part of payment? - A. I entered it in the book; it was not a sale; it depended on his will whether it should be a sale or not; I took the bill by way of security.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. This is a bill directed to pay Mr. Harding? - A. The bill was accepted by Carpenter and Co. it is written across the bill, with red ink. It was taken long before it became due.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden Office: On the 27th of February last, in the evening, I received information that the prisoner at the bar was at No. 62, in the Old Bailey; I went there and the place was fast; I kneeled on my knees and saw him sitting in the kitchen by the fire-side; I knocked at the door and the door was immediately bolted; I heard the door fastened in the inside; I had got assistants, and on hearing a bustle I ran backwards and left my assistants there; just as I got to the wall at the back door, I heard somebody climbing up the high wall on the other side; I said, is that you; he was trying to get over; I have known him some years; I believe he saw my cutlass, and he dropped from the other side; I said to my assistants, some of you go backwards; I said I would break the house open; that rather alarmed him; he halloaed out, is that you, Trott; I said, yes; he said, if I would behave civil to him, he would give himself up to me; I did not take him on suspicion of this robbery; then the prisoner said to me, I thought you would have searched me; I said, it is of very little use to search you, now you have had this opportunity; I then told him that I took him for swindling; after that, I let Mr. Charman know where the watch-chain was; it had been shewn to me by one of the prisoner's clerks; I produce the watch-chain; it was delivered to me at the Office by one of Mr. Pattmore's men, and here are some blank bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his lodgings? - A. I never could find his lodgings; I found a letter in that place directed to him, with other things, tied up in this cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about the watch, chain, and seal? - A. Yes; he said he did not care a button about it, for he had got the bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to No. 10, Basing-lane? - A. Yes; first I went to No. 1, Plough-court, Lombard-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240061"/>I there found among some papers two keys, which I brought away with me, thinking they were the keys of somewhere; I went to Basing-lane, and these keys opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any person of the name of Carpenter in Basing-lane? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the prisoner ever lived in Plough-court, where you found those things and the keys? - A. I never saw him there.</p>

             sworn. - I live with Mr. Patmore, Ludgate-hill, (looking at the chain,) I believe this is the same gold chain I purchased of the prisoner on the 28th of December last; I have not the least doubt but that is the chain that I bought of the prisoner; there was a watch pledged by the prisoner, I did not take it in; I have seen the duplicate, it was a silver hunter; a woman came and took that out.</p>
               <p>(The chain identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pugh) Did you make out the bills of parcels of your own accord, or at his request? - A. At his request.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I unfortunately knew a young man, of the name of Birch, at Birmingham, he came to London; I, having ready money in my pocket when I came to town, he told me that Mr. Carpenter and Taylor were to go and set up agents; I lent them a sum of money, for which they were to pay me interest; knowing Mr. Birch to be a respectable man at Birmingham, I let him have six hundred pounds; I drew upon him for that, and when I came to find the bills were not paid, I was frightened out of my life; I became a distressed man; I have a wife and children, and leave it to the mercy of the Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove that you have a brother-in-law in the Lord Chamberlain's Office? - A. Yes, I have a brother here; I belong to a respectable family; I did not let my father know my situation, fearing it might break the old man's heart.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. What are you? - A. I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police, Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of April last, did you, in company with Perry and Cox, go any where? - A. I did; I went in company with Perry and Cox on board the Essex lighter; she was then driving up past the New Crane, at past ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the county of Middlesex? - A. It is, and it is below bridge, in the parish of Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the other two officers go on board? - A. Yes, and I observed Gray walking on the same side of the deck that I went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the other prisoners there? - A. I did, I saw Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was Hall? - A. Hall had one of the oars conducting the lighter up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on the deck? - A. I did; I saw one of the half-hatches off; it was taken from its place, and the two half-bars off, which confines the hatchway; I then asked Gray what he was; he told me he was a Custom-house officer, and Hall told me he was a watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. After observing the hatchway was taken off, did you go down there, or what did you do? - A. I perceived Gray going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you see any other person there? - A. Yes, a man by the name of Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed Gray going forward? - A. Yes, I followed him, and went down in the fore-scuttle; Gray was upon deck.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down the fore-scuttle, did you observe any thing? - A. I searched there, but did not find any thing, it being dark under the deck; I came up again from the fore-scuttle, and coming aft, where I had been before, a man got into a boat that was hanging a-stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to know who that man was? - A. No, it was a short man; I asked Taylor who that man was; he said, that was the lighterman; I then called out, but he made his escape in his boat, and got on shore; after that, we took the three prisoners that were then on deck into custody; we took Gray, Hall, and a man of the name of Taylor; these were the three persons that were on deck when we first came on board; I searched Gray, and did not find any thing on him; I searched Hall, and found a lighter-key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any search about the lighter afterwards? - A. Yes; we then took the charge of the lighter ourselves, and put her in safety; we got a light, and went below, and we observed two bags, which are now produced here, sewed up with twine; I then looked round, and saw a third bag that was not sewed up, with the mouth open, close alongside of a bag that had been cut, apparently by some instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bag, upon which it was lying close by, open enough for you to see what was contained in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear to you to be? - A. Spanish wool, and apparently a great deal was gone out of it; there was a great hole in it; we then made a strict search, for there was very little room, suspecting there was somebody concealed in the hold of the vessel under the hatch, and under the deck, and after some strict search we found M'Carthy, he was stowed away close by the side of the lighter, on one of the bags; we brought him into the hatchway; I asked him how he came there; he said he had got a cast up; I secured him, and gave him into the hands of my brother officers, and I suspected there was some person farther on board.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to suspect that? - A. There was a great coat on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the great coat? - A. Not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know M'Carthy before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is M'Carthy? - A. I hardly know what he is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a Thames Police officer? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great many officers at the time you went on board this lighter? - A. There were four or five of us.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken the prisoners into custody, did you fasten down the hatchways? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall expect from you fair answers - we know there was a great deal of pressing on the River at this time? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, and so there is at all times? - A. Not hot pressing then, not to break out from all protections.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the man that you found on board was a sailor; he was not particularly employed; you took him below; it is no uncommon thing for a man when he is on board a ship, and sees only two men in a boat, to conceal himself, as it was at night? - A. It was as light as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten o'clock as light as it is now? - A. It was very moon-light indeed; we could see the people, and how many on deck, as well as we could now.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the man on board could see the boat coming, and he hid himself; that happens to you every day; you did not wonder at finding a man concealed on board? - A. I will prove to you that he is not pressable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. When you went first on board, where was Hall? - A. On board, at the stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was that a suspicious situation for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240063"/>watchman? - A: What led us to have suspicions was to see the hatch open, and to find a key upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the situation where you described Hall to be standing, could he see the hatch open? - A. It was as light as it is now; if ever he turned his head down, he must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he, being on board, could see what was doing under deck? - A. Yes, he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go down, if you could see so well where you were, to look for one of the prisoners? - A. We knew M'Carthy was stowed down there, and there we found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had M'Carthy any occupation on board that ship, or was he a perfect stranger? - A. A perfect stranger, and had no more business there than any other person had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the hatchway? - A. I observed the half-hatchway open, and the door taken off, and laid over the other hatchway; there are two bars that go across to fasten them down; these bars and two locks were taken off, and the bars laid on one side; Mr. Gillman went down the fore-hatchway, and I remained on deck with the three prisoners; before Gillman went down, he saw a man push by; he ran up, and said there was a man gone away with a boat; he called after the man, but he did not return; he called out to him to come back, or he would fire at him, and he did fire at him; we then called to Perry, and a lighter-man of the name of Legg, to come round the lighter, and after we had got a light I took these three men in charge, Hall, Gray, and Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present with Gillman when he went down the half-hatch? - A. I observed some bags on the deck that Mr. Gillman found.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able, by looking down, to see the bags? - A. Yes; when the bags were put on deck, Gray was asked how those bags came to be marked; Gray said he had marked them himself, they were sweepings; an observation was made to him that we were very sorry to find him in such a situation; he said he took charge of the lighter, and there was nothing gone out; that it was as he had taken charge of it, and there was the lighter's bill, and he produced the lighter's bill to prove it; I went into the hold afterwards and found three bags cut with a knife, apparently right across in a zig-zag; about twelve or fourteen were there cut; I am speaking of the original bags.</p>
               <p>Q. What does that bag contain? - A. Spanish wool; the bags that are now in Court were removed by Gillman.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a lighterman, I was employed by Messrs. Salter and Cooper; I went on board the Essex at Blackwall Reach, on Wednesday morning, the 10th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You came here in custody? - A. Yes; Fieldhouse, Hall, and Gray, went first on board.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did M'Carthy come on board? - A. About a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know M'Carthy before? - A. About a twelvemonth.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. I know nothing more of him than he was a lumper.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what happened, as well as you can recollect? - A. When he came on board, he proceeded to take off the half-hatch from the lighter, and then M'Carthy and Fieldhouse went down below; there was a handkerchief chucked out of the boat before M'Carthy came in, tied up as if it was a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what that handkerchief contained? - A. I believe it contained bags, but I am not certain; then I chucked the bundle down to Fieldhouse and M'Carthy in the hold of the Essex; I saw no farther, than I saw them put the wool in the bag; I did not see them cut the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the wool was found? - A. No; I did not see any thing farther till the Police officers came on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Essex lying at that time? - A. She was coming up the River; at the time they came on board, she was at the New Crane, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the three bags that the officers found? - A. I saw them after they were brought into the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them after they were undone in the lighter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body bring them up from the hold? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time the officers came on board? - A. At one of the oars along with Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Gray? - A. Along with Hall; M'Carthy went before the officers came into the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. How got you the hatch open? - A. They were unlocked, I did not see them unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who unlocked them you do not know? - A. My back was towards them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of the lighter? - A. Each of us lightermen, in the service of Salter and Cooper, had a key to unlock the hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the employ of Messrs. Salter and Cooper? - A. I was at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You came from prison? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there, you were out of mischief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240064"/>- you have said you were at the oar - when the hatch was open, you could see what was going forwards? - A. I turned round, and then I could see they were putting it in bags.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were packing it up for greater security? - A. I cannot say what they were packing it up for, I did not give it a thought at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you apprehend they were making it more secure? - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give it a thought, therefore you did not think there was any harm going forward? - A. I understood they were to be put out at St. Catherine's.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it was any harm? - A. I did not think it was right; I was upon deck at the time it was transacted, I certainly knew what was going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have countenanced a wrong thing; you thought there was no harm in it? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say it if you try; this I can say, by your giving evidence you get your own neck out of the halter? - A. I hope so.</p>
               <p>Q. And had not you given evidence, I take it, my dear friend, you might have got your neck into the halter? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not say, I do not know again; were not you afraid that you might come to the gallows before you intended; were not you afraid that your worthy life might be cut short; were not you afraid society would lose so good a man as you? - A. I was afraid at the time the Police officers took me, I did not know what might follow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Where did you take M'Carthy on board? - A. At Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing to give a person a lift? - A. I did not take him up, I was not in charge of the craft at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thing to take people up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. And put them down in the hold -</p>
               <p>Gillman. I produce one of the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any more than that? - A. Yes, two more; these are them that Gray said were sweepings; they are all about the same size, I have had them ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. That is your lighter, and the Spanish wool is consigned to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gillman.) Did you compare that wool in the bags with that which was in the packages that were on board? - A. Yes, it is of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Salter.) Q. Are there any sweepings in the lighter? - A. There are sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow sweepings? - A. They are not allowed; there were sweepings of the ship, after the cargo was taken out, which were put in the lighter-bill, twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come to you in such bags as these? - A. No, larger and different bags from those, bags containing 200 pounds weight.</p>
               <p>Hall's defence. I am a poor man, I have got a wife and five small children.</p>
               <p>Gray's defence. May it please you, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On Tuesday, the 9th of April, I went up with the craft belonging to Mr. Fawcett, containing forty-two bags of wool; I left the ship, about ten minutes past five, in charge of the King's watchman; I then went home to my family, and went to-bed; on the 10th, at three o'clock, I walked down to Blackwall, and took charge of this said Essex lighter; I was not there upon the craft to see this cargo come in, and it was unknown to me what might be concealed in that craft then going up; this said

            , and me, rowed upon each side at Blackwall, the tide running very strong; we were afraid that a ship would run against the lighter; at that moment he took the key out of his pocket to get a pole to prevent the lighter from being run against; these lightermen have keys, and have a right to go to what part of the craft they like; my duty was to prevent any thing going out of the craft; that was all that I had to do.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the niece of Mr. Dark? - A. Yes, when I came down stairs in the morning my aunt told me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Your aunt and you keep the shop I understand; look at these five pair of stockings? - A. These are Mr. Dark's, I saw them on the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you are sure these stockings are part of Mr. Dark's property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great variety of cotton stockings? - A. We have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, when you were at the Magistrate's, saying you could not undertake to speak to those stockings till you had got some more to match them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that was the reason that you formed that opinion upon the subject? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you recollect the Magistrate sending for a needle and thread - Why did you send for a needle and thread? - A. To mark the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. That you might know them; that when you came to the Old Bailey or elsewhere, before the Grand Jury, you might swear to them - You had no occasion for a needle and thread, if you could have known those stockings abstracted from all other stockings in the world; I suppose you would have known them if you had worn them and mended them; then you would not have wanted a needle and thread? - A. I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. These stockings you marked at the Magistrate's, in order that you should know them again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you only know them again by referring to other stockings that you had in Mr. Dark's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You put a mark on them to know they were the same that were put into the constable's hands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you had matched them with some others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these stockings that you had to match them with of the same manufactory that had not been stolen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course whoever had robbed the house, they had stolen some stockings, and had left others behind them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they matched exactly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on them? - A. It was torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the shop mark? - A. Plain, 4 s. 6 d. on a piece of paper tacked to the heel.</p>
               <p>Q. You found that part of the stockings which had not been taken away from you corresponded with those stockings, and which were of the same parcel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you saw those stockings at the pawnbroker's, had they been worn? - A. They did not appear to me to have been worn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these stockings, and see if you know them? - A. They are Mr. Dark's, and they are of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they any mark by which you know them? - A. The mark is gone, but there is the tacking at the heel that was done at the shop; I generally mark all the stockings so, I tack them together, and there is the mark that I put at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. You make a tack at the heel to all the stockings that come into your shop? - A. Yes, always, and it is in these stockings now; I tack them together in pairs.</p>

             sworn. - I am a married woman, I live in Gray's-buildings, Duke-street, Manchester-square: On Saturday, the 9th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was passing by Mr. Busby's shop, I perceived two men standing at the iron rails belonging to Mr. Busby's shop, and seeing them there several nights before, it drew my attention to see what they were doing of; I watched, and saw the prisoner standing between the passage door and the shop door; I crossed to the opposite side of the way to watch him, and directly I got over, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with a roll of baize on his arm; it was moon-light, and, to the best of my knowledge, it then appeared like green baize; I immediately gave the alarm, and followed the prisoner closely; I met with Mr. Clements, I desired him to stop him, the other man run off; Mr. Clements stopped him with the baize on his shoulder, and was bringing him back to the shop that he took it from; he threw the baize down, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Clements catch him again? - A. Yes; I picked up the baize, and took it into the shop; it was given to the constable.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Gray-street, Manchester-square, I am a tallow chandler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Thompson, the last witness, on that Saturday night? - A. The prisoner was passing me in Gray-street, I was looking at him when the woman came up; she asked me to stop that man, he had stole the baize from a shop in Duke-street; I followed him immediately, he then mended his pace; I caught him, and asked him what he was going to do with that piece of baize; he said, a young man, an acquaintance, had asked him to carry it somewhere; I told him he should take it back to where he took it from; he said, he would not, he did not know where; the woman was at hand, she said she would shew him where he took it from; he then went along, and wanted me to carry it; I took hold of him part of the way, and then I loosed him; he walked with me, and when he came near the shop he threw it down, and ran away; I followed him, and took hold of him again, and in the course of the contest he attempted to throw me; I brought him back to Mr. Busby's shop, and left him in the care of the woman that is now present, and other people in the shop; I went for Mr. Watson, the constable; he came, and took charge of him.</p>
               <p>- WATSON sworn. - I am a constable, I was sent for to take charge of this man on Saturday the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240070"/>9th of March; I took him to the watch-house, he said nothing to me, but he made use of very improper expressions; he blamed Mr. Clements, and said he was a liar, and he wished he had a knife he would thrust it into his bl - y guts; he was not the person who took it, that he got hold of him because he could not get hold of the right one.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) What is the value of that baize? - A. Three pounds; it has my own shop mark on it, there are thirty yards, I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming up Duke-street, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw this woman following a man with a roll of cloth, but it was not me; I am as innocent as a child unborn, I know nothing about it, the lad that had the cloth made his escape, and this man laid hold of me; Mr. Busby took upon himself to swear at the Office that the cloth was green, you may depend upon it that is a real fact, he said the cloth was green.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. In regard of that, I was asked by Mr. Graham several times whether that baize was my property; in the hurry of speaking, I might probably say once that green baize; still that baize is my property whether I called it black, blue, or white.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the baize that was before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, and it is the only blue one we have.</p>

            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner for some time past been in your father's service? - A. Yes, better than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father has lately taken a new shop in Oxford-road? - A. Yes, about five years ago, he has now two shops in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You, and the prisoner, and another servant, continue at the old shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday, the 9th of March, did you, by order of your father, send out the other servants, leaving only the prisoner in the shop? - A. Yes, that was between seven and eight; I went out with a small parcel to the other shop, and there I saw my father. In consequence of what my father told me, I went back to the old shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a till-book, is it the business of the person taking money in the shop to enter it there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the till-book here? - A. No, I examined the till-book, I found no entry of it there; I asked him if any person had been in the shop; he told me he had taken two shillings for goblets, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. For what purpose did you examine the till-book? - A. For what my father had informed me. Accordingly, a short time after, I took the till-book, and asked him if there was any more to set down, in order to settle the money, as I always do of a Saturday night; I then asked him if there was any thing more to set down in that book; he said, no, he had given me all; he then went out of the accompting-house to put his great coat on to go home; at that interval my father came in, I went out for a Police officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned with the Police officer, did you hear your father say any thing to the prisoner? - A. My father asked him for the three shillings that he had taken for the three tumblers; he put his hand into his pocket, and said he was going to put that down; he then took out half-a-crown and sixpence, and gave it for the tumblers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you not know that this man's memory was impaired? - A. He was generally very forgetful.</p>

               <p>Q. After she had been with you any time, did you miss any of your property? - A. Yes, I missed seven pair of stockings and a cravat; I cannot say I missed the Bank-notes, I discovered them afterwards; the prisoner stated to me she had received some money from her mother, who was very indigent, in the country, she had said that she got a letter wrote to her mother; I requested to know who this person was; at last, after a falsity, she said a Mrs. Baker wrote it for her; in consequence of that, I went across the yard the next morning where her box was; I desired her to accompany me, I saw her box was broken open; she said it was broken open by Mr. Bradley, for she had lost the key; I desired her to get ready to go to Mrs. Baker's, she made her escape with two large bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these bundles contain any articles in this indictment? - A. They did, both mine and my nephew's; we pursued her, and after a lapse of a quarter of an hour, we found her in a cellar in Charlton-street, with two bundles, at Mrs. Newton's, the person who washes at my cottage; we brought her and the bundles back to my cottage; we found there in the bundles my stockings and the cravat, we found more articles which I have not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find any notes, and where? - A. In consequence of information, I went to the house of Mrs. Baker; I asked her how she came to write this letter; Mrs. Baker said she had never wrote that letter, nor never had any transactions with her in her life; I took the girl with me, and my nephew; Mrs. Baker said she never saw her before last Monday week; I then turned round to the girl, and asked her if it was true, she made me no answer; I begged Mrs. Baker's pardon for expressing myself so angry; and when this girl was brought back, after she had made her escape, Mrs. Baker came, and said in the girl's presence, I find you have taken Nanny, I have brought you her pocket-book containing two two-pound notes, which I received from your servant Nanny; I questioned the girl, and she said she took them out of my pocket, with others, before I was dressed, while my coat was hanging in the parlour; half an hour elapsed before I told Mrs. Baker I should go to the Office, then Mrs. Baker said she would tell me the whole truth, if I would not bring her into trouble; she said, that Nanny had brought her two other two-pound notes about a fortnight before; the prisoner acknowledged to taking the notes out of my pocket-book, and stockings from the cottage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Is your house in the City of London? - A. No; Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Baker requested that she should not be brought into trouble, and I believe she is the principal in the business - this is the first service that she came to in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to you particularly recommended? - A. Yes, her mother is a poor woman living in Berkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the girl made her escape from your house, you were not present? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you did not see her take the bundles? - A. I did not; I particularly requested the clerk of the indictments not to put the notes in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is she? - A. Sixteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What is the value of the stockings? - A. Fourteen shillings, and the cravat a shilling; they have my marks on them, I know they are mine; I am given to understand that she has shewn much contrition.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the notes are your's, that you had not paid them away? - A. I had not; there is my writing on the back of it, West, 22 of the 2nd month, and I am given to understand that the prisoner's mother's life depends upon the issue of this prosecution.</p>

            : On the 25th of April, between the hours of nine and ten, I received information that I had lost ten handkerchiefs that were hanging at the door, inside of the shop, tied up with a string; I went out, and saw the three prisoners in company together, at a gin-shop, in Castle-street, Cranbourn-alley; the little one had got her apron up, and I perceived that she had something in it; as soon as she saw me, she threw it out of her apron, and I laid hold of it; it was ten muslin handkerchiefs in one piece; they were my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not sold these handkerchiefs? - A. I am very sure of that, and I am certain they are what I took from them; when I took the handkerchiefs, I said, you have been stealing these handkerchiefs; she said she had never seen them before in her life.</p>
               <p>Berry's defence. I am nothing but a poor girl that follows the market; I went to get something for my supper; I met a woman, and she asked me the way to St. Martin's-lane; she said, hold these handkerchiefs, while I get something to drink.</p>

               <p>Smith's defence. I was coming past this liquor shop, and he caught hold of this young woman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Newport-market, coming down St. Martin's-lane; as I came down there, I met this man, and I asked him if he knew any place I could sleep in that night; he told me, no, he would leave me a shilling to get a lodging if I would carry a parcel; he told me to come and take up these things, and carry them; immediately I took hold of them, he called out, stop thief; this man came out, and caught hold of me.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden; I was standing at the Hat and Tun door, in Hatton-wall; On the 18th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner and a boy past me, the prisoner had got an old basket on his back, it was as much as he could carry; I suspected that it was stolen property; I followed him and at the bottom of Vine-street, Saffron-hill, he stopped at an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this boy any thing with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the old iron shop? - A. One March; he mounted the steps of the door and threw it down and run away; I rather suspected that he saw me standing at the top of the hill; I imagine that the boy told him I was following him; I immediately laid hold of the boy and took the property.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the bag contain? - A. A great quantity of iron old and new; I took the boy to the office; and the boy was committed to the House of Correction; and by the boy I found out that he worked for Mr. Bailey; and where he lived; I went and took him up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the prisoner up are you sure he is the man that run away? - A. I have no doubt, I asked him how he came to run away; he said, he run home on purpose to shut his house up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his house? - A. No. 2, in Weston-park, Lincolns Inn-fields; not having an opportunity to take him before the Magistrate, I took him to the House of Correction, I also informed Mr. Bailey the next morning what I had done; I took Mr. Bailey with me and searched the house, and Mr. Bailey owned the iron and tools; I brought it away; I had two hampers full; Mr. Bailey saw the iron at the Office, that the prisoner threw down at the old iron-shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing to the boy before he run away? - A. I did, but I do not know what it was, he run pretty fast, he had like to have knocked down two or three people as he was running away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to his house, was there any forge there? - A. There was, and a great many tools which Mr. Bailey owned, and there was a stove there, in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Never to my knowledge. I produce the property.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden: On the 15th of March, about twenty minutes after six in the morning, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240077"/>coming up Union-street, Hatton-garden; the prisoner at the bar was offering to sell these four cushions to a master baker, as he was coming out of a public-house; he called them chair-seats; the master baker knew me, and seeing me come up, he said to the prisoner, this man will buy them, he is something in the brokery line; I asked him where he brought them from; he said he bought them at Enfield, and gave half a guinea for them; I told him I would buy them and him too; I took and locked him up and the four coach-seats. I produce them. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming out of the country, where I wrought hard for my money and whatever I have had; I have threshed and ploughed for eight shillings a week; I have a wife and two babies at home; I could not get a bit of bread to maintain them; I was coming up to London, and as I was coming along I happened with a man in a cart; he said, my lad, where are you going to; I said, to London; he said, I have got some cushions to sell, if you are willing to get a few shillings by them; I gave him half a guinea for them; I had but sevenpence halfpenny left; I am as hard working a lad as ever you knew, you may depend upon it; I had just come up out of the country the morning as I happened with this misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of the persons here that you ploughed and threshed for? - A. No, they are not here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long has the prisoner lived with you? - A. About six months.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended the prisoner had he not a key in his hand? - A. I rather think he had, he said he was going to get some wood to light the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to your casting-shop, in the stable-yard; had you told him, on any previous occasion, you would be glad if he would remove the lead to the work-shop? - A. I do not recollect that I had told him; I had told my apprentice. - (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Steadman told me not to let the lead lie about; he told me to take it down to the work-shop in the morning; I was going to take it down, and bring some wood to light the accompting-house fire.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody, I made her pull out the money from her pocket, and there were four shillings in silver, and two or three halfpence; I asked her how she came by them; she said, her sister had given them to her to buy a shift, she lived in Paul-street; I went to her sister, and she said she had not seen her that day, but the day before she had given her four-pence; I produce the four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the prosecutor and my husband are two own cousins; I have not seen my husband, nor had a halfpenny from him this two years, or better; I had agreed with a person to work for her, she was to give me seven shillings a week; in the course of that week I had received three shillings and four-pence to buy some necessaries, on Saturday I received three shillings and eight-pence of her. On Saturday night I went to my sister's she gave me four-pence, then I had three shillings in silver and four-pence in copper; the mangler asked me to turn the mangle, and then she would give me sixpence, which I did, and when I had done she asked me to give her six pennyworth of halfpence, and she would give me a shilling, then I had four shillings and sixpence. On Sunday morning I went to buy an article that I wanted very bad; going there I called at the prosecutor's and asked him if he had seen any thing of my husband; when I went in there, the prosecutor's wife and another woman were sitting there by the fire-side; I was there above half an hour before the prosecutor came in; I asked the prosecutor's wife if her husband had seen any thing of my husband; she said, her husband was a very close man, and very likely if he had he would not tell, it was of no use to ask him; I told her I wanted to buy a shift, I had only four shillings and sixpence; she advised me not to buy it that week, but trust till another week; when he came in, I asked him if he had seen my husband; he said, no, he begged me to stop to have some dinner. After dinner he went out, and I asked his wife if she would like a pint of beer, she gave me a shilling to get a pint of beer, I brought her the beer, and just about a quarter past five the prosecutor came in again, and as he came in, I heard his wife say I had four shillings in my pocket, and was going to buy a piece of cloth with it; then he came in, and looked on the mantle-piece, and said that how I must have taken it from the mantle-piece; he then said to me that he knew I had four shillings in my pocket, and if I would not give it up to him he would send for an officer, and have me taken up; I told him I would not give it, he sent for an officer, and the officer searched my pocket, and took the four shillings from me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - A. I think it was about a week afterwards; I had them at two separate times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for them, or did he bring them to you? - A. I fetched them from his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. In your other dealings with the prisoner for cards, were the aces delivered in the packs, or were they delivered to you in separate parcels? - A. Always delivered in separate parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon any occasion give orders for cards, and not have them so soon as you expected or wished? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner upon that subject, as it sometimes so happened that you did not get the cards so soon as you expected? - A. Yes, he said there was a great demand upon him for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any other reason at any other time when you applied after the 20th of February for aces to make good your packs - did he give you any reason for his not sending the whole packs? - A. He said he had not them by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any the first time you applied for aces for the packs you had received on the 20th? - A. I think I had some on the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had found packs without the aces, in the course of that day you applied to the prisoner? - A. I was gone out at the time they were delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you think you got a few on that day they were delivered to you? - A. I think I had a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner assign to you any reason for not furnishing you with all the aces of these packs? - A. He said he had not them by him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were gone to his house at the time they were sent, the packs without the aces, you were gone to his house while the messenger was going with them - before the cards had arrived to Coventry-street, you had gone to Cheapside to enquire about them? - A.

               <p>Q. And the prisoner said he had sent six dozen - what passed between you and him? - A. I do not recollect, he delivered me some aces then.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what quantity? - A. I cannot; he told me he had not the rest by him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did he make up the aces for that quantity? - A. Very soon afterwards; he gave me the whole aces to make up for the whole thirty-six dozen at his own house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner with respect to the price of these cards and those sold at the shops? - A. I asked him the reason that they were so cheap.</p>

               <p>Q. These cards you now produce were found at Boddington's house? - A. They were; this parcel contains just a dozen packs, found at Boddington's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me one pack; this pack appears to contain fifty-one cards, and no ace of spades; this is one of the packs that you found at Boddington's; you found, you say, a great many; you do not know how many there are, but they are apparently put up in dozens, which you now produce? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by containing cards, as distinct from loose cards? - A. The boxes that contained cards were quite full, and in the other box was a few loose packs of cards; there were three boxes regularly packed and nailed down.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know the quantity of dozens contained in each of the boxes? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you examined any of them to see whether they are perfect packs, or no? - A. Yes, I have examined some of them which are loose in the box; I found them to be packs of cards without any aces of spades.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is one of the sheets of duty aces stamps which he used to work up at Lee's. These that were worked up at Lee's contained only ten on each sheet, and the other, the legal sheet of duty aces stamps, contained twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. These aces were delivered to the prisoner in number to correspond with the packs of cards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You worked from the sheets resembling these which are now produced? - A. Yes.</p>

             upon these two sheets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that these two sheets were taken from Lee's shop? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. And the aces delivered to the prisoner were made from the sheets corresponding with these? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Lee, I believe, has absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner apply occasionally for cards that he had ordered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it sometimes happen that you could not execute his orders so early as he wished? - A. Yes, at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that occasioned by the want of cards generally or the want of duty aces? - A. Sometimes the demand was so large that we had not got the cards generally, and sometimes, when we had got the rest of the cards, the aces were wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner on that subject? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then between him and you? - A. I have told him that the aces were out, we had got none in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever an occasion happened when you stood still till the plate was engraved? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether at that time the prisoner's orders were unexecuted for want of the aces? - A. He told me so; that he wanted aces of spades, and he could not execute the orders because he had not the aces to put to them; and the orders he had delivered they would not give him the money for them till he had furnished the aces of spades; I told him not to blame my master for it, as the man who had the doing of it had disappointed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us your very expression as you used in your conversation with him at that time, or any other time about a plate? - A. I do not recollect that I told him any thing about a plate; no more than what I have observed to the man that had the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The aces that are furnished when the duties are regularly paid are obtained at the Stamp-Office, are they not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that no man, except the person employed by the Stamp-Office, have any thing to do with them till they are delivered to the card-maker? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these regularly and immediately furnished upon application at the Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duty aces which are delivered from the Stamp-Office, do not they always contain the card-maker's name? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore any that had been issued from the Stamp-Office, your master would have had his name upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that these you have produced, as manufactured at Lee's, have the name of Hart upon them - Was there any maker at the time you were employed by Lee, of the name of Hart, that you were acquainted with? - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you pretty well acquainted with the makers in town? - A. Yes, I know them.</p>
               <p>Q. And I suppose you have worked for many of them - Did you know Hart when he was in the trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long ago it is since he left off? - A. I believe about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if he had been in the trade, it is probable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240087"/>you should have known it? - A. I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner visited Lee's house occasionally, did he come where you passed? - A. We pasted backwards, he very seldom came there, he was sometimes there.</p>
               <p>Q. He came sometimes there, while you were actually pasting these plates, which are half the size of the legal plates? - A. I do not recollect seeing him there while we were in the act of doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did he pay Lee for the cards he had bought of him? - A. I do not rightly know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Blacklin about it? - A. I have heard Blacklin say that my master charged him too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know from Blacklin himself what his selling price was, when he was stating to you that your master charged him too much for them - Do you know what he sold them at himself? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And the prisoner was his principal customer? - A. Latterly he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they upon the footing of intimacy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon some occasion you supped together with him? - A. I did, in Christmas week.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Lee supped at Blacklin's house with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those sheets in the name of Hart, the sheets that you used to work up for the greatest part of your trade? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. This is from the same impression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all sold to the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Blacklin, made with these aces? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What we call, at the present, forged aces? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From your own knowledge of aces do you know whether these are legal or forged? - A. They are not legal, they are forged.</p>
               <p>Q. And all that Lee sold to Blacklin were of that manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not the cards, with the card denoting the stamp-duty of the card-maker, generally issued in this form, with the paper stamp on the wrapper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is bound to do it under a penalty, and indeed a man buying them, without that, subjects himself to a penalty - Were any of these cards that were sold by Lee to Blacklin issued in this form? - A. I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these - Is that the form in which they were always delivered? - A. Yes, in a white wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the aces of spades delivered in that wrapper, or in separate parcels? - A. Always in separate parcels by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner complain at any time, either in, or not in, Lee's presence, that his orders were not executed speedy enough? - A. Never before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation before you on that subject? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the Inspector of the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you, sir? - A. Seventy-two.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that thirty-six dozen and the corresponding aces (Lee's aces) that were found at Boddington's? - A. There are seventy-two, and each corresponds to the thirty-six dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. For what number of years have you been an Inspector? - A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. From inspecting these aces, are you able to say whether they are from any instrument issued at the Stamp-Office? - A. They certainly did not come from the Stamp-Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What aces are they? - A.(Mr. Fielding.) Part of the parcel marked B. containing seventy-two aces, being part of what was found at Boddington's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look them all over, Mr. Merchant; are you enabled to say what they are? - A. They are all of them forged, Mr. Hart has not gone beyond the number 80; I mean, there has been, I believe, no aces issued from the Stamp-Office, in the name of Hart, beyond the number of 80; these are 112, 113, 114, 115, and 116.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. Genuine ones, in the name of Hart, never exceeded the number 80.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the other seven aces found at Boddington's? - A. They are all a forgery, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240088"/>are from the same plate, and the same numbers, from 112 to 116.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper 8, containing 59 aces of spades, what are they? - A. These are the same, and appear from the same impression, and contain the same number; the paper marked B contains six aces, they are forged; and the plate E is a forgery, containing fifty-four aces: they appear to be from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that was in the pocket-book of the prisoner, the ace of spades which the officer took out of the pocket-book, which was in his pocket and on his person, look at that, and tell me whether that is a forgery; it is in the name of Hart? - A. It is the same, and marked 112, a higher number than Hart ever had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. We now shew him the two papers marked

            , which Wright said he brought from Mr. Lee's manufactory - Do these appear to you to be a forgery, and to resemble those you have already looked at in these cards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they imitations, and do they bear resemblance to those which were issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Certainly they are an imitation of those which were issued by the Stamp-Office while Hart was in the trade, but the numbers do not agree.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Were you engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time? - A. No, I have examined the books, I find none higher than 80, and I have heard from my predecessor.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that of your own knowledge; your only reason for believing these are forgeries is there are higher numbers, which somebody has told you are higher than Hart ever had? - A. Certainly these numbers do not correspond with the numbers belonging to Hart at the Stamp-Office.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know, you not being engraver at the Stamp-Office at that time; there may be other plates besides those which you have seen. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. I now shew him a genuine plate, a sheet containing twenty impressions, with the name of Hart on them; look at that and look at the ten; and look whether those of the ten, found at Lee's with the name of Hart - Do they appear to be made with a view to imitate them? - A. They are done to imitate.</p>
               <p>Q. From your inspection of the legal one of twenty, and the other of ten impressions on Lee's paper, do they appear to be done with imitation of the genuine plates issued by the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And you are conversant with the business I take it for granted? - A. Yes; the aces are issued from the plates in sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in a sheet? - A. There are twenty in a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Hart was card-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this sheet, and tell me whether this sheet is from the plate engraved for Hart? - A. It is the same as was used by Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched the office books, to see how high Hart's numbers went? - A. I have, I do not find that they went higher than 80.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had gone higher than 80, must not you have found it in your search? - A. From the search I do not find any above 80, and I have searched with all the diligence I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person who was engraver at the time Hart was a maker living or dead? - A. Dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Merchant succeeded him? - A. Mr. Merchant was his assistant for some time, and afterwards succeeded him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You say probably there may be numbers above 80? - A. I cannot say whether there are or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have said you searched? - A. Yes, I cannot find any above 80; I cannot say any thing respecting the cards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched the Stamp-Office with your best diligence, to find whether there are any above 80? - A. I find none beyond 80, there is no record beyond 80.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched any of the warrants? - A. I have only searched the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. They are regularly entered in the book? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. You find no entry beyond 80? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been must not you have found them in your searching? - A. I think so; I have gone from 1765 up to 1800; I have searched all that period, and there are none higher than 80.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not believe there are any higher than 80? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe or suspect there are any beyond 80? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You said you had not got the warrants of the Commissioners of the Office, to see if there were any plates ordered beyond 80; you have not been furnished with these warrants? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Would not those warrants have enabled you to make a better search; what do you mean by not having the warrants? - A. I have only examined the entry of the order-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240089"/>Q. The entry in the order-book is a transcript of the warrants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. What book have you examined? - A. Only the order-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear that there are no higher numbers? - A. To the best of my belief there are no higher numbers than 80.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. The person to whom the warrants were delivered was the engraver you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever there is a warrant of that sort made, there is an entry made of the order, and a specimen of the stamp afterwards taken; you have seen no entry beyond 80? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The person to whom this warrant is given is the engraver, and the order of that engraving is entered in the book, and you have searched that book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the engraving is made there is an impression taken from it and kept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you find no order of the engraving, nor any impression? - A. There is no order of engraving, nor any impression in that book.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will just shew one of the forged cards; you will see the forged card has not the additional duty at the bottom; at the bottom of the forged card there is nothing but the word Hart; on the legal one there is the word additional duty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time that I received these cards, I did not know that there were any aces of spades that were forged, I understood that they were foreign cards brought from abroad; I shortly after was informed that a large quantity of waste paper had been sold to the Neckinger Mill Company about two years ago, and which I have always since understood; the Neckinger Mill Company purchased at Somerset-house these aces amongst the quantities of waste paper which they purchased at Somerset-house.</p>

            , on the 26th of February, in the 45th year aforesaid, did feloniously vend and sell divers playing cards, liable to a stamp duty, with counterfeited marks on the spotted side of the said cards, counterfeiting an impression of certain marks directed to be used by a certain Act of Parliament, made at Westminster, in the 29th year of his Majesty's reign, entitled an Act for granting to his Majesty several additional stamp duties on cards and dice, and several former Acts of Parliament, relating to cards made fit for sale in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. I take this to be the most convenient time to state my objections, and to make an arrest of judgment, if the case should require it, as it does not appear to me that this offence is particularly described by either of these Counts.</p>
               <p>The evidence that we have heard does not prove any offence within this Act of Parliament upon which this indictment is framed, the 29th of 
               <persName id="t18050424-108-person1030">George</persName>
             the Third; the words are, that if any person shall counterfeit, or forge, or procure to be forged or counterfeited, or vend and sell any stamp or mark to be used relating to cards, dice, or newspapers, or shall counterfeit or resemble the same, with such counterfeit marks thereon, knowing the same to be counterfeited, shall be guilty of felony.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship will see that they are, by another Act of Parliament, directed to apply this stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240090"/>not upon any of the cards, but upon the wrapper; the statute I allude to is the 9th of Ann, chap. 28, sect. 41, there the Commissioners are directed to put this stamp on the wrapper of these cards. I submit to your Lordship, it may be said that subsequent Acts of Parliament have added additional duties, still if the original statute of Ann is not repealed, whatever number of duties may be added, the stamp must be in the same place, and in the same manner, as it is pointed out by the said Act of Parliament; and any stamp put in any other manner, is a stamp which the Commissioners are not authorized to put on. I submit to your Lordship, as it appears to me, this man did not vend any of these stamps upon wrappers, nor any stamp upon cards, and if the Commissioners are authorized, by any subsequent Act of Parliament, to put the stamp upon a particular card, then this indictment has not made out the case, because this indictment is not for the offence of putting the stamp upon a particular card. I desired these two Counts to be read, and your Lordship will find that it is both uttering and vending stamps, not upon a particular card, but stamps upon playing cards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. If I understand the meaning of the word cards right, it must be a perfect pack of cards; the uttering of any one card would not be a felony within the meaning of this Act of Parliament, but by making use of the word playing cards. We must likewise see what the Legislature thought proper to impose upon selling such cards. The duty has been imposed upon a pack of playing cards, it is so stated upon the face of this indictment to be playing cards, and the evidence has been, in this case, of uttering cards without the aces of spades. The cards, without the aces of spades, cannot be considered as playing cards, nor can the ace of spades sold by itself at any time be said to be playing cards. In all cases of forgery, it is necessary that the forged instrument should be in all parts the similitude of the true; in this case there arises an objection, namely, it does not appear to be a pack of cards within the meaning of the words in this Act of Parliament, nor is it that which upon the face of the indictment it charges the prisoner with. It charges the prisoner with uttering, vending, and selling playing cards, when, in point of fact, the only evidence that has been introduced on the part of the prosecution have only supported the sale of a parcel of fifty-one cards, and not a pack of cards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. It has been stated to your Lordship, that we cannot possibly support this indictment that charges the prisoner with having sold cards with counterfeit stamps, which must mean a counterfeit stamp on the wrapper; for the learned Serjeant says there is no Act justifies any stamp upon these cards. The 9th of Ann, which directs stamps to be put on the wrapper, which is true, but my answer is a positive denial on the fact, from subsequent Acts of Parliament on the case, which he had either forgotten or omitted. The 10th of Ann, chap. 19, sect. 162, it is enacted, that on one card in each pack shall be marked on the spotted side thereof. Your Lordship will go to the 5th of 
               <persName id="t18050424-108-person1031">George</persName>
             the Third, chap. 46, sect. 9, which I do not find to be repealed, it there directs the Commissioners to provide a new stamp for the wrapper. No, for the ace of spades, and to make distinction between those meant for home consumption and those for exportation, and then it directs that which has always been observed by the Stamp Office, and which they have been studiously attentive to, that one of the sixpenny duties shall be denoted on the wrapper, and another also is directed to be put on the wrapper, and one of these sixpenny duties is also directed to be denoted on the ace of spades. I am not sure that any former Act mentions the ace of spades, but the 10th of Ann having directed it to be on the spotted side of one of the cards, and practice has continued it on the ace of spades. The next argument that fell from a learned friend of mine was, that the Act which prohibits the selling of playing cards with counterfeit stamps, must mean to prohibit vending packs of cards with counterfeit stamps, and that there is no evidence in this case of the vending a pack of cards, only a parcel of fifty-one, and that therefore this case is not within the Act. Certainly, without deviating from the indulgence which is permitted to the Counsel of a prisoner, I might have interrupted him when he was addressing your Lordship, though in fact he was addressing the Jury, when he was stating that there was not sufficient evidence to go to a Jury. Your Lordship will see there is not only evidence, but decisive evidence, and the fact is most certain, that the packs are sold in this way: - If I was to sell a dozen, containing each fifty-one in one parcel, and I sell another parcel containing twelve aces of spades, which two parcels together make twelve packs, if it was necessary to prove his selling these cards, and delivering them in this way, there is no doubt from the evidence. In the first place, do they bargain for cards containing each fifty-one? No; they bargain for a gross, or packs of cards; what or how much a dozen, for what is a dozen parcels of cards without the aces of spades? No, they include the aces of spades, there is no additional price for the aces of spades that these people were to pay, I will prove it by Boddington, who bought thirty-six dozen, and the evidence has said they would not pay for the cards, they would not pay the man till he had sent out the aces of spades. It is beyond all possibility of a doubt that the prisoner not only sold, but actually delivered packs of cards, and that it is proved beyond<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240091"/>all possibility of a doubt or hesitation, that there were all these packs of cards not only sold, but a specific price to be given for each pack.</p>
               <p>Court. I consider it as an offence undoubtedly upon which the Revenue has been defrauded in the strictest sense of the words of the Act of Parliament, that is on record, because there are fifty-one in one parcel, and one in another, which made up the pack of cards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To the Secretary of the Stamp Office.) Whether you know of any cards being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. There were some sold, but I do not know to whom.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Mr. Solicitor of the Stamp Office.) Do you know of any being sold to the Neckinger Mill Company? - A. A society of gentlemen proposed to convert old paper into new, they applied to Government for authority to purchase the waste paper at the Stamp Office, and Government conceiving it was for the benefit of the public, the Commissioners were directed to sell their waste paper for the purpose of being converted into new paper, consequently the Commissioners did dispose of a great quantity of waste paper, amongst which there were cancelled aces of spades, which were brought from the card-makers, with the corners cut off; the Company, at the same time, giving this most positive assurance, that the paper would be immediately plunged into the caldron, and at once destroyed; this Company and manufactory failed, they did not perform their engagement by destroying this waste paper, they afterwards advertised their stock to be sold, and amongst the other things the aces of spades were sold cancelled, and with the corners cut off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that all the aces of spades that they sold the corners were cut off? - A. Mr. Lee applied with a feigned name, they were not sold in sheets, I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Robey, the auctioneer, sold these goods for the Neckinger Mill Company; I gave my attorney yesterday evening some aces of spades which Mr. Lee had purchased of the Neckinger Mill Company, he purchased vast quantities, and my attorney has some of the aces without the corners being cut off; I have been informed that they sold a vast quantity which originally came from Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, you are to understand that they waited for the aces of spades while they were engraving the plate, therefore this could not be from that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am ostler to Mr. Woolcock, he is the builder of this house, and lives in St. John's-street-road; my mistress desired some of us lads to come out, and see if there was any body on the building; I saw a man at the top part of the building; he seemed to be stamping the lead together, and when he came on the ladder he seemed to have a bundle under his right arm; I heard the watchman crying the hour of half after nine o'clock; we went to the corner of Percival-street to call the watchman, and coming back again I saw that man make a dart, and he went right backwards; he sprung into a passage when I and the watchman were coming up; in making up to him, he run across the road on to the footpath, and run under the railing; I ran after him, and just at the corner of Northampton-place I stumbled against a bank; I then saw this young man lay hold of him.</p>

               <p>Q. When he run across the road had he any thing with him? - A. No, I never saw any thing with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any lead about him at any time? - A. I saw a bundle under his arm, I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bundle afterwards found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The first that you saw of any person was on the ladder, high up? - A. He was upon the scaffold.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was a quarter before ten, we all know it was quite dark at that time; if you had seen any man on the scaffold you know you could not tell what colour his coat was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor whether they had round hats on or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see what their faces were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Percival-street, so that the people who were on the ladder might get away if they had a mind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter: my mistress sent me out to see if there was any body on the building, and when I came to the front door I saw a man on the building; he was making a noise, by which I supposed he was ripping off the lead; I watched him, and saw him come down the ladder, very slowly, with a bulge under his coat; I watched him about a quarter down the ladder; I left him then, and run to the watchman along with the witness Goodey.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that you saw come down, was it the prisoner? - A. I cannot tell, because I lost sight of him when I went to the watchman; the minute I told the watchman, I run forward, and before I got to Mr. Percival's house, I saw a man, and I cried out, that is the man, and immediately he crept under the rails and dropped something from under his arm; he ran immediately into the road, I followed him, and just as I got up to him at Northampton-place Pottinger knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same man that stooped down and dropped something that you saw taken? - A. Yes, and the lead was found exactly where I see him drop it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you see the man that came down the ladder stoop under the rails? - A. I do not know that it was the man that came down the ladder, I lost sight of him about two minutes. (The lead produced and identified by Collis.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to a person that I knew, to do some work for me; I have five days work in a week; I am a gardener, I wanted this man to work for me while I finished some other work; I saw a mob running, holloaing out, stop thief; I was running to see what was the master, and they took me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Jury how you came up to that rail? - A. Upon my word it is quite false, it is indeed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            , each of them had a fore wheel; this was a little after six o'clock; they were about twenty yards from Mr. Bushnell's premises; when I first saw them, when they saw me, they were very much shocked; I work for the same master; they were ashamed to see me; one stooped down to tie on his shoe, and the other endeavoured to hide himself, taking the flap of his long coat up, holding it so. I did not know that they were doing any thing that was indecent till afterwards; the premises were searched and found to be broke open; Mr. Bushnell came to me, and I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons you saw roll the wheels along were the prisoner and Oliver? - A. Yes, they went up Park-lane, both in one direction; when I came to look at the premises, the boards were broken down.</p>

               <p>Q. All the opportunity you had of seeing the wheels was, you were in the road, and they were on the foot-path? - A. Yes, I was at the gate paying the toll for my ass; I saw they were coloured a light colour, I did not search into them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say, that at the time you first saw them, they were coming from Mr. Bushnell's premises? - A. I did not see them come out; I saw them as soon as they were out in the road.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he ever any dealings with you about any fore wheels of a coach? - A. I never made any agreement with him in my life; I bought them of Oliver on Monday, and I sent them back about Friday or Saturday.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know quarter-day - what time of the day was it? - A. About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen Oliver before? - A. On the Friday, when I bought the hind wheels of him; I had not seen him before on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Davis before on that day? - A. I saw Davis when I paid 
               <persName id="t18050424-117-person1105">Oliver</persName>
             the three guineas for the wheels, on Monday, in the tap-room; we both went together to the public-house that I use in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240095"/>Q. How came you to pay him in the public-house rather than in your own house? - A. Oliver took me to the public-house, and there I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down and drank with him? - A. I do not think that I drank, I think there was a pot of beer called for, I sat down of course with him to pay him the money, I had not sat down above two minutes before I paid him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sat in the same box with you and Oliver? - A. Haycroft, a master wheelwright; the prisoner sat in the other box, on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Oliver speak to him? - A. There was some of the silver that he rather disputed, and he called that man to see whether it was good; Davis said the silver was very good, and Oliver put it into his pocket; then he went and sat down in his former place; he sat by himself all the time I was there; I was not in the place above seven minutes altogether; I never saw Oliver before I bought the hind wheels of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Davis, besides being called to see whether the silver was good or not, had no conversation with Oliver? - A. No, it did not shew to me that he had any connection with Oliver at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you returned to Mr. Bushnell the very same two fore wheels that Oliver sold to you? - A. I did not take them home myself; Mr. Bushnell declared them to be the wheels that he lost; Oliver came down to me, and said, take care of those wheels, I have stolen them, and then he set off as fast as he could; the wheeler was then boxing them on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for the hind wheels? - A. Three guineas and a half; they declared to me they sold them for a person in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give no more than three guineas and half for the hind wheels, and give three guineas for the fore wheels? - A. It appeared to me that there was a great deal more iron on the fore wheels than there were on the hind wheels.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. There cannot be more iron on the fore wheels than there are on the hind? - A. I was recommended by my own wheeler that they were sold entirely for distress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Oliver was the person you agreed with, and the man who avowed to you he was the thief? - A. It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never agreed with the prisoner, nor never saw him at the time you bought the wheels? - A. He was at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Davis about the wheels? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the third person in the box with you? - A. Haycroft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Oliver apply to Haycroft for his judgment on the silver? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So the prisoner at the bar, who is now charged with stealing these articles, found his way to this public-house, where he might be apprehended? - A. He was there.</p>
               <p>Q. He acknowledged that his name was Davis, and that he was a wheelwright, after you had the conversation with him that Oliver would squash the business? - A. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been looking for him three days, and at the end of the three days you found him at the public-house where the people are put before they are examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had been looking for him two or three days? - A. I went one day to Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, looking for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where he worked? - A. I believe he left his place of work after this, I was informed so, I should have been very glad to have waited on him if I had known where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) When was it that the two fore wheels were brought back to you? - A. I think on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these wheels which were brought back to you are the same wheels that were stolen from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with a constable, and with a search warrant, to Ellstone's? - A. Yes, and I took away the boxes belonging to the wheels; I can speak positively to the boxes; I went after the prisoner to Mr. Hudson's, his master, where he worked (the prisoner worked for the man who made my wheels); I went after Oliver too; I never succeeded in finding him; I am sure they are my boxes by sitting the arm; they are made on the arm to fit, when they are hot; they will not fit another gentleman's carriage; it might happen that they might fit a hackney-coach; I will swear they are my boxes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please you my Lord, I am innocent of the charge.</p>

            ; I told the prisoner I came to demand a letter that my servant girl had from her mother, inclosing some money, the girl having told me her mother had sent her a letter with some money; she answered, with a good deal of apparent surprize, that she had received no letter; I told her it was certainly a mistake; she said no it was not; I asked her if she had seen my servant that morning before; she said she had not; I asked her if she had not given her a seven-shilling piece that she had received from her mother; she said, no, she had never any thing to do with the girl in her life; she never saw her before last Monday week; I then turned round to the girl and said to her, is this the truth, and she sighed; I then begged Mrs. Baker's pardon for having expressed myself so very angrily, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live? - A. Immediately against my garden-gate; when the girl had taken her bundles, I and my nephew pursued her, and we took her in Charlston-street; we brought her back to my house in Marybone-park. When I went in, I found Mrs. Baker there; she said, O sir, you have taken Nanny, I have brought you in a pocket-book with two two-pound Bank-notes, which she gave to me; I said, how could you be so vile a woman as to tell me in the morning that you never had any transaction with her in your life; she then said she had seen her, and that

             asked her to counterfeit a letter, as though it came from her mother, and to say in the letter that the seven-shilling piece was all that the mother could send her at present; I asked her if she agreed to write the letter; she said she could not write, but she agreed that a young girl, who I believe is here, should write it. I then asked her if she had any thing more of the girl's, and she said she had not; in about half an hour, or more, I expressed I should go to Bow-street; she then said, if I would not bring her into trouble, she would tell all the truth; I said, you shall go to Bow-street, this transaction shall be fathomed; she told us where she had paid the Bank-notes away; there were two other two-pound notes she had of the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any Bank-notes in consequence of her information? - A. I did, I found two two-pound notes in the pocket-book; she said the girl had given them to her, and she said to the girl, I hope you have not been robbing of your master.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the pocket-book and the instruments? - A. About seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got the pocket-book? - A. Yes, this is the pocket-book the prisoner brought to me, I have my private mark on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I will tell you the truth, and nothing but the truth, from the beginning to the ending of my acquaintance with the girl: the first acquaintance of this girl with me was, she came to me, and asked me to new sleeve her a gown; I told her I could not do it, but I had a young woman within doors that did needle-work; she went and brought the gown, and came in and said, will you be so good as to do an errand for me; I said, it is a job I do not like; she said, I cannot get it myself, if you will, I will take it as a great favour; I asked her what it was to do, and she said it was to buy her some necessary things, a flannel, two flowered aprons, and some cloth to make a shift, and a pair of white stockings; she came past again, and then she pulled out the notes from her breasts, and gave them to me; I put them up in the cupboard, and did not look at them; she came again in the afternoon, and said, Mrs. Baker, if you see a gown, buy it for me; she said the young woman there would go with me. I immediately, after she was gone, went and looked at these notes, and I saw that they were two two-pound notes, and I said to the young woman that was with me, that was witness to it, this girl has left two two-pound notes, that money will buy a great many things. Accordingly I saw her go by the next morning, and the young woman with me called her in, and I said, what did you give me, why here are two two-pound notes; she said, I have not had a bit of rest all night, my poor mother sent them to me out of the country, and I thought I gave you but one, and I was going to get a letter wrote to send down to my mother concerning it; she said, go and lay it out. I went and brought her the things she told me, and the money I paid for them came to 2 l. 9 s. 4 d.; she came on the next morning, and I gave her half-a-guinea and a pound note; she left them at my house for the young woman to make, who is a neighbour of mine, and who was every time there that she was, and heard every thing that passed; she said, if you do not make them till the latter end of next week, till I leave my place, it will do. On the next Tuesday she came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240097"/>house, and asked me to go to town, and buy a little tea, and she gave me the pound note. On the next Wednesday morning she came running in at the door, and she said, Mrs. Baker, can you write a few lines for me to my mother, it is concerning a seven-shilling piece; I said, I cannot; the young woman said, I would do it if I could, but my hands are very bad; she ran out of the door, and threw this pocket-book at the corner of my bed's head, and out she went. As soon as I cut my children a bit of bread and butter, Mr. Gibbons came in, and asked me if I had a letter from her mother, and whether I had wrote to her mother; I made a reply, I never had any letter from her mother; he said, have you burnt it; I said, no, I never had any letter from her mother, and moreover I never knew the girl till last Monday week; Mr. Gibbons certainly did come in very rash, and he said he would take me to Bow-street; he went out, and begged my pardon. As soon as Mr. Gibbons was gone, the girl pushed open the door; I said, you good for nothing girl, where are you going; she said, I do not know where I am going; she said, keep what you have got, Mrs. Baker, and say nothing; I ran immediately, as fast as I could, round to Mr. Gibbons's, and whether Mrs. Gibbons or the nephew came to the door, I cannot recollect; I asked whether Mr. Gibbons was at home; she said, no, but the nephew was. I had this pocket-book in my hand, and I said, here, Mrs. Gibbons, is a pocket-book which the girl threw on my bed, and there is the two two-pound notes that were in it; she would not take it till the nephew came; I asked her if the girl was in the room; she said, yes; I said, if you please to let me see her; on going into the room, I asked to sit down; then I said, you good for nothing hussy, did you not throw this pocket-book on my bed, and did not you bring me two one-pound notes to buy you some things, which are now at my house, and I will go and fetch them if you please; Mr. Gibbons made answer, no, we will call for them. I dropped the one-pound note, that she gave me to buy her some tea, on the table, and there was a sleeve I had thrown on the table too, which I saw after Mr. Gibbons was gone; when he came in, I gave him the pound-note and the sleeve; he asked me if that was all; I told him of every thing that belonged to this girl; they took this girl to Bow-street. Mr. Gibbons brought a gentleman that took me, and I got bail that bailed me out; Mr. Gibbons asked if this person would be bound for my removal out of the cottage in the course of a fortnight; they said they would not do any such thing to hurt me. Gentlemen, I believe I have told you the truth.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Bourdillon: On the 20th of March my master's watch was in the kitchen, it was for the use of the cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner there? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240098"/>A. Yes, he was in there to have some refreshment by my master's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring the company to your master's house? - A. Yes; I observed the watch in the kitchen just before six o'clock, when I carried dinner in; I looked at it, it wanted about five minutes to six, it was hanging up in the kitchen just by the door; I saw the prisoner in the kitchen about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner leave the kitchen? - A. About eight o'clock; I missed the watch about twenty minutes after he was gone, I saw him searched in the kitchen when he returned to take the company home, and the watch was found upon him. (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I thought it was the servant's watch, and with that I took it, I thought he left it in a very careless place; I put it in my pocket, and went to the stable to get my horses ready, thinking to return it to the servant again; I had no thoughts of keeping the watch, nor to part with it; if I had had any idea of not returning the watch, I should have made away with it, or concealed it somewhere, or dropped it, or thrown it in the street.</p>

I know them both; Mr. Harrison is my landlord, he lives at No. 68, Well-street; I know Murphy by sight, seeing him drive a cart; I have a stall at No. 69, next door to Mr. Harrison; the prisoner came frequently on the Tuesday before Good Friday with a cart load of wood, he stopped at the prisoner Harrison's door, he loosened the wood, and took part of it out, and put it down at Mr. Harrison's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who took it in? - A. Mr. Harrison picked the best of it, and threw it down his own cellar, the large pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the other? - A. He cut it up into these pieces; the cart did not stay I suppose above six or seven minutes at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Murphy was the man that drove the cart? - A. He was; I did not pay any attention to the name on the cart, there were five loads that he came with.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on the same day? - A. No, there were two days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Thornton, you say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240099"/>that you saw Murphy come with the cart, and put the wood down at Harrison's door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time that you are speaking of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear positively that you saw the prisoner, or was it his wife that you saw at the time the cart was there? - A. I did not see Harrison at that time; the prisoner Harrison came home with a barrow of grains, and then he took up the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner Murphy been gone when he came home? - A. Directly after almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see Murphy before he took the wood in? - A. I cannot say but he was very near him; when Murphy was gone from the door, he was not above the length of this Court from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Harrison call him back, or speak to him? - A. Not till the next time he saw him afterwards, and saw the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you and Mr. Harrison were upon good terms - take your time, it requires consideration, there is a deal of difficulty in it? - A. I do not owe the man any harm, he had been picking at me these three years back.</p>
               <p>Q. By which I understand you were upon no good terms at all with him after he had been picking at you for three years - there is a little matter of rent due now? - A. Not now.</p>
               <p>Q. There was rent due? - A. No, never; the very day my rent was due was on Good Friday; I paid him on the Thursday evening, I offered him the rent before Good Friday, though there was none due, and I had my key in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or was he obliged to sue out a Marshalsea writ for his rent? - A. No, not to my knowledge; he said, he would serve me with an ejectment if I would not give up my premises; there was a question about the repairs of the house, I repaired it out of my pocket, and he would not pay me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any notice from him? - A. I received two written notices from him to quit the premises, I received the first notice about a twelvemonth ago; when I came in, he was to repair my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Wheatley - he is a sheriff's officer belonging to the Marshalsea? - A. I do not know, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you had received no Marshalsea writ - upon your oath, had not you a Marshalsea writ served you by Wheatley, or a copy of a writ? - A. I was served with a Marshalsea writ by Wheatley the day after my rent was due. On the 12th of April my rent was due, on the 11th I offered my rent, and took witness with me, I offered my rent to his wife; on Good Friday I did not go, I thought it would be all the same, and on the Saturday after the Good Friday I was served with the writ.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You tendered your rent on the Thursday, and then on the Saturday he served you with a writ? - A. Yes, and I paid him, and brought the stamp with me, and he never gave me the receipt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us for this reason you were not upon good terms with your landlord - have you ever expressed that you would ruin Harrison? - A. I never said to any body I would ruin Harrison till after he served me with a writ, and then I said that to Mr. Wheatley.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you ever say it to any body else? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you make use of the expression to a person of the name of Knight? - A. I will not swear one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to Mr. Knight the very day that Wheatley served you with a copy of a writ, and say you would ruin him as you had the means and the power? - A. I cannot say whether I did, or did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a Police officer of Marlborough-street, I searched Harrison's house with a warrant on the 13th of April; I found this board, and the quartering, and the timber that is in the yard; I found it in the cellar, Mr. Pinsent picked out this bundle of wood from many others that were there, it has paper stuck on it; Mr. Pinsent took a piece of it, and it corresponded with the remaining pieces of paper on the wood; I took both the prisoners into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Harrison say any thing when you took him? - A. He denied that he had bought it, and said he was not at home when it was left there; Mrs. Harrison told us, in both the prisoners' hearing, that she had bought it, she told what she gave for it, which was two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. She named the price, and he suffered it to pass as the real transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take Murphy? - A. Mr. Pinsent sent for him to bring an empty cart, after the search had been made; I desired the person that fetched him to tell him to drive the cart up Well-street, as we wanted a cart; I thought it would answer a double purpose for him to drive the cart; I stopped him at Harrison's door, Mr. Pinsent was either at the door, or inside of Harrison's house; I took Murphy into Harrison's house, and told him what I apprehended him for; Mrs. Harrison said to Murphy, you know I bought it of you, and I gave you two shillings for it; he said, yes, it was two shillings that I got for it.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Hamilton.) Do you know this person? - A. Yes, that is the next door neighbour to the prisoner Harrison.</p>
               <p>Duggins. In the morning part of Tuesday or Wednesday, my young man being up all night, I took my mould-frames out to the door to cool, I came out of my cellar to fetch them in.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Thornton.) What time on Tuesday before Good Friday did you see Murphy with the cart at Harrison's? - A. In the morning part</p>
               <p>Duggins. I believe about ten or eleven o'clock, as I had the mould-frames under my arm, I saw a cart at Mr. Harrison's door; I saw the man take out some wood from under the cords, three or four pieces, which was thrown down at Mr. Harrison's door; I had my mould-frames under my arm, I will not take upon me to say whether I saw Mr. or Mrs. Harrison at the door.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: The prosecutor came to me to apprehend the prisoner; he went into the room, there were two women in bed, and he said, that is the woman who robbed me of my watch; she got up in bed, and said, how could I rob you, I have not got a shift on, if I had robbed you I should have bought a shift; she acknowledged that she was with him in Cork-street, but knew nothing whatever of the young man's watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To prosecutor.) How many girls did you pick up that night? - A. Only that one, she did not undress herself that night; I could not see what she had got on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The first time I saw that young man was at the top of Cork-street, he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going home; he said he was locked out, and he asked if he might come to bed with me; he went with me, and treated me at the watering-house, Piccadilly; there were three or four other girls he caught hold of, and he went up a court with them, and when we came home he had only one shilling; he said, if he saw me again he would make it up to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw one girl after I met her in Cork-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live at No. 4, Duke's-court, Drury lane.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first acquainted with the prisoner? - A. On the 8th of January last, I went to him at No. 6, Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row; I told him that I was informed by a person that he dealt in cards; he said he did, but he had but one pack; he let me have them; they were put up in white paper, I gave him two shillings for them; there were fifty-two in the pack, and the ace of spades I think was with them; I saw him afterwards on the 11th at the same place, and I told him I wanted a dozen packs; he took me to a house in Butcherhall-lane, where he knocked at the door; a girl answered the door, and she asked him if his name was Isaac; he said, yes; he asked for a parcel that was left for him, and she gave him the parcel without any more questions.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know what it contained? - A. Yes, a dozen packs of cards; he then delivered them to me, and I paid him twenty-three shillings for them; I told him I was going out of town at that time, and requested his directions, which he gave me, and it is now on the directions of one of the parcels.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Look into that parcel, and see whether it is now as it was when it was delivered to you, and whether the aces of spades are not in a separate parcel to that? - A. Yes, it is; they correspond in number to them, but they are in separate parcels; I think I saw him again on the 17th in Lovell's-court; I applied to him then for two packs; I then went with him again to Butcherhall-lane; he asked for Mr. Knipe; they said he was not there; then he said he must go to the office; he took me with him to the Bull and Mouth inn; he desired me to wait in the street; he went into the inn, and brought the two packs to me, all but the aces of spades; he said he must go and get the aces of spades; then I went with him to the house of Mr. Read, in Hosier-lane, a cloth-presser; after he had been in a little time, he called to me, while I was waiting in the street; I went in and paid him there two shillings a pack for them, and there I received the aces. On the 29th I saw him again in Lovell's-court; he took me again to Butcherhall-lane, and there I saw Mr. Knipe; he asked for two packs of cards, and Mr. Knipe handed him out two parcels of cards, which he gave me. I saw him again on the 6th of February in Lovell's-court; I applied for two dozen then; these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the aces of spades made up in a separate parcel, and correspond in number to the two dozen packs - open them? - A. Yes, they are; I paid him forty-five shillings for them; I saw they were in separate parcels after I got home; I had before observed the name of Hart being on the aces; I mentioned it to him; the reason of my observation to him was, because he had told me they were French cards; he told me that was an illusion, they were French cards.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the price of a pack of cards now, or at the time you bought these? - A. Four shillings a pack.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You mean the fair price with the duty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. In consequence of information, you went on purpose to purchase these cards? - A. Yes; I saw him again on the 16th of February, I went for two dozen; I went to the Bull and Mouth inn with him; I saw Knipe there; Maydwell said then he would get three dozen, and leave them with Mr. Knipe for me, as he was going out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. He made an appointment with you on the 3d of March? - A. He was to meet me at the house of Mr. Pocock, No. 43, Eagle-street; I had told him that was my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not been acquainted with him prior to the month of January - it was only then that you were taken into this awkward service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You depend upon the bounty of the Stamp-office? - A. No bounty at all; I expect to be paid for my time and trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they constantly delivered in this form, twenty in a sheet? - A. Yes, never in any other way; I knew Hart very well, he ceased card-making on the 13th of November, 1797; he failed, and I was in possession of all his duty aces that were at his manufactory, and I brought them to the Office.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You either did live or do live now with a card-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any direction that you received from Mr. Estcourt, or any officer of the Stamp-office, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 16th of February any where? - A. Yes, I think at No. 7, Butcherhall-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you that day? - A. I wanted two packs of cards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any and what conversation with him, before you asked him for these packs of cards? - A. No conversation with him; I had seen him with Maydwell sometimes, and knew him on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. What cards did you ask him for then? - A. Part of the cards which Maydwell had left for me; he gave me two dozen, which I wanted at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you apply to him and not to Maydwell, when Maydwell was to have given them to you? - A. Maydwell was gone out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been at any time any conversation with the prisoner; had he given you to understand that you should make application to him -</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner about this? - A. The last time that I saw Maydwell, before he went out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before the sixteenth of February? - A. I think that was on the last parcel that I got from Maydwell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. That was on the sixteenth of February? - A. It was. Maydwell told Knipe to let me have the three dozen at different times; when he wanted he said he would if he could; he parted from us and I saw no more of him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again on the 21st of February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you saw him? - A. At the Bull and Mouth I saw Knipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed with you and him on the 21st? - A. I went for the purpose of purchasing two dozen packs, one of these dozens was part of them which Maydwell had left for me; he said he had not so many.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who said so? - A. Knipe, he said he had only ten packs which he would get me, and he went up stairs and fetched them.</p>
               <p>Q Where was he then? - A. At the Bull and Mouth; he went from the Bull and Mouth to Butcherhall-lane to get them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding Q.Where did he deliver them to you? - A. At Butcherhall-lane, I went with him from the Bull and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for them? - A. Twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the money that he asked for them? - A. I agreed that I would make up for that when I had two dozen more; I was to make it up in the next purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to pay him by the dozen? - A. Twenty-two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240106"/>Court. Q. For what? - A. A dozen packs; I got them, and parted then with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding Q. On the first of March had you any other transaction with him? - A. I went for the purpose of getting two dozen and two packs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? - A. I went to Butcherhall-lane, to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live there? - A. He had a lodging there.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him that day? - A. Yes, I told him I wanted two dozen, and two packs to make up the other dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive them of him? - A. Yes, I gave him two pounds seven shillings and sixpence, at the rate of two and twenty and sixpence per dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon these different parcels, in what manner were the aces of spades made up? - A. The aces of spades were made up as far as corresponded with the proper number of cards, but made up by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you had the conversation with him respecting the cheapness of the cards; was that between the 16th of February and the 1st of March? - A. Yes, it was; we were conversing upon that and other things; upon which he asked me about the cards, whether I knew that they were forged, or whether I thought that they were forged, I cannot say which, it is a very hard thing to swear upon; I answered, no; I think he said, well, but they are; I was very much flurried at the time he mentioned that they were forged; I think that was the word.</p>
               <p>Q. You then looked at the ace of spades, you saw the manner it was stamped upon the cards, you observed the name of the card-maker; what stated you to him about the name of Hart? - A. I never mentioned that to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received your directions from the gentlemen of the Stamp-Office, directing you to purchase cards, did you know any thing of the forgery? - A. I did not know any thing of the forgery, but I suspected it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I think you told us that you were at Mr. Wheeler's, a card-maker, are you in his employ? - A. Yes, as clerk, from the beginning of January.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a great deal of knowledge in cards from the beginning of January - Does he deal in a large way? - A. Not very large, equal with others.</p>
               <p>Q. You undertook this on purpose of serving Mr. Wheeler, and now you hope, or you are expecting, to serve yourself, how old are you? - A. Nineteen.</p>
               <p>Q. A promising youth, the prisoner must have been an old acquaintance of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not acquainted with him, when Maydwell introduced you to him he was a man that put his life into your hands; there was something so inviting in your face, and you would have us believe, though you went to him twice, and purchased cards of him, that is the story you come here with, and you not being acquainted with him, you had been buying of him, and buying of Maydwell, and you did not know they were forged? - A. I did not know they were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bought of him the aces of spades separate from the other cards; you likewise knew what the duty was upon a pack of cards; that it was half a crown a pack; you being conversant with card-making, you knew that the sheets came from the Stamp-office not in this way; that the duty was half a crown a pack, and this came from the Stamp-office in this manner, and was so used by card makers, and put up together, and you did not know that they were forged? - A. I did not know that they were forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe then that the stamp upon the aces of spades that you bought, came from the Stamp-office? - A. I did not believe it; I suspected it to be wrong, I did not positively know that they were forged, I suspected they were wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected there was some fraud, and therefore you could not believe them to come from the Stamp-office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I want to know if you did not believe them to be forged, and not to come from the Stamp-office, what third place there was? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not believe them to be forged? - A. I could not tell, I suspected them to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you believe them to be forged? - A. I believed (if believing is the same as thinking) them to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any question was asked you, who was conversant with cards, by this young man, who is rather younger than yourself, did you give him any information on the subject - If he ever asked you how people could afford to sell them so cheap, did you ever give him any information on the subject? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him how they could make these cards in France, and afford to sell them so cheap? - A. I have not the least recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not recollect that you ever did? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have been telling my friends at my left hand that he took you to Butcherhall-lane - Upon your oath, was not that Maydwell's lodging, and not the prisoner's - Will you swear it was his lodging? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was his lodging; the prisoner told me that he kept cards there, and that he had a room for the purpose of keeping them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was that the same house that you went to with Maydwell? - A. There were two houses, one No. 15, and Mr. Knipe and the people of that house removed to No. 7.</p>
               <p>Q. The place that you have described, was that the place where Maydwell lodged? - A. No, Maydwell lodged at No. 6, Lovell's court, Paternoster-row; Maydwell went and got them from Knipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to repeat the same thing, that you do not expect any sort of reward for all this? - A. I never expected it from the first; I expect to be paid for my time.</p>
               <p>Q. That you heard from my friends speech, I wish I had put you out of Court at the time; then you would have us to believe, that you went for the purpose of bringing Lee to justice; that was what you bought the cards for, not expecting any sort of reward for yourself? - A. Upon my oath, I did not,</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding Q. The first object which you set out with, was to bring Lee to justice? - A. It was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the sixth of March, at the Bull and Mouth, Bull and Mouth street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What part was it? - A. In a room, in the Bull and Mouth inn; I gave those cards to Mr. Chetham, he was also with me, and I searched in Butcherhall-lane, No. 7; I found some cards there; I produce them; they are in the same state as I found them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What quantity of cards are there? - A. Nine packs.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness to the prisoner's lodging? - A. Yes, I did, and to his lodging-room at the Bull and Mouth inn.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was the book-keeper at the Bull and Mouth inn? - A. He was one of the book-keepers in the coach-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last witness give you any thing when you were there? - A. I was present when the box was opened; I asked him whether that was his box; he said it was; I then desired the officer to search it; Cartwright searched it, and found one pack of cards, and he delivered them to me; these are the cards, I have had them ever since in my possession; I marked the ace of spades with my initials.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Beresford.) This impression was made at your office, from a plate prepared by the authority of the Commissioners, for Hart, the card-maker, and look at the other aces produced by Thew, what is the number upon that? - A. No. 116.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you searched the documents of your office? - A. Yes, and I find no one higher than 80.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Merchant) Will you look at the first parcel which Thew produced? - A The numbers are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to be a general imitation, and to have a general resemblance of the genuine one; you are the engraver at the Stamp-office? - A. Yes, they are in imitation.</p>
               <p>Q Look at that Mr. Chetham found? - A. They are all forgeries.</p>
               <p>Q. What numbers do you find upon these? - A. They are all higher than 80; they are from 112 to 116.</p>
               <p>- PRITCHARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the overseer, you deliver out these things to the card-makers? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a card-maker of the name of Hart? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. For a considerable while have you delivered out any in his name? - A. None since the year 1797.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know of your own knowledge how high his number went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that from the Stamp-office? - A. I have no hesitation to say it is forged.</p>
               <p>Q. The plates are delivered to the makers whose name they bear? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the plates of Lee would not be delivered to Hart, nor the plates of Hart to Lee? - A. No, they have been delivered by me for a great number of years, and I never delivered one to the name of another card-maker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Thew was introduced to me as a mere stranger by Maydwell; I should have been very imprudent to have told a person I had never seen before that the cards I sold were forged; I never acknowledged to any person that they were forged, because I never knew it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes, I met with these men, about four o'clock on that day, at Bodmin-Cause, near Luxillion, in Cornwall, on the high road; I saw two men riding, as near as I can recollect, and one a walking; there were three horses, with kegs slung across their backs, in the usual way they carry smuggled goods; when I came near them I observed William Row, the tallest man; I alighted from my horse, and went up with intention to seize them; I went up to take hold of the horse, and was knocked down; I cannot recollect any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went up to take hold of the horse, of these men that were mounted, had they got off their horses? - A. Yes; I cannot recollect any more of it, I lost my senses with the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the very behaviour of the men at the time you got off your horse - did they make towards you or not? - A. I think they did, with their bludgeons uplifted; they were several feet long; a double-handed stick, as they call it.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us where you were when you recovered yourself? - A. At my father's house; it was eight or ten days before I recovered my senses; I saw them afterwards in Bodmin goal; I have no doubt at all of the persons of the prisoners being the men who assaulted me on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued very ill a long time? - A. I am not perfectly recovered now; my sight fails me, I feel a lightness and giddiness in my head at this time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you were with your brother and his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240108"/>wife, returning from her father's house? - A. Yes, I was on horseback, and my brother and his wife were on another horse; we came up to the prisoners near Bodmin Cause, about three o'clock in the afternoon; there were two men on horseback, and one walking; they had two kegs on their horses, and each of the three a horse apiece; my brother holloaed out to me, here comes a seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loud enough for the prisoners to hear? - A. Yes, he halloaed out here comes kegs, or ankers, will you assist, we will take or seize them; I told him I would if there was occasion; they each of them had a large green oak stick, I think they were about four feet long; when my brother spoke to me, I got down; he told his wife to get down, and he went forward towards the men; he said to the men, strike, I will take them in the King's name; they said be off, be off, d - n your bl - y eyes, be off; they prevented me from hearing any more by their noise, they spoke louder than my brother, I could not hear him; one of the men pushed on before, he said to the other two come on; they had their bludgeons uplifted against my brother, the first man that struck missed him; I took hold of his stick, and held it fast; I held him till I heard the shrieks of my brother's wife, then I looked about, and my brother was upon his face, and the other two men were beating him with their bludgeons while he was laying on the ground; I let go the man that I had hold of, and ran between the two men and my brother, and said do not murder him, do not murder him; I said let me assist him, I am his brother, I am no Excise officer; I received a blow that I thought was intended for him, and the man that struck me first struck me again; then the man that I was holding of, he came up, and gave me a violent blow; those two men that are at the bar now struck me twice, and the men that struck my brother struck me down to the ground; my brother's wife was continually shrieking, then they ran off with their horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time might this occupy altogether? - A. Not above two or three minutes; I have no doubt but the two prisoners at the bar are the two out of the three that conducted themselves so, I am sure of their persons, William Row was one of the persons that beat my brother, and George Row was the man that I held, he struck me afterwards; my brother was taken to a cot-house, he was quite insensible, he had some life, but very ill; he was after that taken to my father's house, and was attended by a medical person a long time, he was confined a month before he rode out.</p>
