             deposed that Nichols offer'd him half a Guinea to Swear against Ferril. Wooldridge in their Defence said, that they were all Prisoners in the Gatehouse, the Prosecutor by Warrant for abusing her Mother and the Justice, and themselves for Debt, that she was a poor miserable Creature that lay on the Boards, and Swore this against them to get out of Prison; and that her Mother would not let her out without she did it. Mrs. Pickering deposed that she heard her say, that she had lain with several Men besides her Husband; and that a Woman had got 50 l. by doing such a Thing, and why might not she. D. James and R. Gough deposed, that they heard her say, if the Prisoners had not Talkt of it she would not. Several other Evidences appear'd who gave the Prosecutor a very bad Character, as that she Beat her Mother, quarrel'd with her Brother, and that she said she would Swear 40 false Oaths but she'd hang the Prisoners; that she had own'd she had lain with 40 Men, and said that she was a Fool of a Woman that could not take a Stroke without telling her Husband; and one Brooksby deposed that her Mother said she expected some Money from the Prisoners, but now it was too late. No Marks of Force or Violence appear'd upon her Body. The Jury considering the whole Matter, <rs id="t17200303-43-verdict234" type="verdictDescription">
