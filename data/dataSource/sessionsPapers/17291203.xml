               <p>1st, By this Method, there will be more Room to enlarge upon Trials, they, being resolv'd (with all Regard to the Court) to have each Proceeding related in the fullest and clearest Manner, both with Respect to the Crime, the Evidence, and the Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>2dly, It is designed always, to be carefully and correctly. Printed, on a good Letter and Paper, so as to make it really worth Six Pence, beyond which it is never intended to be Rated, even when a Sessions happens to be larger than Ordinary.</p>
               <p>3dly, By this Method, it will be in every ones Power to preserve them clean to the end of the Year, when there shall be an Alphabetical Index to the whole; so that by Binding them up together, they will have a Handsome Volume, and a Complete Annual Register of these Proceedings, and thereby make it, not worth any ones while to Reprint them in Volumes, which has been done at extraordinary Rates, and which could only be necessary, by the Destraction of those Printed on bad Paper, and in the Sheet Size; thus also, the Expence of twice Purchasing the same Accounts will be avoided.</p>
               <p>These Proceedings shall be Published with the atmost Dispatch after the finishing of each Session; and as it is designed to give all possible Satisfaction in the Conduct and Management, so it is not doubted, but it will have the Countenance and the Encouragement of the Publick.</p>

             was called down, and when she came into the Room, she asked Spencer, whether he loved a Fair or a Black Thing best? Then Macartny said, Let me come and see how the Gentleman is; then he kiss'd her, and then they were so loving together, that I was afraid they would have tumbled upon my Bed, and presently I saw Macartny lay down upon the Floor, and this Man (meaning Spencer) upon her, and I saw Macartny take something from him when they got up; Macartny said to Wild, there was something more, something heavy yet, and then she bid the Man stand off, pretending she wanted to make Water, takes a red Pan, goes out of the Room, and immediately out of the House.</p>

            , for 56 l. Rent, due to Mr. Huggins, October 23d, 1 Bedstead with Sacking Bottom, &amp;c. I gave Mr. Bambridge a particular Account of the Value, in order for his disposing of them, the 2d Inventory consisted of the Plate, China, Rings, &amp;c. with precious Stones and wearing Apparel, which was all made up, Mr. Bambridge being told by me, that it was not usual to Distrain necessary wearing Apparel, he said, set down such and such things sufficient to do so: I brought them in at first 30 l. Mr. Bambridge thought that too much, alledging there was Charges attending the Appraisement, and so I brought it in at 27 l. 16 s. 9 d. It is customary to have two Appraisors, but there was none but my self - after the Appraisement, I saw Mr. Bambridge put some of the things in his Pocket, as the Silver Tea Spoons, Rings, and small things, the rest, wearing Apparel, &amp;c. into a Portmantua; there was a Brush found which is used for cleaning of Diamonds, upon which Mr. Bambridge said he believ'd there must be Diamonds, after that, looking every where, found the Rings, Mrs. Barkley look'd very Chagrin during this Rifling, and was turn'd on the Common-Side, without a Bed to lie on, and had not a Bed all the time of my Imprisonment, she was afterwards very much out of Order, talked wildly, would assert that the Lord Harcourt was not Dead, but would punish such Rogues as robb'd her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bambridge, desir'd this Evidence to tell the Court if he did not order him to put every thing down, who answer'd, he did, but added, that if he had had Money, he would have given 30 l. for the Goods himself, because he knew them to be worth so much, that he lower'd the price to 27 l. at Bambridges's desire; being ask'd what Conversation he heard at that time, he answer'd, Mr. Bambridge told Mrs. Berkley, that it was a Shame she should have there and not pay her Rent, for she had good comings In, Mrs. Berkley said, the House was the King's, and if the King sent her there she would pay no Rent; Turner said, that he had made several Distresses before, with Pindar, the Chamberlain, who Mr. Bambridge said was indicted that he might not be an Evidence for him, but was told that he was a Principal concern'd.</p>
               <p>This Evidence being ask'd what Trade Pindar was of, he answer'd a Distiller, and that there was one they call'd Constable at both Seizures, but Pindar knew nothing of the Value of Household Goods.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Bambridge desir'd this Evidence might be ask'd if he did not propose to Barkley to send to some Friend to pay her Rent, and save her Goods, who answer'd, he did.</p>

               <p>I was a Prisoner in the Fleet on the Common Side, and saw the prisoner at the Bar at Mrs. Barkelys Door, about 6 o'Clock at Night, the latter end of October, I believe it might be the 27th. (there was 2 Padlocks on the Door, Pindar had the Key of one, and Mrs. Barkely the Key of the other; Barns, by order, fetched a Hammer to break it off; Bambridge gave orders to Pindar to unlock the Door. There was Turner, Barns, Bambridge, my self, Pindar, and a Constable, as they called him, (he had a short Staff) but I never saw him before, nor since. Mrs. Barkley was fetched up from the Common Side to open the Door, but she refusing it, they broke her Door open with a Poker, (Mrs. Barkley said it was a Robbery, and hoped Bambridge would be brought to Justice for it) when they got in, they took an Account of a few Goods when required Mrs. Barkley to open her Boxes (2 of which were locked, the other nailed) Bambridge broke them open himself, and some of the Goods were taken out by Mr. Turner, as Appraiser, and the other part by Bambridge: When the Goods were Appraised, they were all carried away by order of Mr. Bambridge; I carried the Bed into the Lumber Room, and afterwards carried it to Dorset-Stairs, to go to Wandsworth - the Rings, Bambridge put into his Pocket, for fear they should be lost in the Boxes, the wearing Apparel, &amp;c. Was put up into a Portmantua, Mrs. Barkely was by, and Scolded all the while, and said it was a Robbery, (being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172912030020"/> asked what he see Bambridge put in his Pocket) said, 2 Gold Seals, an Emrald, some Stones, a Garnet, 2 Gold Rings, one a Stone Ring, but never saw any of them afterwards; Bambridge found a little Brush, and said, he believed there must be Diamonds, at first he said the Goods were going to a Sale, and bid me go to the Wandsworth Waterman, the Easy-chair was left with Mr. Turner to clean, and then I carried it to Wills Coffee-House: (Mr. Bambridge desired that this Evidence might be asked, if there was no talk about Rent) he said there was; (desired be might be asked when the Goods were carried out) answered, about 6 Days after they had been in the Lumber Room, but they were locked up, and Bambridge kept the Key, asked if he did not send the Goods out of the Prison publickly, said, he did, asked if Mrs. Barkley was not the Room all the while, answer'd, I am not positive, for after Mrs. Barkley's Bed was carried out, you sent me to fetch a nasty Bed that Mrs. Barkley would not lye upon, there were better in the Room, which you sent away afterwards.</p>

Mr. Bambridge asked, if the Rings, &amp;c. were not shown in the Coffee-Room afterwards, Mr. Savage said, they were? but added that it was in a private Room, and none but his own Company there.</p>
