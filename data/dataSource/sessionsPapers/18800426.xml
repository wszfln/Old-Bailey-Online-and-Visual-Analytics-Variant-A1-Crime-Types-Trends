                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer of 92, Alderney Street, Pimlico—on 15th December I attended the trial of Russell William Wadsworth against William Lawrence, in the Exchequer division of the High Court of Justice, before Sir James Eitzjames Stephen—I took notes of the defendant's evidence—I saw him sworn—I product my original notes. (<hi rend="italic">The transcript was put in and read. The portions upon which the perjury was assigned, were that he denied that his name was Levy, or being a brother of Daniel Levy; that he had paid </hi>5<hi rend="italic">l. on account of his debt, and that the prosecutor had given him six months' credit.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Gillingham Street, Pimlico, and am manager to Mr. Wadsworth—in January, 1879, I was in the back office at his place of business, 39, Lower Belgrave Street; to the best of my knowledge Mr. Wadsworth, senior, was there also—the defendant and a gentleman named Copsey came into the front office—they then came into the back office—Mr. Copsey said that he had been recommended by a friend; the manager to Mr. Overton, that his friend wanted some work done at a shop he had taken in the Wilton Road, one of the new shops of Pete's—I asked what they required to have done—he began to explain, and I said I had better come and see it, and I arranged with him to go next morning—he asked Mr. Wadsworth, senior, and I to go out and have some refresh<lb/>ment, which we did, at the Prince of Wales public-house—next day I went with Mr. Watts, the foreman of carpenters, and Mr. Howard, the foreman of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188004260004"/>
               <p>painters, and saw Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Copsey at the shop in Wilton Road—nothing had been said in our office or in the public-house about six months' credit—it is not true that Copsey said "He can't pay cash for it, he will require six months' credit;" nor did I say "That will be all right, let us see what he wants done"—I never heard of the six months' credit until I heard it in the affidavit in the action—at the shop Copsey and Law<lb/>rence were there, and then gave orders for a small quantity of work to be done—it was commenced on the following day; that portion of the work was speedily completed, but there were fresh orders given almost daily, which increased the quantity of work, and lasted till about the 12th of March; after that the defendant occupied the premises—I made frequent applications to him for money—I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occasion from a fair young man named Day, who was in the defendant's service; it was left by him for me, for Mr. Wadsworth—I did not borrow it on Mr. Wadsworth's account, or on my own—I signed a document when I got it, "Received of Mr. Law<lb/>rence, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account," I signed it, it was written by Mr. Lawrence, at least it corresponded with the handwriting of a bill of exchange which I got subsequently—it is not true that I said I had borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a friend to pay the workmen, and that I wanted the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay my friend back—it is not true that the defendant handed me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that he said "I don't know why you want 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., considering my credit has not expired;" he was not there—I did not say "I shall not look upon it as a payment on account of work done, but I want to pay back to a friend the money which I have borrowed"—I called again on the following Saturday, saw the de<lb/>fendant, and asked him for money—he said he had had so much to pay for furniture for his house and shop and one thing or another, that he could not pay me just then; he must ask Mr. Wadsworth to wait a little—he sent his young man into the City to see what he could get for me if I would call a little later—I did call later, and the young man came back while I was there and said he had not succeeded in getting any—on 3rd May I made out a bill amounting to 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and delivered it to the defendant and asked for payment—he said if I would call on the following day he would give me a bill for a portion—I did call, and he wrote out this bill of exchange for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him to make it 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his wife was present and said "Be careful, don't make it for more than you can meet"—I made several applica<lb/>tions for payment—I believe the first application for money was some little time before the work was finished—on 29th May, in consequence of directions from Mr. Wadsworth, I went to. Messrs. Micklethwaite and Co., solicitors, 3, Long Acre, and made inquiries about the defendant—I communicated the result of those inquiries to Mr. Wadsworth—I did not at that time know that the prisoner had ever borne the name of Levy, or that he had a brother in Messrs. Micklethwaite's office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been employed by Mr. Wadsworth, jun., five or six years—I have frequently lent him money for wages when he has been out of town, and I believe I have borrowed money from a friend to pay wages—I was present at a trial at Kingston in which Mr. Wadsworth lost the verdict and became liable to pay 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a case of Ford and another against Wadsworth, and Dunn, and another against Wadsworth—I had nothing to say in it—I don't know whether 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to have been paid on 19th February—on that day Mr. Wadsworth filed a liquidation petition, and I was returned as a creditor for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wages and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for</p>

               <p>money lent—when I first saw Mr. Copsey he told me the shop was one of the new shops of Peto's—I did not see a Mr. Coles there—Mr. Wadsworth, sen., was present—I believe so; I will not swear positively—Copsey did not mention at the first interview that the shop was to be fitted up as a tobacconist's—the first order was to put a partition across the shop and to put up certain shelves—no bill was made out till the 3rd of May—it was not only for work at the shop, but the whole of the house from top to bottom was done eventually—there were five floors, three above the ground—I floor—Day generally attended at the shop—the defendant held a situation as an accountant—he had recently been married—on Saturday, 29th March, when I called I saw Day—I might have said that I was short of money for wages, as Mr. Wadsworth had not come to town—it is quite possible that Day may have said that he would inform Mr. Lawrence, and that I said I would look in again—I do not recollect the conversation—I don't remember going again the same day, and Day saying that Mr. Lawrence had not come in—I believe I got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday; my impression originally was that I got it on the Saturday—the defendant did not say to me in Day's presence, "I can't understand why you should be asking me for the money now, when the six months' credit has not nearly expired"—I did not then say I had run short of money for wages in Mr. Wadsworth's absence, and I had to borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a friend, which I was bound to repay that day—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent Mr. Wadsworth was in a lump sum; that was quite independent of the little sums I lent him for paying wages—he always paid me that back; they were generally squared the next week when he came to town—the defendant never complained to me of the charges being very high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The charges were fair-and reasonable—it was soon after the work was commenced that he told me he was going to be married—it was when I asked him for money on account—he said he was going to marry a person with plenty of money, and he should be able to settle then—the two actions at Kingston were interpleader actions, Mr. Wadsworth having seized certain goods which had been removed from the defendant's premises; Ford and Dunn claimed them, and brought the action—Mrs. Dunn, I believe, is a widow lodging in his house, and Ford is his wife's father.</p>

At first a thought struck me that I would take them back; but on consideration I thought I would run down first to see if it was missed. When I got down I saw Dr. Bramwell talking to the manager. I then went to bed determined to speak to Dr. Bramwell in the morning. I went down and had breakfast, and walked about the hotel till midday. As I could see nothing of Dr. Bramwell, I went upstairs to get my pipe to have a smoke. When I opened my bedroom door I saw my portmanteau had been opened. I opened the drawer and saw some one had been there too. I took my pipe and went down to smoke. I waited till 5.45 without having seen Dr. Bramwell, and went up to wash before dinner. The detective then came and spoke to me."</p>

I am a carman, and live at Robinson Road, Cam<lb/>bridge Heath—on 5th February, about 4 p.m., I was driving a horse and van in Queen Victoria Street, and noticed before me a Hansom's cab, No. 7638, going at about four or five miles an hour, not more—I then saw the near wheel go over a lady's leg—that was Mrs. Walklin—the driver looked round several times after the accident, as though he was agitated—I saw his features; the prisoner is the man—he did not stop—I stopped at the European, and watched him over to the Bank of England—I did not take my eyes off the cab till I jumped down and gave the number to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 320, King's Road, Chelsea, and am a registered medical practitioner—on Monday, 23rd February, the prisoner Emmerson brought her child to the dispensary—she directed my attention to its right arm; I examined it and found the bone in the middle of the upper right arm was broken—she said she did not know it was broken—I think some days afterwards I looked at the other arm, the child was in a state of great emaciation—the skin of its thighs had a bluish appearance as though it had recently been raw, the same with its buttocks down to the knees—I examined the child, thinking that the excoriation had arisen from disease—I told the mother that it was brought about by neglect and not by disease of any kind—to the best of my recollection, she said it was well cared for—I said that I thought so seriously of it that if the child died I should direct the Coroner's attention to the matter—I can<lb/>not call to mind whether she made any answer to that—the skin of the child was in folds from the rapidity of the emaciation—I put the arm in splints, gave the mother a powder, and told her to take it home—I first sent for the relieving officer, Mr. Faryon, and spoke to him about it—I told the woman to bring the child every fine day, and she did so, with the excep<lb/>tion of two or three days—the child improved, I should say it increased in weight—I did not notice any bronchial affection—I think I saw that it was running at the nose—it died on the night of 15th March—I had seen it that morning and found out in the mean time that the left fore arm had been broken—I spoke to her about it and she told me she did not know there was anything wrong with it—when I first saw the child it required great care and attention, it wanted proper feeding and nursing—as far as I</p>

               <p>could judge that was the cause of the state it was in—the emaciation was not to be accounted for by any disease—that was the opinion I formed at the time—I made a post-mortem examination on the 18th the morning of the inquest—I examined the right arm, that was still un-united; the fracture had existed some weeks—the left fore-arm I cut down upon the bone in order to discover the reason of the deformity, which was quite apparent—I found that the radius had been broken at that point, and had healed in that distorted manner; that might have been ruptured five or six months and never properly set—I examined the lungs, there was no disease except congestion of the lower portion of both lungs, evidently recent—there was no tubercle—there was no food in the stomach—there was mucus in the bronchial tubes—one or two of the mesenteric glands were slightly enlarged, but not sufficient to account for the wasted state of the body—I could not see any fat in the body—the external appearance I should say was that of a well-formed child—there was no enlargement at the end of the bones which characterizes a scrofulous child; the uninjured limbs were straight, I they would not have been if it had been naturally a scrofulous child—I can only conclude that death arose from want of proper food, there was no disease that I could see.</p>

I late at 3, Enkel Street, Seven Sisters Road—the prisoner came to lodge with me about a week before 5th April—on Satur<lb/>day, the 3rd, I gave him notice to leave—on Sunday night he went up to bed about 8 o'clock—I went to bed about 12—his room was on the floor below mine—my wife heard some one walking up and down stairs—she got up and opened the door and called me—I went out of my room, and saw the prisoner come up the stairs from below, and go into his own room with a light—I went down, hearing the cracking of wood—his door was open, and I saw the window curtains in flames, and the Venetian blinds and the toilet table were all on fire, and the carpet was burning—there was no gas in the room; he had a candle, but it was knocked out and was lying on the floor—the prisoner was not in his room then; he was down below—I managed to put the fire out—the prisoner then came upstairs to his ream again, and we persuaded him to dress—I said "Mr. Day, hew did you manage this, did you do it accidentally or purposely?" he said "I done it purposely, because you gave me warning to leave"—I took him to the police-station, and gave him into custody—I firmly believe that he was not in his right state of mind; he seemed in a regular state of delirium, I don't know from what cause, but since the occurrence we have heard that he had come from a private asylum.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was under the influence of drink—he seemed to be in such a funny peculiar manner I could not tell whether he was drunk or not. being in the house so short a time, I had not had time to go for a reference, and did not know where he had come from—I knew he had spirits in his room; I understood that he suffered great pain, and was under medical treatment—he had no solicitor before the Magistrate—he asked me there "Do you believe that I did it intentionally?" and I said "I do not believe you did"—I believe he did not know what he was saying or doing, but we were excited then, and gave him in charge.</p>

I was called to the house about 20 minutes past 12 in the morning of 5th April, by Mr. Hallett, who said he should give the prisoner into custody for setting fire to the place—he appeared to be very stupid, as though he had been drinking previously and was recovering from drink—I said to Mr. Hallett, "What proof have you that he set fire to it?" he said "He must have done it"—I looked round the room and saw what had occurred, and I refused to take him into custody, because I did not think he did it intentionally—I went to the station and informed the sergeant on duty what had occurred—I then went back, and at the corner of the street I met the prisoner with the prosecutor and they went with me to the station—on the way there the prisoner said, "I done it by accident."</p>

I have an establishment at Burleigh House, Highgate, and also in Cavendish Street—I have known the prisoner about two years—during the greater part of that time he has been a patient of mine as a dipsomaniac for habitual drunkenness—he goes on very well for a month, and then breaks out and gets very drunk for a week—drink makes him quite irresponsible for his actions, he does not know what he is about, he gets sodden with drink—he begins by getting drink and ends by getting so drunk that he tumbles about and is unconscious of what he is doing or saying, and has to be put to bed—I should not pay any attention to what he says when in that state.</p>

I will take you home, but he could not speal—I did not go to get any one to help him, because I saw a policeman coming up the court—I heard his head strike each time he fell—I did not see any how in the face—Spencer was drunk, he could herdly stand; Mills was about half or three parts drunk—we had all been drinking.</p>

I am senior house surgeon at the Metropolitan Free Hospital in Commercial Street—the deceased was admitted there on Saturday week—I examined him—he was unconscious; he never rallied; he died on the Friday following—I made a post-mortem examination—there was a fracture of the skull coursing over the base of the brain, and a large clot of blood was effused about 3 inches in diameter, which comprised the anterior part of the middle lobe of the brain—there was a bruise on the back of the head, and another behind the left ear, and a large bruise on the small of the back—I did not see any marks on the face—the clot of blood was sufficient to cause death—every other organ was perfectly healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he got those orders he had already got the customers—I did not inquire into their solvency—the cheque of Mr. Garth Waite was not filled up in my presence—Mrs. Wilson came to the Shop several times—I do not know her writing—orders were not filled up without the person's authority—I gave Duff 15 to 20 blank cheques while I knew him, and the commission was to be shared between us, but I never had any commission—I was not told over and over again that this was an extension of the tally system within another tally System—I do not claim instalments on goods sold, but they are paid at my place Or I should not issue the eiders—five of six weekly instalments Were paid on most of these orders<lb/>Mr. Clark would see from my books if customers Were in arrears, and he Would communicate with them—if they paid promptly they saved the entrance fee, but that would not benefit me—if a customer was ill, a month of six Weeks' delay would be granted, after Which I think they would not be allowed the entrance fee.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Luton, Bedfordshire—in 1872 I was a manufacturing chemist in Bethnal Green, and the defendant put up some gas and steam pipes in my factory—in February, 1872, he asked me to lend him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take some premises in Chicksand Street and start a sawmill—he went into possession, and about October, 1872, he met with</p>

               <p>an accident, and went into a hospital; I went to see him there—he after<lb/>wards gave me a mortgage for the money I had lent him, and I advanced him more money, amounting to 597<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then advanced 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and got a mortgage from him for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I afterwards advanced him different sums as he required it—by the advice of my solicitor, in April, 1875, I cancelled the old mortgage, and got this new one in its place, which is to secure 1,160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced—I went with the defendant to Mr. Frazer, the solicitor's, office, and was present when the deed was read over to him—he took it away with him unsigned, but it was executed a day or two after<lb/>wards—in December the same year he filed a petition for liquidation, and I was returned as a secured creditor for the 1,160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I retained the mortgage; I did not give it up to the trustee—after his bankruptcy I arranged with him that he should continue in possession of the premises, but there was no arrangement about the rent—he went on as before, paying me the interest on the mortgage money—my security was valued at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the liquidation—in 1879 the defendant spoke to me about making an arrangement with the landlord for a new lease of the premises; he wanted some money for that purpose, which I agreed to advance him on a bill of sale, which was to include some of the movables, such as horses and harness—a draft bill of sale was prepared; he returned it, and would not execute it—ultimately, after trying to obtain some money from him, I in 1880 instructed my solicitor to commence an action for ejectment—I got judg<lb/>ment, and at the defendant's request I abstained from putting in an execu<lb/>tion for 14 days—I got into possession on 26th February, and then missed a large mahogany saw frame, 3 circular saw benches, a deal sawing frame, a metal travelling frame, and a saw-sharpening machine, value about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen the mahogany sawing-frame in Hollybush Gardens, at Mr. Vernon's—it was there last Tuesday—the prisoner's yard is an open one, but the shed and the gates are locked—I have not been able to find anybody—about three months ago, when the defendant was wanting money, I said "You are always wanting money;" he said "I have no one else to go to, and it will be to your advantage, because it is to place a better machine there than I have got now, and if it had been <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Peters he would have taken them all out and sold them"—I said "Why so?" he said "He did so, did not he?" I said "Yes, because I had no mortgage deed or security, and he could do it, but it would be felony for you to do it, you know, I have a mortgage deed"—I never gave him authority to move any of the things.</p>

John Frazer. I am Mr. Pepper's solicitor—I prepared the first mort<lb/>gage deed of 1872—it was cancelled by my advice in 1875, and the new one substituted for it—the defendant attended at my office; it was read over and explained to him, and he took it home to read it—he brought it back next day, and it was then executed—he certainly thoroughly well understood it—I afterwards brought an action of ejectment for Mr. Pepper and got judgment by default on 10th February, 1880—a summons was then taken out to set aside the judgment, on the ground that he had made a mistake in the day, and was endeavouring to raise the money, and an order</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188004260061"/>
               <p>was made by consent to defer it for 14 days—I acted as the defendant's solicitor in 1875—I never heard any suggestion from him that these fix<lb/>tures were not included in the mortgage, and I have seen him frequently and pressed him for payment, and no suggestion of the sort has ever been made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Towards the close of last year there was an agreement by Mr. Pepper to advance 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of the new lease which the prisoner then hoped to obtain, and also on the bill of sale—I supplied Mr. Widdicomb, the prisoner's solicitor, with the abstract of the title, of which this is a copy—there is no mention of these fixtures, but you will find it says "<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>" which shows that there was something else—the abstract was not prepared for this purpose—there is no mention of fixtures in it by name—about 24th January this year Mr. Widdicomb called on me and asked whether Mr. Pepper held any bill of sale on the machinery—I said, "No"—I swear he never asked me whether Mr. Pepper held any security other than that described in the abstract of title—I produce a letter from the prisoner's solicitor. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 3rd, 1880. Dear Sir,—I hear from the defendant that Mr. Pepper has taken possession of the mortgage premises and turned him out As you are no doubt aware there is certain machinery and effects belonging to Mr. Tushaw on the premises, I shall be glad to hear from you when Mr. Tushaw can remove the same.") I did not answer that letter, and on 6th March I received this letter: "Dear Sir,—I shall be obliged by a reply to my letter of the 3rd instant." I gave no answer to that letter—no one acted for the prisoner in 1875 when the mort<lb/>gage was executed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 20, Metropolitan Chambers, Broad Street—since the commencement of last year I have acted for the defendant in several matters—in January or February, 1879, he instructed me to endeavour to get a renewal of his lease from his landlord, and to satisfy the freeholder I obtained the abstract which has been put in—about October last an arrangement was entered into for the advance of 2201. on the security of the new lease—I then received from Mr. Frazer, the solicitor, this draft bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was to be part of the' new security—the fixtures are set out in it—on 24th January I called on Mr. Frazer, after having a conversation with Tushaw as to his right to sell certain fixtures and machinery—he is a very illiterate man; he reads very imperfectly, and his writing is ten times worse—he consulted me as to his right to certain machinery, and I advised him upon that—the step which he afterwards took was the result of my advice—I called on Mr. Frazer on 24th January with reference to this very matter in dispute, and took the abstract of title with me—I said "Does your client hold a bill of sale?"—he said "No"—I held the abstract of title like this, and said "Does your pollen hold any security of this kind?" and disclosed the abstract of title—he said "No"—the words inter alia did not convey to my mint that the fixtures were included, because they were included in the bill of sale—I went to Mr. Frazer especially on that account, to clear it up—I wrote this letter the same evening: ("January 24, 1880. Dear Sir,—I have this morning seen Mr. Frazer, who stated that his client has no charge on the machinery at present. I can, therefore, see no reason why you should not sell the machinery if you desire to do so.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mr. Thompson.</hi> I was negotiating merely for a new lease, it had nothing to do with machinery or fixtures—I gave notice in the abstract that there was an indenture of mortgage of 21st April 1875—I had distinct notice that I could inspect the mortgage at any time at Mr. Frazer's. office—I did not do so because it was the lessor's duty, not mine—it was by Counsel's advice that I allowed ray client to be com<lb/>mitted for trial when I could have given the evidence at the police-court which I have given to-day—it was not on a statement of Tushaw's that I advised him that he had a right to remove the fixtures; it was on Mr. Frazer's statement—I do not suppose I made use of the word "fixture" to Mr. Frazer, nor did I ask him whose the machinery was where there is an antecedent mortgage or bill of sale, a second mortgage or bill of sale would not necessarily recite the first, it might or might not—the second recital says "With chattels therein"—I never went to inspect them—I read the draft of the bill of sale, and I very likely read the word "chattels"—it was no use my going into the witness-box, as the Magistrate had made up his mind to commit the defendant—I have not brought the same Counsel here to-day—I employ what Counsel I like.</p>

T." on the case in which the fan is kept are the initials of Mrs. Thornhill Gell's aunt, to whom the fan was presented by Queen Caroline—the china was under Mrs. Siddall's care—I kept the fans in a box in the smoking-room, they were not locked up, and the pipe in a box which was unlocked which was placed in a cabinet, which was locked—I found the lock on my return just as I had left it—I had put the key in my private drawer—I knew nothing of Davey's knowledge of Witton, nor of the confinement—I first knew something was wrong on 12th March, when the clock could not be found—the value of the cardtray is 30 guineas—I asked the housekeeper and Davey about it, and when they came to me Davey said she knew nothing about the property, and that nothing had been missed before—I said "I do not accuse you of taking the things"—that was all that took place—I was going out—the next conversation took place with her when the officer was present—I heard the officer mention Dunbar and Wilson and their addresses to her, she answered that she did not know anything about them—the muff is worth about four guineas—it belonged to Mrs. Thornhill Gell—all these things are my property—I cannot swear to some trinkets.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sole representative of the firm of Peek Brothers, which is one of the leading tea houses in London—Charles Morris came into our employ on 8th February, 1858, and left in 1866—we then made an arrangement to give him credit, as he was going into business on his own account—we had a very good opinion of him—he is a man of good talents and ability—I knew nothing of Henry Morris until they were trading, and I was never brought into personal contact with him—Mr. Gardener, the trustee in the bankruptcy, is our principal ledger-keeper, and I know little of the details myself—insolvency was first mentioned in September, 1879, upon which I wrote for Charles Morris to come to me—he did so, and I said that I was very much surprised to hear him say what he did, and I virtually said that if he would make a clean breast of it I would do what I could for him—I knew nothing then of his betting on horse-races—on 4th October I gave directions that he had better make an assignment for the general benefit of the creditors—it is the course for the largest creditor to file the petition, and in that way I became the petitioning creditor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal ledger keeper to Peek Brothers, and am trustee of the defendants' estate—Arthur Charles Morris had been to Sir Henry Peek, and a deed of assignment had been made—a private meeting of creditors was called on 9th October, of which I was chairman—several other large creditors were there—both the defendants were present—I had been through the books and had discovered that there was a con<lb/>siderable deficiency, which they were asked to explain, and Charles referred</p>

               <p>to Henry, who was the book-keeper—Henry used to stay in London and Charles travelled—Henry said that he had been unfortunate, and had made losses and bad debts—he was then asked to leave the room, and Charles was asked to give an account—he said that his brother could explain it better than he could, but he knew they had been unfortunate and had made bad debts—he said nothing about speculations—I then said "Have you speculated on the Stock Exchange or the Turf?"—he said "Not on the Stock Exchange"—I said "Can you tell me what your loss has been, or do you keep a betting-book?"—he said "No"—I pressed him as to the amount he had lost, but he said he did not know—I suggested various things to him, and at last he said 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover his losses—he said, but I will not be certain whether it was at that meeting, that he had been betting for some time—on Henry afterwards coming in he was asked as to the de<lb/>ficiency—he handed these two sheets of paper to me, which is a balance-sheet of the state of their affairs from 1870 up to 1st January, 1879—this shows on 31st December, 1870, a loss to Charles Morris of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a similar loss to Henry—in 1871 there is a profit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—on 1st January, 1877, their balance was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the wrong side on each side; in consequence they paid in 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they made a profit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, but their drawings were 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Charles and 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Henry—in 1872 there is a loss of 523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; they then put in 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more capital, coming from relatives and sisters—in 1873 there is a loss of 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, or 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1874 a profit of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; in 1875 a profit of 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; in 1876 a profit of 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; in 1877 a profit of 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in 1878 a profit of 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; and taking the balance on 1st January, 1879, Charles Morris owed the firm 3,368<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Henry 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—up to that meeting bankruptcy had not been contemplated, but it was decided upon when it came out about the betting—a petition was then presented and adjudicated, and I was appointed trustee—my attention has been called to the bad debts; in 1870 they amounted to 2,274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. net losses; in 1871, 491<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1872, 938<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1873,212<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1874, 311<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1875, 543<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1876, 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1877, 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1878, 483<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1879, 298<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; total, 6,095<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is taken out from their books—they owe Peek Brothers 5,938<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they purchased from us between 14th June and 14th October, 1879, goods amounting to 3,190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; between 14th June and 14th October they also purchased of Saunders and Worthing<lb/>ton goods amounting to 268. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and of Twinings, 333<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; of Steinberg, 553<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19. 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of Moffatt and Co., 913<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and of Edwards and Son, 387<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; none of those goods within those periods have been paid for—I have realised out of the estate about 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to this time, and am afraid there is very little more to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Their trading with Sir Henry Peek since they have been in business amounts to about 237,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amounts they purchased between June and September are about the same as in previous years—they paid us 5,003<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between June and October, 1879, but that includes a sum of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which ought not to be included, we having lent them 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th August, as they could not meet a bill of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the first time they had come to us for assistance as far as I remember—we sold them about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods after that—Henry Morris used to come to see the samples, Charles used to travel; he lived principally at Stockton-on-Tees—the average drawings of Henry from 1871 to the time of their stoppage was about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and Charles about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Worthing</p>

Morris is a relative, either a sister or an aunt—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was borrowed of her in May, 1867.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If they had not been regular in the payments which fell due they would not have received any goods—the payments were in respect of goods which had been purchased prior to 16th June, but which fell due during that period, and had they not been met the credit would have ceased—their drawings always exceeded their profits—the stock-in-trade in Great Tower Street was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the unencumbered warrants which they could deal with were, coffee 192<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and tea 291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there were other warrants which were given to Brown, Janson, and Co., to cover discounts, but Brown, Janson, and Co. have nothing to return to the estate; they made a loss—if they had stopped at any year from 1870 to 1879, they would not have been solvent according to this paper, but at some periods their debts would have been much larger; fluctuations in the price of goods must be allowed for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman of labourers in the Victoria Docks—on March 22nd I was on board the steamship California in charge of four gangs—the prisoner was one of the men—about 11.30 I went down into the hold where the men were at work, and ordered the prisoner to certain part of the ship to trim the bunkers; he did not go, and I took him by the arm and pointed in the direction in which he was to go—he stopped a little while and picked his pipe, and put some tobacco in it, and came up to me with a shovel similar to the one with which he was trimming coals, and holding it in both hands, struck me on my cheek with the edge of it, having aimed a murderous blow at the top of my head—he cut the flesh from the bone, and I fell senseless—I lost a great deal of blood, and have been suffering ever since, and am still—I have not been able to go to work since.</p>

I am a surgeon at the Victoria Docks—Saville came to my surgery on 22nd March at midnight with a very large incised wound, extending from near the angle of his mouth in a semicircular form to near the angle of his ear, very nearly severing his cheek from his lower jaw—I had to put six or seven stitches in it—this shovel would produce it if struck downwards with the edge—a considerable deal of force must have been used, as the shovel is blunt—the wound stopped short of a dangerous position—the upper end was by the temporal artery, and the lower end by the facial artery.</p>

I think something will come of this"—she seemed very much frightened—I told her I would come and see her during the ensuing week—she said she had seen a man talking to two detectives—I saw her subsequently, and asked her what she was frightened about—she said, "It is about that cheque-book that was found on Lizzie, and if that beastly Roberts goes to the manager of the bank it will be all up with Billy and I"—I afterwards wrote a letter to Mr. Roberts—I received an answer—I gave information to the manager of the South-Western Bank—on 26th March the male prisoner came to my house—he said, "We have had a bother this morning. Edith has been taken. She is quite innocent. We are going to employ Mr. Arm<lb/>strong to try and prove an alibi"—I said, "Well, I have seen the order</p>

I live at 1, Minton Street, Deptford, and am a labourer—the prisoner lodged with me a few weeks—we slept in the same room—I went out with him on Easter Monday, and left him about 9.30 p.m.—some time afterwards I went with a fireman to a public-house in Church Street, Deptford—something was said to me, and I started with my friend to go home—on the way home we met the prisoner coming away from the lodging—I said, "Where are you going?" he said, "I can go where I like," and began abusing the landlady to me—we started an argument, and then I knocked him down—he got up again—we did not fight—I went five or six yards towards home, and then turned back for my hat, and he struck me on my face—I did not see a knife, but blood flowed—I do not remember being struck more than once, but I found several cuts afterwards—I did not fall—he said nothing—I went to a doctor—I had had a glass of liquor, but I was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at 1, Burton Street, Deptford—the prisoner and prosecutor lodged in the house on Easter Monday, and some time after 10 p.m. I met Brown with a comrade in Church Street—I stopped and spoke to them, and we all left together to go home, and met the prisoner about four doors from our house—Brown asked him where he was going, but I do not recollect what he said—I looked round, and they were both quarrelling, but I could not see which struck first—I saw them separated—Brown went towards home, and then turned back for his hat, which was lying between the road and the footpath—they got together again, and Brown called out, "I have been stabbed"—I saw blood running from his face, and his comrade took him home—the prisoner and Brown had both been drinking together in the fore part of the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Deptford—on Easter Monday, about 11.30, I was fetched to 1, Burton Street, Deptford, and found Brown in a state of collapse through loss of blood—he had two severe gashes on the right temple and a gash across the cartilage of the nose, cutting well into the cartilage—the wounds on his temple were long and deep, evidently inflicted by a sharp instrument—a sharp knife would produce them, but not a dagger—they were not stabs, they were gashes,</p>

               <p>lacerated wounds—I afterwards saw blood on the pavement in the street—he is now able to go to work, but he carries the mark of the wound—there was no danger unless erysipelas had set in.</p>

I received information, and took the prisoner entering a public-house—I said, "I shall take you into custody for stabbing a man in Burton Street, Deptford"—he said, "All right; I have stabbed no man"—he had been drinking, but he was sober—I searched him, but found no knife.</p>

After that he came back. I cannot say whether he had come for mere abuse. I had a piece of steel, or patent crinoline spring which I was cleaning my pipe with, and when I saw him returning I struck him with it. I was in a fury of rage and drink. I had no knife. I had to borrow one in the afternoon in the prosecutor's presence. <rs id="t18800426-425-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

I am a laundress, and a single woman—I have removed from 91, Cromwell Road, Redhill, to 101—I have known the prisoner, who is a widow, for some time, and had worked with her four months—she was a laundress, and lived in the Croydon Road, Reigate, and she had four children, the youngest of whom, the deceased, was, I think, 16 months old—as far as I saw, she was always a kind, affectionate mother to them—on Saturday, 31st January, I was at work for her and saw her—I did not see anything in her condition that attracted my notice—on the Monday I went to her house again at 8 a.m.—she was down in the kitchen, and the deceased was playing with his brother—we all had breakfast, and she asked me to go out and take some clothes home for her that had been washed—I returned to the house and went out again to take out her weekly books—when I came back about 10.30 she asked me to sweep up the kitchen—we had some lunch and she told me that she had seen the child's father, a man named Jenkins, and that he would not support the child—she also said if she could not have the child's father she would not have any one, and would make off with herself—she</p>

               <p>told me that she took Nelly, that is the next youngest child to the deceased, to Mrs. Knight's at Redhill—she had made observations of the same character to me before, as to making off with herself, more than three or four times—when I was going home of a night she said to me "Good-bye, Emmie," she called me Emmie, "you will not see me any more; if I don't have the child's father, I won't have no one"—and she said that Jenkins was corresponding with a girl in the Cromwell Road—she said that she had been to the superintendent's office and asked if she could swear the child; those are in substance the observations she made to me—after having lunch on this Monday morning I went out about 10.45 to collect her some money, and take home some clothes to'the lady she washed for—she gave me two letters to post, I think I should know them again, I can't read but I think these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two; I took them with ma—as I left she said, "Good-bye, Emmie, you won't see me any more"—when I got in the front gate she said to me, "Make haste back and then we will go down the town together"—she seemed in great trouble about the child, she never appeared in any other trouble that I could see—there was nothing unusual about her; when I left her that morning—she said she was going out for two or three days to frighten the child's father, she did not say when she was going—I said "Don't talk like that, better days aw coming, and summer as well"—I said that when she said I should not see her any more, and it was after that she said "Make haste back"—I was gone about an hour and a half: I forgot to post the letters—she had given me the money to put stamps on them—I returned to the house about 12.30—I went to the back door and found it looked—I then went round to the front door and that was locked also—I then went in next door to Mrs. Smith's, and after what she said to me I went back to the back door—I found the key of the back door in a window close by—I opened the door and went in, and went downstairs into the kitchen—when I left the house the deceased child was in the kitchen in the cradle, not undressed—there was no one in the kitchen when I returned, the cradle was there but the child's clothes were not—I found a letter on the table, and a blue envelope similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), as far as I can judge this is the envelope—I took the letter round to Mrs. Smith—I then came back to the house with her and looked over the house—I found all the doors open except the prisoner's bedroom door on the first floor, that was locked—I then went downstairs with Mrs. Smith and went outside to find some assistance—we went into Mr. Parsons's—amongst other persons I saw Mr. Pym and Mr. Horneybrook—I gave the letter to Mr. Pym, he read it and handed it to Mr. Horneybrook to read, he read it and handed it back to me—I afterwards gave it to constable Stenning—Mr. Pym and Mr. Horneybrook went into the house with me, and went to the bedroom door—shortly after<lb/>wards Brown, the carpenter, came and burst open the door—I did not go in—Stenning, the constable, arrived shortly after—he went into the room, and Dr. Stone also when he arrived—about an hour and a half afterwards, after the doctors had gone, I went into the room—I saw the prisoner there in bed—the doctor had attended to her then—I saw her throat was bandaged up, I did not speak to her or she to me, her eyes were shut, she never spoke at all—it was about three or four o'clock—I did not know whether she was asleep or not—I gave the two letters that I had had to post to Stenning.</p>

               <p>employed there as a washerwoman—I was not living with her, I was living in Cromwell Road, about a mile from the prisoner—I had seen Jenkins in the police force, but I did not know him to speak to—he told me himself that he was the father of the child—I can't tell when he told me that—the prisoner told me that Jenkins went with the girl on the Redhill Asylum fete day—I was not at work with her when she told me that, it was after I went to work there—it was after that that Jenkins told me that he was the father of the child—it was at Mrs. Knight's, where he was lodging—the prisoner appeared to be in great trouble about keeping this child—she told me that she had had words with Jenkins because he said he would not keep the child—she told me that he had promised to marry her, that he had put it off for 12 months, and had not paid a penny towards the child, and then he took up with this other girl—as far as I know, the neighbours had treated her very kindly—she was in great trouble about the child from the first month that I was there, and also about the man being faithless to her in not marrying her—I cannot read or write—she has oftentimes said she would make away with herself—she used to say to me and the other girl who worked there, "Good-bye, you won't see me any more"—it was a common expression for her to say that—she said she could not keep the child if Jenkins did not pay something for it, that she had a hard matter to support herself and the other children—the eldest of the others is about 14 years old, and was at work at Mr. Keasley's; the other two went to school—I knew Dr. Walters had attended the prisoner during the time I was employed there, off and on the whole time—she worked at the wash<lb/>ing herself—I used to go there sometimes about half-past six, and work there till late, and go home by train at 15 minutes past 9—I had to work wry hard, because she had a deal of work—she used to work standing at the tub washing—Dr. Walters was attending her for loss of blood, some complaint of the womb—she told me that Dr. Walters said she would never get well without she gave up work—she told me that one Sunday after he had been there—I think it was on the Sunday but one before she done the murder—she said, "How can I give up work and let my children go in the workhouse?"—she was in a very dreadful state of health at that tune—she told me that she had been to Mr. Reece, the town clerk, about getting an order from the Magistrates for Jenkins to pay something; and she found that, as he had not paid anything for 12 months, she could not get any summons—I did not go to the Magistrates with her—I went to Reigate, and asked Mr. Small if she could not bring a breach of promise against him—her despondency increased—she kept on getting worse about keeping this child, and said she would never marry any one without she had Jenkins—she used to say she could not sleep of a night, and two or three nights that I slept with her she was awake the best part of the night—she was very often irritable and petulant, as if her trouble was too much for her—when she could forget her trouble she was not at all desponding, she was as nice and cheerful a woman as I ever worked with—she used to complain of her head very much at times—she had got a sick-headache—at those times she used to say that her trouble was too much for her to bear—she was very fond of the deceased child, and always treated it kindly—I tried to cheer her up all I could—she asked me when I left the house to bring back some soap and soda from Mr. Smith's, in the Elmsdale Road—I think it was since</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> She was very fond of Jenkins—at times she used to say she had dreadful pains in her head—she complained of illness that Dr. Walters attended her for—she suffered pain in consequence of that—it was a common expression of hers to say, "Good-bye; you won't see me any more"—I did not pay any attention to it—it was when I used to go home of a night, not every night, now and then—she used to say it to every one that came to the house—she had no other means of livelihood than the laundry work—she had a difficulty in making both ends meet—I know that from the business she did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.R.C.S. practising at Reigate—on the 2nd February, between 12 and 1, I was called to this house in the Croy<lb/>don Road—I went up to the bedroom on the first floor and there saw the witness Brown and Mr. Horneybrook—I found the prisoner in bed, with her infant child lying beside her, lying obliquely across the bed with its face turned towards its mother—I found the child's throat was cut; there was a deep incised wound running across the neck, chiefly on the right side; it was deepest on the right side, and wounded the internal jugular vein—it was quite dead, and the extremities were com<lb/>mencing to be cold—it had been dead perhaps an hour—it was nearly 1 o'clock when I was there—the wound had been inflicted from right to left, I should say—the knife had evidently entered on the right side, the depth of the wound was there, and the tail of the wound seemed to be on the left side—I found the prisoner's throat was also cut; it was a horizontal cut in the neck, quite superficial, wounding only the skin and superficial tissues—she seemed in a weak state, but quite conscious—she answered me immediately I spoke to her—the wound had not bled a great deal, not sufficient to cause fainting or anything of</p>

It is all through that bad, wicked man"—I told her to keep herself quiet—she said nothing more at that time—when the doctor arrived he handed me this knife—before I went into the room the witness Risbridger handed me these three letters—I afterwards gave them to the superintendent—I went back to the room in the afternoon and stayed there—the prisoner made no further statement to me that day—I was not present when the superintendent charged her—about ten o'clock next morning she said to me, "It is all through Jenkins; I have been good and kind to him"—I cautioned her, as I saw she was going to speak.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a B. A. of the University of London, a M.R.C.S. of London, and a M.D. of London University—I have been in practice at Reigate nearly 16 years—I did not attend the prisoner when she was confined of this illegitimate child—the first I remember of her was when attending her late husband in his illness some four years ago—I have no recollection of attending her in the interval—until this unfortunate conuection with the man Jenkins she bore a most exemplary character—I believe it is with regard to Jenkins only that her character was in any way altered—in February, 1879, I began to attend her in her illness; thai must have been about four months after her confinement—she was then suffering from disease of the womb; the complaint consisted of what we call sub-involution of the uterus; that consists essentially of an enlarge<lb/>ment of the womb, it not having recovered its natural size since her confinement—incident to that disease she suffered from profuse periodical lost of blood, in fact it was almost constant—I have no doubt that arose from or was aggravated by neglect after her confinement, by the anxiety to get about too soon—I made her wean her child, and I urged upon her then and subsequently the necessity of rest, that the treatment would not have its proper effect unless she could lay up and give herself rest—she was anxious to get well in order, as she said, to be married to some man, who I understood was Jenkins, the father of the child—she constantly spoke of that—she was not then in a fit state to be married—I attended the child in the spring of 1879 for inflammation of the lungs, a very severe attack—no mother could have been more careful or attentive to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188004260105"/>
               <p>her child than she was—she was moat anxious about it, and most solici<lb/>tous to do everything she possibly could for its benefit—it recovered—I should say that in her station of life no one could have taken more care, of a child, or been more anxious about it, or give more indications of fondness—I saw her constantly at short intervals, on and off, till the actual commission of the crime—she was very weak, in a low state of health, caused by the disease from which she suffered; she complained of great headache and restlessness at night; she was very pale and blood<lb/>less; she also complained of palpitation of the heart upon any exertion—a week or two before the commission of the crime I noticed that she was distressed in mind, especially the very day before; I could see nothing indicating insanity, but she was in a state of great mental distress—I perceived those symptoms from my own observations; her friends had not informed me of her threats to commit suicide, or of the state<lb/>ments she had made; I did not know of them till subsequently—the condition of the uterus was somewhat better, but still she was in a very weak, depressed state of health; she had not had time or opportunity, to recover—insanity is in many cases hereditary—it arises most frequently in females where there is some uterine disease; in this case you have not only the predisposing tendency to insanity, but you have the debilitating disease of the womb, also tending to produce insanity; I attribute import<lb/>ance to the conjunction of these two causes, one would intensify the other—in my experience with persons affected with mania, arising from puerperal affection or from derangement of the womb, there is generally a tendency to suicide or child murder, sometimes one, sometimes the other—in some persons it will take the form of suicidal tendency, in others homicidal tendency—I have listened attentively to the facts and circum<lb/>stances of this case, and I have no doubt that this act was one of homi<lb/>cidal mania—I believe she would not know the nature of the act she was doing at the time—the evidence I have heard rather tends to strengthen that conclusion—I believe she would not know she was doing a wrong thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe she would not know she was doing a guilty act, that she was committing murder—I suppose she would know that she was cutting the child's throat, but she would not know that it was a crime to do so; I take it she was in that state of mind that she would not understand she was committing a criminal act—probably she would know that the effect of cutting the child's throat would be to kill it, but she would not think it was a crime to kill it at the time the act was committed—when I had seen her before on my visits I saw none of the ordinary symptoms of insanity—I believe she was same on other matters—she did not say or do anything to lead me to believe that she did not know what she was saying or doing—there may be depression and great distress of mind without its amounting to insanity—her being much in love with the man who refused to marry her or support her child would tend to produce great distress of mind—I look upon that as the exciting cause of the act she committed—the distress of mind caused by the conduct of her lover I look upon as the exciting cause of the out<lb/>break of homicidal mania, acting upon her previous mental distress and condition—homicidal mania is a species of insanity that takes the form of killing or destroying some person, most commonly those who are most dear to the person so affected—I very seldom saw the other children when</p>

               <p>I was at the house; I did occasionally—as far as I know she was equally affectionate and devoted to them, but she always struck me as being par<lb/>ticularly fond of this child, more so than I should have expected consider<lb/>ing the parentage and the birth of it—it struck me as a remarkable circumstance that, the child being illegitimate, she should show so much attachment to it—until just before the commission of the crime I did not know who her lover was—whoever he was she was undoubtedly very fond of him—I should say undoubtedly from her condition of health, from her previous family history of insanity, that this was the act of an unsound mind—it is well known that persons suffering from this form of insanity will attack the child they are most attached to—she did not attack her lover, as a sane person would probably have done; she had a spite against him, and had every cause to be offended with him; but she does not attack him, she attacks her dearly-loved child: it is not the act of a sane person to do that—apart from the act itself, there is her state of depression, her state of restlessness, her bad state of health; and disappointment by her lover refusing to marry her or support her child, that might produce a similar condition of restlessness, but not so bad; it would greatly depend upon the strength of affec<lb/>tion of the particular woman—I should look on the act itself as an act of insanity—apart from the act itself there may be no special symptom—the threat of suicide would be an additional proof of in<lb/>sanity—some medical men believe that the mere act of suicide is evidence of insanity—I have not formed any decided opinion about that; it would be an additional proof of insanity I take it—the attempt at suicide would be very strong presumptive evidence of insanity, but not actual positive proof—I should say it is a very rare occurrence that a person who is not insane should commit suicide—there is frequently an entire absence of motive in cases of insanity, or a motive founded upon some delusion—there may be some motive in the mind of the person which we are unable to trace.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Many persons may be distressed, restless, and excitable without being insane—I think it would be impossible in many cases to distinguish between sane and insane persons having those symptoms; in the absence of delusion I can point to no positive distinction—except the fact of killing the child I can point out no one symptom as a positive indication of insanity; I look on the act as a symptom of insanity—in certain cases you may have these symptoms without any actual insanity, or with it, and you may have an outbreak—I should take the frequent speaking of suicide to be a symptom of insanity; I should not expect a sane person to do it—in cases of homicidal mania you may have no definite symptoms of insanity before the commission of the act, or after the act, yet the act itself may be an insane act—supposing the person who commits the act is in such a state of bodily health and mental distress, and there is a previous history of hereditary insanity as will tend to lead to the commission of such an act, then if you have those factors I think you may safely say the act is one of insanity.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Smith wood Common, in the parish of Albury, and am employed by the Puke of Northumberland to superintend the common—on Monday, 22nd March, Peter Farley called me from my house at a little after 10 p.m.—I went with him to the common and saw two fires burning—the furze was burning—the two fires were about 200 yards apart, or a little more—I saw the prisoner there; he was at the second fire we got to—I said, "That won't do, King"—the second fare was over then, and I saw him light a match and light a third fire—it was then that I said, "That won't do, King," and he put it out directly—I had put out the two first fires—I first saw King standing a little way off the second fire—I said, "Halloa, King," and went part of the way to him—I then saw another fire, a third, and saw the prisoner standing by it—I went part of the way home, and then went back again, and saw the prisoner light a match and light the furze, and then put it out again—I said, "That won't do"—he said that he would set all the furze on fire, he did not do anything more, but went home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first fire might be 100 yards from my house, or not quite so much—the prisoner lives with my son in a cottage more than 30 yards from mine—the second fire was about 200 yards away from my cottage in quite a different direction to the first fire—the first fire was the nearest to my cottage—it took me about a minute to get from the first fire to the second—I could see the prisoner perfectly clearly at the second fire—he was standing looking at it being put out—after the second fire was put out I saw a third fire, and in consequence of that I turned back and went to it, and saw the prisoner standing by it—I said at the police-court, "I saw King near the second fire, close beside it. I said to him, 'Halloa, King.' He made no answer. We left King there I went part of the way home again. I saw King stooping down; I don't know whether he was lighting his pipe or a match, but the furze bush was on fire"—that is right—I also said, "I saw the fire, but I did not see the match; there was no fire when I saw King stooping"—I have been in Court at Guild<lb/>ford since I gave evidence at the police-court—I was before the Magis<lb/>trates there—it was for taking some sheep into the yard—I am on bail now to take my trial at the Surrey Assizes for sheep-stealing—I did not see any third fire until I got up to King and saw him stooping to strike a light—I swear that he said, "I will burn all the furze"—I did not say something different to that at the police-court—I said, "After he had put the fire out, he said, 'All the lot ought to be burnt'"—I did not hear him say, "It would not matter much if it was all burnt, it is only a bit of waste stuff"—I do not remember his using the words "waste stuff"—I</p>

He-examined. Before I turned back I saw him standing there near the furze, and went back directly—I saw him stoop down, strike the match, and set the furze on fire—I do not know whether he was lighting his pipe or not—I never saw a pipe if he had one—I can't say whether I should have seen it, because it was dark—I never heard him say anything about a pipe—he did not show me one.</p>

I live at Smithwood Common—on Monday, 22nd March, about 10 o'clock, I saw a fire on the common—Denyer was called, and I went with him on to the common—we went to the fire and it was put out—I then saw a second fire several yards from the first—we went and put that out—as we were going from the first fire to the second I saw the prisoner several yards from the second fire—we spoke to him—the second fire was put out, and I went home.</p>

                  </hi>. I have compared the writing in this rent-book with these documents in Payne's case signed H. C. Nugent, and the signature to this post-office order, and in my opinion they are in the same writing, and so is this half cheque—all the documents signed James Melton are in the same writing as the others, and so are. all the documents signed James A. Aston—I am not perfectly certain about the post-office order, but I believe it is the same—the document signed 8. B. Weedon and the filling up of the printed forms are also the same as the rent-book, and so is this writing at the bottom of this printed advertisement, but it is somewhat in a feigned hand—I have not the slightest doubt about it—these pieces of blotting-paper have the signature of Weedon—I do not know that this</p>

               <p>impression on the blotting-paper is the blotting to those signatures, but it is the blotting of the same handwriting, and this piece of paper has the blotting of the word London in the same writing as these letters, and as the rent-book—I cannot identify the blotting of the figures—these letters signed Edward Vassey are in the same writing—I have had a large experience in examining writing, and have given evidence in many cases—I feel no difficulty at all—I give my opinion distinctly—most of these are in one writing, the first is in an assumed hand, very different from the usual style; it is upright, to represent a lawyers clerk's writing.</p>

Mahew, in which I appeared—I pinned my faith too much upon the City solicitor, and it turned out to be the clerk's writing—I gave my opinion as to the writing being the acme and afterwards found out that I was wrong and retracted it—I had given a hasty opinion—I opened my ears instead of my eyes, and that has been a lesson to me ever since; we are all liable to be mistaken—I do not profess to be infallible, we all make mistakes, but the best men make the fewest—in this case I have not relied at all on what Sergeant Littlechild told me—I gave my opinion before I saw him—I have compared with him the post-office order—I gave evidence in Fortescue and Bagshaw, and you cross-examined me—the evidence I gave against Bagshaw was as strung as I could give it, and the Jury acquitted him—if he had not been acquitted I should not have had to givt evidence against him again—I gave evidence in the adjoining Court against a gentleman who was tried for libel, and Mr. Netherclift was called on the same side, and the Jury gave a verdict against us—that is not the first time Juries have done so—after I had passed a confident opinion, a witness came who said that he wrote part of the post-card in question—in 25 or 30 year I cannot always be infallible, but I give my opinion after careful exami<lb/>nation and taking great trouble.</p>
