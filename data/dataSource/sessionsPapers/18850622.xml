                  </hi>. I am manager of the West Brighton branch of the Capital and Counties Bank—I became manager on 14th February, 1884—at that time I knew nothing of Gardner, Forbes, or Bloomfield—I first knew Forbes in June, 1884, when he and Gardner came into the office together—at that time I might have heard there was such a firm as Bloomfield and Co. in Brighton—I might have heard the name men<lb/>tioned, but I had no business connection with them—Forbes was spokes<lb/>man in the presence of Gardner—they wished to open a general account with a line of discount—I said it was not usual, without an introduction; Forbes then said that his Scotch bankers would write a letter of introduc<lb/>tion if I wished it—I am not certain whether it was at that interview or the next that he said "he" or "we are doing an extensive business in Brighton"—the account was to be opened in the name of Jones and Forbes, and their places of business were Conway Street and Aldrington Basin, where they had stock and saw-mills; they are places in Brighton—he said they would require bills discounted—no business was done then—I waited until I heard from the Scottish bank, and not hearing from them I was not satisfied, and saw the prisoner Gardner again—I don't think I saw Forbes, Forbes was there on the 16th; I said that I must write again, it was not quite satisfactory—I asked him what amount of stock he had there, and he said "I should think 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and referred to Gardner, and he said "Yes, quite that"—he said that Gardner was his agent or manager there—ultimately the account was opened—Gardner signed, Forbes wrote an authority for me to honour Gardner's signature—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—to the best of my belief the body of it is written by Gardner. (<hi rend="italic">This gave Gardner authority to draw bills and cheques.</hi>) The account was open for about six weeks, and during that time over 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. passed through the bank—this is our pass-book—these three letters (<hi rend="italic">E, F, and G</hi>) are in Gardner's handwriting, and enclosed monies and bills—our bank is a creditor on Forbes's estate for about 673<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Gardner transacted all the business with me during the whole time the account was open, paying in and drawing out—the indebtedness is in respect of bills discounted or dishonoured—this bill for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 5th July, 1884, payable to T. P. Harker, is filled up and signed by Gardner, and was paid by our bank.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 24, Upper Thames Street, also at Stockton and Falkirk as iron founders—I was a creditor of Jones and Forbes in September, 1884, of about 3,060<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had known Forbes for a good many years before, and have done business for the firm of Jones and Forbes for about nine or ten years—I have been appointed by the Court of Bankruptcy trustee of the estate of Bloomfield and Co., of Brighton, and also of the estate of Jones and Forbes, and as such I have come into the possession of a large quantity of correspondence passing between Gardner and Forbes, and Forbes and Gardner, and I have gone through most of them—I remember Forbes coming to me on the 26th, at that time he was indebted to my firm between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—I recollect his sending me on that occasion some bills of exchange, and amongst them was this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), drawn by Jones and Forbes on Bloomfieid and Co. for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had heard prior to that something about Bloomfield and Co., in consequence of which on seeing the bill I spoke to Forbes about them—I asked him if he had any connection with them, and he said "No, nothing further than doing business"—I asked him if they were all right—he said yes, that Mrs. Bloomfield had a considerable amount of money in the business, and the statements about Gardner being a rogue were not true—I had mentioned Gardner to him, and he said he was simply manager—I had been introduced to him some time previous to that by Forbes—he said that he had always found Gardner an honest man—he asked me to give him cash for the bills or exchange cheques with him, which I refused to do—I asked him on whom they were drawn; I said "Are these customers of yours?" and he said yes, they were all for goods sold and delivered—I ultimately gave him cash for some of them a few days afterwards—I charged him our bank rate—he had altogether about 400<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> part then and part afterwards, and some before—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the bills he gave me, and these other two were sent down to the foundry to my brother at Stockton—the two bills given to me were dishonoured among others—I have only got a shilling in the pound out of Forbes's estate—I discounted a bill he gave me drawn on Bloomfield and Co. for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I discounted others which have been refused—I asked him in the ordinary way how he was getting on, he said very well, that his sales up to that time of the year had been 56,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had made upwards of 30 per cent, profit on some wood, and that next year he expected to be able to pay half cash and half bills instead of all bills for everything he had, and the year after that cash for everything—the reason given by him why he wanted these bills discounted was that his bankers did not give him any accommodation for discounting the bills, and some money that he had borrowed from a Mr. Ross had got a few days behind in the interest, that Mr. Ross had kicked up a row about it; and he said "D—it, I am not going to stand it," and I wrote him out a cheque for the whole amount with interest, about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had also bought a large quantity of wood at a sale, and he had made 30 per cent. out of that, and he wanted to clear it—he further told me that he had between 2,000 and and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of undiscounted bills in his pocket, and that if his bankers</p>

               <p>would only give him anything like reasonable facilities he would be able to pay me now cash for everything he had—after that conversation I came to an arrangement with him about a further supply of goods—I considered he was doing very well to be able to pay from 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed his statement, and allowed the account to increase, but if I had known he had anything to do with Gardner I would not have done it—he got goods after that roughly to the amount of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been paid nothing for that—he is now credited to our firm in about 3,060<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Ross is now proving on the estate for1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a proof on the file, it is at my office in the safe—I took possession of all papers and documents, both Bloomfield's and Forbes's, all that I could find✗—among Bloomfield's papers I found this book hid away—the words at the top of the receipt, "For Mrs. Kate Gardner," are in Gardner's handwriting—that was found in one of the places to which they had removed them, one of the houses standing in the name of Mrs. Gardner, an empty house—I found a sack load of them there—among the papers was found this paper in Gardner's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Relating to the purchase of houses by Mrs. Gardner</hi>)—I also found this press copy of a letter, the body of which is in Gardner's handwriting—I have carefully examined the books of Bloomfield and Co., and all the papers, and there is no account in any cash book or ledger of any account with Mrs. Kate Gardner, nor in any of the books of Jones and Forbes—I have not been able to trace any record of any of these transactions in the books—among the papers I found this letter from Bloomfield and Forbes, dated 28th May, 1884, signed by Gardner—it is on the usual printed paper of Bloomfield and Co.—it mentions the names of Gear, who is the Scotch Bank manager, Sheldon, who is a man at Brighton, and Gray, who is manager of the London and Counties Bank at Brighton—it is signed "J. H. Gardner"—I also found this letter of 1st June from Forbes to Gardner, and one from Gardner to Forbes among Forbes's papers—there are a mass of papers—this refers to Rennie, who is Forbes's nephew and clerk, and also to a code—I discovered a code at Gardner's and another at Forbes's—I found this policy of insurance on the Scottish Union in Forbes's desk when I broke into the office—it is dated 20th June, 1883, and is an insurance for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the private dwelling-house and domestic offices at Cameron Villa, Hove—there is no disclosure of this policy or the property mentioned in it in Forbes's statement of affairs, and he denied at first that he had anything to do with it—there is a house in Church Street which stands in Mrs. Gardner's name—the house has not been given up to me—these two cheqnes were found amongst Bloomfield's papers that were hid away—I received them from his clerk—one is dated March 4th, 1884, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed "R. Bloomfield and Co."—that is the only one I found wholly in Bloomfield's writing—this black cheque is signed by Bloomfield—I have compared those signatures with Bloomfield's signature to his petition, and they correspond—I have examined the accounts of the two firms—an accountant has also examined them independently—a claim was made on Forbes's estate by the Royal Bank of Scotland for between 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., plus the sum of 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. guarantee, the nett amount would be about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and between 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for bills—that is a claim upon dishonoured acceptances—I have the proof—I found no account in the name of Bloomfield in Forbes's letters, and the same as to Gravatt, Schofield, Parker, and Gates—</p>

               <p>delivered, so that it should not be dishonoured—he wanted money to meet it, and got it—I had not overdrawn to that extent on 9th June—it is a thing done many a time, if people cannot meet a bill, to give them money to do it—I recollect a bill in January for 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid every penny of that in the ordinary way—he bought 1,000 stoves, and was selling under price—my discount was 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was taking 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could not sell them—we took them back, and he drew for the amount, and there was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something then—I gave an acceptance for the stoves we took back to prevent him spoiling the trade—it is not true that he paid for things he never had—we stored them in our factory as we made them, and they were included in the account—I can fix 26th May as the date Forbes brought the bill and had the interview, by the entry made as to the bills—he came several days afterwards—I would not give him cash for any of them till the 31st—I did not send the bills to my brother in Scotland—Forbes, I believe, sent a batch of bills to my brother in Scotland—my brother did not forward any of those to me—this 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not one of them—the bill-book does not show he called, but there is an entry in it of the 26th May, and this cheque was drawn on the 29th—I have no account of Forbes calling on the 26th; I have my memory, it was not before the 26th—I had not known Bloomfield before then, I had seen Gardner before—it was not necessary to make inquiries about Gardner, everybody was saying bad about him—Forbes told me he was manager to Bloomfield and Co.—I had heard that on the 26th, the date of the interview—Forbes left some five bills with me; two had four months to run, the one for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was one of them—I made inquiries of him about Bloomfield and Co.; he showed himself to be intimate with their affairs—he told me that Bloomfield had a lot of money in it, and that Gardner was a decent, honest man, and would not have failed if the bankers had not come on him—after I lent money I made further inquiries about Bloomfield and Gardner and Co.—if I had known Forbes was a partner in Bloomfield and Co. I would have trusted him, but would have reduced my trust—I was bound to trust him till he paid up—between 26th and 29th May he told me what he did about Gardner and Bloomfield and Co.—I have got all the books and papers I could, many were taken away—I have got 12 letter books—Forbes's late partner would not let me in the office, and kept me waiting, and sent a message that if I liked to wait he would come over—Forbes stayed in London doing the <hi rend="italic">lardi-dardy</hi>—I could not get the keys from Forbes, nor from Jones or his nephew—they both treated me with the utmost contempt, and I could not get the keys—all the bills he left with me were dishonoured; he left five—the first I refused; I made inquiries about the others—the insurance policy refers to Cameron Villa—Forbes lived in Camden House—I heard that the equity of redemption in that house belonged formerly to Smale and Brinkhurst—I do not know that they owed Jones and Forbes between 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and assigned it to them for the debt—I believe Gardner parted, before he handed these over to Forbes, with a lot of horses and things, and Forbes proved for the full amount—I traced one of those horses, a black one, to Falkirk, and a piebald pony to London—the house was built by Smale and Co.—Forbes took it over when Gardner failed, and then Forbes put it back again afterwards—I could not tell you the exact day it was assigned—some property in Church Street was assigned by Gardner—the cheque</p>

H. Gardner in September, 1883—on one side are goods and cash, and on the other credit by bills, Gates, Sheldon, Blandford, &amp;c.—there is no ledger account for those people—goods sent to Brighton were invoiced to Bloomfield and Co., not to customers—the customers paid for these in bills, but if Bloomfield and Co. had the goods he should have drawn the bills—it was done to have something to fall back on—it enabled Forbes to discount them at the bank, and send the money to Gardner, and to defraud his creditors—I believe Rennie kept the books—the books are so well kept from 1883 to September, 1884, that they do not disclose what they should—the letter of 27th September, 1883, only refers to bills drawn on four customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Boat public-house, North Hyde, and manufacture bricks on the land adjoining—on Tuesday morning, 2nd June, between 5.15 and 5.30, Taddenham, my engineer, made a com<lb/>munication to me, and I went with him to the engine-house in the brick<lb/>field—the boarding of the engine-house had been broken away, the water had been let out of the boiler, and a large cog had been broken off an old wheel outside, and placed between two cogs of a pinion wheel—the result of that would have been, if the engine had been worked, that the whole motion would have thrown down and smashed at a loss of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 70 or 80 men would have to be paid—if the men had lit the furnace without noticing that the water had been let out, the fire-box would have become hot, and when cold water came in the boiler would have burst—the man fills the boiler overnight, and might look or not before lighting the fire—I went down the field and found bricks crushed under foot—I saw footmarks which exactly correspond with Taylor's boots—the engine-house is closed and the driver leaves at 6 p.m.—no one has any right there at any time—I had seen the prisoner on Sunday, the 31st—he came to my house and asked me for a job—I told him I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of a police-constable, and lodge at 25, Rutland Street, Whitechapel—I went to lodge there six weeks before the 1st of March—I have known the prisoner about 12 months, part of that time was when my husband was alive—he died on 4th August, 1884, Bank Holiday—after his death the prisoner on several occasions asked me to marry him—I said "No"—he said nothing but death should part us—shortly before the 1st March I took his dagger from him—that was in my parlour—he sharpened it on one of my pokers, and said it would be bright if it was wanted at the police-court, and he pointed it to me at the time—the blade of it was about six inches long, and it had a cross-bar of steel—it did not shut up—it was quite naked—it had two sharp edges—in consequence of what he said at that time I took the dagger away, and put it in my drawer—I only had it two or three minutes that day—I did not keep it in my drawer all that day because he said he would force it open if I did not give it him back, and I gave it him back—I first met Howard at my brother-in-law's—his name was Charles, but I called him George—I first met him about a fortnight before the occurrence at my brother-in-law's—I saw his frequently after that, not every day, pretty nearly—he was a farrier—I engaged myself to marry him—I did not say anything to Alt about my marrying Howard—on Saturday night, 28th February, I was all day at my sister's, Emily Murrell, 62, Charlotte Street, Whitechapel—Howard had been with me that day, not all day; he came to my sister's about 7 in the evening, we left at 20 minutes to 12 to go home—my sister's is about 5 or 10 minutes' walk from Rutland Street—as we were going home we met the prisoner, and we all three went into the White Hart public-house, which is opposite, in Turner Street, almost within a stone's throw of my house, it is the next turning—we only stayed there three minutes—we were talking quietly, all friendly—I had twopennyworth of rue gin, and the others had half a pint of beer each, in pewter pots—we were all sober—we then left the White Hart together—the prisoner was lodging at a beershop in Whitechapel Road at this time—I don't</p>

               <p>know the name of it—they were just shutting up the shutters, when we left the White Hart—that was close upon 12—we all three crossed to the door of my house and stood there—while standing there the prisoner asked me if I would marry him—that was said in a tone of voice that Howard could hear—I said no, as I said before, as I was going to marry George—my little boy, 6 1/2 years old, was with me all day, and my baby as well—just after I had said this about marrying George, my landlord and landlady came to the door from the inside—they stood at the door, and were present when he asked me to be his wife—the prisoner said something to my landlady which I could not hear—they stood at the door until I was being stabbed, and then they shut me out—when they saw him stabbing me they shut the door—before they went in the prisoner caught hold of Howard and stabbed him first—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand—he struck him somehow on this side, and he put up his arms and staggered—I can't say for sure how many times the prisoner struck him; two or three times—Howard never said any<lb/>thing—after he had stabbed Howard he caught hold of me and swung me against the edge of the door, and stabbed me in the neck, six times in the chest, and three times on my back—it was done all in a moment—my little boy was with me—my baby was in bed—I had gone home about 8 o'clock and put my baby to bed—the prisoner did not say any<lb/>thing either to me or Howard; only made like a groaning noise every time he stabbed me—after I was stabbed I saw Howard standing at the corner of Rutland Street with his arms up and staggering—he had not said or done anything to the prisoner before he was stabbed—at the same time I saw the prisoner with his arms up stabbing himself about the side—I then knocked at the door, and the landlady let me in—I was taken to the London Hospital, where I remained nine weeks—the prisoner and my husband had not been on so very friendly terms, only speaking together and that like—two or three days before this occurrence the prisoner had given me his bank book to take care of—I had got it at the time of this occurrence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The landlord and landlady waited until they saw the stabbing, and then went in and shut the door—I knew the prisoner in my husband's lifetime, he was a particular friend of my husband's; they were on good terms—my husband and I had lodged at the prisoner's cousin's, a Mr. Schweppe, a German baker—I did not, shortly after my husband's death, tell the prisoner that I had poisoned myself, and I never did—he did not give me an emetic—I did not take, or pretend to take, poison within two months of my husband's death—I did not say to the prisoner "I have poisoned myself because I am so lonely"—I did not ask, or suggest to him, that he should marry me—I know he was called to Germany, prior to Christmas, by the death of his mother—we were lodging at Mr. Schweppe's then—before he went to Germany I had not encouraged him to believe that I would marry him—I never told him so—I never said I was going to marry him—I did not say before the Coroner that I had promised to marry him at the end of 12 months of my husband's death—I told Mrs. Burton, my landlady, so, but not in the prisoner's presence—I only told my landlady, no other person; not Mur<lb/>rell, my brother-in-law—I told him I was frightened of him—I did not continue to see him up to the night of 28th February; he obstructed me in the street—I went to live in Rotherhithe for about five days, at</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at the German Hospital, Dalston—on Sunday morning, 1st March, about 1 o'clock, the prisoner was brought there—he was suffering from injuries to his chest; I found 10 punctured wounds—I asked him how he got his wounds—he said he had had a quarrel with another man—the wounds had all the same direction, from above downwards—they might have been self-inflicted; it is more likely that they were self-inflicted than otherwise—they were done with a dagger or a knife with a very thin back, I mean double-edged—they were not very dangerous—he remained an in-patient till 18th March, when he was taken into custody; in the meantime a constable had been in charge of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old—I was staying on a visit to my uncle and aunt, Matilda Millbank, at 22, Rochester Row, Westminster, for about two months—they had two rooms on the top floor—my uncle gets up early and goes to work—on the day this occured he had gone to work as usual; he came home to breakfast at 8 and</p>

               <p>went to work again—my aunt went out between 9 and 10 to take the clothes to wash—she returned between 12 and 1 with the clothes all wet ✗n a basket; I don't know whether she carried them up, they were out on the landing when I got to the door—my aunt sent me to hang them out; I carried them down stairs to the back yard and hung them on the line to dry and carried the basket upstairs—as I went up I looked out of the landing window and saw the prisoner come out and pull the line down and throw the clothes on the ground—she lives with her husband downstairs, they keep a clog-shop—I told my aunt what the prisoner had done, and from wnat she said I went down again into the back yard, picked up the clothes, and brought them up to my aunt's room—two or three minutes afterwards, while I and my aunt were in the room together, the prisoner came upstairs and opened the door of the room, she picked up a plate off my aunt's table and struck her on the head; she then dragged her down by the shoulders on to the floor and kicked her in the back and thumped her—she did not say anything as she did this—as she was going out at the door she picked up a zinc pail and threw it at her—it struck her on the forehead; she had just got up; she fell down again—as the prisoner shut the door she said "If it was not for my two children I would not leave you alive—my aunt was down on the floor, and blood was running all down her face—shortly after my aunt and I went down stairs to the front door, and I stayed with her till a constable came; he fetched a cab and took her to the Westminster Hospital—I went with her—her wounds were dressed there and she came back bandaged—we walked back—before she was struck she was all right—she had been at home about half an hour before this attack was made upon her—she was sober—she afterwards became ill and went to the hospital and died there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before the Magistrate I said "She was a stout person and I should say weakened by recent intemperance"—there was nothing to show that she had been intemperate for a long period, but I should say from the character of her delirium she had been addicted to intemperance recently; I mean there was nothing to show that she had been a chronic drunkard, but from the character of her delirium I should say she had been drinking recently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief-Inspector of Meat and Slaughter Houses under the Commissioners of Sewers—Mr. Burchnell, of the Lon<lb/>don Central Meat Market, is one of the salesmen there—it is one of the public markets in the metropolis for the sale of meat for human food—no catsmeat is sold there—on 14th April, at 7 a.m., I went to the premises of Burchnell, where I found eight quarters of beef, the carcases of two cows—I at once saw that they were unfit for food, and seized them—I have been Inspector of the Market for 24 years, during which time I have seen a good deal of diseased meat, and, of course, a larger quantity of good meat—they were the carcases of cows that had died from an inflammatory disease—the flesh was in a stinking condition, and totally unfit for food—the kidneys were not there, but had been cut away, and parts of the animals were trimmed and dressed in the same way as meat for the market—there is a little misunderstanding about its not being exposed for sale—all the meat in the market is exposed for sale, for sometimes it is sold in hampers—it was not openly exposed or hung up for sale—it was shown to the Medical Officer of Health for London and taken before the Magistrate and condemned—it weighed 760lb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> People would have bought such meat—I could tell it was bad meat by testing it and the smell, and by the blood in the car<lb/>cases—you might not find it was bad by putting your nose to it, but by making an incision in the flesh you would—it was in such a state that I saw it was unfit for human food before I tested it—no respectable buyer would have bought it—it was chopped in half and quartered, two hind-quarters and two fore-quarters, eight quarters in all—it is not the custom to dress good meat by cutting off portions of the feet as in this case—I knew it was an unusual sort of dressing—such meat as this will sell in the market, and is used for sausages and condiments.</p>

I am the head of the firm of Boutcher, Marti<lb/>neaux, and Co., of Bermondsey—I have known the prisoner about 12 years—he kept wine vaults in Old Broad Street—I went there very often and purchased wine of him—he afterwards took a public-house—I believe he was a schoolmaster once—I advanced him money at various times, more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 24th July, 1884, I saw him in the City Club, Old Broad Street—I had written to him in a weak moment to come there and give me an explanation of his affairs, and I would see if I could help him—he came and I gave him a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these letters of July 23rd and 24th, 1884, are in his writing—I next heard from him on January 1st, 1885; he wrote on December 31st, 1884. (<hi rend="italic">In this letter the prisoner asked the witness to lend him 6l. to enable him to pay his quarter's rent and taxes.</hi>) I afterwards received these letters of February 21st, March 12th, and March 18th—it is not true that I asked him to forego any prosecution against me—he did not tell me that he had abandoned on my appeal his idea of prosecuting me for a first offence—I am not aware that I have done any act for which I can be criminally prosecuted—I had received prior to that from the porter at the Reform Club this post-card stamped "Leyton, Feb. 9," and signed "W. Pink"—it is in the prisoner's writing—there is not a word of truth in it—Mr. Wild is a wine merchant. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of March 18th, 1885, signed "W. Pink," to the witness, stated,</hi> "I went before the Magistrate yesterday on the matter of your letters, and am going again to-morrow.") I had at that time been to my present solicitors and given them full instructions to write to Mr. Pink and to accept process—I was just recovering from an illness—until I took pro<lb/>ceedings at Bow Street I was not aware that this post-card had been sent—it is in Pink's writing, and I received it from Mr. Langsford at Mr. Wild's office. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated July 3rd, 1884, addressed to the witness, to the care of Messrs. Wild and Son, complaining of his "scurrilous letter," it stated,</hi> "I now charge you in addition with having committed wilful and deliberate forgery.") I have never committed forgery in my life, nor has the prisoner ever made a serious charge against me—on one letter which I wrote to him I put the word "Granville," like the franks which we used to have—that was done in joke; I never attempted to forge Lord Granville's writing, I never saw it. (<hi rend="italic">A letter from Messrs. Kays and Guedella to the prisoner, dated March 19th, was here put in, informing him that if he continued to annoy Mr. Boutcher proceedings would be taken against him</hi>. ) After that I consulted with my solicitors, and took out a summons against Pink in Bow Street—there has been no impropriety on my part in any shape or form as regards Pink, I have been uniformly kind to him, and was never indebted to him a shilling, quite the other way.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Dated City of London Club, 24th July, appointing a meeting to destroy all the letters.</hi>)—you kept that appoint<lb/>ment and I suppose you brought all my letters—I received them as all; I had no record of them, but in good faith I took them as every scrap of writing you had—I read them all through and burnt them one after the other, keeping back one or two for my own justification hereafter, because I knew what a customer you were—my object was to get rid of the correspondence, to burn it—you had been threatening me with an action which you knew you could not bring—I did not say "We cannot burn them here, I will take them home"—they were not burnt before you, but I promised to burn them all—you gave me yours—I must have burnt them at home; at all events they were destroyed—I received the card from Messrs. Wild about three weeks ago, after I had decided on taking proceedings—I never heard of it till Messrs. Wild said "By the bye, we have one of those cards now"—I had burnt the cards I was going to bring to prove that I had received them—on January 9th I wrote "Dear Sir,—Yours of yesterday to date. I must decline all further corre<lb/>spondence and shall reply to no further letters from you"—after the meeting, when we had shaken hands once or twice, I did not say to you to my knowledge "Now go home and write me a letter stating that all is over between us"—I will not swear that I did not—we very likely shook hands and parted friends—I did not pat you on the back and say "We have been two fools"—I did not say to my knowledge "If I ever can be your friend I will"—I will not swear I did not—I do not think it is twenty years since I lent you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did not lend it, I looked upon it as gone—I had no acknowledgment—I will swear you did not pay it back—on receiving this post-card I wrote and said that it was libellous, and that I would give you an opportunity of proving that you were mad—when I found that you were taking action against me I turned round and issued this process—I was security for you to Mr. Wild, wine merchant, my brother-in-law—he is dead—no doubt I volunteered it, but you must have known it—I did not force you to sell wine to your brother-in-law against your will.</p>

Sir,—I have for many months been making use of your firm to sell our Australian goods, and took an advance of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 15th instant with the intention of paying you this or giving you requisite cover.

I then went to his office, but could not see him—I spoke to Mr. Browne on the subject, and in consequence of what he and the clerk told me I communicated with our solicitors and took out a warrant at Guildhall against Scott—I believed his statement as to a second shipment coming by the Illawarra and that the documents of title would be in my hands in a short time—I have not been paid back any portion of the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or received any documents by the Illawarra—she has arrived, but there was no second parcel on her belonging to Messrs Browne, only the parcel on which we advanced the first sum and received the documents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe my firm have commenced an action against Browne and Co. for the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is proceeding—I am not certain that the documents in respect of the 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced came within four or five days, but they generally do—I am not prepared to say the exact date—we have done business with the firm of Browne and Co., father and son, nearly 30 years, and since June, 1882, the amount is probably 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this document was sent with the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque: "Dyster, Nalder, and Co., to account of goods"—that is the ordinary way in which we send—this other is one of our extraordinary documents—this account says, "Barque Sir W. Raleigh, documents to be handed us 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—the ship is specified there—it occasionally occurs that two consignments to</p>

               <p>the same firm come by the same vessel—the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was paid into the partnership account at the London and County Bank in London, not at Bristol—until the papers arrived the only security we had for the 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the statement that the hides would come by a certain ship, and a promise to hand over the papers—that was the ordinary mode of dealing—I do not know that since the arrival of the Illawarra hides have been dispatched from Beazley Browne and Co. to a larger amount than 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 4th March the prisoner showed me an invoice of the skins shipped by the Illawarra—we had some memorandum, some note of the particulars—I communicated with the prisoner the same day, saying that the weight was not sufficient to cover the amount advanced, and he came and said that the invoice weight he had given me was wrong—that the hides averaged 53 and a decimal, thereby giving me an idea that I could advance him the amount which I had refused to do on his copy of weights—I made the advance at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per hide—the second advance was to be on 5,701 skins—that left very little cover, nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we always treated them very liberally—we do not always advance in that way—we regulate our system of advance by the people we do business with—we did not always value the hides at that amount—18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per hide is not the usual price; it varies with the market and the state of the hides—I based the calculation on the previous parcel, which proved to be 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hide, therefore I advanced that sum on them, leaving a small cover—the tare is added to the net, and not deducted, to arrive at the gross; that is done to explain the weight on the bill of lading—it does not matter which is done—I do not remember the prisoner telling me that he had consulted his partner, Mr. Beazley Browne, about the tare in the 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced, or any discussion about it—I will not undertake to swear that he did not—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) does not refer to the 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I cannot say whether he said that he would work out the figures and bring them back to me—I do not remember his telling me he had worked out the figures with his partner, and had come to explain them to me—he did not tell me on March 16th that taking all the purchase-notes which had been sent by Warner Browne from Australia they showed a consignment to England of 5,701 skins, including 4,666 by the Illawarra, that I state positively—I added the words in red ink "per Illawarra"—he put nothing on the document to show that it was per Illawarra—I have not a distinct remembrance of the conversation when Scott called on me on March 13—I am quite prepared to say that he did not say that the second consignment of goods was to follow, and a second consign<lb/>ment by the Illawarra—if he had named the Duke of Athol and given me every particular of goods sufficient to cover the advance, I should have advanced the amount just the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I always required from him the name of the ship by which the goods were coming, and also the name of the particular goods—I have no doubt whatever that I wrote this "Illawarra" in conse<lb/>quence of what Scott said—I wrote it at the time in the office, and in his presence.</p>

Dyster, Nalder, and Co.—I went out to Australia in 1881 and 1882, but I did not attend to the finances myself—I do not know when the documents were sent out—they must be sent, and they were sent—I know nothing about the books, Mr. Scott and Mr. Chalk, a clerk, kept them—Mr. Scott had the entire conduct of the financial arrange<lb/>ments, the borrowing of money—I know that a bill-book was kept, but I do not know whether there was a book in which bills of lading would be entered—I know nothing of the banking account, and have known nothing of it for a long time past; Mr. Scott knows about it—I understand since that this cheque for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into our banking account—it is crossed, and my firm have received the money—Mr. Haycraft is a junior partner—the Illawarra has arrived, and about 5,000 hides were consigned to us by her—I do not know the exact number, but I understand that that was the consignment upon which the prisoner borrowed 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no other consignment to us by the Illawarra to my knowledge—I believe I heard of other consignments coming by the Illawarra to some other firm, but it did not impress me—I heard of no other consign<lb/>ment by her to our firm—on 16th March, 1885, when this 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in to our bank by Mr. Scott, I believed our firm to be solvent, but it was proved not to be; we are now in bankruptcy—I believe the amount of our deficiency is between 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know where the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. came from—I had no conversation with Mr. Scott about it—I did not know that it had been obtained till I saw Mr. Drake on March 24th—Mr. Scott was not there then—I might possibly have drawn money out between March 16th and March 24th—I do not know positively—after seeing Mr. Drake on March 24th I saw Mr. Scott on the following Sunday, and Mr. Kreighlinger, who was with me, spoke to him about the deficiency—we were told that we must not converse much with Mr. Scott—the subject of our conversation was that he did not believe it possible that there were any deficiencies—the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been mentioned in my conversation with Mr. Drake, but there was no conversation with Mr. Scott about it—I have never spoken to him on the subject, nor has he to me.</p>

               <p>advances on the shipments by the Duke of Athol and the Orronsay, and the documents in regard to this shipments would arrive about the middle of March—about the middle of March, when I was having lunch at the Falstaff, Mr. Scott came to me and introduced the subject of Kreigh<lb/>linger's credit, saying that he was afraid my brother was running short of funds in Australia—I said "I do not see how that can be, considering Kreighlinger's credit is current"—Mr. Scott had arranged in my office for a credit of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I said that my brother would want more one month than another, and it was mentioned as 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in three mouths—I understood that if any portion of it ran off it would come on again—Mr. Scott took a different view from me—he said afterwards at my office "Whether the credit be recurrent or not I have arranged the the matter"—he did not say what he had arranged to do, or anything about documents; I thought it was arranged and there was an end of it—I did not interfere with our banking arrangement in any way—I under<lb/>stood that the money would be forthcoming; the Illawarra had started, and the documents had been sent on, so that, I should say, it could not apply to that—I do not know to what extent we have done business with Dyster, Nalder, and Co. in the way of advance; it is very large—I can't form any definite idea—Mr. Scott came down to me, and said that he was afraid there was some mistake in the shipping weights; the hides were so light—I think it was before his interview with regard to the advance of 3,840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I replied "There are a large number of calfs' skins and horses' skins, you must eliminate those before you can get at the weight of the salted hides"—he subsequently told me that he had found out how it was, it would be accounted for by the tare, which if added to the net would give the shipping weight; it is usual to deduct the tare, but in this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the tare is added—I believe the documents received show the average tare; but not the actual tare, not the average tare that was last sent; I had to purchase the weight, and he gave the average tare at the end of the shipment I believe generally—I do not know that the question of the tare in the 3,848<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the regular consignment by the Illawarra, was in dispute with Dyster, Nalder, and Co.—I have been informed that the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appears in our books as passing regularly into the firm, and Dyster, Nalder, and Co. are suing us for it; the action is still going on—I had every reason to believe that we were then solvent—I believe that there were 6,700 hides shipped by the Orronsay, and there has been no advance upon them on 16th March to my knowledge—I believe there were about 200 tons of bark shipped by the Duke of Athol, value about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say whether there had been any advances upon that on 16th March—after Dyster, Nalder, and Co. com<lb/>municated with me I saw Mr. Scott; he was then in a terrible state of health—his doctor said that he was hardly accountable for his acts, and forbade us to speak to him—that is the reason I did not speak to him on the subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The Duke of Athol brought no hides, only bark, but hides consigned to us came by the Orronsay—we had not obtained a loan of 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on those—hides were hypothecated by the bank after the firm was in difficulty—I can't tell you whether the shipments by the Orronsay were drawn against, they would be in the ordinary way; we had power to borrow on them here—when I was in Australia I made arrangements with the manager of the Union Bank of Australia that our agent should</p>

Kreighlinger for 3,801l. 13s. 3d., and advised them by the same mail; that he hoped to be able to buy about 200 tons of bark for shipment by the Duke of Athol in about two months, which ship would probably also take the next shipment of hides.</hi>) We kept no consignment book—I never heard of any of the shipment per Illawarra, amounting to 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that an advance was obtained of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Dyster, Nalder, and Co. against this shipment—the bills of lading were sent on to them about ten days after the advance had been made—I kept the cash-book; I entered this cheque for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it in the course of business—Mr. Scott gave it to me—I asked him what account I was to charge it to, and he said "To the Australian account"—he did not tell me anything about the documents—on March 4th I received 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against the first shipment—I saw Mr. Scott when he was at Sey<lb/>mour Street, and asked him if there was a shipment coming by the llla<lb/>warra—he did not say anything relating to the shipment—he said that the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he got on the 16th March was a loan—I asked him about the second shipment, because all the trouble had arisen on the Monday—Dyster, Nalder, and Co. had sent over to the office on Monday about the second shipment, and Mr. Drake had come there to ask for the docu<lb/>ments of the second shipment—Mr. Scott was not there then, and Mr. Drake had a conversation with Mr. Browne in my presence, and I saw Mr. Scott during the week and asked him if there was a second shipment by the Illawarra—he said that the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he got was a loan, but he said nothing about the second shipment—I remember telling him afterwards, that Messrs.

I live at 23, Windsor Street, Spring Bank, Hull—formerly I lived at Swaffham in Norfolk, where in March, 1884, I opened a post-office savings bank account—on 9th March this year I went to the Highgate High Street post-office about 3 o'clock and deposited 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner received it, and made this entry in my book—I received no acknowledgment from the General Post-office till I applied for one—I sent the book to the office, and it came back with this red ink insertion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Savings Bank Department of the General Post-office—I made the red ink entries in this book by authority—it was the duty of the person receiving the money to have put the day as well as the month in the writing and stamp—a paper was probably put over the date figure in the stamp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I understand the ways of the Post-office Savings Bank Department—every clerk in the post-office is perfectly aware that an acknowledgment of every deposit is sent from the head office to the depositor—when the clerk receives a deposit it is not absolutely certain that the post-office will know he has received it—when he receives money it is his duty to enter it in the daily account sheet and cross sheet as well as the depositors book—if entered in the depositor's book it is certain that the post-office will know at some time that the amount has been received—we get a communication as a rule from the customer if he does not get an acknowledgment—it is impossible, unless paper were put over the date figure of the stamp, that the omission should have been repeated so frequently—the date on the stamps is moveable every day—if the date had not been put in, the same thing would have happened—I suggest it was done by a piece of paper—the stamps for letters and the savings bank are net always the same—I have no experience of that—this post-office is a receiving house, where the official has a piece of counter in a shop, and the stamps would be by the persons who took the savings bank money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a post-office receiver at High Street, Highgate—the prisoner was employed under me as post-office receiver for four years past, and ceased to be so on Monday evening, 9th March—that was not in connection with this charge—I had notice from the General Post-office to discharge him, and gave him notice on the following morning—he had charge of the entire postal department in my shop—no one else received money on Savings Bank accounts—my sister assisted him, under his supervision—he had charge, and had a key of the drawer—the initials "H. G.," opposite the entries in the books, are in Gamble's writing—the whole of the entry on 7th March, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Jones's book, and those of Mrs. Lehman and Mrs. Bunn, are in the prisoner's writing—it is the duty of the person receiving money to enter it on the account-sheets, and in the deposit account or cross-entry deposit account—there is no 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down on 7th March in either of those—the deposit-sheet relates to deposits opened at the same office, and the cross deposit-sheet to accounts which have been originally opened at another office—there is no reference on the ordinary or cross deposit account-sheets to the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Lehman and Mrs. Bunn—on the cross, sheet of 7th March the word "nil" is written across, and it is signed by the prisoner—Mr. Jones's account having been, opened elsewhere, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to have ap<lb/>peared in that cross sheet—in addition to those two documents there is also a daily cash account to be made up by the prisoner—this of 7th March was made and signed by him—it contains no reference to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and shows no excess of cash in his possession—if the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been</p>

               <p>omitted from the daily cash account it ought to have been shown in the excess of cash in hand—the cash account for 9th March is made out by the prisoner—it contains no reference to any 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor of any extra cash—I have three documents here relating to the 9th of March, a cross deposit, the ordinary deposit-sheet, and the daily cash account—the latter is not signed by the prisoner, and being in figures I cannot say as to the writing—the others are in his writing, but not signed—between 5 and 8 on 9th March the prisoner handed me over his cash, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left at 8, his usual time—the detectives came about 8 with him, and he finally left at 1 o'clock in the morning—the previous week I had told him that his postal orders were not correct, and he made them correct on the Saturday or Monday, the 7th or 9th—it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd he handed over for that—I gave it to Mr. Cooper, the chief clerk, who came on the morning of the 10th—the prisoner said, when handing it over, that he would make it correct, as the postal orders were deficient—Mr. Cooper went over the accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My place of business is a family grocer's shop, a fairly large one—sometimes we have plenty of customers, sometimes few—I have about seven people serving—the postal is on the other side to the grocery counter; the whole of one side is devoted to it, and the counter is about nine feet long—the prisoner was the only post-office clerk; my sister used to assist him; she is not in the employment of the Post-office—his hours of work were from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.—he would have to sell stamps, post-cards, and registered envelopes, issue post-office orders, control the telegraph department and the parcels post, issue dog licences, and do everything connected with the post-office—the prisoner did not know on the 9th March that he was leaving—I rather think I went and told him next morning at 10, he did not come at 8, but stayed away on that Thursday morning of his own accord—he left on 9th March—he was from 8, when the detectives brought him back, to 1 going through his accounts—I was told to discharge him by the Post-office on Tuesday morning.

               <p>was as a man who has done something wrong and been found out—I don't know what nervous irritation means, unless it is worry—I never thought he was unable to do his work, he was a competent clerk—I might have said at the police-court, alluding to that week, "he seemed to be hardly able to take care of his work sometimes"—the prisoner said he should send for Mr. Cooper to go through his accounts when I was investigating them—at the end of the day he handed me the cash, and I counted it out and entered it in a book, and he kept the slip after I had looked at it, but did not examine it—the totals had to agree with my cash-book—I entered the total in his presence in this post-office book which I kept—he made out his slip, told me the total, and gave me the money, and I counted the money to see it was correct—we have an allowance for a telegraph clerk; it is called the voted service, and is all we receive; it does not mean an extra hand—sometimes I had money from the post-office counter for my use to accommodate me, if I wanted change and had no cash—I returned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This book is merely a daily copy of the cash account—the deposit and cross accounts contain the name of the depositor, the account contains only the total sum—the prisoner's wages were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was quite competent to do his duties well, and never showed any difficulty in dealing with figures—he was on the whole a very intelligent and capable officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a senior clerk in the Savings Bank depart<lb/>ment, General Post-office—I have looked at Mr. Lloyd Jones's book at the entry of the deposit of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th March—that was never accounted for to the head office from Highgate—notice should be sent to us on the next working day after receipt—that deposit should have been entered in the white cross entry account, then in the depositor's book, stamped with the official stamp, and initialled by the officer who received the money—in the cross account of 7th March I find no entry of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the blue paper of accounts opened at the Highgate office—those sheets coining to our office, if accurately made up, would give us notice of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited at Highgate that day—the clerk receiving money should put it down on the sheet, the post-office account, before he enters it in the depositor's book—the total is entered at the close of the day's business in the cash account—the total account of that day does not show that he had any excess of cash—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered as the whole amount of Post-office Savings Bank deposits on that day in the blue account—in the white cross account "nil" is written, and it is in that one that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should have been entered—there is no entry on the white or blue sheets of 9th March of the deposit from Mrs. Bunn and Mrs. Lehman—both those sums should have appeared on the white sheet—the white sheet for that day is 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the blue sheet 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received no notice of the deposits from those two ladies—they applied for an acknowledgment, and on that the matter was inquired into—I had notice too from Mr. Jones—subsequently a warrant was obtained for the apprehension of the prisoner—I went down with the constable to Buntingford, Hertfordshire, on 12th May—I saw the prisoner; we had some conversation on other matters, and then I said "I am from the General Post-office Savings Bank Department, and I want to ask you relative to a deposit entry of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which. I am told was made by you in this book," which I produced, "at the Highgate post-office, on 7th March last; is this your entry?"</p>

I have seen the cash account for that day, and all the accounts appear to be in your handwriting, and there is no cash shown over"—he said "I cannot account for it, unless there it some corresponding error in those two accounts"—I said "You know your duty with regard to the entries, that you should make the entry first in the savings bank account"—he said "Yes, but I know nothing about this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have not used it"—I said "I have obtained a warrant for your apprehension charging you with the embezzlement of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a bill-poster for the People newspaper, and live at 23, Britannia Street, near King's Gross—at a quarter to 2 on the morning of 13th June I was going to the office in the Strand where the newspaper is published at 2 o'clock—as I was was passing by Parker Street with the paste can in one hand and bag of bills in the other Hanken was standing at the corner; he swung round and caught me right in the chest, I feel the effects now, I vomit now and then—the blow doubled me down, and before I could get my breath I was pushed against the shutters—my pockets were rifled, but they could get nothing but the half-ounce of tobacco in my waistcoat pocket, which they took, and then the lot of them set on kicking me about the shins—Hanken kicked me in the thigh, intending, I believe, to kick me in the groin—as soon as I could get away I got to the corner and halloaed out "Police"—two constables came across—the others ran away—when the police got up they were 50 yards away, Hanken was going to follow up the attack, when he saw the policeman on him and dropped his hands and pre<lb/>tended to know nothing about it—when the constable came up I said "This is one of the men, I will give him into custody"—on Sunday I was brought to look at some men, I could not identify any one—on Monday I was brought down again, and identified from about a dozen men, Johnson; I could swear to him among a thousand, he has the same jersey and handkerchief on now.</p>

At a quarter to 2 on the morn<lb/>ing of the 3rd January I was on duty in Drury Lane and heard shouts—I came up and saw Hanken standing two or three yards away from the last witness, who complained of being assaulted by Hanken and others—I took Hanken into custody—there were several others at the time running down the street five yards from him when I came round the corner of the street, and the last witness was between Hanken and myself—the prosecutor had every appearance of having been assaulted—his waistcoat was torn open—about three minutes before I had come across the corner of the street, and seen Johnson, the other prisoner, in Hanken's company then—there were about seven other men there too—I took Hanken to the station—he said nothing—Johnson was taken on a warrant.</p>

I am a shoemaker, of 6, Parker Street, Drury Lane—I was in Hanken's company on the early morning of 13th June—he had been to see his sister whose child was ill—about half-past 1 or a Quarter to 2 We were returning home and saw the prosecutor attacked by some men, then there was a cry of "Police," and five or six men ran down Parker Street, and I and Hanken came towards the top of the street, and Hanken went up to the bill poster and said, "What is the matter?"—just then two policemen came up, and the bill poster, who seemed flurried a bit, turned round and said to the constable, "I think that is one of them," pointing to Hanken, who had approached him nearer than I had—the constable said "I will take him in charge if you will charge him"—the prosecutor did not know what to say at that moment—about five or six seconds afterwards he said, "Yes, I will charge him," and Hanken walked down willingly alongside of the constable to the station—I will swear Hanken had nothing to do with the scuffle or row I saw I was not with Hanken when he was with the other prisoner half an hour or so before—I joined him about half-past 12, and was with him up to the time of the disturbance—I went with him to his sister's at 10, left him there, and met him again at 12.30.</p>

I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—Lisle was admitted there about 3 a.m. on April 8th, but I did not see him till 10 a.m.; I then dressed his wounds—the edges of them had united—he had two wounds on the upper side of his right thigh, within an inch of each other—he went on very well for the first three or four days, and then one of the wounds opened—I passed a probe into it, and found it extended six and half inches in an upward and backwacd direction—on the ninth day, April 17th, about noon, haemorrhage came on from the depth of the wound, which stopped before I got to the bed, but it came on again about 3 a.m. on the 18th, but was very easily stopped, and again about 5.30 the same afternoon, when I could not stop it—I sent for a surgeon, and an attempt was made to find the bleeding vessel, and after trying as long as we could the thigh was amputated—the wounds might have been made by this knife—there is a small mark on it which may be blood, but I did not see it till weeks afterwards—the wound was in the fleshy part of the thigh behind the bone.</p>

I am the wife of George Dyer, of 27, Afghan Road, Clapham—on Monday night, 8th June, I was in Holborn with my husband and brother-in-law—we were coming out of a publichouse—I was putting my purse in my pocket—the elder prisoner, I suppose, noticed me doing so, and at that moment I felt his hand in my pocket—I called out, "My purse"—my husband ran to my assistance, and at that moment it seemed as if the elder prisoner gave it to the younger one—my husband tried to get it away from him, when the elder one came behind him and knocked him down—my brother-in-law came up, and the prisoner also beat him severely and broke one of his teeth out—I described the elder prisoner to the police and he was taken—I am quite sure the two prisoners are the men—my purse contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

About 8 p.m. on the 11th June I was at the Royal entrance to the Exhibition—it was shortly after the fire—I saw the prisoners pushing amongst the crowd, and I followed them—Mahoney was pushing Anderson, who slipped his hands into ladies' pockets—I saw Mahoney lift his hand off Anderson's shoulder—I tried to get to the persons to ask them if they missed anything, but could not because of the crowd—I spoke to Sergeant Brown about them—I saw them again at the entrance trying to pick pockets—Mahoney linked his hand through Anderson's and crossed over the road—I stopped them and told them I should take them into custody, and charge them with loitering with intent to commit a felony—Mahoney said "I have only just come; I met this man"—they were there other half an hour—I found on Anderson a purse, three pawn tickets, and sevenpence halfpenny in coppers.</p>

This took place the night of the fire—you saw me there—a larger number of persons than usual was there—there was confusion and excitement, but no "bonneting" or "horse-play"—several persons complained of the prisoners—I saw the prisoners together, Anderson was in front and Mahoney behind, with his hands on Anderson's shoulder—I said at the police-court I saw Anderson long before I saw Brown—I was about to call in a uniform officer.</p>

Simpson was about to enter the door when he saw a man in the church, and they all ran away. They did not get anything."

I am a manufacturer's agent—I have a warehouse on the first floor at 30, Knightrider Street—no one sleeps on the premises—on Saturday, 2nd May, at 25 minutes past 2 in the afternoon, I shut up safely by locking tho door—on Monday morning, the 4th, I came at my usual time, and found the place had been entered—I missed four bales of woollen goods and other property to the value of over 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were seven pieces of lustre twill of 71 yards each, one piece of blue soleil of 20 yards, and 50 yards of blue cashmere—under the counter I found a new packing hammer which did not belong to me, also the lock which had been wrenched off the door—the police have since shown me some of my things.</p>

I am a master carman living at 92, Westmore<lb/>land Place, City Road—I know Allen—on Saturday, 2nd May, he came to my place of business about half-past 11 in the morning and said he wanted a van to go to the City, he did not mention what part, to fetch, some things away—I got my van, and he directed me to Knightrider Street—we stopped first of all just by the church—I suppose that must have been half-past 12—Allen told me to wait there—he got down and walked about, but he did not go away from the van—after a time he told me to follow him—I did so, and we went to the other end of Knightrider Street—there were four parcels or bales there; whether they were in the passage or not I don't know—they were put in my van—they were at the bottom of the warehouse—I never took notice of the number—Allen and a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Mandall, the prisoner's son, belonging to the Great Eastern, who was coming by, lifted them into the van, and I took them to the Vinegar Ground in Old Street—Allen rode with me and told me where to drive to—when we got there we unloaded them and put them in a shed at the corner—I do not know who unfastened the shed, I was at the horse's head; I do not know whether Allen undid the door or not—after we had left the bales in the shed we went to the City Road to the Three Crowns public-house, and I had some drink there with Allen and Vale—that was the first time I had seen Vale, in the public-house—he asked me how much; I told him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he paid me—this canvas (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is similar to that in which the bales were wrapped—I had nothing to do with removing any goods on Monday; I never saw either Allen or Vale on that day.</p>

I got one of Emm's vans for him. On Sunday morning, 3rd May, I met a man whose name I believe to be George. This man was the man who went with Mr. Hunter to the City to do this job. He said to me 'Do you know any person that will buy two pieces of stuff?' I said 'Bring them round and I will try and sell them.' I sold them to Mr. Perry for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—on Thursday, 21st May, I went with the two officers mentioned and Hunter to Quilter's shop, 127, Hope Street, City Road, bed and mattress maker; I saw Vale and Quilter sitting down toge<lb/>ther in the shop in conversation—I said to Vale "This man has identified you," pointing to the witness Hunter, "as a person who engaged a van to bring four bales of dress stuff and other articles from No. 30, Knightrider Street on Saturday, 2nd May last; that pro<lb/>perty was stolen, what do you know about it?"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I said "You must consider yourself in my custody on a charge of being concerned with one in custody and others not in custody in breaking and entering an office at 20, Knightrider Street and stealing four bales of stuff and other articles, on Saturday, 2nd May last"—he made no further reply—I then had some conversation with Quilter, and the result was I took both of them in custody I then searched Quilter's premises, and found this piece of canvas in the base<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>bearing the letters "F. W. E. and Co., E. D.," and in the hall, between the rafters and the tiling, I found this piece of blue soleil, marked "8," and other property, which I showed to the prisoners at the station—while speaking to Quilter in the shop I said to him in Vale's presence "Where are the keys of the shed?"—he pointed to the keys hanging in the shop; he handed them to me; I said "Can any one have these keys without your knowledge?"—he said "No"—on Friday, 29th May, I saw Allen at Bridewell Police-station—he had been arrested by Newby—I said to him "You will be charged with being concerned with others in custody in breaking and entering the office at 30, Knightrider Street, and stealing therefrom four bales of silk dress stuff and a piece of blue soleil on Saturday, 2nd May"—he then made the following state<lb/>ment, which I wrote down: "On Saturday, 2nd May, I was engaged by Mr. Quilter to get a van at 12 o'clock noon to do a job. I went to the place in the City Road and hired a van to stop at the corner of the Vinegar Ground. Quilter came to me there and a carman, and Quilter rode with the van to Knightrider Street. When we got there a man with a fair moustache spoke to Mr. Quilter; the fair man said to Mr. Quilter 'Load the van up.' We stopped there about two hours. Quilter and the man with the fair moustache went upstairs. I went upstairs, and the man with the fair moustache said 'Bring these bales out.' We brought them cut and loaded them into the van with the assistance of a young man named Mandall. Mr. Quilter, I, and Hunter, the carman, went to a public-house and had a pot of ale; the fair moustache man came into the public-house and said 'Drive this van away,' and I and Hunter then drove the van and contents to a shed in the Vinegar Ground. Mr. Hunter and a man assisted in unloading the van, and placed it into the shed; then Mr. Hunter and a Jew man, and the man with the fair moustache, went to the Three Crowns public-house and had a pot of ale. The fair moustache man paid to Hunter 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the hire of the van; Hunter then went away. I then received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the fair moustache man for my labour. I then left the Jew man and the fair moustache man together. I saw Quilter in the Vinegar Ground while I was speak<lb/>ing to a man named Mundall. I said to Quilter 'Where are you going?' He said 'I am going to take a bit of the cloth.' I said 'Will you give me a bit?' He said 'Yes, you can have a bit.' I then went with him to the shed, and he gave me two pieces of cloth. I gave it to <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Mandall and asked him if he could sell it, and he took it from me and said he had sold it to a man named Perry for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said 'Perry says he has bought stuff at the same price.' I received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mandall on the Monday night. About 12 o'clock noon on Monday, 4th May, the fair moustache man, in company with Quilter and a man (a description of whom is given) met me in the George the Fourth public-house; Quilter said to me 'Could you get a van?' I said 'Yes,' and I could not get one, and Quilter went to Old Street and got a van. Mandall's son was the carman. I and the carman loaded the van with the same stuff from the shed that was put in the shed on Saturday. I, Quilter, and the fair moustache man went to the Jolly Butchers public-house and had a glass of ale. Mandall's son and the Jew man drove away with the van, I never saw any more of them"—Allen signed that statement—he never told me the name of the fair moustache man—I examined the door of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, residing at Ealing; I carry on business there and in London—on 20th May the prisoner was in my employment as a clerk, he was introduced to me at the beginning of March by a man named Sewell, who was formerly in my employment—I was looking out for some premises in London to carry on my business—the prisoner said he had an office in the Outer Temple, and if I Iiked I could put my name on the door to use it as an address for service—he then said he could help me in what I wanted to do, as he understood the law, and he proposed that he should have some commission on intro<lb/>ducing business—I said I would think it over, and next day I received this letter from him—I afterwards saw him on the subject, and said I could not come to any arrangement of the sort suggested, and he then said "Will you give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week?" and I agreed to that, for his services as clerk, and I agreed to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the use of the room—I have paid him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week regularly up to the time he was given in custody—he acted for me during that period—I was acting for the plaintiff in an action of Tidy <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Luff—this letter, dated 8th May, is in Sewell's handwriting—the prisoner told me that Mr. Luff had called and made an offer of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had shown me a draft letter which he had written to Mr. Tidy for my approval—I approved of it, and he gave it to Sewell, who was in the office, to copy, and I signed it—this is it—on 27th May the prisoner told me he had settled the action, that he was providentially at the office—I said "For how much?"—he said "For 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I tried to get another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked where the money was—he said it was quite safe, it was in the bank—I asked him to give it me, and he said he would see me the following day, the 28th—he then said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188506220094"/>
               <p>he had more important matters to attend to just then, and he could not go with me to the bank—I asked him where it was, and what bank—he said the London and South-Western Bank, Regent's Circus; that was not my bank—on parting with him I went to Regent's Circus, but didn't find any bank there, and I went to Piccadilly Circus—I sought an inter<lb/>view with my client, Mr. Tidy, the following morning—I met the prisoner in Wellington Street, Strand—I said "Now I want you to come with me to the bank and get this money"—he again said he had not time, but he would give it me next day—I said I should give him in charge if he didn't pay it, and I took him to the Bow Street Station and gave him in charge—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's receipt for the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I live at Waldstadt in Switzerland, and am a lace and embroidery manufacturer—in February or March, 1885, I was in London and went to Flaxman and Danziger's office, 58, Cheapside—before that I had received this memorandum: "Flaxman and Danziger, merchants and factors, importers of watches, 80, Cheapside, and at New York. We have waited until to-day for the promised sample pieces, please send them as soon as possible, otherwise we must place our order somewhere else. Please call on Thursday." I saw the prisoner when I called—he said he was very pleased to see me, and not only my agent, as he hoped to do some good business with me; that he had a good many orders from New York for embroideries and that the 15th of each month would be his day of payment; that his partner was a rich man and his parents were rich, and he would conduct the business, that he always had a few hundreds at his bankers; that he did not think I should be able to execute all the orders he would give me—after that I went with Flaxman to his office at 7, Castle Street, Oxford Street, with about 222<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of embroideries—the prisoner looked at and purchased the whole of them—I let him have the goods, believing what he had said at the interviews—all I had for the goods was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a silver and gilt watch worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 8th March I left for Switzerland—Flaxman had made arrangements to visit me there, and shortly after my return I received this letter in German from Flaxman and Danziger. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Flaxman would be with him in two or three weeks, that a watch had been ordered from the manufactory, that they could make use of a parcel of ribbons if he would send one; that they would like a letter of recommendation to silk mercers, that Flaxman would settle up up when he arrived; that they had received embroidered covert from Mr.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wetter, and would like to know how long it would take him, Ramsauer, to deliver</hi> 5,000 <hi rend="italic">pieces.</hi>) I did not reply—on 19th March I received this from the prisoner and Danziger. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting him to send samples of every<lb/>thing he had in stock and 5l. worth of covers, and stating that Flaxman would return what was not saleable, and would gladden him with cash.</hi>) My heart was never gladdened with cash beyond the amount I have said—I received this other letter on 23rd March. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Flaxman had so many orders that he could scarcely spare time to journey to Switzerland, but that he hoped to undertake it; that he hoped he would fulfil the order by 30th April, as otherwise he could not trust further orders, and that he had given his (Ramsauer's) name as a reference to another firm.</hi>) After that Flaxman came and stopped as a guest at my house, and on that occasion I got the only money I ever had from him, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—that and the watch is all I have received from him—he told me I need never be short of money—if I required cash at any time I had only to telegraph to him, and he could always supply me with about 10,000 francs—I told him I should like a little money then, and it was then I got the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the same time he showed me these two bills, and said I could take which I liked in payment, and turn them into cash and discount them—I asked him about the names on them—he said they were all good firms, and that he was doing very good business with them—I did not understand very well about bills, I preferred to have money—he said, "These bills are as good as money at any bank," and that he would sooner shoot himself than cheat me—after that I showed him goods, and he selected cambric goods to 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and cambric and lace to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some embroidered and lace curtains, 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a parcel of cambrics, 14<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> total, 323<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me to take which bill I liked; I took the biggest. (<hi rend="italic">This was a bill at three months, dated March 12th, 1885, for 199l. 14s. 6d., payable to Mr. James McIntyre, 9, Moorgate Street, at the Royal Exchange Bank, drawn by Levy and Co.</hi>) After he had looked out the goods he gave me these two bills. (<hi rend="italic">These were drawn by the prosecutor on Flaxman and Danziger, dated 27th March, at three months, for 98l. 18s. 9d. and 92l. 10s.</hi>) The prisoner accepted this in my presence—he told me he wanted the goods very urgently—he gave me samples on which I was to manufacture goods amounting in all to 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Danziger his partner had sent him an order for 34,000 yards from Liverpool—I went with the prisoner to Messrs. Locker and Krusi, taking this bill which he had accepted for 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner left Switzerland, and afterwards I received this letter from Zurich dated 4th April. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to let them know if he had received the money from Locker and Krusi, to answer inquiries respecting them, and to dispatch the goods promptly.</hi>) Having heard of different matters I came to London about 12th April and communicated with my solicitor, after having made inquiries here about Flaxman—I then went to a Mr. Hart with Detective Taylor, and there saw three boxes of lace of the goods I had sold to Flaxman in the same state as when I sold them, unbleached—they should be bleached before they are marketable—I also at Hart's saw some samples which I had sold the prisoner in London—I also went to a Mr. Hans, Jewin's Crescent, where I saw some goods I had sold to the prisoner—I am a loser altogether of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this man—the bills I had have never been paid—I gave them to some one with instructions to present them when they became due.</p>

               <p>on my own account, and about 11 months before that in another business, and before that at Neufchatel in a school of industry for 15 months—I had done some business in London through Mr. Wetter, the agent who introduced me to Flaxman and Danziger—Mr. Wetter is here—I was about to leave England when I received a letter from Flaxman and Dan<lb/>ziger asking me to call—when the prisoner told me he had money in the bank it was after the goods were sold, but he had first told me about Danziger his partner being a rich man—I made some inquiries about the firm while in London, and received good references through Mr. Wettor, my agent, in whose possession the goods were—the statements about Danziger being a rich man and doing a large business were all made before he purchased the goods—he said he would give me orders, and I ought to have sufficient in stock to comply with them—I do not know that he carried on a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> business in watches in Cheapside—I saw a number of watches and chains there—he was only anxious to sell one to me—the whole of the second lot of goods I delivered in Switzerland—the 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods which be ordered would have taken three or four months to make—I came over here on 12th April, and afterwards I made inquiries as to the solvency and position of those traders after ascertain<lb/>ing the nature of their business position—before I made any inquiry I wrote this memorandum, "Account stated with Messrs.

I was on duty in Commercial Street, opposite the urinal, but on the other side; I saw the two prisoners and Singleton outside the urinal—Lipman knocked him down partly with his foot and arm; it was not a straightforward blow, it was more of a shove than a hit; both prisoners then made a pounce on him, one on each side; he fell on his back, and they put their hands in his pockets one on each side; I ran over and caught Lipman by his collar and Bryant by his coat sleeve; they struggled, and Lipman struggled very desperately to get away—I held them for a few minutes, and was just thinking of releasing one of them, when Sergeant Lee came up, caught hold of Lip<lb/>man and said "I know you, Lipman"—Lipman said "It is all up, <hi rend="italic">Humpy,</hi> we had better go quietly; I give myself in charge." (<hi rend="italic">Bryant is humpbacked.</hi>) I took them to the station and found 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Bryant—I saw Lipman make a strike at Singleton, but the blow did not properly catch.</p>

He missed hitting him straight—I was on the other side of the road—there are three lamps on the top of the urinal—the prisoners were not in the shade—I did not make a note of what Lipman said—he did not hold up both his hands when I came up and say, "Search me, I have got nothing," nor did he open both his hands. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated,</hi> "He said 'Did not you ask me what I had in my hands?' and I said 'Yes,' and I opened it and had nothing.") That is perfectly correct—that was read over to me and I did not correct it—there is not much difference whether it was one hand or two, there was nothing in either of his hands—he was searched at the station and only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—I held him as tight at I could; I got my fist between his collar and his neck, and he struggled—Singleton had been drinking, but he seemed to know what he was about.</p>

On this Sunday, about 1 a.m., I was in Commercial Street, and saw a struggle on the opposite side—I went over and saw Singleton on the ground and Moore struggling with both the prisoners, holding each of their collars—I took hold of Lipman, who was struggling with Moore, and said, "I know you, Lipman"—he was endeavouring to untie his neck-handkerchief—he said to Bryant, "It is all up, <hi rend="italic">Humpy,</hi> we will go quiet"—I took him to the station—he had on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze, and Bryant had 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze—</p>

I keep the Devonshire Arms, Lancaster Street, Hyde Park—the prisoner was my potman about 18 months ago—on the 7th May, about 12.30, I looked up my house and went to bed about 1 o'clock, leaving it perfectly safe—next morning when I went into the bar parlour I found the gas burning, the window open and propped up by a poker, and saw cigars and papers strewed over the place, and two drawers broken open and the contents taken away, twelve forks, six spoons, and an iron box with about ten shillings' worth of threepenny pieces in it, and a bag with two shillings and sixpence in bronze, a five-shilling packet of bronze, and a bundle of papers—I found the box in the cellar broken open and empty—there was a ladder to the parlour window in the yard—this bag is mine—it had the two shillings and sixpence worth of coppers in it—this clock was found in the bag which was taken away at the same time—I also missed a cigar case, a bottle of whisky, a bottle of champagne, and some cigars.</p>

I am an engine-driver—on 18th May I was on board this steamboat and saw the prisoner on board—when we were at Strand-on-the-Green I saw Neesom with a great many people round him—the prisoner was one of them, and Neesom said to him, "I have not had a bet with you and I will not pay"—a lot of men hustled him on the bridge and tried to hold him, but he slipped down and went down into the engine-room—they were not violent to him, they merely held him—the prisoner followed him down, and I went down after them and took the ladder away to prevent others coming down; but that did not stop them, nine or ten came down without the ladder and called him a b—, and a welsher, and said, "We want our money"—the prisoner was among them—Neesom was sitting on a locker, and my father, who was the engine-driver, could not move the levers to reverse the engines—I saw two little girls on board playing with the prisoner.</p>

On 1st June I followed Stegman and Moon—I saw Wood and Green outside the Peacock, Whitecross Street, standing by a pony and cart—Moon and Stegman came up and passed a few words with them and left them—I followed Moon and Stegman into Fore Street about 3.20 or 3.30—they sat down in Jewin Street watching a railway can which stood there—after a few minutes they got up and walked into Wells Street and placed themselves by the side of a truck with a parcel on it—Stegman sat on a doorstep in a corner by a hoarding—I placed myself in a court in view of both prisoners, Nettleton Court, I think, at the far end of Wells Street—a boy was sitting on some parcels by the side jof the truck—Moon sidled away from the parcel—at truck—the boy turned round—Moon sidled away from the parcel—at that moment Stegman got up from the doorstep and hurried towards where I was standing, about 100 yards off—the doorstep was about 150 yards from where the vehicle was, in another street—Green and Wood were in the cart—the truck was about 50 yards from me—to prevent Stegman seeing me I stepped back into a small court leading from Nettleton Court, and when I came to the front again the parcel and Moon had disappeared—I liiked round, lost all sight of Moon, but saw Stegman hurrying through Wells Street—I followed him into Fore Street, where I met Collins, another officers—we saw Stegman go to the cart where Wood and Green were riding—Stegman said something to them—they looked round, saw Collins and I hurrying towards the cart, and jumped out, Wood with the whip in his hand, and Wood turned into Milton Stegman all ran away, leaving the cart in the road, along turned into Milton when they got to Milton Street, Stegman and Wokod turned into Milton Street, and Green kept straight ahead—when I neared Wood, who was behind the others, he took the whip and put it in a threatening attitude—I passed him, still calling "Stop thief"—Green was stopped by a gen<lb/>tleman at the corner of Aldermanbury Posteru and given into the hands of another constable—I went to Milton Street, where I saw a crowd, and Stegman was standing looking on, apparently unconcerned—I caught hold of him and told him he would be charged with the other prisoners at the station—they were charged together with being concerned in stealing 78 waistcoats, value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from a truck in Wells Street—they all said, "You have made a mistake, we know nothing about it"—the next day, 2nd June, I saw Moon in Guildhall Yard; he was taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was withing a few minutes of half-past 3 when I first saw the box-cart and Wood and Green outside the Peacock on the pave-ment by the side of the cart—I was following the others, and saw them speak—I knew Green; I took notice of Wood too—I did not go into Whitecross Steet again—I next saw the cart in Jewin Street about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, with Wood and Green in it, driving slowly on away from where the robbery was committed—the street is not narrow, about 10 yards wide, with room for some three or four lines of traffic—Stegman overtook the cart; he was hurrying; he did not place anything in the cart—I do not know what Stegman had in</p>

About 3.30 on 1st June I was with Jones—I first saw Green and Wood in Fore Street and going along Jewin Street in the direction of Aldersgate Street in the cart—about halfway along Jewin Street they turned and came back—that was away from where the robbery took place—Jones, who had been with me previously, joined me again, and we followed the prisoners into Fore Street—Stegman went to the Ride of the cart, which had passed me then and was going from Stegman; Stegman went up quickly to the cart and appeared to speak to them—they at once looked round and saw Jones and me following—Green, who was driving, tried to hurry the pony through the traffic; finding he could not they jumped out one on each side—Jones followed Green—Wood turned back in the direction of Cripplegate Buildings; finding I was about to meet him he turned and ran into Milton Street, where he was followed by another officer and taken in custody—they were all taken and charged—I went back to the cart and found this bag in it—it is commonly used by parcel-stealing people, and is called a <hi rend="italic">swag</hi> bag—the property was found afterwards—Stegman gave his address, 12, Windsor Street, which was correct.</p>

I reside at West Ham—on 5th June, 1885, about 6.30, I saw the prisoner next to the station—he made a sign as if he wanted to conduct me and wanted something to drink—I made him a sign that I wanted to go to the station; he made a sign that he wanted to conduct me there—I went into several public-houses, thinking they could show me where I wanted to go—the prisoner followed me constantly; I did not want to have anything to do with him—when I came out of the second public-house the prisoner made a half-turn round me and put his hand suddenly into my left coat pocket, in which was my purse containing two 20-franc gold French pieces and two English florins, and a ring worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a small quantity of <hi rend="italic">bronze</hi>—I caught his hand coming out of my pocket, but he ran away with the purse in his hand—I have no doubt at all about him—all at once two police officers came to my assistance and arrested him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I live at Plaistow—at 7.45 p.m. on 5th June I was in Lilliput Road, near the tidal basin railway station, and saw the prisoner and Sevrin—the prosecutor handed a piece of paper to a man passing by—the man pointed in the direction of the docks—the prisoner said "Yes, that is right, come along"—they went some little distance down the road to the corner of Frederick's Road, where the prisoner said "This way"—they went down Frederick's Road—Sevrin went into several shops, and showed the same piece of paper—the shopkeepers came out and directed him—the prisoner went in with him on each occasion—the prosecutor would go towards the docks, but the prisoner would catch hold of him and take him in the contrary direction—they went towards the station—Sevrin kept pushing the prisoner, and making motions with his hand to go away—they went to the railway station, where Sevrin showed the paper to some people—after remaining there a few minutes they went to the public-house opposite—Sevrin again showed the piece of paper—they came out and went to the station again, to the booking office, where Sevrin laid down the money, and the prisoner said "Two," and showed the piece of paper to the clerk—the train came in, but the prisoner prevented Sevrin going to it, saying it was nearer to walk—they went to the Connaught Hotel—I went in too—the prisoner asked for a glass of ale—Sevrin paid—they came out and went to the dock-gates, spoke to the constable at the gates, and returned to the hotel, had two glasses of ale, and went out—before I followed out I heard cries—I went out and saw the prisoner with his Land apparently round Sevrin's waist—the prisoner immediately ran away some distance, and was leaping a fence at the bottom of the road when I caught hold of his leg and threw him down, saying, "I am a police officer"—he said "I will surrender"—I took him to the station—when charged he said "He is only a foreigner; he don't know what he has lost"—I searched the ditch; it is a large tidal ditch, 6 or 8 yards wide, with several feet of water; it runs parallel to the fence about 18 yards off—just as the prisoner was making the jump I saw him throw something away—it went in the direction of the water—there is high grass on both sides of the ditch—the moment it was daylight I searched—I could not find anything—the ditch is never empty.</p>

               <p>little child, I was there when it was born, and I frequently saw it up to the time of its death—the prisoner took care of it, but the fortnight this happened she was not there; her little boy, six years old, took care of it then, he used to nurse it—the prisoner was not at home at all for the last fortnight, she came in and out—the child was very badly clothed, only a very dirty bedgown—I fed it several times from my own breast—on Friday, 1st May, I saw the prisoner; she went out about 2 o'clock, leaving the baby with the little boy; I saw it about 3 o'clock in the boy's arms, he was sitting down at the door feeding it with cold sop, and I took it inside and gave it my breast two or three times—the sop must have been bread and water—I did not see any milk in it—the baby had been crying—I took charge of it till a quarter to 1 o'clock, when I went to meet the prisoner—I took the child with me wrapped under my shawl—I met the prisoner coming towards home, she was the worse for drink—I said "Oh, Mrs. Murphy, the baby has been crying"—she said "I can't help it"—I gave her the baby; she came down home with me and sat down at the foot of the stairs with the baby and I left her—I did not see the baby again till it was dead—I looked at it; one side of the face was all black—my father sent for a constable—the prisoner had two rooms, she used both—her husband does work at the docks—he was away at work at this time; he went to work about 5, and came back about 6 o'clock at night—the prisoner was drunk every day during the week preceding the child's death—there was no fire in the grate the whole week; I was in and out the place—I have not seen very much sop in the place—the little boy has come over and asked me for some for the baby, and I gave it what I had—I saw the prisoner's husband on the Friday night, he came home about 11 o'clock—they had two other children besides this baby, one four and the other six.</p>

On 10th April, after seeing Robinson, I went with Bell to tins leaf-pit at 9 a.m., having been there the day before—we watched from a small place close by, and at a few minutes before 2 o'clock saw the prisoner and two others, Evans and Pollard, who were taken in custody, come down the hollow and look round—Evans went into the leaf-pit and Pollard kept observation outside—it is a natural hole, where they put leaves—Evans came up and Pollard went down and joined this prisoner, who was down there all the time—I was 50 yards away—after they came out the constable and I went into the pit and found the two boxes left, but the chocolate was taken, except about a dozen drops—Bell followed the men, and as they knew me well I kept out of sight—I did not see the prisoner till he was in custody, but I knew where he lived—I saw him run into his house, 22, Tyler Street, on the 11th, where he lives with his wife—the door was ajar, and I pushed in, but his mother would not allow me to search the house for 20 minutes, and then he was not there—on Sunday, 12th April, I went to 7, Queen Street, East Greenwich, where the three prisoners had run the previous day, when they were chased by Bell, and in a closet across the yard I could see some chocolate drops through a hole—I broke up the board and found a number of them—a man named Kitchener lives at 22, Tyler Street—I had no difficulty in recognising the prisoner; I have known him a considerable time, but he was away, and I heard he was with the militia—Pollard and Evans were tried here in April for this robbery, and convicted of receiving.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I said before the Magistrate, "I saw all three fill their pockets out of the two boxes, which they again covered with leaves"—that is quite true—it is not a pit, it is a natural hollow which goes down slanting, and in some places a cart can go down for the leaves—the ground sloped towards me.</p>

I am an hotel-keeper, of 160, Westminster Bridge Road, and one of the wardens of St. Thomas's Church, West-minster Bridge Road—at half-past 10 on Wednesday morning, 13th May, I went to the church and found a window had been broken open and the church entered, an iron bar removed, two money boxes knocked away from the wall and broken open, and then as the vestry door could not be opened the vestry window had been broken, a cupboard in the vestry broken, and a box removed from the cupboard; there were only books in the box—I had last seen the articles safe on the Sunday.</p>

On the 13th about 2.15 I climbed over a low wall, 6 or 7 feet high, at the side of St. Thomas's Church, believing some one had got over—I examined the premises, heard a noise at the left-hand side, turned round and saw the prisoner coming out of the vestry window with his feet first—I got over the wall, got hold of his feet, and pulled him out of the window—I asked him what he was doing there—he said, "We live here"—I said, "I will take you into custody"—he said, "G—blind me, will you"—we struggled—another man came out, and I having no assistance he got away—I searched the prisoner at the station and found on him these two knives used for cutting lead windows.</p>
