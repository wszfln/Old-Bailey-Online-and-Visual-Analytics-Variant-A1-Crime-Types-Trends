A little before three o'clock, on Friday afternoon, the 22nd of February, I was passing through Rood-lane, and missed my handker<lb/>chief—I perceived the prisoner close by me, on my left-hand side—I sus<lb/>pected him, but not liking to charge him with it immediately, I stepped aside, let him pass, and saw him endeavouring to get my handkerchief into his pocket—I made a spring at him, and he dropped it, and ran away—I pursued him, struck him with my umbrella, and knocked off his hat—I picked it up, and stuck it on the first post I came to—I cried, "Stop thief," but he turned the corner of Cross-lane, and I lost sight of him—there were one or two others with him—I cannot say whether they were accomplices.</p>

On the 4th of December, I received information from Ham the constable, and spoke to the prisoner on the subject—he was in bed at the time, it was about eight o'clock in the morning—I went round my premises with Ham, but could not find any trace of hay on my premises—I told the prisoner I understood Mr. King had been robbed of some hay, and asked if he knew any thing about it—he positively denied know<lb/>ing any thing about it—I asked him if any hay had come on the premises—he said there had been none brought there during the night—I said nothing more to him then—I called him into my room in the evening, and told him I had my doubts about it whether he did not know something about it—I saw his countenance change, and said, "I am satisfied you are con<lb/>cerned in the robbery, now tell me all about it"—I did not say it would be better for him to tell me, or worse if he did not—he said he did know some<lb/>thing about it; that Hammond stole it, and brought it to him, and he received it; that he put it somewhere in my back premises, and Halsey took it to London—he did not say where it was taken to—I have a barn or</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Edgeware. On the morning of the 4th of December I received information of the loss of some hay from a rick in Mr. King's field, near the Old George—I tracked the hay by foot<lb/>marks in the grass, to a shed of Mr. Fenn's, from 200 to 300 yards from the rick, in sight of it—a person standing outside the shed could see what was going on in the field—it is in a direct line—in consequence of what I heard, I went to the Horse Bazaar—I took a truss of hay from there, took it to Mr. King's rick, and it matched it—there were two or three hedges between the rick and the shed, and a portion of hay hung on the hedges, and some lay close outside the shed door, not inside—it corresponded with the bay in the rick—there were distinct footmarks of two persons from the rick—I did not try the prisoner's shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Edgeware. On the night of the 3rd of December I had some bay in my field which had been sold to Mr. Tootel—it had been cut from the rick, trussed, and laid there ready for delivery—next morning it was gone—I afterwards saw a truss produced by Ham, and to the best of my judgment it was part of what I had sold to Mr. Tootel—I was sent for to Fenn's the same evening, and Mrs. Fenn gave me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as the value of my hay—she would not let me know who the prisoner was, till I had taken the money—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and he told me he had given Mrs. Fenn 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the hay—Mrs. Fenn said before him that he was one of the men concerned in it, and that there were three or four—he said he was very sorry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am compositor to a morning paper, and live in Drury-lane. On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, about four o'clock, I went into the Antelope public-house, in White Hart-street, Drury-lane, went to the front of the bar, and sat down—I undid the clasp of my cloak, but made it fast by the ties, allowing it to remain on my shoulders—I wrapped it about me on the seat, and fell asleep—when I awoke my cloak was gone—I do not think it could have come undone by itself—I was not sitting on it, I merely put it round me not to crease it—I never saw the prisoner till he was at Bow-street.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, before five o'clock, I was on duty in Wel<lb/>lington-street, Strand, and saw the prisoner coming from Exeter-street, which is the adjoining street to White Hart-street, towards me with this cloak on—it occurred to me it did not belong to him, and I stopped him—I said, "Where did you get this cloak,?"—he said, "I found it"—I said "Where?"—he said, "A little higher up"—I said, "It looks very clean, it does not appear to have been in the road," as it had been a very blus<lb/>tering wet night, and the roads were in a dreadful state—I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Compton-street, Soho, with Mr. and Mrs. Segrave. I am not married, hut live with a person named Benjamin Hawkins, as his wife—I have known the prisoner between seven and eight months—on the 6th of February, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I met him at the Crown and Anchor—we drank together—I changed a sovereign to pay for a glass of rum and water, and got six half-crowns, and three shillings change, which I put into my bag—I do not know ex<lb/>actly at what time we left, but the prisoner told me he had leave till twelve o'clock, and I think it must have been nearly twelve o'clock—in crossing some square, from there to my own house, he persuaded me to go to another public-house to have some other liquor—I do not know the name of it, it is kept by a person named Kendrick—we had a glass of rum</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183903040029"/>
               <p>and water there—I cannot say who paid for it—I was sober—my bag was placed on the table, during this time, with the money in it, and two letters, on? from a physician, and one from my mother at Bath, and a pocket handkerchief, which he had lent me in the evening—on leaving, I took the bag up, and found it completely empty.</p>

February the prisoner came into the shop, with another woman, who asked for a halfpennyworth of nails—I served them—I turned, and thought I saw the prisoner put some thing under her shawl—when they were gone, I looked in the window, and missed a pair of boots—I ran after the prisoner, who had got eight or ten yards off—I asked her for them—she said she had not got them, or if she had, the child must have taken them—(she had a child in her arms)—they dropped down in the street, almost close to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>was—I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the passage, between the prisoner and Wilson, what about I cannot say—they were talking and fighting—I went into the passage, and saw the prisoner strike Wilson in the passage—the prisoner's shipmates were keeping him from fighting Wilson, who did not seem to want to fight at all—the prisoner ran into the tap-room, threw off his coat, and swore by Jesus Christ, "Where is he, let me get him, I will kill him"—Wilson was not in the attitude of fighting when he was struck—he was standing apart, not wishing to fight at all, his hands were down by hit side—Wilson then came into the tap-room, with some of the prisoner's ship<lb/>mates, to have refreshment—the prisoner ran to him, and struck him again—Wilson turned round in his own defence, and struck at the prisoner, but did not hit him, as he stood a little way from him—they sparred, and Wilson was knocked down several times by the prisoner—Wilson was de<lb/>fending himself then as well as he could—he was knocked down by the blows of the prisoner alone—Wilson was stripped—he had nothing but his shirt on, and the wrist was doubled over his hands—he pulled his shirt off after that, and the prisoner was standing by the table, as if he was feeling for something—Wilson went up, and struck the prisoner, who was stooping at the table—I cannot say where Wilson struck him, but he hit him, and the prisoner returned the blow with a knife in the left breast—I saw him draw the knife from a sheath at his side, and strike him on the left breast—he then threw the knife out of his hand on the floor, and resumed the fight with Wilson, as if nothing had happened—I immediately took up the knife, and showed it to the company, standing round the room—I ran to Wilson, and grasped his wound, where the blood was flowing from him in torrents—he did not know he was stabbed at first—he fought one round after he was stabbed, and was knocked down over a bench by somebody, I do not know who, but two more of the prisoner's shipmates were before the Magistrate, and discharged—I stopped the blood as well as I could—he told me he was not stabbed, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> my hand away from the wound, and told me to let him go, that he was a dead man, that he should die by him—I told him he would recover—I took him down to the bar—Howard, the policeman, was coming up the passage, and I gave the knife to him—the blade was covered with blood, half way up—somebody went for a doctor, who refused to come—Mr. Gurney came in about a quarter of an hour—Wilson was in a very weak state—he seemed to know what was going on—I held the wound to stop the blood till Mr. Gurney came.</p>

I was called into the Hope and An<lb/>chor, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and found the prosecutor—a good deal of bleeding had taken place from a wound about an inch and a half below the collar bone, between the first and second ribs—the wound was about two inches, extending obliquely upwards towards the wind pipe—it was about half an inch deep—I closed the wound, and stopped the blood—he was rather low and exhausted from the previous loss of blood—it was certainly a dangerous wound, as the upper lobe of the left lung was slightly injured—he expectorated blood—if it had been a little lower, and passed between the ribs, it would have penetrated the lungs and the large vessels of the heart, and death would have immediately followed"—this knife is an instrument likely to have done it—I have no doubt the blow was struck with force, from the nature of the wound—the man must have been in a stooping attitude at the time, which prevented it going further—the rib prevented it from entering further.</p>

               <p>bed, or having got out of the window—there was a little grit between the two beds, where the prisoner represented the man to have been lying—there was not the least scratch or mark about the window, or window-sill—it is fourteen feet two inches from the ground, and there is an iron grating, beneath, on which he must have dropped—if he had dropped into the street, be must have dropped on some very rough pavement—I saw the cash-box found under the bed—I took the prisoner into custody, about two o'clock, the same day—I asked her if she had any suspicion of any person who committed the robbery—she said she could not think of any one, she had not the least idea of any one whatever—I asked her what sort of a man it was she saw under the bed—she hesitated, and gave no answer—I said, "Was it a labouring man, with half-boots, and tied up with laces; or did it appear as if they were a respectable man's feet"—she said she considered they were the feet of a respectable man, because he had straps under his boots—I said, "How do you know that?"—she said she looked back, and had another look, to satisfy herself—I charged her particularly not to tell me whether she was guilty, but if she was, and another person older than herself had persuaded her to do it, to tell me in mercy to herself whether she had any accomplice—she said she had none whatever—I applied this instrument to the marks on the cash-box, and they corresponded exactly—I have not the least doubt it was opened by that instrument.</p>

On the 2nd of March, about seven or eight o'clock, I was at Hadley, in Middlesex, and coming from my brother's house there with Mr. Stewport—three boys overtook me—they kept abreast of me some little time, and I observed what I thought was my pocket handkerchief pass towards the one on my right hand—I immediately turned round to Mr. Stewport and said, "I believe that fellow has had the impertinence to take my handkerchief,"—I immediately caught hold of him, and was in the act of searching him, when he slipped out of my hands, and made his escape—I was going after him, when Mr. Stewport called out, "I have got the fellow who has got your handkerchief," and I went back—this is my handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

I was on duty at a quarter to eight o'clock, on the 18th of February, in Phoenix-street—I heard a noise at No. 11, and found the back first-floor window open—I got in at the window, and found the prisoner in another back room appa<lb/>rently asleep—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he had seen two men the night before, taking away some glass, and he thought he might as well have some himself—I found a glazier's diamond, a putty knife, pincers, two screw drivers, and some glass in his pocket, and a box of lucifer matches—I called in another officer—I then found two leaden casements, which bad been taken out, and a hundred and thirty squares of glass, tied up in a bag, and in a handkerchief that he had by his side—a number of squares of glass had been taken out of different windows, where the casements were not taken out—these casements fitted into the window-frames.</p>

On the 16th of February, about twenty minutes after seven o'clock in the evening, I was in High-street, Whitechapel, and, passing Mr. Hutchins' shop, heard a noise at the iron bar—I turned my head, and saw the prisoner throw a shawl down, and run off towards Whitechapel church—I picked the shawl up, gave it to a person in the shop, and pursued the prisoner with several others, crying "Stop thief"—I did not lose sight of him—he stopped in a crowd, and then turned back—I kept alongside of him two or three hun<lb/>dred yards—he walked through a public-house—I followed, but not seeing him in there, and knowing there was another way out, I went round the other way, and took him, and told him he must go back with me to Mr. Hutchins'—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman-baker, and live in Duke's-court, Bow-street. On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, I came from the East-end of the town, and went to a public-house in Newcastle-court, Strand, for about two hours—I did not see the prisoner there—I left about twenty minutes before six o'clock, and went to No. 3, in the same court, nearly opposite the public-house—I did not go into the house It first—there was a young woman standing at the door of No. 3—I merely asked her how she did—I had not been there more than half a minute be<lb/>fore the prisoner struck me with a stick while I was standing outside the door—it gave me a slight scar on the forehead, and struck me on the left shoulder—he came from the front parlour of the house—I followed him into the passage, and from the passage into the room he came from—he must have known that I was following him, for before I could get up to him, he took the poker from the fire, and struck me on the left side of the head—I had got into the room, but not close up to him, not to touch</p>

               <p>him—the blow caused me to fell on the ground senseless—I bled a great deal—I never saw the prisoner again till be was in custody, about six o'clock I was taken to Bow Street first, and from there to Charing Cross Hospital, where my wound was dressed—I went to bed, and remained in the hospital a fortnight—I was then discharged as being better, but was not able to work then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman baker, and live in Silver-street, Wood-street, Cheapside. On the 10th of February I was with Harris and Brimley, at Newcastle-court, Strand—when we came out of the public-house, I was talking to another young man, who had not been with us before—he is not here—Harris then went towards the top of the court—I then heard a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and saw Brimley enter the house—I believe it was the third door on the right-hand side—I followed him in, hearing the <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and saw <hi rend="italic">Harrison</hi> standing by the prisoner, bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you call him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Harris, not Harrison—I am not parti<lb/>cularly acquainted with the name—he was standing upright—I saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner strike Brimley on the hat with the poker—I went to his assist<lb/>ance, and tried to rescue the poker from the prisoner—he got the best of me, and ran out of the house with the poker, and I after him—the pro<lb/>secutor was then in the house bleeding—I cannot say whether he was sitting down or standing, for my attention was directed to the prisoner—I followed him till the policeman stopped him—about ten yards before the police<lb/>man sewed him, he saw the policeman draw his staff, and he dropped something of the sound of iron—the policeman took him into custody, and desired me to assist him, as he seemed rather afraid of the man—I did so, till another policeman came to his assistance—after the policeman took him, the prisoner said, "I know I have done it, and am sorry for it"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On your oath, did not he call out for the police as he was running? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as I heard—I called, "Police"—I was within, I should say, three yards of him, from the time he left the house till the policeman caught him—if he had called "Police" I must have heard him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you happen to slip out the name of Harrison just now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A thing may slip out—it was mere accident—I might have said so—it was mere chance—I first met the prosecutor and Brimley about ten o'clock, at the White Bear, in Bartholomew-close, or square—they found me there—it is a house of call—I belong to a club there—I had something to drink, I cannot say how much, it was half-and-half—they drank with me at times—I do not know what they drank—they had not any gin there, to my recollection—we left there about one o'clock, and went from there to Newcastle-court—we loitered about, because we found it too late to get to our lodgings—I parted from them to go to my lodgings, and met them again in Newcastle-court, about four o'clock—I was not doing any thing parti<lb/>cular from one till four o'clock—I was walking about the street—it was by accident I met them in Newcastle-court—we bad two pots of half-and-half there, and a quartern of gin, as we left the bar—we left there, I should say, at twenty minutes to six o'clock—we were quite orderly and sober—there was no disturbance or knocking at the doors in the street—when I saw Harris in the house bleeding he was standing up—I did not speak to him, or he to me—I did not notice whether he was stanching the wound with any cloth, or any thing—he was not lying senseless on the ground—it is a house of ill fame, I believe—I was never in it before—I have found that out since—I had heard of it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman baker, and live at Swal<lb/>low-street, Regent-street. On. the night of the 10th of February, about twenty minutes to six o'clock, I left the public-house in Newcastle-court, with Harris and Palmer—there was a young woman standing on the opposite side of the way—I saw Harris make towards her—we had not been out of the public-house above a minute before I saw the prisoner come and strike him on the shoulder with a stick—I cannot say where he came from—it was from inside the house—the prosecutor was outside the house, at the door, and the prisoner struck him as he stood in the passage—there is a step to the door—Harris was in the court, not on the step—I then saw Harris go into the passage—I walked towards the door on seeing him do so, and when I got to the door I heard a noise—they were out of the passage then, in a room on the right hand—I walked in, and when I got to the room door which opened into the passage, I heard a noise like iron moving, and saw Harris and the prisoner scuffling together—I imme<lb/>diately went towards them, to Harris's assistance, and saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>strike Harris on the head with a poker—he struck me also, and had it not been for my hat I dare say I should have had a cut—the blow Dearly knocked Harris down—I cannot say whether he was quite down, for I ran to his assistance directly—I was nearly down myself, and by that time the prisoner had made his escape out of the house, before I could recover my<lb/>self—I saw him run out at the door, and followed him—I believe he had the poker in his band, but I cannot positively say—Harris was bleeding from the head very much when I ran out after the prisoner—we both came out of the house nearly together—he came out very little after me—I ran after the prisoner a little way, but stopped for Harris—he came out of the house, and walked as far as he was able, to the end of the court, and then stopped, from the loss of blood, I suppose, which made him faint—I had observed Palmer follow me into the house—I cannot say what he did, because as he got into the house I had the blow on my hat, and by the time I could recover myself he and the prisoner were both gone—I did not observe Palmer endeavour to wrest the poker from the prisoner.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you got the blow before Palmer came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, after—I saw him come in clear enough—I did not see him attempt to do any thing before I was struck—I have known Harris between three and four years—we went out together that evening to see a few friends—I first saw him about six or seven o'clock that evening, and went to the east-end of the town—we went to a public-house in Bartholomew-square—that was not the first public-house I went to with him—the first pub<lb/>lic-house we went to, was the Adam and Eve in Jewin-street—I think we got there about nine o'clock—we did not stay there more than half or three-quarters of an hour, and we went from there to the house in Bartho<lb/>lomew-square—we met Palmer there—I cannot say whether he was there when we went in—I drank with him there—we had a pint, or perhaps two pints of half-and-half—we did not have four—that was the only liquor I had—what the rest had I cannot say—I did not hear them call for any spirits—I drank no gin as I left the bar—I cannot say what they did—I left with them—Harris and I then walked through Smithfield—we lost Palmer in Smithfield—we walked up Holborn, through Lincoln's Inn-fields, into the Strand, and into Newcastle-court—we had a glass of half-and-half each there—before that we went into a public-house at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn—that was about two o'clock—we did not stay there more than twenty minutes, I should think—we had some half-and-half, or porter there—we then went through Lincoln's Inn-fields into the Strand—Harris was with me from the time I left Bartholomew-square till I got to Newcastle-court—we never parted company—he was not two mi<lb/>nutes from me—the first thing I saw when I went into this room, was Harris and the prisoner scuffling—I saw the blood running down Harris's face—I do not know which I saw first, the bleeding or the scuffling—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it—I said, "I went in directly, and saw Harris in the front parlour, bleeding from the head, and the prisoner was standing near him with the poker in his hand, and then I saw him strike Harris on the head with the poker."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you reconcile that with sweating to-day that the first thing you saw was Harris and the prisoner scuffling, and you then saw the prisoner strike Harris on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was bleeding from the head at the time they were scuffling together—it was about four o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>when we got to the public-house in Newcastle-court—it was between five and seven o'clock when I first met Harris—I never parted company with him till this occurred—he could not have gone the distance of a street from me without my seeing him—he was not knocking at any doors or windows—he was not refused admittance into any house, to my know<lb/>ledge—he never went to his lodging, he knew it was too late.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, about ten minutes before six o'clock, I heard a loud noise and cry of "Police"—I turned round the corner and saw the prisoner running furiously up Little Shire-lane—I could not discern positively whether there was any thing in his hand, but seeing the fury he was in, I drew out my staff to stop him—I perceived him slacken his pace, and he said, "Police, I called police first, I give the charge"—I took hold of his collar on the left, and said, "Never mind that, you must go back again"—in turning round I saw another man come up, he seemed to be frightened to approach the prisoner, and said, "Where is the poker, where is the poker? he had a poker, he struck my friend, and wanted to strike me"—I said, "Seize hold of him, seize hold of him, lest he should get from me"—he took hold of his opposite collar, and we returned to meet the mob—there were but very few persons in the street—I saw none but the mob, who seemed connected with this affair—I walked about ten yards, and saw the poker lay—I snatched it up and produce it—when we got to the bottom of Little Shire-lane I saw the prosecutor bleeding very much down his coat and waistcoat, and without a hat—he said, "That is him, I give him into custody"—in going along, a female came up, and said to the prisoner, "Have you got your watch safe?"—I gave her into custody of the first policeman I met—the next policeman I met, I asked to assist me, and li<lb/>berate the man who came up at first, which I believe was the witness Palmer—when I met more constables, I looked round to arrest the others, but they disappeared—I proceeded to the station-house where I received this stick, I believe from the prosecutor—the prisoner said over and over again, that he had called the police, and he would give the charge, he knew Sergeant Pocock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, stationed at Staines. On Satur<lb/>day evening, the 16th of February, in consequence of information from Spelling's, I paid particular attention to the flock of Mr. Goring, in the Lammas-field—I went out, about half-past ten o'clock that night, with Lee—Taylor, our inspector, had given directions to Mr. Goring to have his sheep counted—about eleven o'clock that night I saw Giblett go into the White Lion, which is a quarter of a mile from Church-street, and saw him come out about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, with Frake, Duffin, and three others—Frake and Duffin saw me, and began to whisper together—they afterwards parted, and Frake called out to somebody, "Half-past eight in the morning"—they made answer, "It's all right," and parted—Frake crossed the road towards me, in the town—Giblett kept on the other side of the way, and went up the town, the same way as I did—Duffin went quite the contrary way—I watched Frake up the town—he went down Tilley's-lane, leading to where he lives—that is in a direction from London to Staines, leading towards Church-street, and so to Colebrook-lane—I walked about the end of Tilley's-lane, and waited there a few minutes, expecting he would come up again—he came up, and by that time Duffin had got up, and met him at the top of the lane—they went on, I followed them along to the end of Church-street, to High-street, that is in a straight line to Lammas-field, and about a quarter of a mile from it—I met Taylor, and told him what I had seen—I and Lee went the back way to the Lammas ground, and waited there for Taylor—we found out where the sheep were in the field, and watched them until a quarter past one o'clock—they were at that time in an undisturbed state—at a quarter past one o'clock we came away, and Lee went home—I went up the town with Taylor, and remained in the town a little time to see that ell was quiet—about two o'clock we went back again, and found the sheep as we had left them, all quiet, and in the same place—we returned again to the town, went back about half-past three o'clock, and then found that the sheep had been driven a considerable way from where they had been, across the road into another field—it is an open common there—we searched round the field, but could see nobody—we then went towards Giblett's house, at the corner of Black Boy-lane, which comes into Clarence-street and Church-street—I waited about by Giblett's house till about twilight, and at ten minutes after six o'clock, I saw Frake and Giblett coming together up Church-street, as if from the Lammas-field—Taylor was with me—we observed that Giblett had something under his coat, under his right arm—when he saw us, he seemed to try to avoid us, by going across the lane—the moment they saw us, they moved off, and tried to avoid us—when Giblett came to where he should turn to go to his own house, he went quite in a contrary direction, along the Laleham-road, and Frake went down the town, towards his own house—I went</p>

               <p>down the Laleham-road after Giblett—I lost sight of him for a second, in consequence of a projection in the road by a school—I followed, and when I got sight of him again, I found he was further a-head of me than before, he must have quickened his pace—I came up with him about a quarter of a mile down the lane—he had passed by the school-house, and by the orchard—I called, "Giblett" after him—he said, "Hollo"—I said, "Where are you going to?"—he said, "To get turnip-greens"—I said, "Do you stop out all night to get turnip-greens?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You have been out all night"—he said he had not—I said, "What were you doing in Church-street with Frake?"—he said he had not seen Frake—I then asked him what that was he had under his arm—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You had something"—he said, "You may search me if you like"—I felt down his coat, and could not find any thing—I asked him if he had got a knife—he said, "No"—I said, "What were you doing with Frake in Church-street?"—he said he had not seen Frake—I said, "I am sure I saw you come down Church-street"—he said, "You night see me, but I have not seen Frake, I came down on the moor to get turnip-greens"—I said, "Turnip-greens don't grow on the moor"—I told him to come up into the town with me, which he did—he held his hands down by the side of his coat—I said, "What is the matter with your hands?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me look"—he put up his right-hand, and it was all over blood, back and front; the inside, and round the outside of the finger nails—the blood was quite damp, as if it had been fresh, and between the fingers also—I asked him to show me the other hand, that was all over blood also, but not so bad—I asked how he accounted for it—he said he had been dressing a sheep's head over night—I asked him where he bought the sheep's head"—he said he did not know, for his wife always went to market—I then told him I strongly suspected he had stolen one of Mr. Goring's sheep, and I should lock him up till I ascertained it, which I did—this was about ten minutes after six o'clock in the morning, between the lights—I afterwards went with Taylor to Giblett's house—I did not see Giblett's wife—I found no sheep's head there—Taylor and I then went to Frake's—we found him at home with his shoes off—I observed blood on his hands, which appeared fresh—it was noticed to him, and he laughed at it—we took him into custody, and gave information to Mr. Goring—I was present about seven o'clock that morning, when a sheep-skin, the feet, and part of the entrails was found in the Thames, which joins the Lammas-field—they had been tied toge<lb/>ther with string, and thrown in—a sheep's head was left with me by a young man named Denyer—I took it to Mr. Goring's, about ten o'clock that morning, and saw it compared with the skin, which was taken out of the Thames—the lip of the sheep, where there had been no wool, had been starred down—part of the flesh remained on the lip, and part on the skin.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a drayman in the service of Messrs. Ashby, the brewers, at Staines. One Sunday morning, about a month be<lb/>fore Mr. Goring's sheep was lost, I was in the White lion public-house, at Staines, and saw the prisoners there—Frake asked me if I wanted any thing for dinner—I said, "Yes," and asked him what he had got—he said a leg of mutton—I communicated the conversation we had to Taylor, and told him what I had purchased of them—I saw them again in the evening—on the Thursday before the Saturday when this sheep was taken, I saw</p>

               <p>Frake at the White Lion—he asked me to give him some beer—I gave him some—he said, "We will make it all right by Sunday if we have a <hi rend="italic">pull</hi> before then"—I asked what they were going to have, and said, "A <hi rend="italic">woolly one</hi>?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "One of Mr. Goring's?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him when he was going to have it—he said, "If we don't to-morrow night, we shall on Saturday night"—I went and told Lee the policeman what had passed—Frake told me to be at the White Lion on Sunday morning, by half-past eight o'clock, to receive a leg of them—on the Friday evening I was coming home with the dray through the town and met Frake coming up Church-street from the Lammas, where the sheep were—he said he had been and looked out a good one—I went after the police to tell them, but they were out on duty, and I told the watchman—I had regularly told them what passed from time to time—Frake had told me on Thursday night what time the police came off duty—he said, "We can always beat them, we know what time they come off duty, between four and five o'clock in the morning"—on Saturday evening, as I was going home from the White Lion, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I met Giblett—he asked me if I had seen Frake any where—I said, yes, I had, and I had been hunting after him—I told him Frake was at the White Lion—he said, "I hope he ayn't gone down the field, for the policemen are gone that way, and if he does not mind what he is at, they will <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> him"—I was in the tap-room of the White Lion on Saturday night, and so was Frake, but I was gone home before they parted—I did not hear any thing said about "It's all right."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic printer, and live in Pit<lb/>field-street, Hoxton. On Sunday night, the 3rd of March, about half-past eleven o'clock, I met two females in Old-street-road, near Pitfield-street—they asked me to go home with them—I at first refused, they afterwards prevailed on me, and I went into a house in Old-street-road, on the op<lb/>posite side of the way to where I met them—I went up into the second<lb/>floor front room, and staid there about twenty minutes—they were both in the room with me—one of them asked me to send for drink—I gave them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—another woman came into the room and fetched some gin—I drank a very little myself—they prevailed on me to send a second time for drink—one of the women then went out, and in about two minutes after the prisoner rushed in—he either kicked or attempted to kick the female who was in the room—I told him not to hurt her, for no harm had hap<lb/>pened—his foot was up, as if to kick her, but whether it reached her or not I cannot say—he knocked me down on the bed, and hit me several times with something hard which he had in his hand—I could not distinguish what it was—it was some dark substance, about an inch above his knuckle—the female remained in the room the whole time—there was one candle in the room—he got me down on the bed in a moment, and struck me a great number of times on the face, chest, and throat—he took a yellow silk handkerchief out of my pocket, and rubbed me down the front of my trow<lb/>sers as hard as he could, feeling towards my fob—I had a watch, but it was in my waistcoat pocket, and my coat was buttoned—I had a great<lb/>coat on, as well as a body-coat—I made an effort with all the strength I could muster, and pushed him back with my hands against the fire-place—I ran down stairs, and he after me all the way, swearing very much—I hallooed out, "Murder," "Police," at the street door—there were two women standing just within the door, at another door, which leads into a shop—there was no light, but a fire—I kept just within the doorway, with my head and part of my body out, and called out, "Murder," "Police"—the prisoner did not follow me further than to the foot of the stairs in the passage—a policeman came up to me in about a minute—I told him the circumstance—I was all in one gore of blood—I bled at least a pint from my nose—he said he must go and get somebody else, and he came with assistance in two or three minutes—I had much to do to keep within the door till he came, for the women wanted me to go out, for them to shut the door—I went up stairs with the policeman, and found the prisoner in the room where he had ill-treated me—the door was fastened—I spoke very loud to the policeman, so that he must have heard it—I said, he would have taken my life if I had not got down stairs—he said something, and refused to open the door, but in eight or ten minutes after the policemen threatened to break it open, he opened it—I then went into the room with the police<lb/>men, and told the prisoner he had stolen my handkerchief—he produced a yellow handkerchief, and asked me if that was mine—I said, very likely it was—I do not know where he produced it from—I looked at it again mi<lb/>nutely, and said it was not mine, for I had been taking snuff all the after<lb/>noon, and mine was stained with it—my handkerchief was not found at all—the prisoner was given into custody in the room—my head was not hurt, only my face and throat—I put up my hat to save my face, and the crown</p>

On the 12th of February the prisoner came into my shop with a little boy, and asked to see a coral snap—I took out the tray, on which were various rings, wedding-rings, and snaps—the little boy kept looking over the tray, and the prisoner also—he wanted a different kind of snap—the prisoner at last bought one for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at the same time saying he wanted another one, which I promised to get him in a few days—on the 14th he and the boy came again—he asked if I had got the snap—I said I had not—he asked to see some ear-wires—they were on the tray which he had seen before—I. produced the tray—he bought a pair, and paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—as soon as he had gone out I missed six wedding-rings—I had seen them while he was in the shop, and the moment he went out I missed them—I went out immediately in search of him, but could not find him—on the evening of the 22nd he and the boy came again—I was then by myself—the prisoner asked me, "Have you got the brooch?"—I said, "I believe my boy has got it"—I rang my bell, and went between the pri<lb/>soner and the street-door—my boy came up—I told him to send my neighbour in from next door—the prisoner immediately sent me forcibly out into the middle of the street—I had not made any charge whatever, or said any thing—I just turned my head to see if my neighbour was coming, when he forced me into the middle of the street, and ran out with the boy—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—he was stopped in Holywell-street, and taken to Bow-street.</p>

In the morning, when I got up, I found that my watch and appendages had been stolen, and my room door was unlocked—I went down stairs, and discovered that the prisoners were both out. In a few days afterwards, in consequence of information I received, I went to a small trunk, which I always kept locked in my bed-room—I found it had been broken open, and several articles of plate had been stolen therefrom—I do not know when these things were stolen, as I had not been to the trunk for some time past—the prisoners absconded on the 22nd of November, and I saw nothing of them till the 5th of this month, when they both came home—I sent for the policeman, and gave the prisoner, George Walker, into custody, and on the following Monday, the 7th, the other prisoner, William Walker, was appre<lb/>hended—the elder prisoner admitted to me that he had pawned my watch,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brooks, who is gone to America—he went in the Michaelmas week, and left me forty sovereigns and some bills that I was to get in, and to go after him—I have known the prisoner for nine or ten years, and I went to reside at her house at Southall Green, in the parish of Norwood—about the 6th of January she said to me, "I suppose you have spent five or six of those forty sovereigns"—I said I had spent three and lent one, which made four—she advised me to lock it up, as her son-in-law was out of work, and money was a temptation—I then locked the thirty-six sovereigns in my trunk, which stood in their room—on the 10th of January I went to my box, at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at noon, to take something out, as I was going to Harrow—my box was all right, and the thirty-six sovereigns were there—I went</p>

               <p>to Harrow and returned at nine o'clock at night—on my return I met the prisoner's husband at the door, but the prisoner was not there—her husband went to bed at ten o'clock, and I sat up till twelve o'clock, expecting the prisoner to return, but she did not—I then laid down till the morning—the prisoner's husband got up and went to work as usual—I then went to make my bed, and I noticed that the prisoner's night cap and gown were not there—I saw her box was ajar, and her clothes were gone—I then went down and said to her son-in-law that Mrs. Avenell must have run away, as her things were gone—in a few minutes something struck me to go and look if my money was safe—I went up—it was then between ten and eleven o'clock—I took out my key, opened my box, and saw my clothes had been moved—I put my hand down and my money was gone—I ran down stairs, stated that it was gone, and was going to the prisoner's husband to tell him—a lodger who was there said, "You must have mislaid your money"—I said, "I have not"—I ran up stairs, turned every thing out of the box, and it was not there—I went down, put on my bonnet and cloak, and went to Avenell, to see if he could tell me where his wife was—he disclaimed all knowledge of it, and joined me in the pursuit—we came to town by the steamer, and went to Mary-le-bone office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Liverpool. In consequence of in<lb/>formation, I searched the house of a person named Johnson, in Regent-street, Liverpool—I found the prisoner there on Friday, the 15th of February, a little before eight o'clock in the morning—I had written to the prosecutrix, and she had come down, and was with me—I got the landlady to knock at the prisoner's room door, and say she was wanted—the prisoner was in bed—as soon as she opened the door, I said, "Mrs. Avenell," she said, "You are wrong, my name is Hooper"—I said, "No, it is Avenell, you have committed a robbery in Middlesex, and the party is come down"—she said, "Well, I will tell you all about it, I have taken the money, and I have redeemed a quantity of things"—her stays were there, and a pocket at<lb/>tached to them, in which I found nineteen sovereigns and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked what she had done with the other money—she said, "Redeemed some things out of pledge—this watch, and some other things"—she owed a week's rent, and with the consent of the prosecutrix I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Windmill-street, Finsbury, and am a grocer. On the 18th of February I went to my shop door, about six o'clock in the evening—I missed four bars of soap—they had been four feet within the door, on a cask—I had seen them safe just before—on the Friday following I heard of the prisoner being in custody, and received information from Archer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Beaufort-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea. Some months ago Mrs. Rayner was taken ill, and I went into the country—I returned eight or ten weeks ago, I think, in Decem<lb/>ber—my cottage in Beaufort-terrace was undergoing repair, and I took another the while, and let the prisoner and his wife live in my cottage in Beaufort-terrace, to take care of it, from the good character I received of him—I had a wardrobe there, which had tome keys in it—it had some brass trellis-work in front of it—on the 14th of February I missed those keys from that wardrobe, and was obliged to employ a man to break open some closets—I then missed from the closets two coats, four ox five waist<lb/>coats, a desk of Mrs. Rayner's, three tablecloths, a cloak, and other articles, among which was some stained paper—I think I had from thirty to forty pieces of stained paper there, and there were not more than eight or nine left—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and told him to quit the house, in consequence of my suspicion—I cannot say that I explained to him the articles I had lost, but I went to the station-house, and explained it to the Inspector—the policemen came to the house with me just as two of the prisoner's boxes were in the act of being wheeled away in a barrow—the policemen insisted that they should be brought back, and they were examined in presence of the officer, myself, and Mrs. Rayner—some few things were found in them, but at the bottom of one of them was found a roll of paper measuring twelve yards, which corresponds exactly with the thirty or forty which I had had in the closet in my chamber—the value of all I lost was more than 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The prosecutrix was at my shop—I did not observe the prisoner come in—the prosecutrix came in again and complained of losing her purse—she said that loud enough for every one in the shop to hear it, the prisoner was there, and I have every reason to suppose she heard it—when the prosecutrix said the girl is the blue bonnet was the person she suspected, the prisoner attempted to come out—she had not been served with any thing, nor had she asked for any thing—I put out my hand and stopped her—the shop was then very full—when it got clear, the prisoner was at the bottom of the shop—as she came up. I saw something go down, and I picked the purse up from under her clothes—I have every reason to suppose it fell from her, became I had looked over the shop before it fell.</p>

               <p>been in my own desk—I missed that, and there was none left in the other desks—I found screw-driver, a file, and a hammer on the premises, which might have effected the breaking of the desks—the office joins the ware-house, in which is a window—there was a crate of glass under that window—I caused the younger prisoner to be apprehended, in conse<lb/>quence of suspicion—on the 20th of February I went to the house of the elder prisoner, in company with Fink, the officer, at the corner of Vincent-street, Old-street-road—the elder prisoner was not there at the time—in a drawer in the back bed-room there we found a quan<lb/>tity of silver, wrapped up in a rag, to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sixpence in a box by the side of it—it was an old box, containing old shoes—I saw a woman, calling herself the prisoner's wife—on the evening of the 21st, the elder prisoner and that woman called at my counting-house—the elder prisoner said, "I hope you will be so good as not to go on with this thing, ft will be the ruin of me"—I said, "I certainly shall not stay the proceedings; and moreover, we can swear to some of the money that we have found"—he said nothing about any more money but what we had found—on the 22nd be called again, before nine o'clock in the morning, by himself and told me he had found a quantity of money in an old boot, up stairs in his house; that the silver which we had found, he himself had put into that rag; that the other money, which he then handed me, he had himself hid under a coal; that he was counting the money, and heard a knock at the door, and then the money which was found he put into that rag in the drawer, and the rest he hid under a coal—the money be then brought me was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, making 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—shortly after this he was taken into custody—I went to the station-house with him—it was the same day as he brought the money—on the road there he said that the boy got into the premises by pushing away the board—there was a board on the top of the glass crates under the window, which appeared to have fallen down—a person, by getting on those crates, could get to the window—the crates were inside the premises, under the window, and a board on the top of them had the appearance of having been pushed down from there—I cannot prove that the board had been there the day before—the boy had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—when I first took the elder prisoner before the Magistrate he ordered him to be discharged—he afterwards ordered him to be apprehended again—I never made him any promise to induce him to tell me anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Lambeth-street. I took the pri<lb/>soner on Tuesday, the 26th of February, in Gracechurch-street—Derecourt was with me, and said, "I give you into custody for stealing sugar from a hogshead which you conveyed to a grocer's in Holborn"—the prisoner made no reply—I put him into a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and as we were going along he said, "I am an innocent man"—I said, "Taking two cwt. of sugar out of one hogshead was rather too much"—he said, "I delivered it as I received it"—I asked him if he had ever left the wagon on the road—he said, "No</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Wilson—he Keeps the Cock public-house, at Walthamstow. On the 7th of February, in the morning, I was in my bar; and as I had for some time suspected that my till was robbed, I marked sixteen halfpence and six penny-pieces—I left, and went up stairs for two or three minutes, and heard the till rattle—I came down, and saw the prisoner, who was my servant, coming out of the bar in a great hurry to go up stairs—I told her she had no business up stairs, she had the pots to clean, and I asked her what she was going for—she said she did not know—I told her to come back, as I had suspected her a long time of robbing me; and I sent my son for an officer—during that time the prisoner went to the water-closet—I afterwards saw six penny-pieces found there, and one of them was one I had marked—this rum and bottle, and this pin, which is mine, were found in her box by the officer in my presence—I know this rum is mine, because that morning our rum was rather thick, as this is.</p>

On Wednesday, the 27th of February, the prisoner brought these tablecloths to me to pledge—one of them was in the rough dry—we never take any thing of that sort, and told her so—she went away, and shortly returned with the two, mangled—I asked her where she ob<lb/>tained them—she said she borrowed them of her landlady named Harris—I found they had been marked "F. M."—I called a policeman and gave her into custody, seeing they were far too valuable to belong to her.</p>

The prisoner lodged with us—he had the back room down stairs, and front room up stairs—the back room is kept for the accommodation of the lodgers—the other lodgers occasionally put things there—the earthenware pan in that room belonged to the prisoner—I do not know that the other lodgers used the room, but they might if they chose—I am sure my husband and myself never put any thing there—the pri<lb/>soner is married—his mother lives at Wandsworth—he came home on the 6th of February very shortly after six o'clock—it could not be much after.</p>
