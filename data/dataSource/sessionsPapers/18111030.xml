               <p>was the prisoner - A. Yes, and the sack appearing full made me make up to him. When I went up to him I asked him what he had got there. I asked him if he had got a pig; he said, no, mutton. Then I asked him where he came from, he answered Holloway; I asked him where he was going to, he said Holloway; I said, it was very strange that he should come from Holloway, and going there again; I then rubbed him down of both sides to feel if he had any fire arms about him; I did not say any more to him until we got him over the gate. I had four more with me. I ordered two of the men to go over the the gate, which they did. I told the man to put the sheep over to them, which he did; he then said, I think one of you had better take a turn now; no, I said, you had better take it up, we are going your road. He asked the men to help him up with it; they did. We went on the road until we came to Mr. Crosses, and there we opened the bag; we found the carcase of a sheep in the sack, no head to it; the skin was taken off, the entrails were all gone, but the heart and lights, and part of the liver were left. It was quite warm, it was killed and fleyed in the regular way, and was dressed very nicely. We took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and returned to the field where we first found him. We there found the skin of a sheep with the head on it; we found the entrails, and all the remainder of the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you find that in the field from where you first found the prisoner - A. Near about an hundred yards in the same field.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things warm when you first found them - A. Quite warm. It being dark we did not observe the sheep in the field that night, the next morning I saw that there were sheep there. I afterwards delivered the skin to Mr.

               <p>Q. to Crouch. Did you see any blood as well as entrails in the field - A. There was a great deal of blood laid by the entrails nearly a yard square; it was killed there I have no doubt of it. This is the skin.</p>

            , a watchman. I went into my dining room, opened the window, and asked what was the matter; he told me to came down I looked round, I saw nobody; I went to my bar door, it was locked. I found my cellar door smashed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open - A. Yes. I went forward to the street door, I held up the light to the private door of the bar, a pannel of wood was forced in. I turned my head on the right, I saw the prisoner laying in the bar on the floor, with his head on a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the private door of the bar of which the pane of wood was taken out, was that door open - A. It was open. It was fastened when I went to bed with a drop bolt, if you put your arm in that pane you could shove the bolt up. I unlocked the street-door, and let the watchman and a man of the name of Leach in; they took hold of the prisoner by the collar and pulled him up. The prisoner said nothing, he appeared to be dead drunk. He was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner completely dressed - A. I did not observe that any part of his dress was off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his shoes on - A. That I cannot say. I unlocked my bar front door, I found on the counter a dark lanthorn, an iron crow, and a little bottle in a tumbler; they were not there when I went to bed. Then I went into my cellar, I found my cellar flap, one dog was quite off, and the other hung by one nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these dogs part of the fastenings of the cellar flap - A. Yes, they are the front part of the flap that goes into the solid oak frame. The bolts are on the opposite side, and the bolts were shot, they could get under the shutter by pulling the dogs out. I found in the cellar a small bunch of matches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either that little bottle in the tumbler in the bar, or the bunch of matches in the cellar there in the night when you went to bed - A. No. The bottle would light a match in a minute, I have tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the flap of your cellar the night before - A. Yes, I fastened it myself I bolted it with two bolts a little after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose by forcing the dogs on the opposite side of the bolts the flap could be got up - A. Yes, and they could get under it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not lost any thing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bar was safe the night before, and the cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. No, I never saw him before to my knowledge in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. What time had you gone to bed that night - A. A little before twelve, and then my house was quite safe. I always take my keys up stairs, and put them on my drawers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The publican went to bed before ever he shut up the house; two of his lodgers shut up the house; he went to bed quite tipsey.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was the last up in the house, and took the key up stairs with me. My lodger fastened my shutters, I went down and saw them all safe. I myself fastened the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>- OSBORNE. I am a watchman in the parish of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. In going your round on the night of the 21st had early in the evening tried any of the fastenings of that house - A. Yes; the shutters of the window were safe at eleven o'clock at night. I went round every hour. I was going my round at two o'clock, a gentleman knocked at a door at the opposite corner to the Bell; the landlord let him in, and from what he told me we tried the flap of the cellar and found it open. On that we called Mr. Finch, the landlord of the Bell, up; he got up and let me in, and a gentleman that is here, he is not the landlord of the next house. I saw the pannel of the bar out, I lifted up my lanthorn, I found the prisoner in the bar, he was laying across two chairs lengthways, as if he was asleep. I went and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Finch, the landlord of the house, point him out to you first - A. No, he was at the door at the time, I did not perceive any body find him out but myself, I took hold of his collar and said, my friend rise up; the prisoner said, oh, that is all he said then. I took him to the watchhouse; he walked to the watchhouse with his shoes off. He had no shoes on when I found him. At the watchhouse the prisoner asked for his shoes, and a little girl brought them, he did not put them on till the morning.</p>

            . I am an excise officer. I was on my duty that morning, I was coming from Barbican up the court into Red Lion Market, I found a gate loose in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this public-house lay in a court - A. No, at the extremity of two courts. My curiosity was arisen at seeing the gate loose; a man rushed violently by me as if from Mr. Finch's down towards Barbican, he was going at a quick pace.</p>
               <p>Q. That man you did not know - A. No. I scarcely bad turned round before another man came in the same direction as if from Mr. Finch's house, it rather alarmed me. I proceeded up the court and heard distinctly a bolt drawed back at Mr. Finch's, I did not know it was a public-house then, I know it now; I heard a bolt or something making a noise, which attracted my attention, and seeing a light on the right hand side of the house on the opposite side of the alley, I knocked at the door, the master came in his shirt and shoes with a lanthorn, him and me applied to the watchman; the watchman was deficient in candle;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300005"/>the man said, there is plenty in my house; I went to his house and got a candle; they were stationed one of each side of the cellar flap; I saw the shoes found on the outside of Mr. Finch's house, a pair of thick shoes with large nails in the heels. The neighbour took the shoes into his own house. This was previous to Mr. Finch's door being opened. We tried all that we could to wake Mr. Finch with our voices, we could not; we knocked the shutters with such violence that soured him, he came to the door and let us in. I observed this square of wood was out of the casement, and when the light came nearer I observed the prisoner plainly, his body couching down a if to conceal himself, and not as has been observed living along the chairs. I caught hold of him by the right hand, the watchman pushed the door open, and we brought him out. I having seen the shoes so and the first thing I did was to look if he had any shoes, I found he had none. We took him to the watchhouse, and there he asked for his shoes; I asked him what kind of shoes they were; he said, I shall know them again, they have got nails in the heels. There was a little girl and another standing at the watchhouse, I told them where they were to be found, and they were brought. The next day I saw him put there on, they appeared to sit him. I staid in the watchhouse untill they brought in the implements they had found, and they were shewn to the prisoner.</p>

            . I attended at the office, Worship-street the next day when the prisoner was brought, on Tuesday the 22d, I was desired by the magistrate to go with Mr. Finch. This iron laid on the table. When the prisoner was examined it was brought by Mr. Finch, or some of the witnesses. There was one place in the flap of the cellar that corresponded with this iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the iron - A. It is called a Sawyer's Dog. it is not what they call a crow. It may be used as a crow, and it appeared to have been used to one part of the cellar flap. When I went to Mr. Finch's, I saw this pannel laying in the bar, it appears to bear the impression of the broad part of this iron. This dark lanthorn and a bit of candle was produced to me at the office at the same time, and a few matches and a phosphorus bottle, which I have had ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found this iron in my bar. This is the little bottle that I found in my tumbler glass, and these are the matches that I found in the cellar, they were afterwards taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend with Armstrong when the iron was tried to your bar and to your cellar flap - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this - A. On last Friday morning, about half after three.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you and your family gone to bed A little before twelve; the house was quite clear then of company.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last up - A.Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your doors and windows secured at that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a door is there to your cellar - A. The outer door there is a flap that lifts up.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this night when had you examined that flap - A. On the Monday previous. This was on the Friday. On the Monday before I had beer in; it was opened for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this flap used to be opened excepting for taking beer in - A. No otherwise taking beer in, and letting butts out.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this cellar door secured within - A. Within it is secured by a perpendicular door that it rests upon; we were forced to have a square hole made in the bar, otherwise the hole would not be large enough to let a butt up, and the back of the cellar flap is secured by this perpendicular flap, and the perpendicular flap is secured by the window within the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether on the Monday that the beer had been taken in that this flap was secured - A. I fastened it myself in the usual way, and had no occasion to use it afterwards. The other end of the flap next to the street is fastened by means of iron dogs that goes into the oak frame round the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to examine your cellar from the Monday till the time this happened - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this an old flap or a new one - A. The flap and framing are both new, they had not been made above a fortnight; it was very substantial and firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the persons that gave you the alarm on the Friday morning - A. Horn, the inspector of the watch, and Lockwood the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you came down upon receiving the alarm - A. The watchman having no rattle I sprang mine out of the window before I came down. Then I came down and let Horn and Lockwood into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them into your cellar - A. Yes. There is a door in the house that goes down into the cellar, I looked at it, it was as I left it. When I went into the cellar with Horn and Lockwood; I saw a man standing between the cellar stairs and the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time perceive any thing else - A. I perceived a tinder box and candle, the watchman shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them pick it up - A. No, he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon the cellar flap - A. Not until after the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse, that was three quarters of an hour afterwards. The watchman shewed me a file, the end of it was broken off; I looked to see if I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300006"/>see the end of the file sticking in the flap; the flap was wrenched up and one of the dogs off, and the other nearly so; I likewise found the end of the file, I have it in my hand now, it was sticking between the oak frame and the flap. The iron dog the watchman had previously found; Horn and myself tried the dog on where one was missing, it fitted the place exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when one dog was totally removed, and the other nearly so, was there large space enough for a person to get through there - A. When the dog was removed, and the flap only rested upon the curb, it might easily be removed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far inside from the ground is your cellar door - A. Near nine feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see found any thing more in your cellar - A. When we returned I found a remainder part of the tinder box. We found part of a tinder box before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it - A. Behind one of the butts.</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of a tinder box was there any tinder in it - A. Some small portion, flint, steel, and matches. At the watchhouse I saw two keys found on the prisoner, one a street door key, and the other a smaller one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I think I have seen his face in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean in drinking in your house - A. Yes. or coming to the bar more properly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the dog was wrenched off the flap would rest upon the curb it would not stand wide open - A. No, it would rest upon the curb; I asked the prisoner how he came there, he told me he fell through he was going to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Q. But the flap was down when you found him - A. Yes, it laid even over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon the alarm you did not examine the outside of the cellar flap - A. I did not examine it particularly, I saw it had been wrenched up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he asked me how I came there I told him I came by about half after three, finding the cellar flap open I went through to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he fell through, and that he was going to sleep there.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch there. Early on the morning of the 25th I was standing in the watchhouse, about twenty yards from Mr. Gillbank's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watchhouse door open or shut - A. The top part of the hatch was a jarr. The watch-house is in Goswell-street, It was about half past three, I heard a noise as if somebody had slipped down, as if they had fallen down in the street, and the sound of wood of something, it appeared at Mr. Gillbank's house; upon nearing this I got up and pulled the hatch of the watchhouse open. I perceived two men standing at Mr. Gillbank's door; I thought by their standing there they were after some lead over the bar window; I opened the lower hatch and walked out; as soon as they perceived me the two men ran down Old street, both of them; I then walked towards Mr. Gillbank's door, and perceived a light under the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>Q. The flap was down - A.Not quite close.</p>
               <p>Q. From what aperture did you perceive the light - A.Through a small space in the front of the flap towards the street, I lifted up the flap a little higher and observed the hand of a person, and a lighted candle.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe any thing more than the hand of the person - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts was the hand - A. Just under that past going into the bar. I could see nothing of him but the hand, and a piece of candle in the hand without a candlestick; upon perceiving this I immediately shut down the flap and found this file laying close at the front of the flap on the outside one, and appeared to have been broken. I immediately stood upon the flap to keep it down. I then alarmed Mr. Gillbank by hitting the handle of my cutlass against the boards at the window. I called watch; he was stationed about forty yards from there, that was Lockwood. He came, and the landlord came down, he opened the window first and asked what was the matter; I told; he came down, me and Lockwood went down into the cellar through the house passage.</p>
               <p>Q. That cellar door was fastened was it not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the cellar was there any light there but what you brought with you - A.None. I had a candle, the watchman had nothing. I observed a man standing in the cellar, facing the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar. We took him in custody; I told Lockwood to keep him secure while. I searched about the cellar to see if there was any more persons there; I looked round the cellar, there was nobody else there in the cellar. I found the top of this tinder box underneath the flap in the cellar, and this piece of candle; the candle was out, but the wick was warm; I found this iron dog on the ground, under the cellar flap. I found nothing else at that time, the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse, and in about three quarters of an hour we returned to the house; Mr. Gillbank and I went into the cellar together, we there found this tinder box, flint, steel, and matches. The top that I found before exactly corresponded with it. They were found in a corner under the cellar window, between a butt and the wall. Mr. Gillbank and I tried this dog to the place where it was wrenched off, it fitted the marks exactly. The other dog was nearly wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any account the prisoner gave how he came there - A. When he was at the watchhouse he said he had fallen into the cellar, and was going to sleep there. I saw the officer take these two keys out of his pocket, one a large key, and the other a smaller one.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you pick up the tinder box - A. Mr. Gillbank and I were both together when we found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the observation that you made how did it appear to you that the cellar window had been opened - A. It appeared to me that it had been wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no light in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Witness. I perfectly saw the light from the outside, but when I went down there was no light; this piece of candle I picked up, she wick was warm.</p>

            , and the cellar window was a little open, I did not observe any light in the cellar, I had my lanthorn with me. I heard a voice say, open the flap that he might come out to us. I told him I would not let him come out. I would go down as soon as the door was opened, Mr. Gillbank came down and opened the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went with Mr. Gillbank and Mr. Horn into the cellar - A. Yes. There was no light in the cellar but what I brought. I saw the prisoner at the bar standing there with his back to the wall, nearly opposite to the flap. I asked him how he came there, he told me he was going by there about half past two o'clock, and he tumbled into it, and having no lodging to go home to he pulled down the flap of the cellar, and meant to go to sleep there. I immediately took him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him into the watchhouse did you see any thing picked up - A. Yes, the top of the tinder box, and I saw the dog picked up; when I came back I saw the candle picked up and the tinder box. Mr. Horn shewed me a file; I did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gillbank. You produced what you supposed to be the end of a file - A.Yes, here it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Try it with that file - A. It fits exactly. I found the end of the file sticking between the flap and the curb. (The file and the end of the file handed to the jury.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing by about half past two in the morning, I thought it rather an unreasonable hour to go home; I saw the cellar flap of one side. I went down into the cellar and

               <p>Q. On the 10th of September had these three men all lodged in your house - A. Yes, they all went to bed about ten o'clock in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning did you hear any body go out - A. Yes, about five o'clock I was awoke by the moving of the chairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to say it was about five o'clock - A. I heard St. George's bell ring a little time after, it rings a quarter before six. I suppose it was about five.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your window shutters open or shut - A. They were all shut, I cannot say whether it was light or dark at that time; I heard a person coming down stairs, I called, whose there; the prisoner answered that he was going on board the vessel; he asked me if he should open the door and go out, or would I get up and let him out; I told him he might let himself out, upon that he opened the door and went out. I heard him unlock and unbolt the door; I bolted it myself after the lodgers had gone up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his way to go out of the house lay through your room - A. Yes, the stairs come into my room. He went out, and I went to sleep again. He did not return. He had lodged with me about a month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was only a thin linen screen between the bed and the door, it was impossible for me to pass with a bundle at that time of the morning without being seen.</p>

I ran after him and called stop thief; he immediately threw down the hat and boots, and ran. I took the hats and boots up and went home, another person pursued him, he was soon brought back.</p>

I merely put it to; there is a patent latch underneath, sometimes it does not catch, that might be the case that morning. These are the boots I have on, this is the hat I wear myself, and this is the child's hat I fitted up the night before.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was serving in the shop. - A. Myself and a young man of the name of Crease, we were in the shop. He is not here. The prisoner looked some prints, muslins, and other articles out, she did not pay for them, said she would call again for the parcel, we thought it better to send the parcel with her, I took the parcel home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she lived. - A. No, I followed her as far as Newgate Street, I asked her how much farther she was going, she told me if I would wait there ten minutes she would return, I told her I would not leave her, I wished her to go back again, she consented, returned back a little way, she went in a court and sat on the ground and said she would go no further, I hired a Hackney Coach and as I was taking her up she dropped a piece of print.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the print drop. - A. Yes, as she arose it dropped from under her, I took it up, I then secured her. This is the print that dropped from her, it is a different sort to what she had bought, I had the goods that she bought.</p>

At the corner of St. Paul's Church Yard, of the Tobits side, I took hold of her she said I had no business with her, I got her to the watch-house passage, there she made a stop, I called out to my partner, he came, and then she came easy. We searched her, there were two guineas and a one pound note dropped from her person, I took a candle and lanthorn and went over the ground where I had taken her, when I came to the corner of the passage where the struggle was, I there found this purse containing eight pounds in notes and three guineas. The gentleman wanted the purse and the money, I said no, you must not think of that before we go before the Alderman, the money that I found in it the Alderman gave to the gentleman, and gave me the purse. This is the purse.</p>

At the watch house he said there were two more concerned, he thought they wanted to rescue the prisoner from him, I asked him if he should know the two men that wanted to rescue him, he said he should know them, they came up to the watch-house door, I fetched them in, he swore to one, we had him before the Lord Mayor, he could not swear to the other, he accused him of attempting to rescue the prisoner from him, he said he shoved against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a curious story altogether, watchman, have not you heard him a while ago swear that neither of the men offered any violence to him. - A. That is what he told me at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you different at the watch-house. - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was searched, did not you find some of the work that belonged to Messrs Rundle and bridge. - A. There was some work found upon him.</p>

            . I am the officer that took the charge. The prisoner was charged by the prosecutor of robbing him of the chain and seals, the other man was charged with being an imaginary accomplice, he was detained, and discharged the next day by the Lord Mayor. This is the watch-chain.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, with all deference to you, I unfortunately had been into the Borough on business, I was returning home through Gracechurch Street, some man run against me and shoved me against the prosecutor, having property about me, and fearful of danger, I walked faster than otherwise I should. this man accused me of taking his chain and seals, which I knew nothing of till the constable asked me my name and put it down in the book. Mr. Prior swore positively to me, the watchman went out and took two others. I know nothing of the parties, nor they of me, one of them was detained, and discharged by the Lord Mayor; Mr. Prior, through malice, or I cannot say for what swore to me. I was a peaceable subject of his Majesty passing at the time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any other person live in the same room with you. - A. None at all except a young child. I took the prisoner in for her victuals and drink, and a shilling a week to take care of my young child, I go out with a barrow, she came to me at ten o'clock in the morning, on Saturday the 12th of this month, and staid till four in the afternoon, she then returned the child and key to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your lodgings that day. - A. At one o'clock I took the prisoner with me where I pitched my barrow, because she should know where to bring the child to me in the afternoon to give her the breast, when I had pitched my barrow she went away and took my child with her and the key of the room, she returned to me in the afternoon with the child, and delivered me the key, when I looked about she was gone, I returned home at half after eight in the evening, keeping my child all that time, when I returned I found my room door locked, I unlocked it with the key and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left any money in your room at the time you went out. - A. Yes, I left ten dollars, a one pound note, a half crown piece, and thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this money of yours put. - A. In a locker in my box, I had seen it safe in my box a little before eight o'clock, I left the box under the bed, when I returned the box was near the fire, not where I had left it, the lock of the box was broken, and all my money and note was gone. Between nine and ten the same night I saw the prisoner in a cellar in Bembridge Street, I gave her in charge of the watchman, she was taken to the watchhouse, in the watchhouse she owned to the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it first said to her that it would be better for her to tell. - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not say what she said, there was none of the money found upon her. - A. No.</p>

Yes, it was between eleven and twelve, I saw him go in and from the appearance of him, and coming out again with two rolls of flannel in half a minute, I suspected him, he carried them in his arms before him, I immediately went into the shop, there was nobody in the shop, the door between the shop and parlour was shut, and a thin silk blind up at the door window, I went into the parlour, there was a young woman there, the young woman came out of the shop, and said somebody has stolen two rolls of flannel, I ran directly after the man, he had got about five or six doors, I laid hold of his collar, and brought him back with the flannel in his arms into the shop, when I took the prisoner I said, young man you must bring this back, he said nothing, and when I brought him in the shop, I said lay the flannel down, he laid it down, Mrs. Webb said you villain I suppose you are the same fellow that stole the callico off the same shelf about a fortnight ago, he said he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the young woman in the shop when you brought him back. - A. There were two women sculking about, I brought them in, I asked the prisoner if he was married, he said no, he knew nothing of the women, I let them go, I took the prisoner and the flannel to Marybone watchhouse.</p>

Yes, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in my way home, I went into a public house on the right hand side, I had a pipe of tobacco and six pennyworth of rum-and-water, there were several people in the public house. When I asked for something to drink an old man said they did not draw any beer, I then ordered some rum-and-water. The old man asked me if I could help him to any work, I said no, when I was coming out I gave him a glass of gin. Payne came in and began to quarrel with the old man, I said take this glass of gin, and not have any words with the old man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the other prisoner at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in this public house. - A. About a quarter of an hour, I only drank six pennyworth of rum-and-water there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left that public house, where did you go to. - A. I went into the public house opposite, I went out and did not like to go into that house again, I went into the house opposite, I found the two prisoners there, they were there before I went in, and there we had in the whole two glasses for each person, I had two as well as the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in company with the two prisoners there. - A. I might be half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. After you left the second public house where did you go then. - A. I went over to the cooks shop, and the prisoners went in with me. I had not been in the cooks shop many minutes before the officers of Bow Street came, there might be six or seven of them, I sat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300014"/>opposite them in the shop, the master of them said to me who are you, I said I am a tradesman, I live in Well Street, he said come out, I went into the middle of the shop, he said I shall search you, the prisoners were there at the time, I said you may search me and welcome, I have nothing but what is my own property, he began searching me, the two prisoners were there and a few other persons, they saw the officer take my property out, he took out my pocket-book and my handkerchief, he opened the pocket-book, in a little book that was in my pocket-book there were the notes, a ten pound note, a five pound note, and three ones. Then he looked into the remaining part of the pocket-book, he found what I told him was true, he told me to fold the pocketbook up in his presence, and advised me to go home, I put my book in my inside pocket, the prisoners saw the whole of this.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of them do any thing while you were being searched. - A. Payne pulled a pocket knife out while I was searched, as I was in the cook-shop, Salmon said d - n you if you let me have any nonsense I will take you to the watch-house, he put the knife in his pocket. I went out for the purpose of going home, I had not gone many yards from the house that I came out of, the prisoners came along with me out of the house, I crossed over, it might be twenty, thirty, or forty yards, I cannot justly say, they came and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see them. - A. I saw them right and left over me, they were not in the front, they laid hold of me and tried to get into my pocket by force, they laid hold of my shoulders and arms, then Payne forced his hand into my pocket, and cried out a book, a book, he got his hand into my side pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your hands and arms all this time. - A. Confined.</p>
               <p>Q. Who held you in that manner. - A. Both of them for the moment it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. How long were they about this. - A. Not above two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get the book out. - A. Yes, his hand went along in my pocket, the book was rather large, he could not get it out. I eased it, he pulled and said, book, book, and out it came. They ran one way, and I the other, I ran to the first watchman I came to.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you run away from them for. - A. Because they should not injure me. The prisoners were not apprehended till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that among the notes there was a ten pound note, who gave it you. - A. My wife brought it me, she brought it in change of a check at a bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that note again. - A. I saw a ten pound note again at the office, I could not swear to it again.</p>
               <p>MR. ARABIN. It seems you are a married man. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. This was twelve o'clock at night in St. Giles's. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been before twelve. - A. I had been down into Fleet Street, an upholster failed he owed me nine pounds, he called his creditors together. I went there about eight in the evening, and was detained there about two hours, I left about ten, I had</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you drink while you were at the meeting of the creditors. - A. I drank two glasses of wine, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you turn into any gin shop. - A. I did not. I was not disposed for any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you got to St. Giles's you were. - A. No, I drank no more than would do me good. I went into the second public house up the street.</p>
               <p>Q. There you met the old man. - A. I did, I gave the old man some rum-and-water and some gin, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say Payne came in and some conversation passed between Payne and the old man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went over the way, you saw the prisoners there. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before. - A. No, never before. I paid for two half pints of gin, and drank a glass of each.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always sensible when you are so generous. - A. If a person wanted a glass of liquor if I saw them at any time I would give it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then go home. - A. I went to the cook-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And there the officers came in. - A. Yes, they searched me and this money was produced.</p>
               <p>Q. He advised you to go home, and these men came and used you in this way. - A. Yes, I am positive of it, so help me God.</p>
               <p>Q. You were perfectly sober. - A. Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you knew of a reward. - A. No, God forgive me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that you do not know there is a forty pound reward. - A. I have heard of such things formerly, I never knew it for certainty.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you upon your solemn oath, whether you did not believe before you gave your evidence here. If these two men are convicted, that there is a 40 l. reward for each of them. - A. So help me God I never knew such a thing in the world. God forbid that ever I should expect such a thing in my life, I have heard before that there was a 40 l. reward for a highwayman, but not of this kind.</p>

            . I am a police officer. On the night of the 7th of October, about half past twelve, I in company of four others went into a cooks-shop, in St. Giles, I saw the two prisoners there and the prosecutor, soon after I went in the prisoner Paine got up, he asked me if I knew the man that was standing up, that was meaning the prosecutor, I said no I did not know him; he said he is a returned lad, lately bolted from the bulks, meaning a returned transport, the prisoner Paine said he had got a pocket book and some notes in it, I recollected there were about thirty-seven that broke away from the hulks about four days before, in consequence of what Paine said to me I went to the prosecutor; I asked him who he was, he said he was a tradesman and lived in Well Street, Oxford Street, I asked him what he had got about him, he said nothing but his own, I told him I wished to be satisfied, he said I was welcome, he offered to shew me, I searched him in the presence of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both looking on. - A. They had every opportunity of so doing if they pleased, I found a ten-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300015"/>took. While I was searching Paine made some observation, I did not take much notice, the prosecutor has stated right, I said if he was not quite I would take him to the watchhouse, I looked at some papers and read them over, and put a few questions to the prosecutor, and from the answers that he made I concluded that Paine's statement was not correct. I knew Paine, after this desired the prosecutor to put the notes in his pocket book again, and put the book in his pocket, I advised him to go home, or else he would be sure of being robbed, he then wished me good night and went out, there were two patrols of my party in the cook's-shop and two at the door, when the prosecutor went out the prisoners were certainly in the room, there was vacancy in the room, they might have gone out while was speaking to the landlord of the house for keeping his house open so late, and harbouring such company. cannot say whether the two prisoners were there then I went out, they might have passed me.</p>

I keep a public house in George street, I know the two prisoners at the bar, they came a Tuesday morning about half past eight, and changed a ten pound note he same day they were taken by that was the morning they came to my house, - Paine asked me to change a ten pound note, they had four or five shillings worth of rum and milk, I said to Paine, Dick, have you been selling out? because his mother had left him some property lately, yes, he said, he had, I sent the note out to the pork butcher to be anged, I put Paine's name upon the back of the note before I sent it out, when I got the change I gave it to Paine.

               <p>DAVID HARRIS. I am the brother of John Harris, I serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your brother any partner. - A. No. On the morning that the last witness has mentioned, I observed the prisoner shuffling something on the counter, I could not tell what it was. When she was going to pay for what she had bought she dropped a dollar or some silver, she was going to pick the silver up, she stooped down and put something under her petticoats. In her way to the door I laid hold of her, she stood some time, and from under her petticoats the silk handkerchiefs dropped, I picked them up and kept them till the constable came.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity of feathers had she taken away. - A. Twenty pound weight. I am in the habit of going into the rooms every day and making the beds; the property is under my care; the bed was not ripped before.</p>
               <p>- WOODMAN. Here is the two baskets of feathers and a hat box. I took the woman in custody; I weighed the feathers, they weighed twenty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. No. I saw a bundle tied up laying over him on the counter, I reached over my hand and felt that they were halfpence in the bundle. Then I examined the doors, I found the door was unbolted and upon the single lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asleep all the time. - A. Apparently so to me; he did not move any. I then opened the door he got up and ran out, he frightened me at first, but I saw a paper of halfpence drop out of his pocket, which knew to be my master's, I had tied them up in a paper the over night and knew the paper, I went and stopped him, he struggled and tried to beat me, I brought him back to my masters door, I rang masters bell, he came down stairs, I gave him in charge to my master. Afterwards I saw four silver spoons taken out of his pocket, and four five shilling papers of halfpence, I then saw nineteen shillings and sixpence in copper taken out of a hat and eight and sixpence in silver, two knives and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>RICE PRICE. I am a pork butcher, 78, Snow hill, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On the night of the 26th of October, or rather half past six in the morning, I lay awake in my bed, all of a sudden I heard the cry of stop thief, I thought I knew the voice, I instantly got out of bed, I opened my back window to ascertain whether I knew it or not, I dressed myself and ran down stairs, and found the prisoner in the custody of my young man, I took him by the collar and looked at him, then I requested my young man to lay hold of him, I then went for an officer, the officer came with me an I searched him There was sound in his waistcoat pocket eight shillings and sixpence in silver, and loose copper two shillings and eightpence. In his coat pocket was found one pound in halfpence, four silver tea spoons, a pair of sugar tongs, a small knife and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had all these things been the over night. - A. The tea spoons and sugar tongs were in the parlour, he took an apron into the shop, broke open a small desk, the contents of the desk were eight pound ten shillings in copper done up in papers, and eight shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man. - A. I have seen him before up and down Snowhill. My house is situated at the corner of Cock court, on examining the premises we went up the court, and found the wall was marked with chalk, the wall is about twelve feet high, on the top of the wall glass bottles were placed in mortar, it appeared as if he had got up that wall, and by the marks on the parapet wall, he had walked backwards and forwards once each way, inside there is a shed, he got down the wall on to the shed, he could get down by the tiling into a small yard that adjoins my house, In the yard there are two sash windows that goes into the parlour, he pushed up the sash, got into the house, and opened the bolt of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that window was down when you went to bed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing how he came there. - A. He never uttered a word. There were a knife and a nail found upon him, the marks we found on the two tea caddies and the desk, he could not well break the lock of the till, he cut a hole in the counter and pushed the bolt of the lock back.</p>

The prisoner was on board and the surveyor was just in the act of searching him, and on seeing me he unloosed his breeches; I told him it was useless doing that if he had any property about him he must bring it on shore. He was taken to the office and searched, and about half a pound of tea was taken out of his breeches, the officer was sent for to take him in custody, he begged pardon and hoped me and Mr. Bird would forgive him.</p>

He came into my house on the 12th of October, about ten in the evening, I perceived he had linen under his great coat, I asked him what he had got there, he said his wife's or sisters gown, I laid hold of the table cloth, I saw it was not mine, the cloth was full of gravy and liquor as if it had been shortly used, and by his saying it was his wife's or sisters gown I thought he had stolen it. I lodged him and the cloth in the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the owner of it. - A. By the company that were in the house, there had been a club-feast there, we suspected that it belonged to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober. - A. I rather think he was elevated. The prosecutor's house is about three miles and a half from mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Could he have heard you if he had been in a proper situation. - A. No doubt of it, and where he was he might have heard if he had been attentive, we ran towards the waggon to save the child, but we were too late, the fore-wheel of the waggon had gone over the child's ankle just as we came up. The prisoner jumped down immediately, and stopped the horses after it had gone over the child's ankle, the child was taken up and taken to a surgeon immediately. The prisoner behaved with a great deal of contrition, I never saw a man shew more contrition in my life, he said he would make every satisfaction in his power.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How soon did you see the defendant after the accident happened. - A. The next morning he came to my house, he was going before the magistrate, and he came to go along with me, he said if the child lived he would do all in his power for it, he seemed hurt very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your child in the habit of running across the road. - A. It would always run out if it could.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I was sent for. When I saw the child the bones of the foot were crushed, a mortification had already taken place on the morning after the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you sent for. - A. On the morning after the accident, I continued to attend the child until it died, I attended the child from the 11th to the 24th. The mortification suppurated, which is common in these cases, the child did not die of mortification, but from the suppuration that followed it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you not think of performing amputation. - A. I should have performed it, but a large abcess took place in the thigh, it was so high up it was impossible to perform it.</p>

               <p>- COLTSEN. I am a watchman. On the 27th of September, about ten o'clock at night, I espyed a horse and cart at the Queen's Head, Clerkenwell Close, there was no one with the cart, and just before the clock struck eleven it turned round and came up Clerkenwell Close, there were two men with it, one in the cart and the other running after it, I was in my box, I saw the cart come by my box up towards the field, the cart afterwards turned round and went back to the Three Queen's, then it was half past eleven, when I came back to my box at a quarter to twelve, it was standing there then, when I went back at twelve, the cart was gone. I saw no more of the cart till a quarter before one, I heard the rattle spring and a voice halloa out stop thief, the same cart and horse came down the close and went to the Three Queens again. I went to the watch-house to get somebody to come along with me, the officer of the night and I went up to the Three Queens, the cart was not there then. In about a quarter of an hour the cart came again to the Three Queens, there were two men with it, the prisoner was in the cart driving it, they got out of the cart at the Three Queens, and went into the house, there was nothing in the cart. Me and the night officer looked all over the cart, there was neither name nor number to the cart, a short man came out of the Three Queens, I asked him if the horse and cart belonged to him. The prisoner made to the cart as if he was going to get in, I asked him if the horse and cart belonged to him, he said the horse belonged to him, I asked him if it was his property, he said, what was that to me, I told him I would take his horse and cart to the green-yard, and him to the watch-house if he did not give me his address, he said it was a neighbour's, he did know his name, I then took him to the watch-house, I left the man that was in the cart along with a watchman. The man took to his heels, the watchman took the cart and horse to the green-yard.</p>

On the 12th of October I went into my bed room about five minutes to twelve o'clock, the windows were down, the curtains of the window not being drawn I drew them, it is a sash window in the gallery, I found there were no fastenings to it, afterwards I put the candle upon the table immediately under the window, placed my coat and waistcoat upon a chair close to the table, at the corner of the window, and went to bed. Somewhere about three o'clock in the morning I thought I heard something move like pushing up the window, I heard it rain very hard, and therefore conceived it might be the wind and rain that deceived me, I went to sleep again: I heard it the second time, but had the same impression, I thought, as I supposed, for some short time I heard my coat move, I also heard something fall, at that time it appeared to be like the sound of a small tea-spoon, but it turned out to be my pencil-case, I also heard my money rattle, I had two dollars and a shilling in my waistcoat pocket. I listened for some time, but I could not hear the foot of any person, I heard the mewing of a cat, I thought there might be a cat in the room, or a rat, or something of that sort, that might move my coat, I got out of bed, I looked round the room as well as I could, it was dark, I could see nothing, I had no idea of the window being opened, the door I knew to be locked, I considered myself in a very respectable house, therefore I had no fear, and got into bed again, it was still raining and very dark. When I awoke in the morning about five or ten minutes past eight I observed the curtains of the window moving gently, as though blown by the wind, I got out of bed and saw that the window was open, I looked at my coat and waistcoat, and did not find them in the situation that I had left them at night, I immediately searched my coat pocket, I had put my coat and waistcoat on the back of the chair. When I got up in the morning the coat was on the chair, not upon the back, the coat was upon the seat of the chair, and the waistcoat upon that, but not as I had left them. I searched for my money, but it was gone.</p>


               <p>Q. What was it you lost. - A. Twenty-five pound, three five pound notes, two twos, and six ones, Bank of England notes, I for some time considered whether I should mention it to Mr. Glover, he being a particular friend of mine, I was afterwards so determined. I knew the notes when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not try the window. - A. No, I am certain it was down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been dining at the house. - A. Yes, I was perfectly sober I assure you.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Mr. Glover's, the Green Dragon Inn. On Saturday, the 12th, the prisoner came into our house, between the hours of two and three in the day, and asked whether he could have some dinner in the coffee room, it was served to him according to his orders. About an hour after dinner he called for the bill, when he discharged the bill, he asked whether he could sleep at our house after he came from the theatre, having at that time the appearance of a gentleman I told him yes, he came between the hours of ten or eleven, he had his supper and went to bed.</p>
               <p>The next morning about seven o'clock he got up, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300020"/>paid me his bill in the coffee-room and went away, I am sure as to his person.</p>

            . Q. You are a city marshal. - A. I am. On the Sunday morning I was going down Bishopsgate Street, about the hour of ten or a little after, Mr. Piper was on one side of the street and I on the other, he beckoned me to come to him, he had something to communicate, he then told me that he had been robbed at a house, which of all the houses in London he respected for punctuality and good conduct, he wished me to come before Mr. Glover to investigate this robbery, after some few minutes I requested the waiter might be sent for from thence, I had every clue that caused me to do what I did, that is to apprehend the prisoner. I went round to the different coffee houses and inns in London to give information that if a man, answering the description, that they would be good enough to give information, so that we might be able to see if it was the man that slept at that inn that night. I received information on the Monday morning that induced me to take him into custody, I instantly took him into the coffee-room at the Four-Swans, Bishopsgate Street, where I apprehended him. He made a strong resistance before he would suffer me to search him, upon searching him, in his breeches pocket I found three five-pound Bank of England notes, with other things that he had about him, which I now produce. I went on Monday evening to the prison, and took four one-pound notes from the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) Look at these five-pound notes. - A. They are mine all three of them, there is on them the person's name I had taken them of the day of the month, the date of the year. The four pound notes are mine, I knew them again.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can Mr. Piper say that he had the property about him when he went to bed. - A. Yes, when I was in Mr. Glover's bar I put my hand in my pocket, and felt the notes two minutes before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I changed a thirty-pound note in a gambling house in Oxford Street, I lost five pound there, that was on the Saturday night. On the Monday night I was taken up, I was as liable to take them in change as any body else, on Thursday night I slept at the Green Dragon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know them before. - A. Row had used my house about four or five days, he worked for a livery stable over the way, they called for a pot of porter and sat down in one of the boxes to drink it, Row came to me in the passage, he said here is a man owes me ten pounds, he has got a twenty pound note, and if I cannot give him change now perhaps I may never get it. If you will give me change, or let me have ten pounds till I get the note, you shall have the note and give me the difference when you can, I immediately replied if it was a good note I thought I could give him change, he then returned to the prisoner Jones, and in about a minute or two he came again, he said here is a comical joke, he will not part with the twenty-pound note until he has got the ten, in the mean time Jones came to the bar to my wife with the false note so as to shew the word twenty, it was doubled up in four parts, here, said he, you need not be afraid, you see it is a twenty pound Bank note, I saw the note, and heard him say it, I said this is a comical piece of business, but I shall be sorry for the man to loose the money for the want of ten pound, I went up stairs and brought a ten-pound note down, I held my hand on the table with the note, I said here is my ten-pound note, where is your twenty, the note was snatched out of my hand by Row, Jones immediately took it from him, Jones doubled up the note, put it in his pocket; he threw down the false note; here, said he, is the note, it is not worth two pence, that fellow has swindled me of ten pound, and I have got it again, I do not care a d - n.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the note. - A. One of the Marlborough Street officers searched Jones and took it from him. I never parted with the note, it was snatch-out of my hand.</p>
               <p>CROKER. I am an officer. I searched Jones, I found that ten pound note upon him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my note.</p>
               <p>Row said nothing in his defence</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. John Row asked me to give him ten pound on a note, I gave him nine pound and one pound the next day, but I should not have done it if I had not thought it a twenty pound note. On Row I demanded ten pound, the prosecutor lent him ten pound, upon getting that I returned him the twenty pound note again. Had not the prosecutor been warm I should have given him the note again, although I should be a loser.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of October, on board a ship in the West India Dock, I searched him, I found nothing upon him at that time. I told him that I had a warrant to apprehend him for robbing a man of two watches, and some money; the prosecutor was with me, he pointed him out. The next day I was going to search him again, he gave me a duplicate out of his pocket; he said he would leave him a monthly note to make good the watches and the notes he had lost, if he would let him go on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harris. Look at that duplicate produced by Willan, is that the duplicate of that watch - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Willan. After that he was taken before the magistrate there the prisoner promised that he would pay the money if he would let him go. The magistrate asked him him if he had any means of paying him he said his captain would give him a monthly note for the payment of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken down in writing that was signed by the prisoner - A. Yes, this is the prisoner's signing, it was read over by the clerk to him, and I saw the magistrate sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that watch - A. It is my watch, I know it, I bought it eight months ago; the case has an old spring, it will not keep fast. This is the watch that was in my chest, it was taken at the same time with my two notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor was with me in my confinement, he said he would make it up if I had any money, last Monday.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I work for Mr. Dickson. On the 5th of October I was at work up stairs in Mr. Dickson's house about three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a screaming in the street, I looked out of the window, I saw Mrs. Dickson and the prisoner scuffling together, they were about twenty yards from the door, I could not distinguish what was said. I saw the prisoner lay his hand upon Mrs. Dickson's breast to shove her away from him; she had hold of the flap of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is this window that you were looking out - A. I was looking out of the two pair front, I could see distinctly all this. She would not let him go; the prisoner fell down, and the flap of his coat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300022"/>came off with a pair of shoes in the pocket. I could see the heels sticking out of the pocket distinctly, in the pocket of that flap that came off. I saw Mrs. Dickson come back to the shop with the shoes in the pocket of the flap that came off. I did not come down until I saw the man go down the Commercial-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to come down sooner when you saw the man scuffle with Mrs. Dickson - A. I had not time, it was done so quick. When I came down stairs I went out of the house and turned the corner of the Commercial-road, two captains had hold of the prisoner; he was brought back to the shop by them, and then the prisoner had only one flap to his coat, he asked for the flap. The shoes were taken to the office in the pocket of the flap of his coat. I did not examine the shoes until I came to Shadwell office, then I knew them to be Mr. Dickson's property.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before this had you been in your shop - A. About a quarter of an hour. Griffiths looked out of the window, he said it was my wife scuffling with a man in the street; I ran down stairs, my wife had come back when I came down; the shoes were in the pocket of the flap, on the counter. I went out of doors, turned the corner of the Commercial-road, I saw two captains had got him; he was brought back to the shop. I sent for an officer; he begged me to let him go; he begged hard for the flap of his coat, to sew it on, the officer would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here - A. No, she is not in a fit state to come. The prisoner came to me on the day before and made application for work; I told him I would give him a winters seat of work if he suited me, if he could get himself a lodging; he asked me if I could recommend him; I told him no, I would not recommend any one; he said he would come to-morrow morning; he came about twelve o'clock, I was then in the shop, he told me he could not get a lodging, could I recommend him one; I told him no, I would not; the prisoner said, as you are going to dinner I will go and seek for one; I said, when you get one I will employ you. The shoes were in the window, he took the shoes up two or three times to look at; he said, they are very good shoes; I said, yes, they are, and if you make as good you will suit me. Then afterwards he went out of the shop, I never saw any more of him until the time that I have spoken of before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined the shoes at the office that were in the pocket of the coat, do you mean to swear that these shoes were the same which the prisoner had been looking at in your shop, and upon which he made the observation that they were good - A. Yes; I am sure they are the same, because they were cut particularly high for a customer, and they are higher than the other shoes. These are the shoes, I know they are mine.</p>

               <p>MORGAN JENKINS. I am shopman to Mr. Gillman. On the 12th of October, between ten and eleven at night, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for some dimity; I stood at the door, I asked her to walk down the shop; she went down about the middle where the shawls were laying upon the counter. I turned my back and fetched the dimity, and when I turned back I missed six printed cotton shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of them - A. Ten shillings and sixpence. I cut her off half a yard of dimity, it came to seven pence, she paid me in copper for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. There are many persons employed in your shop - A. Yes, there were two or three persons in the shop at the time, and there was a young woman came in with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who left the shop first - A. The one that is gone, and this one was left behind.</p>

I came in just as the prisoner was going out; a signal was given me; I immediately followed her into the street; I laid hold of her arm and brought her back, at that moment I discovered the shawls between her feet and mine in the street; I immediately took her and the shawls into the shop, I then sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had she put the shawl - A. I do not know; I did not see them fall, I saw them between her feet and mine; my foot touched them as I laid hold of her.</p>
               <p>Mr Challenor. Whether the shawl dropped from this young woman or the other you cannot tell - A. The other young woman was gone at the time, the shawls were on the ground. The prisoner went out the first time, and returned to know if she had paid for the dimity; she had, and then when she went out the second time a signal was given me. I went after her and laid hold of her arm, and the shawls were on the ground. These are the shawls, I know they are ours, there is my private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, and called no witness to her character.</p>

On the 25th of October I was below in the casting shop, I was told that the prisoner had been there; he had no business there; I observed this piece of pewter had been moved out of its place, it was stood up and covered with straw and ends of rushes. As I had suspicion of the prisoner I watched, and saw the prisoner come at five o'clock in the evening, he took that same piece of metal, placed it under his apron, and went out of the shop. I followed him across the yard, through the front shop, to the street door, he got into the street; I then called him back, I accused him of having the property about him; he denied it two or three times, and said, that I might search him. I told him I would not search him, I was confident that he had got it, and told him to pull it out; he said he had got a small bit, and pulled it out from under his apron, I took it from him, and gave it to one of my shopmates. I sent for my master, I told him what I had done, and what he had done.</p>

Staniford called me down on the 25th of October, about five o'clock in the evening, Staniford told the prisoner he had taken some metal; the prisoner denied it. He took his apron of oneside, and in his waistcoat and waistband of his breeches, this piece of metal was lodged; he pulled the metal out, and gave it to Staniford; I received it of Staniford. He begged for mercy, and said it was the first time.</p>

               <p>- HODSDEN. On the 21st of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at Mr. Barker's in Houndsditch, I saw the prisoner pawning two pair of shoes, knowing he was employed at Mr. M'Laren's it gave me suspicion. When the prisoner walked out I stepped forward and looked at the shoes; I told the pawnbroker I thought they belonged to Mr. M'Laren, Cornhill; the young man said he would be aware for the future. I went up the next morning to Mr. M'Laren's and told him; he desired me to go with him to the pawnbrokers, and there he saw the shoes, and knew they were his property. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I am in the habit of seeing him every day. I work for Mr. M'Laren.</p>

            . I am a constable in the City of London. On Friday the 25th of October I saw the prisoners in America-square. they went up Vine-street, into John-street, into the Minories; I called my brother officer, I said John, here is something not right. In the Minories I shewed my authority, and said to Hoblan, what have you got here. I touched him upon the stomach. I found something hard; my brother officer came up, I said, Jack, take care of this man, I gave him charge of Plaston: I had hold of Hoblan, we took the two prisoners up the Minories into Whitechapel, to a wine-vaults, I untied Hoblan's apron, out dropped five pieces of wood. On searching farther I found nineteen brass breast plates belonging to different regiments of volunteers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Plaston searched - A. I did, on him was found thirty-one breast-plates.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say - A. For God's sake do not hurt us, you may do away with it, Plaston said he had a wife that had been bed-ridden for nine months; Hoblan said, for God's sake do not hurt us, we can settle it. I kept the property in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a city officer. On this night week, about half past five in the evening, I saw the prisoners in America-square, I was with Hodson, by their shifting their hand I immediately suspected they had got something; the moment I laid hold of Plaston, he said, I will tell you the truth if you will let me go; I said, I do not know what you mean, I have not accused you of any thing. I put my hand to his pocket, I felt something that appeared to be brass. We brought them to the wine-vaults in Whitechapel. In his two waistcoat and breeches pocket, I took out thirty-one brass breast-plates. Hudson searched the other going along. Plaston begged for mercy, he had never done such a thing in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bellis. Are they what you call breastplates - A. Yes, they are brass breast-plates, they appear to be part of the ordnance stores of his Majesty; we had a good many in the tower; they are worth about four shillings.</p>
               <p>Plaston's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I have a poor wife that has been laying bed-ridden a long time.</p>
               <p>Hoblan said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Plaston called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hoblan called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             and James M'Quire, they were given to me for the purpose of purchasing Bank notes of the prisoner</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoner. - A. As near as I can recollect, the commencement of my dealing with him was the 20th or 21st of August, that is to have dealing with him, I have known the man before six or seven months, I had seen him, but not in the habit of intimacy with him till then.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at that time a prisoner in Newgate. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the eight one pound notes of Mr. Westwood, had you any other notes about you. - A. I was particularly searched by Beckitt and M' Quire, I had no others.</p>
               <p>Q. Having received these eight notes what did you do. - A. I went from the House of Correction in company with Mr. Westwood, Beckitt, and M'Quire in a coach to Newgate, when we came to Newgate I and Beckitt got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Beckitt accompany you to the door of Newgate. - A. Not immediately to the door, he was on the opposite side of the way, he saw me go to the door, and go into the prison, I then went to Habberfield, the prisoner at the bar, I could not be admitted, immediately, I saw some other person with him, when that person was gone I got admittance. Mr. Westwood requested that I would keep part of the eight pounds, and put them into my pocket. I then delivered six one-pound notes into the prisoner Habberfield's hand, he knew what I want by giving him the money, and he gave me the quantum according to what money I gave him, I gave him the six one pound notes without saying any thing then. He delivered me six. three of which were what I gave to him, and the other three were three two pound notes forged on the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason for returning you three of the notes that you had given to him. - A. I always purchased them at ten shillings the pound and on returning me the three he told me that he had no more left, and that in the course of a few days he should have a fresh supply, I think on the Wednesday or Thursday week, in the course of eight or ten days he should have a fresh supply. I then returned to Beckitt, and put into his hand these three two pound notes, he was in the same place, as near as I could recollect, as I had left him, M'Quire was with him, I put into his hand the three two pound notes, the same that I had received from Habberfield, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the five one pound notes that were left. - A. I was brought to Mr. Westwood, I found him nearly opposite to Newgate, I gave him the five one pound notes on my return in the coach with Beckitt and M'Quire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What countryman are you. - A. I was part of my time reared in Ireland, and part in Scotland. Ireland is the place of my nativity.</p>
               <p>Q When you were in Cold Bath Fields prison the Bank expected you dealing in forged notes. - A. It appears so</p>
               <p>Q. And you wished to disappoint the gallows this time, you thought you would bring it on somebody else. - A. I always wish to disappoint it</p>
               <p>Q. So they searched you before they let you out of prison. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in Newgate. - A. About fifteen or twenty minutes. I did not watch the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody went with you into the prison. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the prison was Habberfield in. - A. I believe they call it the state side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors did you go through. - A. Four doors, and a subterraneous passage.</p>
               <p>Q. The turnkeys went through these doors, they did not know the errand on which you came. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was nobody there to watch you inside of the prison, with whom you spoke to, nor whom you dealt with. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw many other prisoners though you did not converse with them, walking backwards and forwards. - A. Oh dear yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for Habberfield, or any body else ask you who you wanted - A. They seldom ask who you want, except past six o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . Q. You are a clerk to the solicitor of the Bank of England. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you had received, did you go to the person that has been examined of the name of Barry, in the house of Correction. - A. I did, on the 23d of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you learned of him, did you then make up your mind to try the experiment for him to go and buy any forged notes. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had permission of the directors of the Bank to go for that purpose. - A. I had, I gave Barry eight one pound notes. I was present when Barry was searched by Beckitt and M'Quire in the house of Correction, before I gave him the notes, he had neither Bank notes or money about him, his pockets were turned inside out, and he was stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Now before you gave him the eight one pound notes did you make any marks upon these notes individually, and describe what marks they were. - A. I put upon the back of these note a small W, but previous to my doing that I took an accompt of the number of the eight notes and by whom they were signed, this paper contains an accompt of the numbers and dates of them. Brickett marked all the eight one pound notes with another mark in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you deliver these eight one pound notes to Barry. - A. For the purpose of detecting the prisoner, and to enable him to purchase forged bank notes by them. After delivering the notes to Barry, I then went with Barry, Beckett, and M'Quire in a coach from the House of Correction to the Old Bailey, very near Mr. Newman's house Barry and Beckett then got out of the coach, and I got out also, and I saw Barry go into Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw Barry again. - A. About a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and Beckett delivered me these notes, three two pound notes which Beckett marked in my presence, and I marked them also. These are the three two pound notes, they have been in my possession ever since, after I had received the three two pound notes, Barry returned to me five one pound notes, these are them, they are part of the eight one pound notes that I delivered to him, I know them by the mark I had put upon them. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards I received from Beckett and

             a city officer, after they came out of Newgate, on the same day I received two one pound notes and part of a one pound note, the two one pound notes contains both mine and Beckett's mark, the part of the one pound note only contains Beckett's mark, that part of the note where my mark was appears to have been burnt, it contains the same number that I marked, they form a part of the eight that I had given to Barry. I attended the examination of the prisoner in Mr. Newman's house, about a fortnight after he was in custody, Barry was then produced as a asked what he had to say in answer to the charge that had been brought against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this examination taken down in writing. - A. The examination was taken before Mr. Alderman

            . I am a turnkey in the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present on the 23d of September when some bank notes were delivered by Mr. Westwood to Barry. - A. I was; I marked them and searched Barry dilligently, previous to the notes being put in his possession, there was nothing in his possession but a shilling and a few halfpence. I accompanied Barry to Newgate, with Mr. Westwood in a coach to the end of Newgate Street, and when he came out again he delivered into my hand three two pound notes. I marked them. These are the notes. I delivered them to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at these five that Mr. Westwood produced, that were returned to him by Barry. Are those five that you hold in your hand now, part of the eight that you marked in company with Mr. Westwood, in the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields. - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you had received the three two pound notes of Barry, did you afterwards go into Newgate. - A. I delivered them first to Mr. Westwood, the three two pound notes. After that I went into Newgate, accompanied by John Brown, the city officer. I went with Brown to the prisoner's room, there were seven or eight people in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any of the turnkeys there. - A. Yes, two, Vinge and Smart went in with us. The prisoner was sitting on the bed, I asked him if he had any property about him, he answered yes, he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of gold, after that he pulled out a pocket-book containing notes, I opened the book and looked over a great many of the notes, he then produced a stocking full of notes. It was requested by some one in the room to have the number of the notes taken down as I looked over them, after I looked over twenty or thirty, or more, some in the stocking and some in the pocket-book. I asked him for the remainder of the property he had got about him, he said he had no more property, then he put his right hand in his waistcoat pocket, he pulled some notes out of his right hand waistcoat pocket and laid them on the bed, about twenty or thirty pound. I looked over them and found they were not what I wanted, that had my mark upon them, he then put his hand in his left hand waistcoat pocket and pulled out three notes, he laid them down on the bed. These were three one pound notes that had my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these three that the prisoner took from his left hand pocket, part of the eight that was given to Barry in Cold Bath Fields prison. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these three notes you say he produced and laid them down on the bed. - A. Yes, I took them up and looked at them, and by request I handed them over to 
               <persName id="t18111030-43-person369">Brown</persName>
             the same as the rest to have the numbers After the numbers were taken down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300027"/>Brown handed them back to me, just after I had got them in my hand from Brown, the prisoner Habberfield ran and snatched them out of my hand, he snatched part of the three notes out of my hand, he left three pieces in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the part that remained in he prisoners hand. - A. He went to the fire immediately, I ran and caught hold of the prisoner to prevent him burning them, there was a scuffle took place between Vinge, Brown, and the prisoner, to prevent him burning them. the prisoner attempted to put them under the trivet on the fire. I believe there was a kettle on the trivet, he tried to shove them under the trivet, but was prevented. I took some off the fire, it was in the flames, I throwed it on the ground and put my foot upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to snatch any other bank notes out these three. - A. None, he afterwards snatched at some paper that the person had been taking down the numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. What numbers did the paper relate to. - A.I tore off from the paper the numbers of these three notes, was in my hand, and he snatched at it. This is the paper, I delivered the paper to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. You had tore it off before he snatched at it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that in your hand, you see there are two one pound notes, each tore in half, and two bits of a one pound note - A. They have my mark on them. They are what the prisoner produced out of his left hand pocket, they are also the notes that he snatched at and tempted to burn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they also part of the eight notes that you and Mr. Westwood marked together in Cold Bath Fields prison, and delivered to Barry. - A. They are, there is y mark on them.</p>
               <p>COURT. During all this enquiry of yours about the property, did the prisoner put any question to you, what business you had with his property. - A. As we were going out he asked us what business we had with his property, and said he would serve us out. We did not tell him for what purpose we came, there were so many in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'QUIRE. Q. I understand you are employed in the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields. - A.am, I was present when Beckitt searched Barry, he was searched dilligently, he had no notes about him. I am not certain whether there were not a few halfpence, there was no money to a great amount about n.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw some notes that were marked by Mr. Westwood and Beckitt, given to Barry. - A.Yes. I think eight one pound notes. I went with Mr. Westwood, Beckitt, and Barry in a coach to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is the time of Barry's conviction out. - A. No.</p>

            . I am one of the turnkeys of Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present on the 23d of September, in Newgate, when the prisoner produced any property to the witness Beckitt. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were sent there for the purpose of ing present. - A. I was by the order of Mr. Newman that was produced was from his left hand waistcoat pocket, after the prisoner produced these, notes I saw him snatch them out of the officers hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the officer. - A. Beckitt.</p>
               <p>COURT. In whose hands were they. - A. I cannot say rightly whether Beckitt or Brown. I saw him snatch them, he immediately put them on the fire underneath the tea kettle, they were taken out of the fire by the officer, he trampled upon them and extinguished the flame.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. Q. You are one of the city officers. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Beckitt to Newgate on Monday, the 23d of September. - A. Yes, I saw the prisoner at the bar produce a great many notes, some in a book, some loose that he took out of his breeches pocket, and some in a stocking, after producing these, Beckitt told him he had more, he then pulled three more out of his left hand waistcoat pocket, he gave them to Beckitt to look at, the moment that Beckitt had looked at them, he gave them into my hands for a man that was sitting by to take the numbers down, after the man had taken the numbers, I returned the three notes to Beckitt again. At the moment that Beckitt had got them in his hands, the prisoner Habberfield made a snatch at them, Beckitt immediately scuffled, and Habberfield made towards the fire place, seeing him in the act of putting them under the kettle, I immediately laid hold of him with my left hand, and stretched my right hand out to lay hold of the notes, his waistcoat gave way so that I was obliged immediately to throw him down, the moment he fell, the notes fell from his hand into the fire, as soon as he was down I put my hand into the fire to rescue the notes, there were two partly whole not burnt, and one partly burnt. I picked up the piece that was burnt and gave it into Beckitt's hands, the other I put into my pocket, that I took off the fire and kept it in my pocket until I came out of the prison I then delivered them into the hands of Mr. Westwood, in the lobby of the prison. The man, then of the name of Gilbert, was then asked for the paper that he had taken the numbers down. Gilbert gave the paper into Beckett's hands, who immediately tore off the number of the three notes now in question.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean by that the number of the three notes that came out of the left hand pocket. - A. I do. When they were torn off Habberfield made a snatch at that paper, but could not accomplish it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Westwood.) Do you know that paper. - A. I received this paper from Beckett, it contains the number of the three notes that were torn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the mark of the five notes. - A. The mark that I made is a small W, under the one at the back of each of the notes, all the eight notes were marked the same way.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Beckett.) Point out the mark on the five ones, and tell me what is your mark, and whether that mark appears upon them. - A. My mark is a blind E, the letter E filled up, it is on all of them, even upon that which appears burnt.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 3d of May last were you at the Royal Exchange. - A. I was, I am not positive to the day, it was in the early part of May, I saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. No, I did not. He accosted me by name, he said he had a favour to ask of me. I expressed some surprize that he should address me as he was a perfect stranger to me, he then stated that I must have seen him in the cashier's office in the bank, I then looked at him, and recollected him in that situation as having been a clerk in the bank, I asked him what favour he had to ask of me, he replied he wished me to discount a bill, I expressed a considerable reluctance in doing it, stating that I never wished to discount bills out of the regular course of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any bill been produced by him. - A. No. He then stated to me that he was very well known by Mr. Lee, one of our principal clerks, who would also confirm his statement to me, he would go over to our house, and Mr. Lee would confirm it. I still continued to express my dislike to discount the bill, he pressed me very hard, that he had a sum of money to make up in was not made up, would be affected by it, to the best of my recollection them are the words he said I went back with him to my house, I then called Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee said he knew him very well as a clerk in the cashier's office in the bank, that he had always been very civil and very attentive to him when he had occasion to transact any business in that office. The bill was then produced, I think, for the first time by the prisoner, I then shewed the bill to Mr. Lee in his presence, Mr. Lee stated that he thought from the situation that the prisoner was in the bank, there would not be any risque in discounting a bill of that amount. I however was not perfectly satisfied with that, I requested the bill might be left with me, in order that I might make enquiry of Ransom's clerk, with respect of the respectability of the acceptor. I said that in the presence of the prisoner, The prisoner expressed no objection of leaving the bill with me at all, and accordingly, the next day, when Ransom's clerk came to our house, I asked him if it was a bill that I might safely discount.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of these enquiries, did you give any directions to discount the bill. - A. When I was satisfied, I then gave directions for the bill to be discounted, and the money given to the prisoner, charging him for the regular discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it paid. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Look at that bill, and see whether that is the bill. - A. This is certainly the bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have no other partner at all intrested. - A. None whatever than has been stated.</p>
               <p>Q. The man left it with you in order that you might make enquiry. - A. I made the enquiry myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not remember the name of Gullan, you shewed him the bill, and the clerk on looking at the bill, he said it was a bill that you might take. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. You are a clerk in Robarts's house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do, I have known him probably four or five years, I knew him first in the chief cashier's office in the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the cashier's office at the time he came to you. - A. I thought he was, it turned out he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your house. - A. I remember enquiry being made of me by Mr. Robarts, whether I knew him or not, the prisoner was present, I knew him very well, I once knew him to be a respectable man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the prisoner the day after the amount of that bill. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that bill and see whether you know it. - A. I do not know that I saw it. The bill goes into another office, a ticket is brought me; Whitehead brought the ticket himself, and I paid him the money. This is the entry in the book, 86 l. 18 s. 2 d. G b. that is the book, I paid him eighty seven pounds in Bank notes, he paid one shilling and ten pence to make it even bank notes, that is the amount, deducting the discount. The bill was eighty-seven pounds ten shillings, that left eleven shillings and ten pence discount.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. I see the name of Whitehead is here, now you copied that from some other person in the A. Yes, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300029"/>Q. Pay P Whitehead eighty-six pounds eighteen shillings and two pence. Looking at that, can you say that you paid that for the ticket that is now produced - A. Yes, I knew Mr. Whitehead very well.</p>
               <p>Q. That I know. Looking at this you could not say whether the bill was one month, two, or three; you know that would make a difference, if the bill was a two month bill, then this might be it deducting the interest, I want to know whether the bill produced in question was the bill that Whitehead discounted to you. - A. It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first saw the bill before. - A. The night before I paid the money Mr. Robarts enquired if I knew Whitehead, I had seen the bill the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have seen a bill in Whitehead's hands, which being a two month bill, and deducting the discount, would amount to this ticket. - A. It could not be two months quite, the interest would be more.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know, you not having the bill presented to you at the time, how you can swear to that being the bill. - A. I do not know that ever Mr. Whitehead discounted a bill before.</p>
               <p>Court I understood you to have been present the day before, when the prisoner came into your shop, Mr. Robarts called to you to tell him what you knew about the prisoner. - A. Yes, then I believe I saw the bill, but not when I paid the money, Mr. Robarts asked me wether I knew Whitehead, Whitehead was present.</p>

            . - A. Yes; his house is in Manchester Buildings, his livery stables are in King Street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an account in your house. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received general directions not to pay any acceptances from him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you refuse payment of it. - A. It was refused by me, it was presented by Mr. Bowen, Mr. Robarts's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Gullan's hand writing. - A. I do exceeding well.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me wether you know that acceptance is Mr. Gullan's hand writing. - A. In my judgment it is not, I have seen him write repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In your judgment it is not is your answer, I want to know whether that judgment is formed in consequence of any conversation with Mr. Gullan, or whether it is solely the result from the view of the bill itself. - A. From the bill itself, strengthened from that.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had seen that, and you had no conversation with Mr. Gullan, would you not believe that to be his hand writing. - A. I certainly would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Supposing you had received no directions from Mr. Gullan himself, should you have paid that bill. - A. Not if I had looked at it as I do now, - it might have been paid in the hurry of business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Making allowance for the distinction of a man's writing now and then, can you undertake to say that is not Mr. Gullan's hand writing. - A. I have seen him sign drafts for fifteen years, according to the best of my opinion it is not his hand writing.</p>

             I was nine years old on the 30th of June last. My father is a stationer in Cambridge Street, Hackney Road</p>
               <p>Q Had you ever a watch gave you. - A. Yes, my father gave me a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you this watch before this happened, that you are to speak about. - A. About half a year, this happened on Thursday the 26th of September. I was going home from school, it was about a quarter past twelve I go to school at Mr. Parry's, by Hackney turnpike, I had my watch with me then in my waistcoat pocket, I put the chain through my waistcoat button hole.</p>
               <p>Q. So that part of the chain was out - A. Yes, I was going alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it that any thing happened to you. - A. Almost facing of the Nag's Head, about a quarter of a mile from the school, and about half a mile from my father's house. I was in the road walking towards my father's. Three men came all of a row, they met me.</p>
               <p>Q Did you know any of these men - A. Yes, the two prisoners at the bar are two of the three, I was going of one side of them, they stopped me, then I wanted to go on the other side of them, they stopped me again, they would not let me pass, they slipped before me, they kept of a row when they slipped before me. Then I wanted to go of the other side of them and they slipped before me, there they made an opening in the middle, I wanted to go through and two of them closed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by closing you, what did they do. - A. They crowded me up, they pushed me, they both got me in between one another, and I was standing between them, they pushed against me, and squeezed me, they crowded me up and said stop young fellow, then they snatched at the watch and broke the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say which man snatched the watch. - A. Yes, Murphy. I am not sure it was him, it was one of these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it between these two men that you were pushed and squeezed - A. Yes, it was one of these two that snatched the watch and broke the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your watch. - A. They took it, when the chain was broke they snatched it out of my pocket and then gave it to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. They put a hand into your pocket and took your watch, did they - A. Yes, and part of the chain remained in my button hole. They ran down Nag's Head Yard directly after they took it out. I holloaed out, a soldier ran after them and they were taken into a house. I saw them in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that only two were taken, there were three men. - A. The other ran down the London Field, and the two men that ran down Nag's Head Yard was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. And one of them that were taken was the man that took your watch. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever see your watch again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two prisoners that were taken searched in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of your chain again. - A. Yes, here it is they left in my button hole.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you were a good deal frighted while this was doing. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding this did you take notice enough of the men to know them again. - A. Yes I followed them quite close down Nag's Head Yard. I never lost sight of them before they were taken. They were taken to Worship Street and I went there the same day, soon after this happened.</p>
               <p>JOB GREGGS. I am a soldier. On this day between twelve and one o'clock. I was about twenty yards from the Nag's Head, as I came along I saw the child run across he road</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any men with him before that time. - A. No. I heard the boy cry out stop thief, he has got my watch, these two prisoners were turning down Nag's Head Yard at the time, and as they found there was no thoroughfare they were returning back again. I stopped them both, I asked Murphy to give the boy his watch, he said he had not got it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300031"/>Q. Did you see any thing of a third man. - A. No. I took them into a persons house in the yard, there I had them searched, they had not got the watch about them.</p>
               <p>JAMES SANDERS I am a watchman. I had been to the London Fields selling cakes in the day time, I was coming home. I was near the Nag's Head. I saw the three men altogether, and saw the boy. I was about four or five hundred yards off them, or not quite so far. I saw them shuffling and hustling the boy, and stopping him from going along, they shoved him from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that they did any more than stop him. - A. They shoved him from one to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then were you so far off as four or five hundred yards. - A. No. I made a mistake in that, I was near the Nag's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear them say any thing. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you actually see them lay hold of him and see them shove him from one to another. - A. Yes, I did. All at once I saw them all three run, and immediately the boy cried stop them, they have got my watch. I holloaed out stop them, they have got the lads watch, they all three ran past me, the lad and I ran after them, they got up Nag's Head Yard, the soldier had got them before I got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man run. - A. No. I did not see that, the boy and I followed these two.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WORTH. Q. You are the father of that little boy. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You made your son a present of a watch I understand. - A. Yes, rather better than six or seven months, and a steel chain. I wore this chain myself twenty years, the watch was not quite so old as the chain.</p>
               <p>Q Had you given it him or lent it him. - A. Which you please, he called it his watch, and I allowed him to call it so.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA REYNOLDS. I am a constable. On the 26th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming out of the Nag's Head public-house, I heard the cry of stop thief, the people said they had just run down Nag's Head Yard. When I got to the yard I met this soldier coming up with the two men, I heard the boy, these are the men that stole my watch, we took them into a neighbour's house in the yard, we searched them and found nothing, and after that took them to Worship Street. The magistrate knew them directly</p>
               <p>Levy's Defence I was going of an errand for my father down Hackney Road, I was going along by the side of this little boy, I was off him a good way. When I heard him holloa out, stop him, he has got my watch, I saw the little boy run after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What you mean the other man there. - A. Yes, I was running the same as some more people, one of these men took me in custody and charged me with having the boy's watch,</p>
               <p>Murphy's Defence. I was looking after work, I heard stop thief cried, and as I was passing this turning that soldier stopped me and gave charge of me.</p>

             I am an apprentice to the prosecutors. On the afternoon of Wednesday last the last witness shewed me where a bundle of hair was, I found it under the manger under the stable, I took it to the accompting-house and shewed it to Mr Wells. It was in separate lots, I put a dark piece of twine round each bundle, I gave it to Luckett and desired him to place it where he took it from, this was between seven and eight o'clock. Mr. Wells brought the prisoner to the accompting-house about a quarter before eight o'clock, he desired a porter to search him, the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and afterwards pulled the hair out of his breeches. It had the dark thread on it, I knew it to be my master's property</p>

This is the parcel, it is the kind of hair that we use in our manufactory, I believe it is our property, it is worth upwards of four shillings. The prisoner earned thirty-four shillings a week, and his wife ten shillings and six pence, he had been with us two years</p>

               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that he had been that day in the warehouse where the cantharides were. - A. I only know from report.

               <p>Q. When you produced this paper bag did Mr. Beckworth claim the property. - A. He did, they were his.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 15th of September you were on board of one of the boats of the Rattle Snake. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any boat that attracted your attention. - A. Yes, in the Walmer road, a little before eleven at night; we chased the boat and came up with her, when she found that we came up with her, she ran on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she to the shore when you first saw her. - A. She was about thirty rods off.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it turn out that she contained. - A. Spirits in half anchors. She was full when I seized her first.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. After she got on shore you actually seized her. - A. Yes, the boat's crew were with me at the time, I saw the mob assemble on the beach, I cannot tell what number they were. I sent after the soldiers directly, I went up on the beach, and told the mob to keep off, if they did not I would fire into them, they gave three huzzas and ran down to the boat, and began to take out the tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what number they took out. - A. No, I cannot say, I judge that there might have been about sixty taken away, because the boat was full when I seized her, and afterwards there were left but thirty-two. When I saw them take out the half anchors, I fired a couple of pistols over them, that was for a signal for the other Custom house boats to come to assist; d not desist, I ordered the boats<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300033"/>crew to fire in upon them, the fire was not returned just at that present time; finding that I could not keep them off, I ran up to the barracks, the soldiers were just coming out, they came down with me, the serjeant is here of the 21st Regiment, he came down with a party and assisted, then when I came I fired my piece, and ran round the boat, and the mob left it, they ran up behind the boats that laid on the top of the beach, the mob did, and then they fired two or three pieces, the mob did, we could see the flashes but not see the people, we tried to get the boat off, at the time they fired I ran up on the top of the beach, there I saw Leonard, he told me he took a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man. - A. Yes, I told him to take care of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Custom-house officer come to your barracks for the assistance of the military. - A. Yes, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, at that time there was firing going on at the beach, I and others went to the beach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go between the public houses called the Good Intent, and the King's Head. - A Yes, the firing was going on then, I think it proceeded from different parts, right and left; the fire was mostly on the left, but some on the right, Smith was with us, he told me to fire to the left, I fired twice accordingly to the left, I had no more ammunition I drew my sword, I then observed firing at my left, about twenty yards off or better; I instantly ran to the spot where I had seen the flashes of that firing. I found three men standing there behind a boat, I struck one of these three men with my sword, somewhere about the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q Was that man the prisoner at the bar. - A. I cannot say, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q Upon your so striking that man somewhere near the shoulder, did that man speak to you - A. Yes, I do not think I touched the skin. I left a mark upon the jacket, the man said soldier, do not strike me, I am a man of Deal, and have a small family, I seize him directly, and made him my prisoner, I delivered him over to Serjeant Lamshire.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any doubt whatever that the last firing, by the flash of which you ran to that boat, proceeded from that boat where these three men were. - A. I should think it was, I have no doubt of it, it must be some or one of them, the last firing I think was only one piece discharged at the spot to which I ran.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were the three men to the boat when you came up to them. - A. They were all three in the rear of the boat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You fired all your ammunition, and then drew your sword. A. Yes, I was about twenty yards from the boat from which I saw the flash come, and so far from the Custom house boat.</p>
               <p>Q. The persons that were in the boat could not tell but that it came from the other boat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So there were distinct parties firing on the ground</p>
               <p>Q. You struck some man on the shoulder, and you did not touch his skin, but you think you cut his coat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That man had not any stick. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any ammunition, or guns, or any thing of that sort. - A. No, not about the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the smuggling vessel - A. I did.</p>

He gave me up the man he took, which I supposed to be one of the smugglers, it was very dark but I think it is the prisoner, it is the same man I delivered to Riley, I heard him say to Leonard when he struck him, Soldier, have mercy. I am a man of Deal, and have a small family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you were between these two public houses, the Good Intent and the King's Head you heard a firing, you could not say from whence it came. - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that you did not hear any firing until you came there - A Oh yes, I heard different firing as soon as I came out of the barrack gate before I got to the two public houses, but more when we got between the two public than there were before.</p>

The prisoner put her hand into her bosom as if she wanted to take something out, I took the prisoner into a house in Rupert Street, I put my hand into her bosom, I took out a little bag containing seventeen shillings, two half crowns, and the rest three shilling pieces.

The prisoner came into my place on the Wednesday, between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, she asked me to let her leave the bundle while she went and took a place in the coach, this is the same bundle which Haye took in, the bundle is a shawl, three new handkerchiefs, and a new gown and petticoat.</p>

They are my own gowns, myself bought them, I brought the money from Ireland in my petticoat, I told my mistress if she would not give me two shillings a week, I would part with her, I gave her a week's warning, and then left her, I never saw the inside of the box since I was born.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury the circumstance that I feel it my duty to declare to his honourable court that caused me to do the act: During the last two years of my confinement I felt as happy and comfortable as it was possible for a man in my situation, looking forward to the time that should restore me to my family I have a wife and children. Not hearing from my wife for the last two years, on my enquiring I heard that she had cohabited with another man, and had a child by him, she has since married another man, and is with child by him. A boy of mine was permitted to see me, who told me this about three months ago. Jealousy and rage got the better of me, and finding no rest day or night, I resolved I would make my escape. I did not desire to make the above escape until the above circumstances came to my mind The night the ship was cut I could then come away if I liked. If ever there was a poor fellow deserved pity, I do.</p>
               <p>LIMERICK. He hears a good character with the officer of the hulks, and here is an officer knows of the other man living with his wife.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH HARVEY. I am a laundress at Clements Inn, to Mr. Sandys and Mr. Cousins. The pri- prisoner came on the 28th of October, at half past ten in the morning, he enquired for Mr. Cousins and Mr. Sandys, he told me that he had appointed to meet them there, I told him they were not within, he went away and came about one o'clock on the same day, he enquired if Mr. Cousins had returned, I told him no, he said that he had seen Mr. Cousins, and that he would be there at a quarter past one, he gave me some papers and told me to give them to Mr. Cousins, and he would return directly; I immediately put the papers into the chambers, about a quarter after one the prisoner returned, he enquired if Mr. Cousins had been, I told him no, he said would I return him the papers he gave me, I immediately opened the chamber door and gave the prisoner the papers, the prisoner then said he would wait a little while, I said very well; he walked in and sat down, I came out and left him in the room setting in the chair. I shut the parlour door and the passage door after me, I ran up stairs to my own room, which is over the chambers, and staid there about ten minutes. Mr. Cousins not coming home, I wanted to go of an errand, and being uneasy leaving a stranger in the chambers, I sat on the garret stairs, and on hearing the chamber door go gently, I looked over the bannisters, and saw the prisoner come out of the door with a great bundle under his arm, I immediately ran down stairs after him, and called out stop thief as quick as possible, he dropped the clothes he had under his arms on the last stair case, I immediately stepped over the clothes and followed him through the Inn, and called out stop thief, he was stopped by some gentlemen, who brought him back, he was searched, and these things were found upon him, two shirts, four cravats, they were taken out of his pocket, he was immediately taken to Bow Street. When I pursued the prisoner, I never lost sight of him until he was taken.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PHILLIPS. I am a laundress at Clements Inn. I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran out of my room, and on the second pair of stairs I picked up these clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive any person at your pocket - A. No. I turned round and saw my handkerchief lay in the area of the house; I was passing, a cry of stop thief was raised; I saw a man pass me into Friday-street, I followed him, the man ran very fast, he was stopped before I came up to him. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your handkerchief a silk handkerchief - A. It was, and the value about five shillings. At first the prisoner denied that he had taken it, on the way to the Poultry Compter he seemed agitated, and said he would not do so again.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WILLIAMS. I am a warehouseman in Watling-street. I saw the prisoner and Mr. Haughton in Watling-street, I knew Mr. Haughton; I was on the opposite side of the way; the prisoner and another person was behind Mr. Haughton; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Mr. Haughton's pocket; the instant he took it he found he was detected, he threw it over his head, it went into an area; I do not know whether he saw me; there was a gentleman standing at a door directly opposite where the handkerchief fell. The prisoner run away, and I followed him, his companion was standing near by him at the same time, he did not attempt to run away; he did not run. It was not a minute before the prisoner was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that he was the man that did this act - A. No doubt; he was not out of my sight, only just when he turned round the corner. I came up when he was stopped. I told Mr. Haughton that he was the man that picked his pocket, I would go back and shew him where the handkerchief was. Going to the Compter the prisoner told me that I must mind what I swore to. We had the man that was with him up also, he being a bad character; the grand jury threw the bill out.</p>

            . I am a constable of Uxbridge. I took the prisoners about three hundred yards from Mr. Prior's shop. I met Mr. Prior in the street, he told me that he had been robbed of a pair of high shoes; he described the men, I took them by that description. I searched them, I found a pair of high shoes in Rawbone's pocket; Rawbone said he bought them; Mr. Prior claimed them in the prisoner's presence.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you been that evening - A. At Mr. Paris's the Bee Hive public-house in Nightingale-lane; I came out of the house about a quarter after ten o'clock, I was waiting for some person to go to bed with me at my lodging; I waited outside of the door, an English sailor came down Nightingale-lane, he asked me the way to Plough-court, I directed him; I saw him go as far as Redcross-street, and just as he got to the corner there came the prisoner and three other Portugueze, and Rosella Plunkett, I had seen her before. They came up as far as the Bee Hive door, some words occurred between them and the English sailor; the prisoner wanted to go back to the English sailor; Rosella Plunket appeared to be endeavouring to hold him; the other men had passed me; the prisoner said, d - n your eyes, you English b - r, I ll kick you to hell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that said to by the prisoner - A. To this man that asked me the direction; he was standing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300038"/>still at <placeName id="t18111030-60-crimeloc328">Redcross-street</placeName>

When the sailor heard them words he walked up to the prisoner; the prisoner then went out in the middle of the road, as to what words passed between them I cannot say. The deceased came towards the English sailor and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the deceased before - A. No. The deceased got in between them, and Rosella Plunket sung out, oh, Manuel, do not now; she repeated it, and before she could say it the third time the deceased came to me, and put his hand on my left shoulder, and said, I am stabbed. I put my hand to his left side, my hand was all over blood. I unbottoned his trowsers, and he walked with me as well as he could to Mr. Paris's bar at the Bee Hive.</p>
               <p>Q. When you unbuttoned the waistband of his trowsers did you perceive any thing - A. Yes, it was just at the hip bone. When we came into the Bee Hive the deceased called for a glass of spirits; Mr. Paris said, you have got plenty of spirits running away from you, you do not want any. The deceased remained in the house, we went for a doctor, but could not get one. Some more of us joined together and took him up to a doctor's in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him - A. Yes, and then I took a watchman with me and went to Mr. Bolingbroke's public-house, the prisoner was there and Rosella, I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself saw no blow whatever made, did you - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear the deceased's name - A. I did. On the Wednesday I went in the hospital, I saw him, he was then dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long was it after that you went to Bolingbroke's and caused the prisoner to be taken up - A. About twenty minutes or half an hour. I had been to the doctor's first.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in the public-house smoking his pipe - A. No, he was standing at the bar, and Rosella was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this - A. Rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the deceased at the time that you supposed he received the mischief - A. I have paced it since with eighteen long steps.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you say there was the prisoner, the deceased, the English sailor, Rosella, and the other men close to him - A. Yes, about as far from him as I am to you.</p>
               <p>Q. These three men, were they close together or parted - A. A little distance from each other, and Rosella close to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. You went for a doctor, you could not find one, and when you came back you found in the house the English sailor that you have been speaking of - A. Yes, he went with me and the deceased to the doctor's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got him to the doctor's shop you found he was very bad indeed - A. Yes, and then we thought it was best to take him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which the English sailor went away, saying, he would fetch a coach to take him to the hospital, and he never brought any coach, or ever come back again - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen either of these three Portuguese since - A. I have seen one, but at that time these three men went away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES. I am a seaman. I was coming up Nightingale-lane about a quarter past ten, I heard a woman say, oh, Manuel, do not do that; Walker was with me; we made the best of our way up to where the noise was; I saw a man running towards the Bee Hive door, he came out of the road, he said, I am stabbed; we took him into the Bee Hive, Tandy was there at the time. We assisted him when he said he was stabbed; he put his hand upon the bar and asked for a glass of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came running out of the road you saw some other people there at the time - A. Yes, four or five where he run from, who they were I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- WALKER. I am a seaman, I was with Jones in Nightingale-lane, I heard a woman's voice say, Manuel, do not do that. Afterwards I heard a man sing out, I am stabbed; he came from out of the road, and where the man came from there were four or five in company, who they were I cannot say.

             came to me at a quarter past ten, and told me that there was a man stabbed; I went with him and took charge of the prisoner, and brought him to the watchhouse. The next morning at half past three I picked up this knife by Nightingale-lane, about twenty yards from the Bee Hive.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLSON. I am a surgeon in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home on the night of this Sunday did you find the deceased laying in your shop - A. Yes, about eleven o'clock. Upon examining him I found a wound upon the left hip, which I dressed; there was a considerable quantity of blood on the floor, his clothes was likewise wet with blood; I found him to be very low and very fast declining; I ordered him to be sent to the hospital, he said his name was Douglas, he was a Scotchman; I asked him if he should know the person that had stabbed him if he saw him. He gave me no account of the person.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHAMBAUD. I am a pupil at the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the night was it when the deceased was brought to the hospital - A. Near twelve o'clock. I observed a wound upon the left hip, there was no hemorrhage at that time, though there appeared to have been some, from the appearance of his shirt. I dressed the wound and ordered him to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300039"/>put to bed; the next day his body was examined; he died between one and two on Monday morning; there was a wound on the hip, it passed from the hip into the cavity of the belly; the wound divided two large arteries, it wounded one intestine, and part of another, the wound was three or four inches or more in depth, it appeared to be a penetrating wound, it appeared to have been done with a stab, it did not appear to have been done with a triangular instrument. There is no doubt the man died with the stab.</p>
               <p>ROSELLA PLUNKETT. I was so intoxicated at the time I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 25th of last month the prisoner was brought to us at Union Hall, I charged the prisoner, Catherine Burke, with the robbery; she told me that she knew nothing of the robbery, that her name was Conner. I told her I had seen her tried so often by that name I was sure of it. I kept her in custody.</p>

The prosecutor has got a key to the chest and this prosecutrix another; she took the things out to pawn, and I gave her a shilling a week to fetch them out of pawn. There were some words passed between us, she swore she would send me over the water. This woman that she has brought against me knows nothing about it; she is a common prostitute in the streets, and she would go twenty miles for a glass of gin; she knows it is false what she has sworn against me.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a lodger - A. Yes, I have the two lower rooms. She came about ten o'clock in the morning. I intended to keep her that night if she would stop; my husband went to bed about ten o'clock, my son went to bed soon afterwards. A woman that washed for me delivered my clothes about nine o'clock, they lay upon two chairs in the kitchen; the prisoner and me sat talking till near eleven o'clock, I told her she might sleep with me, and she wanted to stop to smoke some tobacco; I went to bed and went to sleep, I left her smoking; she was to have laid with me. My son got up about four o'clock to go a milking; I said where is Sally; he said she is gone, and the clothes were gone. I found her about half after ten at night on Michaelmas day. I sent for a constable, and she made off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again - A. No.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY DWYER. I am the son of the last witness. I went to bed about ten o'clock at night, I got up about four in the morning to go for my milk, I found the door open, and the things gone. We made every enquiry, we could not find the prisoner until Michaelmas day, I found her at Mr. Morris's public-house, Great Saffron hill, I told the girl to go for an officer, and while I was speaking to the girl she ran out of the front door; I pursued her and stopped her by Hatton Wall.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to me, I searched her, and found nothing relating to this property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Mrs. Dwyer's house, she was in liquor, we had seven shillings worth of drink, beer and gin; we continued drinking; a woman brought in some washing and laid it on the table. After Mr. Dwyer and his son had gone to bed a tall woman in a black gown was there. Mrs. Dwyer sent me for two pots of beer before the public-house shut up. I left her and this woman about half after eleven at night.</p>

               <p>Q.Was Stephen Read in your employment lately - A. He was a hat stiffener in our employ. We searched Read's premises and found a hat finished fit for wear; in consequence of that we had Read taken up and tried at Union-hall, and Mr. Hanks went with a constable to Lowe's house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HANKS. I am a hatter, I reside at No. 6, Broad Wall, Blackfriars-road.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an apprentice of the name of George - A. Yes. On the 17th of August I went with George and Cooper to Mr. Lowe's house in Ratcliffe Highway, he is a retailer of hats; I went into the shop, I said, Mr. Lowe, you have been buying hats in an unsaleable state of my apprentice, I am given to understand; he said he did not know that he had; I said you have bought of my apprentice yesterday, and I demand a sight of the hats, as the goods were stolen; we asked where the goods were; he said, they were backwards; the constable and he went into the workshop behind, and brought the goods into the shop; his wife then came into the shop; she said, for God's sake, what is the matter; the prisoner was so struck he could not answer; I told her that the goods that Mr. Lowe bought yesterday were stolen goods; she said, the Lord forbid, and then said to my apprentice, you wicked wretch, you knew the goods were stolen, how could you bring these things to my husband, and distress me in the manner you are a doing. The constable took the goods and told Lowe he must go with us to Union-hall I believe; he was taken to Union-hall. While I was in the coach I said, Mr. Lowe, these are good goods for the money; he said he thought he had given sufficient, he thought the hats were covered with hares wool. At Union-hall George was asked how many hats he had sold to Mr. Low, he said eight; Mr. Lowe was asked, he said he had purchased eight. We took four first and nine more in the afternoon. They were unfinished unstiffened hats, eight of them, and four were trimmed up ready for wear.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it part of the retailers business to stiffen hats - A. It is not common.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the selling price of these hats in this state - A. I should expect sixteen shillings, because we are liable to a discount of five per cent.</p>
               <p>Q. What did these hats cost the manufacturer - A. Without they know the materials that they are made of they cannot tell within a shilling or two: it is the worst state that a hat can be sold. I do not suppose I could manufacture them under thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in these hats to see if there were any marks - A. The marks were D O.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In the same state in which these hats were a person might be deceived two or three shillings - A. They might be two shillings in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not occur to you that a little maker may sell at times under the price - A. Very often; they never sell to a maker.</p>
               <p>Q. They would sell to a person that kept a shop - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mr. Lowe's you found a workshop behind his selling shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He is himself a hat-maker and hat-seller, and therefore is himself competent to do any work to the making a hat - A. So I am informed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you that he had been buying hats of your apprentice did not he say he did not know he was your apprentice, or any apprentice - A. I believe them are his words. I do not believe that Mr. Lowe or Mrs. Lowe from what they said, knew any thing of their being stolen hats.</p>

               <p>Q. You know something of the business of a hatter, I believe - A. I am a hatter by trade. I found these hats under the stall-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there in that part of the premises the necessaries for stiffening - A. Yes, to make shift to do it in a very small way indeed. It is not usual for hat-makers to sell them dyed and unstiffened, they are so likely to become damaged in the dye, they generally sell them in the grey. We found at Mr. Lowe's nine hats in all, four dyed and unfinished, and five finished, besides the four that were produced at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Plank. You went with Lammond and George to the house of the prisoner - A. I did, I was present when these nine hats were found. The hats are our property.</p>

             the man who was tried at Horsemonger Jail - A. Yes, he told me to take them to Mr. Lowe's house to sell them, and to ask ten shillings, to take what I could get for them, and to bring the money to him, he was to satisfy me for going with them. I went with the hats to Mr. Lowe's, he was not at home; I left the hats there till the next day, and on the next day I went into the shop, I saw Mr. Lowe; I told Mr. Lowe that I had left four hats that a young man had sent me with; he asked me his name, I told him Read; he looked at the hats and said nine shillings were as much as they were worth, he thought they were covered with hares wool; he gave me thirty-six shillings for the four. This was two months before I was taken up. I gave the money to Read, he gave me five shillings for my trouble. About two or three days before I was taken up Read left four more hats at my lodgings for me to take to Mr. Lowe's. I went to Mr. Lowe's, I told him I had brought four more hats for sale; he looked at them and said, nine shillings was what he gave me before. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300042"/>gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he upon this occasion ask you where the hats came from - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you were before before the magistrate at Union-hall did you say that you mentioned the name of Read to him - A. No; at Union-hall I did not say that I told him that Read sent me. (The copy of the Conviction of Stephen Read read.)</p>

I am the clerk of the warehouse at Paddington. In about two hours afterwards they were delivered to Cowdall our carman; the truss was directed to Mr. Daniel, the truss was numbered, and the weight mark upon it, half a hundred and twelve pounds; I say it put in the cart and delivered to Cowdall; I afterwards saw it at the magistrates office on the same day; that was the same truss.</p>

On the 18th of October I received a truss out of their warehouse directed to Mr. Daniel, No. 572; it was put in my cart on the top of of the goods, on the off-side of the cart. When I was in Berner-street delivering goods I was obliged to leave the cart. Downe met me as I was coming out of a door, from his information I looked in the cart and saw Mr. Daniel's package was gone; I and Downe pursued Wilks and Ragan, we came up to them in Hollis-street, Wilks had the truss on his shoulder, I laid hold of him, asked him what he did with the truss and told him it was taken out of my cart; he said a man gave him a shilling to carry it for him; I told Downe to take Ragan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ragan a man at that time - A. I did not perceive it. Ragan said he did not know Wilks, he had never seen him before. I put the truss in a public-house, I knew it to be the same truss that I had in my cart. The prisoners were taken to Marlborough-street-office.</p>

On the 18th of October, in the afternoon, I was in Wardour-street, I saw the prisoner Ragan, he had a truss in his arms; I gave information to Cowdall; we pursued him into Holly-street, we there saw both the prisoners, Ragan was about five or six yards from Wilks, Wilks then had the truss on his shoulder; Cowdall took Wilks and the truss, Ragan ran away, he did not appear lame at that time, he ran near as fast as I did. They were both apprehended and taken to Marlborough-street office.</p>

I gave the alarm to Cowdall when he came out of the house.</p>

No, unless in consideration of the salary I receive; I have an accompting-house in the workhouse, it has two windows looking into the yard, they are fastened by a spring-latch. I had about twenty shillings in penny-pieces and fifteen shillings in paper by the side of them, in the accompting-house, I missed twenty shillings of penny pieces, Malpas, one of the boys acknowledged the theft, and Heath finding that Malpas had acknowedged it, he came to me and said he would show me where the penny pieces were; he took me to a hole under the stone stair case, he said it was hid there, he could not exactly tell where, a boy of the name of Evans had hid them; Evans came and pulled a great many penny pieces out of a hole, apparently like a rat-hole, to the amount of sixteen or seventeen shillings. The prisoner said that he got up himself about one o'clock on the Sunday morning, and broke the accompting-house window, Malpas was with him, they got in and and took the penny-pieces away from a cupboard of mine in the accompting-house; he told me he had done so repeatedly. He is a pauper in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What could induce the boy to tell you this - A. Finding that Malpas had confessed it. I told Malpas if he would tell who it was he should not be hurt if he told me the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Malpas go and tell him - A. No; a gentleman took him of oneside while I examined Heath. These are the penny-pieces that Evans took out of the hole by the direction of Heath.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMBLIN. I am one of the overseers. I found thirty-penny pieces in the ward in which the prisoner slept.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I should not have taken them if I had victuals enough; I was obliged to buy victuals every day.</p>

On the 2d of September a shopmate of mine and two of his friends came to see me; we spent the evening together; a little before nine he said he must go home; he asked me to go with him a little way; I said I did not mind.

Ashby drawed the coat off my arm, and by drawing it off the lining came outside. The watchman came up and asked what was the matter, and wished us to disperse; we did; I looked round and Ashby was gone; we got intelligence which way she was gone; I went home. In the morning I went to Queen-square, and gave a description of Ashby, we took her in Pie-street, Westminster, we found my coat and waistcoat at the pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you say about the other woman - A. The other woman pawned the coat; I never saw her till the morning we went to take her.</p>
               <p>- M'GUIRR. Q. Were you of this party - A. Yes. In the Haymarket we met the prisoner, she asked us to give her some gin; we did. This young man ran against a man by accident, the man struck him with a stick in his face; he pulled his coat off one arm to defend himself, the prisoner pulled it off the other arm; the watchman interfered and wanted us to disperse, we did. I had seen Ashby with his coat, we looked for her and could not find her.</p>

I asked him how long he had been on the premises, he said, about twenty minutes or half an hour, My fellow-servant got up, and we took him into the lodge. We looked about the premises, there are a great many things deposited in the area of the kitchen; we found a copper saucepan, and an iron pot taken from there and put into the gravel walk; a shovel was brought from the piggery and set against the front gates; he had opened the straw-house, and left the doors wide open, and the hogs got in; and the windows of the lower part of the house had been throwed up, but being so strongly barred no person could make any entrance. We then took him to the watchhouse. The pots not being taken off the premises we did not think it would be wanted.</p>

            , we have the whole house. On Sunday the 27th of October, at eight o'clock we went out, and returned home at twelve o'clock, and when we came home we could not open the door, the lock was stiff, we were obliged to get the watchman to open it, it is an old lock, it does not open very easy. We got the watchman to light us, the first thing I saw when I went in was the parlour door open, I looked up at the mantle piece for the time piece, it was gone, I had left the time piece on the mantle piece in the front parlour when I went out. I went into the back room, I found the money and the notes box gone from out of a drawer in the bedstead, three five-pound notes and four one pound Bank notes, and two pair of gold ear rings, and a plain gold ring, and a breast pin, were taken away, I went into the front parlour, there were three silver tea spoons taken out of the cupboard, I have seen all the things since.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the persons get in. - A. By the cellar door, it is a bad bolt. I saw all these things before I went out, and when I returned they were all gone.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 28th, I received information of the house, No. 21, Oxford Market, being broken open, I went and searched the premises, and found where they got in, the prisoner Burne was active in shewing us the place, he is a relation of the prosecutrix, we concluded that it could not be any one but what well knew the premises and knew where the property was, Burne seemed very much flurried. Limerick told me to go and ask the prosecutrix who he was, I went and asked the prosecutrix, we then accused Burne of it, saying that we had great suspicion that he either knew who it was, or had had concern in it himself, he denied it, we told him that we were sure he was concerned in the robbery, and that we should take him in custody, he then said it was not him, but he knew who it was that did it, it was two soldiers that belonged to the West London militia, and a young man of the name of Tibbett, he said he partly knew where they were, he would go and shew us where they were in the city. We then came into Bunhill Row, Burne went into several houses they were not there, he went into one house, they said they had not been gone above half an hour; he then said he supposed they were gone to the Bricklayer's Arms, in South-Molton Street, where Tibbett was to meet him in the afternoon to divide the property; we then went into Oxford Market to the prosecutor's house, there he wished to see the prosecutor, they went up stairs, Limerick followed the prosecutor and Burne, - when they came down again the prosecutor, Burne and Limerick, and I, went into Grovesnor market, we went into a house, Burne and Limerick went down into the kitchen, and Burne brought up some notes in his hand, we counted them over, there were two fives and two ones, he then said if you come along with me to the Bricklayer's Arms in South Molton Street, we shall have the remainder part of the property; we went there, and was there near half an hour, when Tibbett came in, Burne asked him to drink, they drank together, and went out, and Limerick followed them, they got some distance, Burne turned back and said, come along, you shall have the other part of the property; we then went into New Court, Fleet Lane, Fleet market, we went into a garret where there were presses, they were book binders, and under some paper shavings Tibbett produced this time piece, three silver spoons, a breast pin, two pair of ear rings, a gold ring, a silver tooth pick, and a horn box, and a small article or two that are not mentioned in the indictment. We brought them to the office, and took them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they got in. - A. The way they got in was at the cobler's stall, the kitchen was being repaired, they took the wainscot away and got into the cellar, they got into the back window, up one pair of stairs, the prosecutor found the back window open,</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutrix.) This window is up one pair of stairs, was that up or down when you went away. - A. It was down, not fastened, we found it up a little way, it was quite shut down when I left it, when they got into the yard, there is a shed that goes up to this window, we saw the foot marks where they got in at the window.</p>

            . I went in company with Read to 21, Oxford Market, to look at the house that had been broken open, we went in, Burne was there present, he shewed us all about the place, we went into the cellar, it was dark, I said to Burne go up and get us a light, he did, he seemed a great deal alarmed at the time, I told Read to go and ask who he was, he brought back word that he was a relation, and had been out of work six months, I then had a strong suspicion of him, we went up stairs, I told him I should take him in custody concerning the robbery, he said he had not done it himself, it was three others; he said there were three men that had done the robbery he could give us information where the things were; he said it was two soldiers and one Tibbett, we went in company with him to Bunhill Row, we could not find the three men, he said most likely they would meet him at the Bricklayer's Arms, he pressed very hard to see the prosecutor, we took him to the prosecutor, he wanted to see him privately in a room, I told him I had him in custody, I could not grant any such thing, without being present at the time. He went up stairs, he asked the prosecutrix if he was to bring back all the things would she hurt him, she said she could not say any thing to it, it was gone too far; we went up to Grovenor market, where his mother and he lodged, he went down into the kitchen and produced these two five pound notes, he said these were a part of the notes that he had taken, he owned to changing one of the ones, he said he had three, and that is all that he had received, two fives and three ones, there were three fives lost. We went with him to the Bricklayer's Arms, in South Moulton Street, we waited there about half an hour, and Tibbett came in, they drank together, and he beckoned him out, Tibbett made answer to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300046"/>him, you are in a hurry. They went out, they had got about half way down the street, they called to us, we were very near to them, and Tibbett said to us, if you have all the things it shall be all right, I said that rested with the magistrate; we went straight on to New Court, Tibbett went up and brought the remainder of the property, when we came to the office before the magistrate, they confessed the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them sign this. - A. I did, and I saw the magistrate sign it. That is my hand writing. I saw both the prisoners sign it, it was read over to both of them.</p>

            . Q. You live opposite do you. - A. Yes, in High Street, Shadwell. On the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve, I saw the prisoner go into the shop, she took something off the chair that stood opposite of the door, and by her concealing it I supposed that she stole it, she was by herself. I went over and gave information of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARTRIDGE. These are the articles, they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>- BLISS. Thy are Mr. Stephens' property, of the value of between three and four pound. Mr. Stephens has no partner, he has the whole house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman met me at the shop door, she said she would give me a shilling to carry the bundle, I was glad to earn a shilling. I did not know that they were stolen, or else I would not have had any thing to do with it.</p>

A lady came into the shop to settle a bill, in the mean while the prisoner walked away with the goose. I received information that he had taken it, and in about ten minutes the prisoner walked by my shop without the goose, I immediately collared him and took him into New Street and enquired where his lodgings were, we found his room and the goose in his room, he is a near neighbour of mine As we were going to the watch-house he begged for mercy, and said he did it for distress. I am sure he is the man, and I am sure it was my goose, it was a grey goose, I bought it particularly large for a publican to have for dinner.</p>

I told the prisoner Mr. Goodwin wanted to speak to him. I walked him by the shop to see if they knew him, they all came out and said that was the man. We went into his room, and there was the goose on the table, the landlady of the house said it was his room.</p>

I could not go to serve her immediately, she walked towards the door, I lost her all in a minute, and the same time I missed a piece of flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again. - A. Part of it. I ran to the door, she was gone out of sight, we found out where she lived. I applied to Bow Street Office. I had a warrant, she lived in Great Earl Street, the officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300048"/>mark to it, the other part she had made away with.

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to No. 30, Great Earl Street. I went up stairs and enquired for the prisoner, she came out. I saw her tucking up something under the bed, I asked her what she was doing there, she said what is that to you. I got a light from the next room, I took these two pieces of flannel from between the bed and the sacking, she had a number of halfpence, and she was rather in liquor, she denied taking it, or knowing any thing about it. This is the flannel.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my flannel, we found about a couple of yards. I can swear to it by my mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the gentleman's shop for silk and thread, that I used for shoe binding, I met a man that came out of the shop, that used it for haberdashery to sell again, he said hold this bit of flannel until I came back, he did not come back. I took it home. When the officer came he said where is the flannel, I said here it is. I thought it was the man that gave it me.</p>

On the 29th of October, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, she asked to look at some muslin, I shewed her some, she purchased half a quarter of a yard, it came to threepence three farthings, after I had served her I doubled the wrapper over, and put the wrapper behind her in its place. I then went to the till to get change for sixpence, and on my coming to her again, I saw her stoop down as if apparently forcing something up her petticoats. I could see nothing whatever, my suspicions were aroused, I took the wrapper again, and on my turning again, she was stooping down the same as before. I looked over the wrapper, but being confused I could not miss any particular article that time, she was then going out of the shop, not liking to tax her with a theft until I had looked over the wrapper. I called to her and said I had a bargain in the wrapper that I would sell her cheap, and while I was looking over the wrapper, she stooped the third time, and slowly took up two pieces of muslin, and placed them on the counter, the muslins were as smooth as if in the wapper, not tumbled in the least. I then jumped over the counter, took her by the arm and sent for an officer. From the appearance of the muslin, they had never been on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. And because they had not been on the ground, you suppose she had taken them. - A. Yes. I had my eye upon her the whole of the time, her countenance changed. I observed her take and put them on the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only wanted a bit of muslin to go over my caps. I saw it lay on the ground, when I stooped down to pick my pattens up.</p>

I stopped some time, I had not been there above half an hour before the officer asked me if I had lost my handkerchief. I saw the box lay on the ground at the same time, the officer picked it up, it is a paper painted snuff box, worth sixpence. I told the officer I missed my handkerchief, it is worth two shillings, the officer shewed me the handkerchief, I knew it to be mine. Two officers had hold of the prisoner at the time.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WESTBROOK. I am a constable. Mr. Essleby and I were in the Park together, on the 23d of October, there were a great many people looking at the engines, we saw Mr. Brown in the crowd, we were watching the prisoner for half an hour. we knew the man that was with him, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Brown's pocket trying to get the handkerchief out of Brown's pocket, the handkerchief was half way out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so when you first saw Mr. Brown. - A. No, when first I saw Mr. Brown, I could not see that he had a handkerchief in his pocket. The handkerchief had been drawn out of his pocket by the man who was with the prisoner, the prisoner went up and took the handkerchief out, I directly collared him, and took the handkerchief out of his hand immediately, some person picked up the snuff box. I believe it was my brother officer. I held the handkerchief up and said who had lost a handkerchief, Mr. Brown claimed it. I am quite sure that Mr. Brown's pocket, was the pocket from whence I saw it taken. Mr. Brown claimed the snuff box too. The prisoner said he was very sorry for it, he did it out of distress, we took him to Bow Street. The mob gathered round so very soon the other man absconded.</p>
               <p>JOHN ESSLEBY. I belong to Bow Street. I was in the park, and knowing of Westbrook I joined him, I saw Mr. Brown in the crowd, he was near the Dukes of York, Kent, and Cambridge. I saw the prisoner with another attempting several gentleman's pockets, that induced us to watch. I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of Mr. Brown's pocket, in drawing the handkerchief this snuff box fell to the ground from the pocket, we both seized the prisoner at the same time. Westbrook took the handkerchief out of his hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been to bed. - A. No. I was perfectly sober. I had been to see a person home, that was not capable of seeing himself home. I had been spending my evening at Paddington, till twelve o'clock, from there I went to see my friend home, in Crown Street, it was then about two o'clock</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be two hours coming from Crown Street into Oxford Street, how many minutes would that take a man that was not drunk. - A. If I must speak I was coming up Oxford Steeet when I met this woman. I had been at a watering house in Oxford Street, by St. Giles's, from there I went up to my home, I found I could not get in, then I went into a market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the women in your way. - A. I saw the woman in Oxford Street. I had then a crown, a half crown, a three shilling piece, and two shillings in my pocket. This woman asked me to give her something to drink, I went to the Watering House, Oxford Road. I went afterwards towards my home as far as a market, I forgot the name of the market. I there lost my money out of my breeches pocket. I fell asleep in a cart while the woman was with me. Taylor is a watchman, he came and awoke me in the market.</p>
               <p>Q. You fell asleep in the cart in an open market, any body else might have stolen it. - A. The money was taken out of the watchman's pocket.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WAKEMAN I am a watchman, in South Molton Street. Hart and Fox passed me about four o'clock in the morning, he was intoxicated, they went up towards Grosvenor Market. I saw them in a passage about ten minutes, they were talking together. I saw the woman afterwards, she said she had left Fox sleeping in a cart. I went and awoke him, he said he had been robbed, I told him he should keep better company. We went to Taylor's box, we found Hart in Taylor's box. We took her to the watch-house, Taylor followed, they were both searched, on Hart was found nine-pence halfpenny, and upon Taylor a crown piece, half a crown, and two shillings.</p>

               <p>for me to or three yards off the prosecutor's door, we went with the prisoner to his place, we asked him for the key, he said he had not got it, I had the door broken open, this was between seven and eight at night, on the 15th of October, we went in and found the bed under the soot, wrapped up in the cloths that he puts before the chimnies, I took the prisoner, and the bed was taken away: before we found the bed he said he knew nothing of it, and after we found it, he said he did not steal it. This is the bed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This bed was under my care for sale, it is worth twenty shillings.</p>

I had been drinking at the Swan public house, and on my returning to my lodging, I observed the bed in the road, I took it up there being no one near, in the morning I went out for the purpose of enquiring whose it was, and also to my labour; - when I was informed by my neighbours that there was a search warrant, and in going to my lodgings it was found there. I am perfectly innocent of the charge, and ignorant how it came in the road, I took it in my place for safety.</p>

               <p>CHARLES COOK. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner up stairs at a gin shop, in St. John Street. Dalwin said she was the woman that had taken his pocket-book, she was very much intoxicated at the time, she said she bought these things with part of the money. I searched her and found only a shilling and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, the awful predicament I now stand in, has so agitated my mind and worked upon my feelings, that I have scarce power to appear before your lordships and this honourable court. On the night of the 9th of October, I in company with my sister were met by the prosecutor between two and three in the afternoon, he said we should have something to drink, we went into the house at the corner of Golden Lane, during the time we were drinking in the house, the brother of the prosecutor came in, we left this house and went to the Britannia, we all were drinking freely. I and my sister went home to fetch my bonnet, to go to Sadlers Wells, it being full we could not get in, we went to the John of Jerusalem, the prosecutor took his watch and his book out of his pocket. I put it in my bosom, I kept it safe, the prosecutor requested me to go home with him, finding myself unwell I returned him his book and his watch and went home.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor.) Did you lose your watch. - A. I never had it out of my pocket.</p>

            . I live with my aunt. On the 25th of September I served the prisoner and another with a quartern of gin, when the prisoner went out I thought I heard the measure and the glass jingle in her pocket. I went to see if it was in the tap room, it was gone. I went out and told the prisoner that she had the glass and measure, she said she had not got it. I went to pull her in doors, she offered me the glass, I refused it, then she took out the measure and threw it down and the glass after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she drunk or sober. - A. She did not appear to be drunk. This is the measure, and this is part of the glass, it is my aunt's property.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August last did you work for the prisoner Pollard. - A. Yes, he is a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his shop. - A. In the two pair of stairs in John's Court, Handy Street, Oxford Street. The prisoner Rippen lodged in the same house in the one pair of stairs, Pollard keeps the house. In the middle of August I was in Pollard's Parlour, Pollard was reading the newspaper, he saw these things advertised, and said,</p>
               <p>"they have got a good booty," I made answer,</p>
               <p>"I think they have." Then the week following Mrs. Rippen came down several times and asked what such stones and such ear-rings were worth. Then after she came down and made these enquiries, then Pollard sent for the same newspaper, and on his reading the same paper she said,</p>
               <p>"I think these things are up stairs." Then on the Saturday night following Mrs. Rippen brought down an amethyst stone and a heart-blood stone, and an amethyst broach, there were nobody else in the parlour but me and Mrs. Pollard, Mr. Pollard came in at the time, he said they were the finest stones that ever he had seen in his life, and then I saw the amethyst broach was crack'd at one end of it, Mrs. Rippen asked Pollard what these things were worth, Pollard said the blood stone was worth a pound, and the others were very good, he could not say what they were worth. Then on the Sunday morning I was up in the shop, I saw several of the sittings of diamond rings broken up, and I saw some stones I had seen the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see an antique head in a ring. - A. Yes, and I saw a gold lockit with a snake round it with diamond eyes, when it opened the inside opened in the shape of an heart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the amethyst stone. - A. Pollard was taking the ring out of the heart, and in taking the ring out of the heart, it broke the stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Pollard did with the antique ring. - A. I saw the stone, he had it reset.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the blood stone. - A.Rippen waited in the shop while I did it, he had it to wear it as a broach in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any sitting of a miniature picture. - A. Yes, I had it, that was among the other things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were journeyman to the prisoner at the time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What reward are you to have for giving evidence to-day. - A. Nothing, I have been offered something by Pollard's brother not to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to a magistrate. - A. No, I never went to a magistrate till they took me with Pollard and Rippen, I was taken in Pollard's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave no account of this transaction until you were taken upon the charge as a prisoner. - A. No. I did not know they were stolen. I did not know whose they were, Mr. Isaacs bought the pearl head piece and the gold locket with the snake round it, some loose diamonds and the beads to match the head piece, and beads for a necklace, for which Isaac's gave eight pound five shillings, as Pollard told me.</p>

On the evening of the 27th I looked in the prisoner's drawer, I found five or six sheets of proof paper, I shewed it to Mr. Scott and then replaced it in the drawer the same as I found it, on the next morning, Saturday, the prisoner came to work sooner than usual. I then stated to him that I believed we should have something to do on the Sunday, so that if I had occasion to call upon him I might know where to find him, he gave me No. 3, Bull's Head Court, Peter Street, Saffron Hill. After the prisoner was gone to breakfast I looked in the drawer again, and found the paper gone from the drawer. The work that he was upon I counted out and missed fifty or sixty sheets out of about three thousand five hundred. I obtained a search warrant and went to his lodgings that he had described. I searched the lodgings on the Saturday afternoon, and found the six sheets that I had found on the over evening, it was hanging upon a line to dry, it had been wetted fit for work. I found also a quire of royal paper, which was part of the paper that he was at work, and part of that I had missed. I found some sheets of printed paper, some sheets of what I was printing of Blairs Sermons, and some sheets of the Monthly Review. This is the property that we found. I am certain that the paper is the property of Mr. Strahan and Mr. Preston.</p>

I kept the prisoner in my eye, then in about five minutes after the prisoner walked past the window with something in his apron, which he endeavoured to conceal. I was some distance, I saw before he got out of the yard that what he was carrying appeared to be a great weight. I suspected one of the pieces of lead was gone, there were eight pieces of lead in the hall. I had seen them about ten minutes before in the hall, they had been sent in the night before. I sent my child for my husband, and watched the way the prisoner went, the other man went off first.</p>

I pursued the prisoner and overtook him, he had the lead in a leather apron carrying it on his shoulder, I collared him, he resisted three or four minutes, the lead dropped in the scuffle, and then he begged of me to let him go, that I did not do. I left the lead in Mr. Wilds shop, opposite of whose house I took him, I took the prisoner to the watch-house. I am certain there were eight pieces of lead in the hall. I went to look in the hall before I pursued him, and one was gone. I have the lead in my care. This is the apron it was tied up in, and this is the lead.</p>

I found the things safe in my box, I locked the box and took the key up to the landlord; I returned on the Monday morning; I slept at my mothers; I went up stairs for the key, the landlord was out, I found the key on the table, I took it, and went into the room; when I came back the prisoner was gone.

               <p>MR. STEPHENS. I was there present in this old iron shop at the time.</p>

On the 25th of December, the prisoner and another man came in and asked for pudding; I told them I did not sell it; they went out and came in again, and asked for two ounces of ham, they said they must toss up for it; they tossed the money under the scale, and went out; they came in again and said they must have two ounces more, they must toss up for it; the prisoner throwed a halfpenny the other side of the counter, and asked me to pick it up; I said no, that may go for the ham; the prisoner said no, pick it up. I stooped to pick it up, in the mean while the ham was taken away; I said, a thief has stolen my ham; the other man said, I will soon have him, and ran out; I locked the door and kept the prisoner in.</p>

I was in the auction-room that night, there were two blunderbusses in a drawer; I looked at this blunderbuss, and as I was going to lay it down the prisoner said, it seems to be a good one; I said, it is; he took it and kept it in his hand. I went across the room, and looked to see what he did with it; in a minute or two after he walked off with it; I made an alarm, some of the people went after him.</p>

When we had taken a fourth I came up again and missed the barrel cask; I asked Mrs. Farrol if she knew the men; she said she knew one of the men, they had a quartern of gin, and left me to pay for it. I know no more of the men than what I have told you. She told me they were gone into Castle-street, and it was Mr. Atkinson's dray in Cannon-street. I went there and asked the prisoner what business he had with the cask; he said he had no cask belonging to me; I told him it was my cask, it had Mr. Buckley's name on it; I told him I should get an officer; I did, and when I came with the officer the cask was put on my dray.</p>

This was on the 30th; he said he had purchased it a fortnight back of a man in Smithfield, and had given fifteen shillings for it; I told him it was my property, and could he bring forward the man that he he said no; I shut the gates and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300059"/>went for an officer for the prisoners.</p>

               <p>MR. BERRY. I am a coach broker. About the 8th of October I sold a pair of wheels, and an axletree to the prosecutor. On the 30th he told me that his cart was finished, and that he had had it stolen; he told me to stop it if I should see it offered for sale. While he was talking the elder prisoner brought the axle-tree; I believe it to be the same axle-tree, it has been in the fire since.</p>

The prisoner returned, said she could get no porter, and said, I had better stop with her to-night; I said I was short of silver; she said, never mind that, you can see me another time. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket; she said, what property you have about you is safe with me. We went to bed. About three o'clock I awoke and found the prisoner gone, and the property likewise. I came down stairs, and met the patrol, the landlord of the house, he opened the door to come in, he said, who are you; I said I had lost my watch, and gave him my address. In a few days I got information, and took the prisoner.</p>

She first came with another woman's husband, about the latter end of March, I let the lodgings to them both at first, the man left the lodging, and then she had it, and agreed to pay me four shillings and sixpence a week for it, she paid me regular for a time, there were five weeks due when she left me, she went away without giving me any notice whatever, but sent me a letter. I knew of the blanket being gone at that time. She came again, and left me without notice. There were two genteel women that she brought into my house about August, and when I accused her of taking my things, she said she had taken them through distress, I said that could not be, because she had been tipsey. She left my lodging on the 1st October, I found her the next day in Market Lane, and the duplicates was found upon her.</p>

On the night of the 26th, a little after one in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Drury Lane, I searched them, and found a great many different sort of buckles belonging to harnesses, and leather, they said they had cut them off different coaches, they hoped I would forgive them. Darvell came up to our office about some ten pound notes, I told him that I had some buckles, these are them.</p>

            . I keep the sign of the George in Drury Lane. I am the landlord of this man, before ever he went out of the house this book contained fifty-four pounds, that was between seven and eight o'clock, he was about half seas over, this woman was an entire stranger in the house, she came in and called for half a pint of ale, I saw him leave the house in company with the woman. The next day the master of the house came down to me. I saw the prosecutor about nine o'clock the next morning. Donaldson gave me this book, it contains seven ones and a two, the four tens and the five were taken from this book, he charged this woman with robbing him, and this woman declared just now that she heard nothing from the prisoner about her swallowing them, they were taking water up stairs to make this woman's emetic operate. I know that he had fifty-four pound when he left my house, and on the next day he had only nine left. The prisoner in jail sent to the prosecutor telling him that she had voided the notes, and they was as sound and good as ever they were; and when they went she said he had come too late, a prisoner that is under transportation had robbed her of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this man in Drury Lane, he asked me to go and have two pots of porter with him, and then I went to his landlords and had some ale, and after that we went into a public house Covent Garden. I left him and saw him again. I went to bed in this house with him, in the morning he said you have picked my pocket, and he said if you do not give it me I will rip you open. I alarmed the house, this good woman came up stairs, a constable was sent for, they took off all my clothes and searched me. I am not guilty at all, and as to swallow a note I never said so, nor did I do it.</p>

            . I am a publican. In consequence of information I went to the prisoner's house, 23, Tower Street, Seven Dials. I was informed there were four dozen pots there the day before. We told him we come to look for stolen pots. I went to the place where he kept the pots, I found one pewter pint pot, and 107 lb weight of pewter, all in cakes, there is the rim of a pot on one of the cakes, he denied at first that were any pots, and when we found the pot and the pewter he said he was a collecter, and a woman brought the pot in with some beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how much at that time you had about you. - A. I had eleven ones and two fives, I took them out on a bench, they were tied with a piece of pack thread across, he pushed me, or I pushed him. In the event I fell down, I did not suppose him a robber, in my getting up he got hold of my hand clasped, endeavouring to unclench it, and seeing me with this parcel of notes, he said, you could lend me some notes, I said I could if I liked, I am quite certain I did not lend him any, though it may be asserted hereafter that I did, I gave no consent whatever. Finally he took the notes away from me, I called upon him the next morning, supposing it was a joke, he disappeared from his lodgings.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. I recollect the circumstance of the two gentlemen coming into my house, they had been out spending the evening. Mr. Eades was very much intoxicated. Wesley was not. I recollect Mr. Eades lending the other four pounds, but he took the whole.</p>

               <p>Q. At this time were you much pressed to make up a bill. - A. Not the least in the world, he said that without my authority. I believe he applied to me to take off the discount of five per cent. of the one pound five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring that money to accompt the four pound fourteen shillings. - A. He never did. I called upon Mr. James for the money on account of receiving the letter upon which he acknowledges receiving the money and not accompting to me for it.</p>

I am the master of the taylor's shop in the Philanthropic Society.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300066"/>Weightman was under my care; previous to the 18th of August I was furnished with cloth for eight coats, it was sent to my shop by Hollroyd and Jackson, to be made up into coats; the Philanthropic Society got three shillings and sixpence a coat for making them, and we received cloth for trowsers; the cloth was charged ten shillings to us, and a shilling making made it eleven shillings for the trowsers.

             belonged to the shoemaker. On the Tuesday morning we missed two coats and three pair of trowsers. On Saturday the 31st we went with a warrant to Mr. Swift's, a slop shop in Rosemary-lane, attended by the officers, Turner and Drinkwater; I saw the defendant at the door, Drinkwater asked him if his name was Swift; he said, it was; he desired him to walk into the shop, and told him he had a search warrant to search the house. I asked the prisoner if he recollected three boys coming and selling him two coats for an old coat and two jackets; he said he knew nothing about the matter. I then asked him if he did not recollect buying a pair of trowsers for half a crown, and out of that the boy stood sixpence to be spent. He said he had no knowledge of it. We then proceeded to search; I found this pair of trowsers that I had lost; Mrs. Swift came in, and said she was very sorry any thing of the sort should have happened, he was but a servant, and she knew nothing of it, we were welcome to search; we searched and found nothing more than the trowsers. We took the prisoner before the Lord Mayor, and the boys were produced, Weightman and Smith. Weightman said that he took one pair of trowsers and two coats to Swift's shop; he sold the two coats for an old coat, and two old jackets, and the trowsers for half a crown. I have never recovered the coats, only the pair of trowsers. The prisoner then said that he had a slight recollection of seeing the boys in the shop. The trowsers are of the value of eleven shillings, and the coats, one at twenty-four shillings, and the other twenty-five shillings, and the coat and jackets the boys had of the prisoner might be worth seven shillings.</p>

             I was employed by Mr. Moore, the taylor; I took away two coats and two pair of cloth trowsers, and one pair of nankeen; we took them to Mr. Swift's, the same place where the officer found the trowsers. We all went there together on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go dressed in the same way that you are now, with your badge on - A. No; Bent, one of the boys, had his clothes and his badge on; I had not, and Smith had not. We all went past there; the defendant asked us if we wanted to buy any thing; we told him no, we had some clothes. We would make an exchange with him; he told us to come in; we all went in together; we asked him to give us two sailors jackets for a coat, he gave us two sailors jackets for one coat. We told him we had another coat, if he would exchange for another kind of coat; he gave us another coat in exchange. We told him we had a pair of trowsers we would sell him; he said he would not give more than half a crown for them. These are the trowsers he gave us half a crown for, and he asked us for sixpence to drink, we gave him sixpence. I had worn the trowsers on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Bent - A. I do not know where he went to. I returned on the Wednesday, and Smith on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coat you exchanged - A. Smith brought it back, and I brought a jacket with me; these are them, they are both old. I gave the same account to the Philanthropic Society as I have now. I have told the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The clothes that you carried to the defendant were the clothes that you stole - A. I stole them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in that good institution - A. Seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. And after having seven years good protection you turned thief and robbed your benefactors - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your comrade Bent, upon your oath - A. He is in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How dared you to tell me this moment you did not know where he was - What is he in Newgate for - A. For thieving.</p>
               <p>Q.You said that one of the boys that went with you to this man's shop had his badge on - A. No, he had not his badge on, he had the buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call a button a badge - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by swearing that Bent had his badge on when you went into this wretched man's shop to change the things, was it not false - A. Yes, it was.</p>
