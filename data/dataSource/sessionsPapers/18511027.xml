                  </hi>. I a ma native of the Duchy of Oldenburgh, and am a merchant. I know the prisoner—I do not think he understands English—from 24th to 29th Sept. I was staying at Mr. Quartermaine's, the York Hotel, Bridge-street, Black friars—on 26th Sept. I changed this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd at Messrs. Glyn's, and received six 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and some gold and silver, I took the number of the first note—here is my memorandum of it, "No. 24769, July 9th"—the other notes were consecu<lb/>tive numbers, so I did not take them down—I went home in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I had gone in, and locked them up in my trunk—I saw the prisoner in the coffee-room next day (Saturday)—on that morning, about 8 o'clock, I took the notes out, and enclosed them in a large envelope—I found them in the same state as I had left them—in the evening I was at the Argyle-rooms, from 9 till half-past 11—I met the prisoner there soon after I went—he came up and said he believed we lived in the same hotel together—he said he was a native of Baden, in the military service—he did not tell me his name—I said I thought the hotel must be very full, as they had at first given me a room very high up in the house—he said he had been in the same way; he had his second room now, and asked me what the number was of my room—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270002"/>
               <p>I told him it was No. 17—he said we were very close together, he had No 14, and he would come up to my room next morning about 6, because I had been telling him he got up very late in the morning, as I saw him about 2 in the day taking his breakfast and coffee—I said it would be of no use to come to my room at 6, for he would not find me there at that time—I do not recol<lb/>lect that I told him I was not going home that night—I think I saw him there when I left—I got to the hotel next morning between 6 and 7, and went to my trunk to get a book, to lay down a few hours to read—the trunk was disturbed—I could not find the book which I had put on top of my trunk; it was locked, but I found some difficulty in opening it, which I had not noticed before—I was lying down reading—I got up between 9 and 10—I then went again to my trunk to get the notes, and take the numbers of all of them—I missed three 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, but can only tell the numbers of two, which were 24773 and 24774—those were two of the six I got from Glyn's bank, the other four were all right—I bad other notes there—I remained in my room some time—at 10 o'clock I sent for Mrs. Quartermaine, she came to my room at once—it might have been between 11 and 12 when I went down-stairs—I met the prisoner coming up-stairs; I only bid him good morning—he said he had been to an apothecary's shop, and got some medicine for his leg—I saw him again on Monday morning in the coffee-room—I was afterwards obliged to go to Germany, and have been fetched from Germany as a witness—a sergeant of police was sent to insist on ray coming.</p>

I was going down to the coal-cellar, and saw the prisoner—she was employed there occasionally, and was employed that morning—I saw her concealing some<lb/>thing away—I let her go up-stairs, and I went to the place where I saw her conceal something, and found half a piece of ribbon—I replaced it, and set a person to watch—I was afterwards called, and saw several more half pieces of ribbon, which the prisoner had got in the cheese-cellar—an officer was sent for, who took the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, carrying on business at 127, Leadenhall-street; I formerly occupied premises at No. 3 in the same street, and carried on business as an outfitter there. The prisoner was in my employment as porter, at No. 127—he assisted in removing the goods I bad at No. 3 to 127—they were packed in boxes, tied round with rope, and some of them were locked; they were put in the counting-house at No. 127—I did not live at the counting-house; I lived at Southampton—the pri<lb/>soner had the keys of the counting-house after the clerks had left; he had them during the night—Mr. Hickey, my partner, has a house at 115, Leaden-hall-street; the prisoner was allowed to live there—on 17th Sept., I missed some of the articles—I had missed some about a month before—the goods were removed from the one house to the other; last May, I think—the first I missed was in Aug.—the amount I missed on 17th Sept. was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., perhaps more—the box from which they were taken appeared to be exactly in the same state, corded and locked—I gave information to Russell—these handkerchiefs are like many that I had in stock, both as regards the quality, the hemming, and the fold—this is one that was found in his room, and this is one that I had remaining in the box, which is precisely the same in quality and hemming—this (<hi rend="italic">produced by the officer</hi>) is the one from the stock; they correspond in texture and fold, and in the borders—I have some dusters in stock the same as these; I have missed two of them, and only two—there were two dozen packed away in this box, tied up in dozens with pink tape—one of the dozens had been unfastened, and two dusters have been taken away from them, and these correspond precisely with those remaining in hemming and border, they are rather peculiar—these silk handkerchiefs have been washed—I could not exactly swear to them; they are precisely like those I had in the box—the cambric handkerchiefs have been washed; they were kept in stock washed, and ready for use—they are just as they were taken from the stock; they are folded precisely the same; it is an unusual way of folding them—this blue silk handkerchief is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I missed dozens of handkerchiefs like that—this piece of soap matches precisely with some I have in stock—it is marine soap, a peculiar description, made for washing in salt water, which outfitters usually keep, and is made by a person in the Strand—I produce some, which is precisely the same—they are done up in bundles of three—this bundle has two left in it—this other piece, was, no doubt, taken from it—I only miss one cake of soap—this piece of cloth I have no doubt was taken from that box—I had a dozen pieces there; they are all gone, with the exception of one or two—they are cuttings of cloth which we use in the outfitting—they were rolled up in a bundle in the box—I had numbers of purses among my goods, of this and other sorts.</p>

               <p>not at that time—he ceased to be my partner last Dec., three or four months before the removal of these goods—about two or three weeks before the loss I had packed these goods into the large box in Leadenhall-street—I first missed a few goods, but could not lay the charge on the prisoner, or any one else; and I put the remainder of the stock into this large chest, about three weeks before I discovered the loss—they were removed in May, in a number of small boxes—I did not take stock of them, or enter them in any book—it is a matter of memory with me, and certainty as well—I did not take the goods out of the small boxes; I put the boxes all into the large chest, and roped it; and when I opened the large box, I discovered them packed pre<lb/>cisely as I had left them, but nearly all empty—there might be seven or eight small boxes there; I cannot say exactly how many; but I know they were all empty, or very nearly so—I should think there were about half a dozen, there might have been seven—they were full when I put them into the large box—I put them in myself—I could not tell what quantities were in each box; there were two or three, or three or four dozens—they were kept in the counting-house—there are two clerks—there is no housekeeper there—a Mr. Davis lives in the upper part of the house—he is a pickle merchant—he has one servant—he has the first-floor, over the shop—there is a shop below, but it has no intercourse with the house at all—Messrs. Maynard and Harris keep the shop—this is the cambric handkerchief that was taken from my stock; I took it out myself—it was either this or the other that I first spoke to as coming from my stock—this is the one I got from the policeman—I did not before I got that show one to the Jury as taken from my stock—there is no private mark on the handkerchiefs—I bought them of a wholesale house in the City—I may have had them in my possession for a twelvemonth—I have not sold a large quantity of these—I have not sold any of these; they were in dozens—I have sold handkerchiefs corresponding, but not corresponding with the border—it is a particular border, a wide border—I will not swear I have not sold any—it is a very particular border; it was not made for me specially—I go by the folds, the quality, and the way it is put up altogether—I do not say it is a very par<lb/>ticular fold, it is the way we have kept them all—that is the way I used to keep them—I had two dozen dusters—I have one dozen and ten of them; they have been washed and hemmed, and they have a particular border, and a wide hem—I got them from a wholesale house—I dare say they sell to other houses—I dare say other wholesale houses keep and sell them—I never sold dusters of this kind but once; it is a thing I very seldom sell; I had an order for them, and sold them all to one party, and these were two dozen left on the piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the 89th regiment; I am twenty-six years of age. I returned from Canada at the end of 1846—after that I had some transactions on the turf—I had known the prisoner previous to June, 1849, by meeting him casually at race<lb/>courses—we occasionally had betting transactions together, not to any great extent, up to that time—in June, 1849, I lent him a small sum, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from that time until June, 1850, I lent him other sums of money, altoge<lb/>ther amounting to about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was money absolutely advanced to him—in Jan., 1850, he owed me about 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was money absolutely advanced—as far as my recollection serves me, I had an interview with him in Jan., 1850, at 2, Great Ryder-street, St. James's, where I was then lodging—I had not at that time pressed him for payment of the money that he owed me; I had asked him for it—at that interview he gave me the note produced—he had previously given me one of Mr. Gerard Sturt's for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as security for the sum I had previously advanced to him, and then he gave me this second one as further security for the money I had then advanced to him, together with the sum of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave him at that time by check—he asked me to keep this note as security—he told me that ho had this document of Lord Clifden's, which was a perfectly good security, and which I believed to be so—he made those preliminary observations before he produced the note—he said if I would hold it until he repaid me, I should be conferring a great favour upon him—this check for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is dated Jan. 4—it was upon that day this took place—I gave him this check at the time, to make up the amount of 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think it was—that was all that took place at that inter<lb/>view with reference to Lord Clifden's note—subsequently to that I lent him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the check; it is dated 22nd Feb.—I had some transactions on the Derby of 1850, that was run in May—I betted a con<lb/>siderable sum for Coyle—I lost about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that race, over and above the amount which I became liable to for him—he was then indebted to me absolutely about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I only charged or credited him with 2,325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as far as my memory serves me—I paid that 2,325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—I did not press him for payment of the money he owed me; but after the Derby, when I found I had lost such a considerable sum, I was of course anxious to get from him the money he owed me, to assist me in making my settlement, which was very heavy—knowing his losses were very heavy, I did not press him, but I asked him to help me with a certain portion of this money, which he promised to do on the Monday morning following—that would be the day before the settling, which was Tuesday, 4th June—he called at my chambers on Saturday, 1st June, about 12 o'clock, in a great state of excitement, as I imagined at that time, and alluded to his large debt</p>

               <p>to me, and said, "I want to talk to you more about it, if you will call on me it Wood's hotel, Furnival's-inn, at 2 o'clock; I shall then be in a position to pay you a portion of my debt to you, or make arrangements for it," or words to that effect—I went with my brother, Captain Holder Alleyne, to Wood's hotel, on that Saturday, about 10 minutes or a quarter to 2—I there found Mr. Coyle, and a friend of his, Mr. Charles Coglan—nothing important took place for five or six minutes—Mr. Coyle kept looking at the clock, in a great state of excitement, stating that his time was now come, or words to that effect, which I do not quite recollect—I was talking to my brother, and Coyle was walking about the room, and presently he left the room very abruptly—my brother turned round and ran after him—Coglan then came up to me—Coyle had then left the room, and could not hear what Coglan said—in about five minutes Coyle returned with my brother, came up to where I and Coglan were standing, and told me that he had forged the document that he had given me of Lord Clifden's, for the purpose of getting money to send either his brother, or his brother-in-law, out to Australia: that he very much regretted it; that if I would not prosecute him, he would do all in his power to repay me the money, which he hoped to be able to do in a short time—he said he was perfectly ruined, and all that he had left in the world was six sovereigns; that if I would let him off, he would work for me all his life, and would never forget my kindness—he then threatened to commit suicide, and throw himself from the Monument, and all sorts of things, if I would not let him off—after some more conversation, he gave me these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave me this one in lieu of all my demands on him—it is a note for 4,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me the other paper at the same time—(<hi rend="italic">the papers were here read</hi>: "London, June 1, 1850. On demand, I promise to pay A. M. Alleyne, Esq., the sum of 4,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. J. F. Coyle"—"I have this day given to A, M.

               <p>dine with him there—I did not go to the Leger of 1850—I lost last year at the Derby 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not a defaulter—the money I lent Coyle was my own—I first took proceedings on this note at the police-court on 29th January—I applied to Mr. Bingham, the Magistrate, for a warrant—Coyle appeared before him—I did not appear on the first occasion—I was at Carshalton, and did not come back—Mr. Clarkson was my counsel—the case was withdrawn on the promise of Mr. Coyle to pay me the amount of money—I did not speak to Mr. Coyle—I did not hear Mr. Clarkson state, that in consequence of inquiries that had been made, there was reason to believe that Mr. Coyle had not a guilty knowledge at the time the bill was forged—to the best of my belief I was in the yard outside at the time; hut Mr. Clarkson made that statement in consequence of a letter I had received from Coyle—Mr. Emmett, of Bloomsbury-square, was at that time acting as my attorney—Mr. Lewis is conducting this prosecution, with the assistance of Mr. Em<lb/>mett—the case was brought on twice before Mr. Bingham—Coyle was there on each occasion—he appeared on bail—I went before the Grand Jury to prefer this indictment in July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the interval between the Feb., when the case was over at the police-court, and your going before the Grand Jury, had you been indicted for obtaining a large sum of Mr. Kennedy, an officer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a mali<lb/>cious prosecution got up by Mr. Coyle, who is on the back of the bill, to stop these proceedings—it is a fact that I am indicted for obtaining 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Kennedy, by false pretences—I know Mr. Kennedy perfectly well, he is now in court—my brother, Captain Holder Alleyne, is also indicted—the indictment was found against us in May—it has not been tried; it was removed by <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> to the Queen's Bench, by mutual consent—the case did not come on for trial—my attorney withdrew the record in the absence of our evidence—I believe my recognizances have not been estreated—I swear that—I was taken upon a warrant after ray recognizances were estreated—the case now stands for trial—it is a malicious prosecution by Mr. Kennedy, unquestionably, as I was in America at the time the alleged offence was con<lb/>cocted—I did not receive 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money—I will swear that—I was in America when the bet was made which was the subject of the alleged offence—I know that my brother made a bet with him for 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon a trotting match, which I am happy to say he won—that is the subject of the indict<lb/>ment—Mr. Kennedy was a lieutenant in my regiment—I mean to say I did not receive one shilling of that money from my brother—my brother lent me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own money, but not of that money that I believe—he gave it me some short time after he had got the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Kennedy—he never told me that it was part of that money—it was a present, and he lent me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—I was in England on 6th Jan. 1847—I had no account at Sir John Kirtland's—I had at Cocks and Co—Sir J. Kirtland is not Mr. Kennedy's banker, or his father's, that I know of.</p>

               <p>with him afterwards that I know of—I forget whether he backed or betted on other horses for me, not to any amount—not to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—he was not visiting me, and dining with me, at Webb's Hotel, down to Jan. this year, when I preferred the charge against him—I met him at Webb's Hotel, in company with my brothers, on the day of one of my brothers' marriage, and I asked him about this money—I met him for that purpose—he said he would repay it as soon as he could—I did not dine with him—I may have had some refreshment with him, but I never dined with him, and I never saw him, except for the purpose of trying to induce him to pay me a portion of this money—I was not with him at Webb's Hotel ten or twelve times—I forget whether I went there in Jan.; but I never went there except to get him to make payment of this money—I do not recollect dining with him; I may have taken a chop—I had money of my own at the time I lost the money at the Derby.</p>

Joseph Low Alleyne, a clergyman, who is in court; that was in Sept., for the purpose of getting some of this money—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter, which induced me to forego the proceedings against Coyle—it is Coyle's writing—it was not altogether the reason of my foregoing the prosecution—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Feb. 14, 1851—To A.

Sir,—I think it right, and more straightforward, as between gentlemen, who have been so connected as you and I, to address you direct, notwithstanding the intervention of professional men, to whom I mean no disrespect. I write to you, as the lawyers say, without prejudice; when I gave you the bill in question, I had no reason to doubt its genuineness; on the contrary, I had every reason to believe its perfect correctness; for it was in the market, and I believe had been some time before it was paid to me; I took it in the regular way of business, and I so parted with it; if you have been taken in, so have I; but, as far as I am concerned, any damage you may have sustained has been unintentional, I give you my honour—I am perfectly blameless in the affair, and I put it to you, as a gentleman, whether it is right further to pursue the steps you have thought proper to take, and which I am sure you would not have done, if you had asked for, and received my explanation"—I am quite satisfied that it was on 4th Jan. that I received this bill from Mr. Coyle; it is dated 31st Dec., four or five days before.</p>

               <p>received the 7,000 and odd pounds something like a fortnight before the trotting-match was to have come off, which was in Jan. 1846; the money was paid because Mr. Kennedy considered he had made a very good bargain—I fancy it was in the latter part of Jan. I received it—I gave my brother Alexander 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, and my brother, the clergyman, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have often given him since, when I have won large sums of money—my brother, the clergyman, is not on the turf I presume, I fancy my brother, M'Geachy, did sometimes bet for him, but very seldom—I now stand in the position of a gentleman at large.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a draper, and live at 19 and 20, Ald<lb/>gate. The prisoner was my shopman on 4th Oct.—he gave notice of leaving on that day, about half-past 1 o'clock or a quarter to 2—it was our dinner-hour, when the greater part of our young persons were out of the shop, the prisoner and one more being left in it—the prisoner came down to dinner with the second party; he spent but a short time—he hastened out of the room in one or two minutes—he returned again and appeared very much agitated, stating that a messenger had just come up from Oxford, saying that his brother-in-law had died suddenly, that his sister had been confined about a month, and was dangerously ill, and he hardly knew what he was saying or doing—seeing that he was so much excited, and supposing what he told me was the truth, I asked him what he wished to do; whether he wished to leave at once—he said if I would allow him to leave under these circum<lb/>stances, he would be very much obliged to me—I said, "Certainly," and in the course of two or three minutes I came up in the shop and paid him his salary due to him to that day, which was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—his wages were 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and he had his board and lodging—he lived in the house entirely—I had not heard before of his intention to leave, but I had intimated to him that he would not suit me—I had not given him notice, for he had promised to try to do better, and to please me, as the situation was very comfortable, and he wished to stay in it—my brother owed me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner in the course of his duty was in the habit of receiving money for me over the counter—I cannot call to mind that he received any debts for me, but he was in a position so to do if a person had called to pay debts in the regular course of business—if he received money for me across the counter, it was his duty to take it to the desk, or to give it to me—he did not on that day, or at any time afterwards, give me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had received from my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased after his death—his death had arisen from some external violence, but the external injury was so slight that I could not judge from that—I examined the body, and found effusion of blood into the left ventricle of the brain, extending to the base of the brain, especially on the left side, and the blood was almost wholly fluid—I attribute the death to the effusion of blood into the brain—a blow under the left ear would occasion that—a blow of that sort would occa<lb/>sion sudden death—there was no visible blood-vessel broken—the whole of the blood-vessels of the brain were so exceedingly congested that it appeared there had been very considerable excitement previous to the blow—the vessels were in such a condition that a very slight blow might produce the injury—there was no evidence of his having been drunk.</p>

               <p>Either from drink or wrangling—it is possible that such a fall as has been described might rupture the vessel—I cannot say that it is probable—in order to fall forward with considerable force there must have been previously an impetus—there was a slight bruise or abrasion under the left ear, and a little blood was oozing from it; there was a slight swelling—he was about thirty years of age, he was a stout, strong man; he was exceedingly pale, but there was no appearance of disease about the body, with the exception of the liver being slightly enlarged, which is generally the case with labouring men who always take more or less spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Coach and Horses on the day in question, about 1 o'clock—Taylor and Mr. Scadden came in directly after me—Scadden took him to a table and paid him some silver, and said, "Thomas, is that right, look at your money?"—he said, "Master, then am I to go?"—Scadden made no reply; he stopped till Taylor picked it up, shilling by shilling, and when he came to the last shilling, he said, "Now, Thomas, is that right?"—he was then going away, and Taylor called to him, and said, "Will you have anything to drink?"—he refused—Taylor was intoxicated—I had observed him at his work at 1 o'clock, and he was not able to do it—I do not say he was beastly drunk, but he was stupid—I heard Scadden tell him how to do his work, he really did not know how to do it—I know he was in and out the premises several times in the course of the morning—he appeared to be out of temper when Scadden refused to drink, he did not even stop to put his money in his pocket, but hastened after Mr. Scadden.</p>

Bush and Mullens—the 15th April bill would be due on 18th Sept,, and the one of 15th May on 18th Oct.—we merely sent a letter to Mr. Gil<lb/>bert of York—it came back, and then Bush and Mullens inquired—we took no steps except by letter—I do not know the prisoner's brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury,—I am placed in this deplorable situation from circumstances over which I have no con<lb/>trol; and so far as regards the crime imputed to me of forging or uttering with a guilty knowledge, the document produced, I am entirely innocent; and had, down to almost the last moment, hoped to have made my innocence manifest, by producing the persons who have done the act for which I am here before you to answer. I pray you, not only for myself, but for my poor wife and six children, seriously to take my case into your consideration; and believe, too, that it is quite possible for circumstances to arise which may warrant an accusation, and for the party accused to be the innocent victim of others, and to be without the power of producing witnesses, because those others (fearing consequences to themselves personally) decline to come forward and prove the facts which none, except themselves, can establish. It is painful for me to introduce to your notice the name of a brother; but my present misfortune, for truth's sake, obliges me. He may have been, and probably has been, him<lb/>self</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270055"/>
               <p>deceived; but I will tell to you the honest truth of my own participation in this transaction, and I defy contradiction as to one iota. My brother, Augustus Westley, was under considerable obligations to me, in consequence of my having assisted him to go into business. Having a very large book-binding concern myself, in which my outlay for wages alone was from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, I was frequently straightened for money, and it was fre<lb/>quently the subject of conversation between myself and my brother Augustus. It is known to the commercial and trading world, that men in business will, and very frequently do, assist each other with "accommodation" acceptances; and by such assistance very many tradesmen are able to get, by discounts, temporary help, which enables them, at the time of pressure, to keep their credit, which (but for such assistance) would be entirely destroyed; for you know, Gentlemen, when once a man's own acceptance is dishonoured, his trading credit is gone; and without credit, no man, in these times of specu<lb/>lation and competition, can avoid sinking. Upon mentioning to my brother my want of capital to go on with,—having, as I had, a large business which would (by assistance being afforded me) have enabled me very shortly to have extricated myself from embarrassment of every kind, he said, "I have no doubt that I can get you some accommodation paper;" I was thankful for his offer; and, at his suggestion, I drew upon parties upon whom he stated I might do so with confidence. He took the bills, thus fully drawn and signed by me, to get them accepted; the bills were brought back to me, and I had my brother's assurance that they were accepted in due course,—for that he was acquainted with a person who, to oblige him, had procured the acceptances. Gentlemen, fully relying upon the acceptances being genuine, I then added my name at the back as indorser, in the usual way, thinking that in doing so I was using a mere temporary accommodation, determining to provide at the time when the bills should become due, in order to honor them, but which, I lament to say, subsequent unforeseen embarrassments prevented; and I solemnly assure you that, until I was apprehended at the Court of Bank<lb/>ruptcy on this charge, I was utterly unconscious of the fact of the acceptors not being resident at the places named on the bills, and not being known at the places where they were made payable. I had relied upon my brother, and had no reason to believe, or suspect, that he had deceived me. I had always believed the bills to bear true acceptances (there being no doubt suggested by anybody as to the fact that they were otherwise), and that all I had to do was to provide for them at maturity. Gentlemen—I was, when put into custody, taken to the Mansion-house, and remanded to the Giltspur-street Compter, where my brother Augustus came to me, and I told him of the accusation against me; he stated then, as he had done before, that the accep<lb/>tances were genuine, and that by the next examination he would bring for<lb/>ward the acceptors. I fully expected he would do so; but from that moment I never saw my brother,—he never came near me again; and from communi<lb/>cation made to the rest of my family, it is quite evident that he is fearful of doing so, or appearing, lest he (by the evidence whereby he would relieve me) should be placed in my situation. These are the facts, Gentlemen; and I implore you to take them into your consideration. I am guiltless of the charge, and have been deceived, as I told the Lord Mayor; but I am help<lb/>less, and throw myself on your justice. Gentlemen, when the bills became due, Messrs. Glyn, it appears, presented them for payment. They must, by those presentations, have at that time discovered the fact which I was ignorant of, namely, that the acceptors were not known at the places where the bills had been made payable; and although they did so then know, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270056"/>
               <p>made inquiries after the acceptors at the places where the bills were addressed and could not find any such persons; they kept those facts secret from me for weeks, until after I was declared bankrupt, and until after I was in custody. Instead of which, I cannot help saying, that it would have been better had they at once sent to me and stated the facts, I should have then told them all the circumstances about the acceptances; and the parties who have deceived me, and through me deceived them, would have been made answerable, and justice would have been done. As it is, the bills were kept in their hands, I was in the dark, and they never thought of making this charge against me until I was bankrupt, and in due course appeared at the Court of Bankruptcy,—which, Gentlemen, do you as tradesmen, and as men of rational understand<lb/>ing, think I should have been mad enough to have done, had I ever imagined that the bills which I had passed, had upon them forged acceptances? Gen<lb/>tlemen—to charge me with this forgery, or with this guilty uttering, is surely an afterthought. Messrs. Glyn's were aware of my difficulties as to money, because I made them known to them myself; and to cover any deficiency that might be upon my running account, I deposited a security in their hands, and they now hold that security; it refers to freehold property in the City of London, which will realize from three to four thousand pounds. So that if they do sustain some loss, it will be comparatively small; and when it is known, as their books will prove, that during the few years I have been bank<lb/>ing with their house, ninety thousand pounds, or thereabouts, has passed through their hands, you will readily admit that it was not too much for me to expect some consideration from them. Gentlemen, I do hope that you will take this plain and honest statement into your humane and just con<lb/>sideration, and remember that I was a tradesman, having large weekly de<lb/>mands to meet; that I believed I was merely availing myself of genuine accommodation acceptances, to gain time thereby to meet just demands upon me; that I was anxious to keep up a large business, which (could I have continued) would very shortly have placed me beyond all difficulty; that I availed myself of what is considered a kindly and affectionate brother's offer to extricate myself from present pressure; that I had no intention of injuring or defrauding the prosecutors, they having security to so large an amount as from between three and four thousand pounds; and that guilty knowledge was at variance with my whole conduct, by meeting my creditors, and by going to an open Court, where my intended appearance bad been openly and pub<lb/>licly advertized in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette,</hi> and the public journals, for a particular day and hour. These are the observations which I take leave to address to your humane hearts, trusting that my true statement will weigh in my favour against inferences which are only supported by circumstances, all of which (though some may be consistent with guilt) are thoroughly capable of being consistent also with innocence.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 5th Oct., about 4 o'clock, I was on board the barge <hi rend="italic">Lucy,</hi> near Hampton-court—I saw some boys in the barge<lb/>walk throwing stones first at one barge and then at the other—we were very much annoyed by them, and in great danger; we were forced to keep popping our heads about to escape the stones—I was steering, and the prisoner, who was the captain, was standing at the stern near me, and being very much annoyed by the stones he took the gun up and <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> it round, and in bringing it round it was fired—he did not put it to his shoulder—when we got the barge round I saw the boy rubbing his arm—this is the gun (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

               <p>and they were talking together as to what the lady could say, if she was brought before the Magistrate—she had not then been examined—Jones said to me, "If you get the lady, what can she say?" I made no reply; and he said, "If you get her, she can't say how she lost it; the arm is too quick for the eye"—I did not speak to him at all, either before or after that.</p>

I was in Hyde-park, near the Crystal-palace, and met the prisoner—I had known him some years before, at Cheltenham—he was one of the classical masters at the Proprietary College there, when I was a pupil—he asked me what I was doing—I told him I had a temporary situation in the Admiralty, at Whitehall, but that as the business I was engaged in would be very soon concluded I had some thoughts of going into a profession—he told me he was a barrister of the Middle Temple, that he had chambers in the Temple, and he lived in Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square—I said, "I have some thoughts of going to the bar, and perhaps, as you are a barrister, you will be good enough to give me some information about the expense, and so on"—he said if I would call on him in the course of a few days, at his lodging, he would give me every information—after a few days I called at his lodging—he then said that it would require a sum of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enter me in the Temple—he also said that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be required as caution-money—I objected to that, because I said I had been educated at Oxford, and had left the University with my college testimonial, and I thought they ought not to require that caution-money—I said the matter required some consideration, and I would consider over it—some days afterwards I called on him again; that was on 10th Jan.—I told him I had made up my mind to become a student, and that I should be prepared with the money next day—I went on the 11th and sold out some stock, and on the 16th got the money—I gave the prisoner 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and went with him to the Temple—I waited for him at Prosser's oyster-shop, in Fleet-street, while he went to the treasurer's—he came back in about half an hour, and said he had paid—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I got from him some days afterwards, not then—he gave me a receipt then, which I returned to him, as I was not satisfied with it, because it was not stamped—he gave me this about ten days after—he said, "This is the receipt"—I said, "It is a very strange kind of receipt; they must do business in a very odd way in the Temple"—he said the treasurer was a very careless sort of fellow, and many complaints bad been made of him; "in fact," he said, "he indulges rather freely"—I did not make any inquiry at the Temple on this subject until Aug.—I was taken very ill, and went to Brighton, where I remained some time—then I went to stay with a friend—the receipt purports to be signed "W." or "H. Compton"—the prisoner told me that Mr. Compton was treasurer of the Middle Temple—I have looked at this receipt—I have seen the prisoner write on two occasions—my belief is that this is his writing—Messrs. Knight, Son, and Reeves, were the brokers from whom I received the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes.</p>

Perhaps, therefore, you will call Tuesday evening, about 7 o'clock, unless you hear from me to the contrary. In the meantime, I remain, Sir, yours faithfully, R, F. To Mr. Alex. Beale.")—I called at 9, Denmark-street, Soho, on Tuesday evening, with Mr. Fry—I was shown into a room, and found the prisoner and an old gentleman, who retired immediately I entered—the prisoner said she supposed I was astonished to see a lady; but she was the person who had corresponded with me—she said she was in a position to promise me an appointment, in consequence of the services rendered by her father to the shipping interest and to the Navy; and said she should require 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the expense of remaining in town, and to fee the clerks with a <hi rend="italic">golden key</hi> to give her the first information of any vacancy—I asked her what security she would give me—she said she thought the old gentleman who had retired, her landlord, would oblige her by giving her his acceptance—she said his name was William Menzies—I said I would consider of it, and left—I afterwards received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "30th April, 1851. 9, Den<lb/>mark-street. Sir, I did not see my landlord last night, as he had gone to see an invalid friend, and was late; but to-day I explained that I should require security for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at six months' date, and that I calculated upon his long friendship and knowledge of me to become my guarantee. He consented to do so, provided his note-of-hand or his acceptance should be satisfactory; for, although very willing to serve me by any responsibility of his own, he would not put himself under an obligation to another person. There cannot be a doubt but you will be appointed before the period stated; so that I have no hesitation in accepting this kindness from him. If you saw Mr. Cooze, I dare say you heard that Mr. Menzies is an honest roan, and would enter into no engagement that he could not be prepared to meet. For myself, I need say no more than that self-interest will be a sufficient guarantee for the exercise of the interest I possess to urge your speedy appointment. If agreeable to you, perhaps you will call to-morrow evening, and then I shall hear your final decision. In the meantime, although you know my name, t will subscribe myself, Sir, yours faithfully, R. F. To Mr. Alex. Beale.")—After I received that letter, I called on her, and she said her landlord would give his acceptance, and said it was usual to bind the agreement by some<lb/>thing, and I gave her a sovereign—she sent out and bought a stamp, and I drew a bill on William Menzies, which the prisoner brought to my house next day accepted; and I paid her 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., deducting the sovereign I had let her have, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest, as it was a six months' bill—I had prepared a memorandum, which I gave to her—this is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">read: This was an agreement between Alex.

I had no appointment—I called on her a few days before Sept. 25th—she was ill, and I said I would call another time, and she wrote to tell me to call on Monday 25th—I went, and she said she had received a very favourable letter from Sir Francis Baring, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and I was to get an office from him—she showed me the answer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Admiralty, Sept. 17th.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first hear of this transaction afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard them talk of it in the lane some time after, perhaps a month ago—I heard the Jews talking of Jones being in custody about some boots and shoes—I did not hear of it till after he was in custody—I did not hear that he was not to be found—I did not go to the police court—I told this story about the man in the velveteen coat about a fortnight or three weeks ago to some parties, and they introduced me to Mrs. Jones; I told her what I knew of the affair, and she asked if I would have any objection to go to her solicitor's, and state to him what I had told her—I said I would go with pleasure, if it would do her any good; and I went with her to the solicitor, and made my statement, which he took down in writing; that was last Monday week—I did not know anything of Mrs. Jones before; I had only known the prisoner by seeing him, and his name only by hearing it, nothing more—when I heard of his being in custody, I remembered the circumstance occurring, and I made it known, as soon as I could make it convenient to go down again among the Jews—that may be more than a week ago; it may be a fortnight—I had my work to attend to; I went as soon as I could—I heard about three weeks or a month ago that the prisoner was in custody on a charge of having some boots in his possession, which had been stolen—the first time I again went to the market, I mentioned to the Jews there what I have stated to-day—I cannot say whether I mentioned it on the first or second occasion, but I did men<lb/>tion it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, living at 5, Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell; I have resided in the parish all my life, forty-seven years; I attend the Clothes' Exchange, for the purpose of making purchases; I am in the habit of buying boots there. New boots are brought up from the country in great quantities—I have constantly been in the habit of buying them there—I was there on 9th Sept., about half-past 11 o'clock in the morning—the place was crowded—I saw about a dozen persons assembled round Mr. Jones, who was purchasing, and a man who was selling—he was a man about five feet nine in height, or he might be taller—he was dressed in a velveteen coat, with a kind of cape—he had the appearance of a countryman—he was selling women's cashmere boots with black bottoms—they were very similar to those now lying before me—they were in a rather long brown basket, similar to what boots come in from the country—I know Lambden—I saw him there—he was going away at the time I came up—he called my attention to the boots, and said, "Can you buy that lot?"—I cannot say exactly the words, but something to call my attention to business—I then looked at the boots—Jones had put a handkerchief on the ground, and was putting them out of the basket into the handkerchief, looking at them—I took up a pair, and asked the price; and he said, "Put them down; the lot go together;" and the prisoner said, "Don't you see I am <hi rend="italic">on,</hi> "meaning," I am about to buy"—it is a general understanding in the market, when that is said, that others are not to interfere—I then walked away, and heard no more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you often go to this market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I recol<lb/>lect very well that I was there on 9th Sept.; I was there on the Friday previous—the 9th was on a Tuesday—I bought two pairs of Wellington boots on the Friday—I have been in the habit of purchasing there for the last twenty years; not new boots; I go principally to buy old Wellingtons, to re-foot—I have purchased new and old—I looked at the man with the boots—I should know him again—he had on a dark velveteen coat, something between a brown and a black, a dark dingy velveteen coat—I did not notice the cap—I have known the prisoner three or four years, or more, by being in the market—he is a different buyer to me—it was generally stated round that there were about 100 pairs of boots in the basket—I heard afterwards that the prisoner was apprehended—I read the account in the paper—I did not see him from the 9th until he was apprehended—I did not know where he was, or that he had been away—I did not immediately, on reading about this, go and tell what I knew—I read that he was taken for receiving a large quantity of boots—I first told this story when Mrs. Jones called on me—I do not say I might not have mentioned to some one in the market about Jones buying these things; it might have occurred between Lambden and me—I have known Lambden sixteen or seventeen years—I think we had a con<lb/>versation about it—we talked it over at the time I was called on by Mrs. Jones—I do not say we might not have spoken about the matter before, but not about being a witness—I cannot recollect when I first spoke to Lambden about it, or whether I spoke to him before Mrs. Jones came to me—I often see Lambden in the market, and away from the market as well—I did not know that Jones was keeping out of the way after 9th Sept.—I knew nothing at all about the matter till I read it in the paper—I did not go to the police-office—I mentioned nothing particular to any one that I know of till Mrs. Jones called on me—I left before the bargain was completed—when he</p>

I am in the habit of attending the Clothes' Exchange every Hay—on Tuesday, 9th Sept., I was there—I do not remem<lb/>ber seeing Mr. Jones there; I might have seen him—I saw a man in the market with boots, about 20 minutes or half-past 11 o'clock—he had a country appearance—he had on a dark velvet coat—he had a basket lying on the pavestones, full of females' boots—I took up some of them to look at—I cannot positively say whether Jones was by at that time—I did not see a handkerchief on the ground—a person who was kneeling down in a stooping position, said, "Can't you put them down? don't yon see I am looking at them?"—I then threw down the boots and left, or I would have bought a pair or two for my wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between five and six years—I very often see him at the market—my attention was drawn to the man with the boots as I entered the market—I remarked him—I should certainly know him again—his coat might have been a dark brown, or a black faded—I am positive he had a cap on, not a hat—I did not notice the colour of it—all descriptions of goods come to this market, daily and hourly, boots, shoes, watches, earrings, jewellery, and all descriptions of wearing-apparel, and pawnbrokers' stock—it is usual for a man of that appearance to come into the market with a large quantity of boots and shoes—I have often seen it: I cannot say when—I have seen it invariably, in the course of the twenty years I have been dealing there—I have, on various occasions, seen boots and shoes brought in by a man of that description—I do not know what quantity there was—I would sooner say fifty pairs than ten—I have seen larger quantities than fifty pairs brought, not by a country<lb/>man, perhaps—I cannot say when—there was nothing strange in a man of his appearance having such a quantity of boots and shoes to sell—I cannot be certain that I saw Mr. Jones on the 9th—I have not seen him since—I heard that he had got into trouble about this—it might be two days after<lb/>wards, or it might be the next day—What did you ask me, Sir?—it might have been a fortnight after—I first heard that his wife had got into trouble, not him—I first heard about his getting into trouble three weeks or a month ago—I did not then mention what I have stated to-day—I did not tell it to any one till I was applied to by Mrs. Jones—it might have been last Monday week that I first heard of the prisoner getting into trouble—it might have been three weeks or a month ago that I heard of Mrs. Jones getting into trouble—Mrs. Jones must have heard that I saw the boots, she came to me first, and then I told what I had seen—no one was with me in the market that morning—I went there to purchase, and I did purchase—I came away before the bargain was completed—there were seven or eight persons standing round.</p>

On Tuesday, 9th or 10th Sept., I was at the Clothes' Exchange between 11 and 12 o'clock—I saw Mr. Jones there, holding the handle of a flat basket, in Fill's-buildings—it was a long flat basket, apparently about three feet long—there was another man there—the prisoner requested me to assist that man with the basket, and show him where he lived—I did so, and went with him to the prisoner's house—he was a tall man, about five feet nine or ten—he had on a velveteen shooting-coat—the basket apparently contained woman's boots—I and the man placed it on a table in the prisoner's house—the prisoner came in a minute or two</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Edney-place, Bromley. On 8th Oct. I lived at 17, Duck's-fields—the prisoner lived in the same house—on that evening I was in my room, sitting on a chair, with my head resting on the bed—while I was in that position, the prisoner came and kicked me in the mouth—I awoke up, and saw a knife in his hand—I told him to put it down, and I would fight him fair—I had never quarrelled with him in my life—he put out the candle, and we had a scuffle in the dark—I got away from him, and ran—he followed me as far as the front-door—before I got to the front-door I knew that I was cut in the left cheek, but I did not think it was so bad as it was—I never saw the prisoner again till he was at the station—a man took me to the doctor—there was nobody in the room but my two children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a maltster, and am now living at 4, Bell-lane, Spitalfields. On Thursday, 23rd Oct., about 1 o'clock, I was in Good-man's-rents, Minories; and a person who was afterwards with the prisoner, but who is not in custody, came up to me, and asked me whether I wanted to buy any tobacco—I told him I did not, and he asked me to buy a watch—I consented to go and see it, and he went with me to Mrs. Abrahams, at the Golden Lion, in Goodman's-yard—while I was there with him, the prisoner came in—I am quite sure he is the man—he asked the other man whether he had shown me the watch—he said yes, and the prisoner took the watch from him, and said to me, "Look here; you can have this watch for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it cost 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I took it out of his hand, looked at it, and thought it might be stolen property—I wanted to get away from them, so I pulled out my watch to show them I had one, and did not want it—the prisoner said, "D—n it, old fellow! let us have a bargain; buy something of us," and he pulled out a chain—I told him I did not want a chain or anything else—he then palled out some handkerchiefs and shawls—I told him I did not want them, and he asked me to advance him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the chain—I told him I did not want to part with my watch, or to buy anything—he said he had been on board ship, and his master was a black man, and he had some tobacco wrapped round his loins—he said he lived at this Golden Lion—he wanted me to give him my watch and something else for his chain, or to give my watch for the watch he had—I refused all his offers, and he said that he lodged there, and he would go up-stairs and fetch another watch, I believe it was—as he passed the corner of the table to go out he snatched my watch out of my hand and threw the chain on the table, saying that would make satisfaction—he went out of the room, and I did not see him again till he was in Newgate—I was going to follow him, but the other man pulled me back to show me the quality of the chain, and told me that Dubois gave a doubloon for it—he then said he would go up after his mate, and I never saw him again—I went out in search of a constable—I identified the prisoner in Newgate last Monday—I was in his company ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I have doubt he is the man.</p>

On 23rd Oct., between 1 and 2 o'clock, in consequence of the parlour-bell ringing, I went there, and found the prisoner, prosecutor, and another man—I had seen the prisoner before, about 11 the same day, when I served him and another man with a pint of beer at the bar—the other man took up the newspaper, and the prisoner took a silver watch out of a bag the size of the watch, shook it, and put it to his ear—they stayed in front of the bar about ten minutes, and I had a good opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face—the very moment I went into the room, between 1 and 2, I recognized him—they then called for a pint of beer, for which the prosecutor gave me a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—I afterwards heard some one go out, but did not see who it was—the prosecutor then came out, and made a complaint to me about the two men—he said the stout man had taken his watch, and I then found that the prisoner was gone—he has never lodged in my house, but I think I have seen him in and out several times.</p>

"Let him go!"—Agar then made a stop, and swore he would not go any further—I found Agar was getting away, and I threw him down in the carriage-way, I received a kick on the leg—I struggled with him some time, and was kicked several times, but I cannot say who by—I still held Agar by the collar, and he twisted and struggled with me, but he twisted himself out of his coat and got away—I kept his coat in my hand—I then tried to get up to go after him, and found my leg was broken—I was assisted to the station, and then carried to the hospital—I know all the prisoners, and saw them all there—I have known Flynn a long time—I saw her at my back, but did not see her do anything.</p>

               <p>packed upon the top of a small chest of drawers at my house—an arrange<lb/>ment was come to between us as to their disposal—after that arrangement, I saw a person of the name of Wolfe Abrahams—they commonly called him <hi rend="italic">Woolley</hi> Abrahams—I afterwards went down to the Mitre, and there saw Abrahams and Myers—after leaving the Mitre, Whicher told me to go some<lb/>where; in consequence of which, I went to Senior's house—he kept the Black Dog public-house, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, at the corner of Long<lb/>alley—I found him at the end of the bar, by himself—I asked him if he knew any one that would buy any pieces of de-laine—he asked me to bring some patterns down—I took some down on the Sunday evening—I first saw him about 3 o'clock on the Sunday, and in the evening I took him the patterns, and showed them to him—I went home, and cut the patterns off—after looking at them, he said they were splendid goods; he should not buy them himself, but he could recommend me to a man—I then left, and left the pat<lb/>terns with him—I went again on the Monday morning—I saw Senior, and he said he would take me down to a man—he said he could not go then, as his wife was ill, but told me to call the next day—I called next day, and from day to day down to Friday—I saw him every day—he said he could not go this day, and he could not go the other day; that his wife was not sufficiently recovered—on the Friday he sent for me—I was at home when the person came—my wife answered the door—I did not see the person that came—in consequence of a message I received, I went to his house—I went into the bar-parlour, and found Sayward and Senior there—they were examining the patterns which I had taken—Sayward asked me what I wanted for them—(that was in Senior's presence)—I said, "A shilling a yard"—Sayward said he could not give a shilling; he would write on a piece of paper what he would give, and he wrote "8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Senior said he could afford to give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—Sayward doubted whether they were all wool; but after examination with him and Senior, they considered they were all wool—the patterns con<lb/>tained both the de-laine and the merino—the price ultimately agreed upon was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the de-laine, and 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the two pieces of black merino—the price was reckoned up—Senior got a little book; I think they call it a ready-reckoner—Sayward was casting up how much it would come to, each piece—Senior said, "What do you make them come to? I make them come to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece, at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My Lord,—In my defence, I humbly beg permission to state the cause of my now standing before this tribunal charged with so serious a crime. It is in consequence of the unjust treatment I have received on board of the <hi rend="italic">Justitia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">York</hi> hulks. From the month of July,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270116"/>
               <p>1847, being the month in which I was given over by the military into the hands of the civil power, at Maidstone, in the county of Kent, until the month of June, 1851, I received punishment three times, as follows: in the month of February, 1849, I committed an offence upon shore; I was taken on board the ship; I never saw the governor or deputy-governor, but was put by the same warders that took me on board, into separate confinement, where I remained from Saturday morning until Monday morning, when I was brought upon deck. The grating was rigged in a private place; I was ordered to strip by the only two warders present, and by them I was tied up. After the space of ten minutes the governor and doctor came. The governor said, "Give him three dozen," which I received without any examination, or even so much as reading the report that was against me. That was the only punishment I received on board of the <hi rend="italic">Justitia</hi> in ten months; still the char<lb/>acter given is bad. I was removed along with a great number of prisoners to the <hi rend="italic">York,</hi> whither the same warder had been previously removed, for whom I was so unjustly punished, and whose hatred I soon felt again, not only from him but from others, whose mind he had prejudiced against me. The conse<lb/>quence was, I resolved I would be removed under any circumstances, rather than suffer such treatment. Shortly after, having received great provocation from a fellow-prisoner, I took the law in my own hand by resenting the insult. The consequence was, I was reported, and kept for the disposal of Captain Vowles, the superintendent; but by the time he came, there was an additional report against me, namely, outrageous and insubordinate conduct (that is, for shouting and making a noise while in separate confinement). I humbly beg leave to state here, that, let a report be ever so serious, or the punishment intended to be inflicted ever so severe, the warder is never put upon oath; so that let him say what he will, it is taken for truth. But to proceed;—when the superintendent came, the report was laid against me in the most exaggerated manner possible; but in consequence of a recommenda<lb/>tion previously given in favour of me, by a gentleman, to Captain Vowles, it was not his wish, he said, to remove me. I then laid before him the unjust punishment I had received, and the character given me on board the <hi rend="italic">Justitia.</hi> In answer to which, he replied, "The report made against you was sent to me, and I did not consider it necessary for any examination, I ordered the punishment you received." I then said I did not think it just to be judged, condemned, and punished without being permitted to defend myself. He then said it was not what I thought, but that it was he that was the best judge. I then begged that he would remove me away from the ship to separate confinement. I then stated my reasons more fully, upon which he said, "Upon those grounds I will remove you." I was removed to Penton<lb/>ville prison, as incorrigible. I remained there nine months and ten days without a report. At the end of that period I was sent back to the <hi rend="italic">York</hi> hulk, with a badge of distinction upon my arm. The moment I was on board, the governor, Captain Barrow, called me, along with three others, and addressing himself to us, said, "I do not think it right that you should have been sent back to this ship; but as I think it is a mistake, if you do not think you will be able to conduct yourself, or if you think any of the officers will take advantage of you, I will get you transferred to another ship, but, as you have regained your character, the past shall not be brought against you. And as you have done, or nearly so, your probation, I will send you that have done your time in the first free ticket ship that comes; and the others shall go as they finish their probation." True to his promise, he sent all away but me. In about a month after, he also promised me that he would send</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270117"/>
               <p>my name up to the Home-office as soon as possible, which promise was made for eight successive months; during which time he sent letters to and from my friends, in which he saw how I built upon his promises. But I had some misgivings, which caused me to go to him and volunteer to go out of the country as a prisoner. But he positively refused me, saying, "No, I will not send you as a prisoner after the character I have received of you, but I will tell you what I will do, I will send you away with a free ticket the first opportunity." The principal warder being present, said he should not like to see me sent as a prisoner after doing so long a time, and giving such proofs of reformation; and begged I would leave it to the governor, and rely upon his promise; upon which I thanked him, and retired. But about five or six weeks previous to the ship coming, I made a complaint against one of the senior warders; it was committed to writing, and given to the deputy-governor, who was in charge. The substance was made known to the warder next morning by him. The governor being from home, it was three or four days before I was called upon to confirm my statement. The governor told me he would inquire into it, he did so, in the following manner: he asked the warder if he knew so-and-so, he also asked two prisoners of the guilty party if they had done so-and-so, which it was natural for them to deny; he then said he would bring it to the notice of the inspector; but the inspector came and went away, and there was nothing about the statement made by me. But, previous to his coming, there was a draft of prisoners to go abroad, among whom was one that I considered my chief witness; I went to Captain Barrow and told him, and begged he would take his evidence in writing before he went away; he took a note of it, and said he would see the man, but did not; though I had not been permitted to attempt to prove my statement, or any further inquiry being made, or my committing myself in any way. Captain Barrow, not with<lb/>standing all his promises, erased my name from among those that were to go abroad, and thus deprived me of my ticket of leave; neither was I made aware of it until the men were called up and told they were going. My name not being upon the list, I applied to see the governor, and reminded him of his promise, but he instantly denied having promised to send me in the first ship, and said that he could not send me on account of my being sent back to separate confinement eighteen months previous. I then said I thought I was unjustly dealt by, for I was the only one out of four that he refused, and one of those had been twice seat back, and still received his ticket; another, also, who was scarcely out of trouble, and had been flogged for attempting to escape, sent back to prison, and still was sent abroad six months before his probation expired. But he would not listen to anything I could say, but told me I could not go, this threw me into despair. In about an hour after I was required to go to chapel; this was upon Thursday night; when the warder asked me what I was in the service, I made no reply; he asked me again; I answered, a prisoner. He flew in a passion, and said, was that the way to speak to him. I made no reply. He asked me if I was going to chapel. I said no. He asked me if I had got leave to stay away. I said, no. He asked me if I would not obey his order. I answered, I wonder you are not afraid to put your head in a place of worship. He then locked me up, went and made his report. I was taken that same night before the governor (who seemed to be in a greater passion than myself). I asked him if I had not given him every proof that man could give of my wishing to do well. He answered, "Yes, you have." I asked why I was deprived of my liberty. He said, that was no reason for me to throw myself into trouble. He made several excuses, but there was no regard to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270118"/>
               <p>truth or honour. He then said he thought I had been brought before Captain Vowles at his last visit. I had not. He then ordered me to be locked up in solitary, saying, he would see me in the morning. In the morning he came to me and told me that though he had prevented me from going in the first ship, he intended to send me in the next; but as I had thrown myself into trouble he would not dispose of me, but keep me for Captain Vowles; and that the complaint should also be brought before him. He then asked me the men's names I wished to call upon to confirm what I had stated. I told him the names. I asked him if he had took the evidence of James White, as he promised, but he did not answer. I asked if I should be allowed to hear what my witnesses said when called upon. He answered he was there to see justice done me, and that I should certainly hear them. After I had been in solitary about three weeks, Captain Vowles; came; I was brought before him. He said to me, "Before I proceed with the report that is against you, I will say a few words in regard to the complaint you have made; but I tell you, plainly, though you should be able to prove fully what you say, I shall not give you any credit for so doing, neither does my duty compel me to make any inquiry into it; yet I will, to satisfy you, go through the form" (a mock inquiry began). The governor, deputy-governor, chaplain, and Captain Vowles, himself, not only baffled me all they could, but put words in the warder's mouth. I was then ordered to my cell, while they took lunch. Upon being brought in again, the statement was laid aside, and the report made by the warder, without being put upon oath, received. Captain Vowles said, "Though I have so often advised you, and encouraged you with hopes, you have, because you were disappointed in going abroad, thrown yourself into trouble. And I now tell you, plainly, that had your name been sent to the Home-office, and I had seen it, I would have taken it off, for, as I have told you before, you show signs of insanity, and a person bordering upon insanity is not fit to be set at large; and now, for this one report alone, yes, for this one, I will send you to a penal settlement; but here is another, more serious, just brought against you, it is for making a false charge against your superior." I said, "I hope you have not condemned me without permitting me to call upon and hear those men give their evidence, whose names I gave to the governor, who promised that I should have every just opportunity of proving my statement." Captain Vowles replied, "It is not necessary that you should either see or hear what they said—take the prisoner away." With that I was removed to my cell, where I remained until the 19th of April, when I was conveyed to the Millbank Prison. About the beginning of June I applied to the visiting-inspector, Captain O'Brien, to have the sentence carried into effect, at the same time stating my reasons. The answer he gave me was, "Some people have strange fancies; I will register your wish. I cannot give you any answer." In a few days after I was brought before him for the purpose of inquiring into an offence I had committed; he referred to the books for my character, and finding that I was sent back twice as incor<lb/>rigible, he awarded punishment according, which was thirty-six lashes. In the month of August I applied to him again, and told him that I considered I had been most unjustly condemned, punished, and sent back, and I earnestly begged that he would permit me to relate to him the whole circum<lb/>stance, for I felt convinced he would see I was not deserving of the treatment and character given me; but he refused, saying, his duty was to investigate into my conduct while here, and not to inquire into anything previous. I again begged that he would send me to a penal colony the first opportunity, or at least give me some hope of a removal. This he also denied me. I then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270119"/>
               <p>said, if he refused me in all my applications, and would not listen to reason, it would be better to be out of the world, and the only thing I could do was to force myself into a court of justice, in order to make known the kind of justice that was administered in the convict service. Thus all application to the authorities to obtain justice or hearing failing, drove me to desperation. And now, after being in confinement from the 25th of September, 1846, undergoing the greatest suffering, I am, through the treatment above described, sunk deeper into misery and crime. I humbly beg, my Lord, you will condescend to consider the above. Throwing myself upon the mercy of the Court, I earnestly implore that mercy may be extended to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and reside with my father at 56, Tavistock-square. On the morning of 12th Oct., I was sleeping in the back drawing-room—I heard some glass fall about a quarter-past 3 o'clock—I supposed from the sound it was from the back kitchen-door, leading into the garden—I got up, raised the window-sash, looked out, and saw a figure close to the kitchen-door—after a few minutes, it moved on one side, and I saw a face looking upwards, and a man's hat—I called for the policeman, and at that moment the man ran from the kitchen-door to the wall—he got on the top of the wall, and I saw the policeman running up Woburn-place, springing his rattle, and the man jumped from the wall into the street—shortly after<lb/>wards the prisoner was brought back by the policeman to the side of the wall from whence be sprung—I went down and examined the door, leading from the kitchen to the garden; I found a pane of glass broken, and an iron bar, which went across the door, was down—the glass had been whole the night before, and I had put up the bar myself across the middle of the door inside, and had bolted the door—it is the dwelling-house of my father Charles Henry Winfield, and is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I remember the morning of 9th Oct.—William and Edward Jarrett, my brothers in law, had slept there, and William had breakfasted there—I do not remember whether the door of the breakfast room was open or shut that morning; it was usually left open—after breakfast my brother William asked me to let the prisoner go with him, to show him the Downham-road—after her return I went with her up to the bed-room, after she had had her breakfast—it was then about a quarter before 10 o'clock—I smelt a disagreeable smell, and opened the window—I then proceeded with the prisoner to strip the bed, and I saw scorches on the bed, on the opposite side to the door—I went round to that side to look, and found the edge of the mattress had been burnt which had been principally underneath—while I had been at breakfast that morning the prisoner had an opportunity of going up-stairs—I know that she had not filled the water jugs up to the middle of the day, and she had not emptied the slops at the time we went up—when the fire was discovered she said there had been a fire in the back-part of a house in the Downham-road; that a servant had set it on fire—I asked her how that was—she said it might be with a candle—I said, "Suppose these new things had been burnt, and we were not insured, what a pity!"—the prisoner said, "0, you are not insured?"—I then examined all the bedclothes very minutely, and there was no stain or spot of anything on them—I took the counterpane, one sheet, and two blankets from the bed, and put them on a chair at the bottom of the bed—I am quite sure there was no mark of any turpentine or anything on them—the sheets had been put on clean, on the day before—I then went in the next room and dressed—I then went down-stairs, and the prisoner too—I</p>

               <p>afterwards sent her up stairs to fetch a letter, which had come while we were up stairs—about 12 I smelt something—I asked the prisoner if she smelt anything—she said, "Yes;" she supposed it was next door; they were burning old boots or shoes, for they were always burning some rubbish or another—I told her to look about, and she said there was a smoke—I went up stairs, and about one yard of the sheet was burning away—it was not flaming, but smouldering away very fast, and I discovered spots of oil in different parts—in my opinion it was oil from a lamp—the prisoner had been dressing the lamp just before—I staid in the room then till my brothers came, and they examined the room with me—after they were gone I examined the prisoner's dress, and found some oil on her dress—I rubbed the sheet against her frock, to see if it would leave a mark, it did leave a mark, but not such a one as I saw on the sheet before—the prisoner said it must be set on fire, and perhaps some one was up the chimney—about a quarter before 3 I sent the prisoner up to see if all was right—I had told her seven or eight times to go up, and just about five minutes before I smelt the fire the third time I sent her up, and she said all was safe, but previous to that she said they had burnt a pair of shoes at the next house—I said, "How was that?"—she said, "By putting them too near the fire the toes were burnt"—she laughed, and I thought she laughed at me for being nervous about it—when I went up stairs to the bed-room I found the side of the bedstead nearest to the door in flames, and the sheets were burning—I called for help, and took the burning sheets in my hand and threw them out of the back window—the prisoner came to the room—I called for water; there was none in the room—I told the prisoner to go for water—she left the room, and in the meantime I was calling for help, and the neighbours were knock<lb/>ing at the door—the prisoner did not open it, and I could not leave the room, for I was afraid the fire would get much higher, till I got the most inflammable things out of the room—I then went down to open the door and let the neighbours in—I do not know where the prisoner was then—she did not bring any water—she was asked several times to go for water, but she did not bring it—the door of the bed-room was red-hot when I went in the room, but being moved from the flames it went black immediately, in taking away the bed things that were burning, it went out—when I first went into the room the door was open towards the bed—when the prisoner came to the bed-room I heard a chuckle, as I thought—she was putting her apron or pinafore in her mouth, to prevent laughing, and I said to her, "What are you laughing at? is this a time for laughing?"—she said, "I was not laughing, but the smoke stifled me"—there had been no one in that room that morning but the prisoner, after William Garratt left, till my two brothers came home, at half-past 12, and left at I; that was after the second fire—the prisoner was to leave my employ on the following Saturday, and a girl was to succeed her whom I had had before; her name was Jemima—I know there was a jealousy between them—I had told the other girl that if Mary did not mind I should turn her away, and she had told Mary that if she did not mind she should have her place—I traced spots of oil on the sheets—I tasted the blankets afterwards, and found there was turpentine on them, but on the first occasion it was lamp-oil on the sheet, and on the other occasion turpentine on the blankets—the prisoner had told me throughout that it was not with her will that she left me, but her father did not like her being so far from home.</p>

               <p>the back-room—one of my brothers had been sleeping in the back-room for five weeks—then the other brother came, and those two had our room that night—I was in the habit of going to make the bed every morning—there was no particular work to be done that morning more than usual—my brothers were to sleep there again that night—we always breakfasted in the front kitchen—the water-jugs were filled in the morning, when the slops were taken down—I never filled them once that I remember—there is a small garden at our house—I might have gone into the garden about 10 o'clock but I do not remember it—the first time that I went up and smelt anything was about a quarter before 10—that was after the prisoner had been to the Downham-road with my brother—she was about twenty minutes gone—when I went up-stairs, at a quarter before 10, I found a disagreeable smell, and marks that the tick of the wool mattress had been burning—that was in the middle, between the palliasse and the horse-hair mattrass, on the top—I am in the habit of turning the bed up to air it, but not moving it—when I came down, I did not go up again till I smelt the second fire, which was at 12—I then found the sheet over the chair smouldering away very fast—it was not in a flame, but burning as fast as it could—of course I put that out—at a quarter before 3, I went up again, and found the sheets burning, and the door, and the palliasse, and bolster, and mattrass, and bedstead—it was the prisoner's duty to trim the lamp—she did so that morning—she was trimming the lamp while I was reading a letter, about half past 11—it was a large patch that I found on her dress, the size of my two hands—this was an upper room—I have two kitchens, two parlours, and two bed-rooms—I have known the prisoner since January—she appeared very careless and indifferent while all this was going on—she stood about, I thought she was calm and quiet because she was very much frightened, just as I was myself—I sent her to my husband after the fire—that must have been past 4.</p>

I heard Mrs. Jarrett call out in the afternoon—I went to her house and knocked at the door several times, as loud as I could, but nobody came till Mrs. Jarrett herself came—I went up-stairs to the bed-room immediately—the side of the bedstead by the door was all on fire, and the two mattrasses—a gentleman, two doors off, followed me into the house—when Mrs. Jarrett let me in, the prisoner stood by the back-parlour door—I afterwards heard her told to go for water, but I never saw her bring any up—I did not burn any boots in my house that day, or have any burnt—I had nothing but a coal fire.</p>

On Sunday evening, 28th Sept., about half-past 10 o'clock, I was in Leather-lane with Henry Bullen—Graziani, who was on the other side of the street, took a stick out of another man's hands, ran across the road, and hit me on the shoulders with it—this black stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I ran into Mr. Caves's, the King of Prussia, at the corner of the street—they would not let me remain there, and I ran out again, and Graziani struck me on the forehead with the stick which knocked me down, and cut my head open—I got up again directly, and saw Graziani, and also Bardinet, and several other foreigners, and Bardinet stabbed me in the side with a knife—I did not see a knife—I saw him strike me with something, and felt myself stabbed—both the prisoners ran away towards Baldwin's-gardens, where I overtook them, and I there saw the knife with a little boy, who had picked it up—I got my hands cut in the scuffle, while I was on the ground—I was taken to the police doctor, and have been attended by him since—I bled a good deal from the wounds—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shirt I had on—I had seen Bardinet in a public-house about a week before—I had not quarrelled with him, and no words had passed between us on this evening—I have seen Graziani going up and down Gray's-inn-lane; but never had any quarrel with him.</p>

I am the wife of Frederick Brandt, of 115, Fleet-street—the prosecutrix and prisoner came and lived at our lodgings, but I did not see her come—it was some day in April—they slept together that night, and between 7 and 8 o'clock next morning, the prisoner came from up-stairs, with two boxes, and went out with them, say<lb/>ing she was going to the laundress with her washing—she never came back—a few hours after, Miss Diepenheim inquired after her, and I told her she had gone away with the two boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer's labourer, and live at 11 ford. On the evening of 3rd Oct. I was near the Coach and Horses, between half-past 8 and 9 o'clock—I saw the last witness in the road near the Coach and Horses—I saw the prisoner, I had not known him before—it was not quite dark—there are not many lamps about there—I took hold of Mr. Martin's arm, and was leading him along—I led him a little way, and the prisoner overtook us—he put his hand in Mr. Martin's pocket, and pulled out some<lb/>thing; I cannot tell what—he walked on—I followed him, and told the policeman—I saw Mr. Martin go to the Coach and Horses—the prisoner was brought to the Coach and Horses in about a quarter of an hour—I did not go with the policeman—he told me to stand against a lamp-post, and he would bring him back, and he came back with him to where I was—then I went to the Coach and Horses—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been with Mr. Martin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five minutes—I had hold of his arm—I first met with him just before you come to Ilford Gaol, not much above 100 yards from the Rabbits—I took hold of his arm because he was very drunk—I asked him where he was going, and he could not answer me—his trowsers were undone, and were hanging about him—he was down lying on the ground, and there were two females there, who said, "For God's sake assist this man, or he will be robbed"—it was five or ten minutes after that before I saw the prisoner—Mr. Martin was trying to get up, and I took hold of him—the two women left, and came towards Stratford—I did not know them before—they said nothing to me—there were two more persons along with me, but they went away, and would have nothing to do with it—Mr. Martin buttoned up his clothes, as well as he could, in going along—when I went after the prisoner I passed the gaol and the police-station—I did not stop there; I still followed him about 100 yards—I went a little farther than the Lion—I did not speak to him when I got to the Lion—I did not go up to him opposite the Lion and ask him to stand something—I said, "Have you got the money?" and he thing—I did not say, "Come, old fellow, have you got the money?"—I said, "Have you got the money?"</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 315). On Monday evening, 15th Sept., at a quarter to 9 o'clock, I was with Hunt, secreted in a yard, at the back of the Chequers public-house, at Eltham. I saw a wagon of Mr. Shove's, driven by Reeves, and drawn by two horses—Saxby was on the wagon—when they got into the yard, Reeves got down off the wagon, and went and stood by the horse's head—Saxby then threw down four trusses of clover-hay to Chalk<lb/>ling, and counted them as he threw them down—Chalkling was standing close to the wagon—Saxby said to him, "Will you have any more?"—he said, "No"—he then carried the four trusses into the coach-house—he is under<lb/>ostler in the yard—I then came out of my hiding-place, and asked Chalkling the reason why this clover was left in his place—he said, "I know nothing about it, for I am under-ostler"—I then took him with me up to Reeves, who was standing at the horse's head, and asked him the reason of his leaving this clover here—he said, "I know nothing about it;" and in an instant he said, "Oh, it is all right; I am going to receive 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for these four trusses of the clover, for I left five trusses here last Friday night"—I asked Chalk<lb/>ling whether he knew anything about the clover that was in the coach-house besides (pointing to a lump besides the four trusses)—he said, "No; I know nothing about them; for I am the under ostler"—I found twelve trusses in the coach-house, besides the four—I then took Reeves and Chalkling to the station—I afterwards searched the wagon, and found one truss of hay on the top of the load, which was not tied down with the ropes—the four trusses were also not tied.</p>

I said, "For picking pockets"—he immediately put his hand into his right trowsers pocket; I caught hold of it, and pulled out the handkerchief that has been produced—I took him to the station, and he there said he bought the hand<lb/>kerchief in Petticoat-lane.</p>

I saw the prisoners at my bar—my daughter brought me a bad shilling—I told them it was bad, and asked them for a good one—they said they had not got one—Cole then said he was a hardworking man, and wished me to give him back the shilling—I would not, but sent for a constable and gave them into custody and gave him the shilling—the prisoners were searched in my house—Shee<lb/>han struggled very much, and I saw two other pieces of bad money fall from his mouth—three others were afterwards taken from him.</p>

               <p>Williams sleeps in the house—Mr. Rimmer does not, but he lives on Sunday morning, 28th Sept., I got up at 7 o'clock, I was the first person up—I went to the second-floor back-room—I found the door open—it had been open the night before—I had been the last person up the night before—I went to bed about half-past eleven—there was a chest in that room which had contained linen—I saw it about half-past ten on the Saturday-night—it was shut, but not locked—it contained night-shirts, day-shirts, and other things, and two tablecloths—at seven next morning the chest was open, and the things were turned over; I examined and found that two tablecloths were gone—there is a cupboard in that room—the door of it is shut, but not locked—in the morning it was open, and a carpet-bag which had hung up in—that cupboard had been taken down, and thrown down by the clothes—I had seen the contents of the cupboard safe on the Saturday-night—I missed some boots from that cupboard—I could not at that time tell how many, but here were three pairs missing—I have seen one pair since, they belong to Mr. Rimmer—a pair of pumps were also missing—there was a chest of drawers in that room—in the morning one of the drawers was on the floor, and empty—another drawer was open, and the things in it turned over—four or five waistcoats were missing, which had been in that drawer—I think some of them were silk—I had seen them on Saturday; I had opened that drawer to put things away—there were three flannel-shirts missing from that drawer, and a pair of flannel-drawers, and a new silk handkerchief—the waistcoats belonged to Mr. Williams, and the other things to Mr. Rimmer—I had teen them safe on the Saturday night, when I put away the clothes—I afterwards went down stairs, and found the middle window open in the passage, which is between the first and the second-floor—the passage goes along the stair<lb/>case, and there are three windows in it which open on the leads, which go over the circus in the shop, and right back to Collingwood-street; from those leads you could get to Collingwood-street very easily—I cannot say how high they are from the ground—I had seen those windows on the preceding even<lb/>ing the last thing before I went to bed—they were all three snapped—they lift up and fasten with a catch or snap in the middle—the pane under the snap in the middle window had been broken a few days before—any person, by putting their arm through that broken pane, could unfasten the snap very easily—it was that middle window that was open—that passage leads to ill parts of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Francis. I have been there twenty-six years—the prisoner was warehouseman in my masters' employ—it was his duty to sell the goods of Messrs. Francis in the yard—he had a check-book, and when he sold goods it was his duty to make out a check as a bill and receipt if the goods were sold for cash, and give that to the party who bought the goods; and if they were sold on credit, the goods were merely filled in—the counterfoil remained attached to the book—it was his duty to make out a weekly stock-paper—it consisted of the goods that had been sold during the week from the Friday to the Thursday night—he was to enter in the day-book the money and goods sold on credit—he brought the stock-paper and books to me every week—I used to look at the account and receive the money from him—the amount of cash in the stock-paper I compared with the amount in his day-book, and if they agreed I took the balance from him—he paid me at the time—the day-book was the voucher to me for the moneys that had been received by him—I considered that every. thing ought to be entered in the day-book—I looked at the day-book to see what had been received by him—I have the day-book here—I have com<lb/>pared it with the stock-papers from Jan. to Sept.—I have found that the stock-papers agree with the day-book—I do not find any entry in the day-book of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Keith, or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Laycock, or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Beach.</p>
