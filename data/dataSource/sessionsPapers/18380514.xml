I keep the Four Swans, in Bishopsgate-street Eli<lb/>zabeth Starkie lived in my service about five weeks—I suspected her during that time, and on Saturday, the 17th of March, I detected her in stealing some money—she left that evening, and I watched her down to London-bridge, to Tower-street, Leadenhall-market, and various other places—I believe she saw me—I at last traced her to a house in Black<lb/>smith's Arms-place, Whitechapel—I did not see her go into the house—I obtained information there, which led me to No. 8, Lower Chapman-street—I watched that house for several days, day and night, with assistance—on the Thursday I received information, and went and watched there, and in a short time the prisoner came home, he went into the house, came out again, and walked up and down the street twice—he then went into the house again, and brought out two wheels of a truck—he afterwards brought out the rest, and made up the truck—he then sent, his boy on with the truck into Anthony-street, which is just by—he followed the boy there, told him to take the truck up a lane, and while he did so, the prisoner went into No. 5, Anthony-street—he remained in there about five minutes; then came out, walked up and down the street two or three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140006"/>
               <p>times; then beckoned the boy, and the truck was taken to No. 5, An<lb/>thony-street—the prisoner brought out two boxes, placed them on the truck—he then took away the truck himself, and went towards St. Ka<lb/>tharine's Docks—I spoke to Nicholas, a policeman, and we followed him to St. Katharine's wharf—I saw him take the boxes into the wharf, and he gave directions that they should be taken to Hull by the steam-boat—we asked him where he brought them from—he said, "Somewhere out of An<lb/>thony-street"—we asked him what number—he said he was not certain, but he thought it was No. 5 or 6—we asked who they belonged to—he said, "To a woman named Ann Cook"—I asked why there was no direc<lb/>tion on the boxes—he said the woman was following him down, and was going to direct them—they had no direction to them—I then gave him in charge, and the policeman took possession of the boxes—the prisoner said he did not know the woman; that he was merely engaged to bring down the trunks, and she would pay him when she came down—we went to No. 5, Anthony-street, and saw a woman named Chason there—I inquired there about Starkie, but did not find her by Chason's account—I saw her found in the privy of the adjoining house—I left her in charge of a policeman, and went to No. 2, Lower Chapman-street, from where I had seen the truck brought—I saw some property there belonging to a Mr. Browning—I there found a woman named Bell, who has been convicted—she passed as the prisoner's wife—I gave her into custody—the prisoner said that the house No. 2, Lower Chapman-street, was his—I missed a great variety of articles belonging to myself and my guests while Starkie was in my employ.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, the 22nd of March, my attention was directed by the prosecutor to the truck which was drawn by the prisoner—I followed it to St. Katharine steam wharf—he was about taking the boxes out, and I asked Mm when he brought them from—he said from Anthony-street, either No. 5 or 6, he did not know which—I asked him why they were not directed—he said a young woman was fol<lb/>lowing him down to direct them, and they were going to Hull—he was then about telling the man on the wharf that a young woman was coming down, who was going by the Hull steamer—they were asking him about their not being directed—I asked if he knew her name—he said he believed her name was Ann Cook, he did not know any thing about her, he was only employed as porter—I then took him into custody, and took possession of the boxes—they were not locked, but corded together, and nailed down—I afterwards went to the house, No. 5, Anthony-street, and made inquiry of Mrs. Chason—she said she knew nothing about Starkie, but I found her in the privy of the adjoining yard; she could get to that from No. 5, as the palings between the two yards were broken down—I knocked at the privy door several times, but could get no answer—I forced it open, and took her—Sarah Bell was brought to the house, and we took her, Starkie, Chason, and the prisoner, to the station-house, together—I asked Starkie for the keys of the boxes—she said she had no keys to them—I asked if they were locked—she said they were not—she treated them as hers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laundress—I live at No. 5, Anthony-street. I know the prisoner slightly, and also his wile, and Starkie—Starkie passed as the prisoner's sister—I gave her leave to be at my house for a day or two, as she said she wished to be screened from the anger of her husband—when the officers came and applied about her, I denied her being there—I was with her in my parlour when the prosecutor went by</p>

S.' are the property of my late husband"—the articles had been looked at by the prosecutor then—the prisoner replied, "Oh, you d—soft one—if J am asked the question I will tell the truth, in what way the things came to my house, and who they belong to—you have no right to bring any more into It than are really guilty—he also said to her, "All that you say will be given as evidence against you"—Starkie was about saying more, but she took the caution he gave her—they spoke to each other as if they were quite on familiar terms.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 16th of April my suspicions were excited in consequence of what Roe the officer had told me, and I watched Brown, who was charing on the premises—she occasionally came out into Paternoster-row with dirty water, and looked about for somebody—I saw Raisin loitering about the premises, and after some time she approached Brown very closely, and appeared to receive some property from her—I went up and said, "Who is that person?"—Brown said it was a woman who was coming to assist her to-morrow—I took them both up stairs into a room, and got an officer—on Brown was found a comb, and close by her a jewel-case and another comb—the other prisoner was up in another room) and I believe she had managed to get rid of a very handsome comb, and put it into the fire-place—it was found there; and on her person was found some duplicates of our property, but we have ninety people serving in our shop, and it is impos<lb/>sible to swear that goods are not sold—Brown might have taken the pro<lb/>perty without Raisin's knowledge, but Raisin approached her, and I sup<lb/>pose received that handsome comb—she was loitering about, within thirty feet of the house—she could not see Brown take the property.</p>

I went to the Tower, on the 15th of April, about one or two o'clock, to see a soldier, a cousin of mine—I saw the prisoner, and he offered to go with me to a public-house—we did so, and I war to stop there till he fetched my cousin—he came back, and took me to an<lb/>other place, and took me into a room and ill-used me—I had a handkerchief, a ribbon, and a brooch—he took them away from me, and did what he could to me, and then locked me in with another man—he took the handkerchief, ribbon, and brooch away with him—this was not a bad house, it was in the barracks, in the Tower—there were no other soldiers in the room where, he took me—it was between seven and eight o'clock when he let me out of the room—I hallooed "Murder" when I came down.</p>

I did not give him either of these things—he took them from me—my handkerchief was twisted round my hand, and he took it from me—he locked me up in this room with himself and then after he had done with me, he locked me up with another one—I told the other one that the prisoner had ill-used me—the prisoner let me out—I came down, and told a man that I had lost my things, and he had been ill-using me—he asked me if I should know his name—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Was it M'Gann!" and I said, "Yea"—I had beard another man call him by that name.</p>

On the 12th of June last the prisoner pledged a pair of breeches and a waistcoat for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I, at the same time* took in a coat of another person, and advanced 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I laid them all on a pile of goods behind the counter—it was between eleven add four o'clock in the day—the prisoner had a child with her—she was playing with this child, and pretended to let it fall over the counter—I cautioned her, and she went to the door two or three times to speak to her sister—during this time I missed the coat—I knew where she lived, and went to her house, and charged her with it—she came to our house, and I took her into a back room—she made solemn assertions that she had not seen it—on the Saturday following she came to redeem the breeches and waistcoat, and we could not find them—we thought they might be mislaid—I told her td bring her husband, and we would pay for them—she brought a man whom she represented to be her husband, and we paid a sovereign for them—the breeches and waistcoat are here—the coat is not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am colonel of the 2nd Life Guards. I was at the Opera on the evening of Saturday, the 31st of March—between the opera and the ballet, I quitted the stall where I had been sitting, and went to the passage round die pit—as I was going along I felt some one try my coat pocket—I looked round suddenly and saw the prisoner close to me—he had his hat on—that is not very unusual in the pit at the Opera—I passed on about twenty yards—the prisoner followed me—I then went back, and observed the prisoner still following me—I stopped to speak to Mr. Montague, and while speaking to him I felt my pocket, and my purse was there, but I soon found that it was gone—I turned instantly round and collared the prisoner, and said, "You have picked my pocket"—he was close to me—he said I told a falsity, that I was mistaken—the instant I collared him I saw the purse fall on the floor—it appeared to fall imme<lb/>diately from his hand—I picked it up immediately below his hand—I cannot swear that I saw it in his hand—I held him by the collar, and begged Mr. Montague to fetch a police officer—the moment I desired that, the prisoner volunteered to go out of the pit with me—I left go of his collar upon that, and walked with him to the top of the stairs that go down towards the orchestra—directly we got there the prisoner took to his heels and ran down the stairs, through the door into the passage—I ran after him and retook him, just as we came to where the stall tickets are shown—at the very moment that I seized him behind, I believe, the check-taker stopped him before—I have not the least doubt he is the person I had be<lb/>fore—I heard him asked why he had run away—he said he did not wish to be stared at—I had not got hold of him at the time he ran—I delivered my purse to the officer—it contained a £5 note, four sovereigns, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver.</p>

The prisoner was employed as clerk and publisher to the firm at a salary—among other things, it was his duty to receive money for advertisements, and all monies that came to the office, and to put it down in his regular book—he was to account to me every day, or at any moment that he might be required to do so.</p>

Dell, of Macclesfield, was found on him; and another letter, addressed to Miss Potter, Regency-square, Brighton, was taken from his waistcoat-pocket—I looked at the letters—they had the post-mark on them, and were precisely in their present state—other letters were found on him, some of which he should have delivered at two o'clock that day—the one addressed to Miss Potter was on thick paper, and might be mistaken for a double letter—these are the covers of the letters which were found in his pocket, tied toge<lb/>ther—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I think there were eight altogether—they should have been delivered by three o'clock that day—they had been dispatched from London at one o'clock that day, and should have been delivered before he returned to the office—the letter directed to Miss Potter was not tied up with these letters, but the others were tied up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer. On Wednesday, the 18th of April, I went to Kensington, by direction, to watch the prisoner—I saw the mail-cart come up from Hounslow, and stop at the Post-office—I saw the prisoner come out of the office, and go into Mr. Roe's, two doors from the office—I told him to consider himself in my custody, I was an officer—he stood a little while, and I asked him if he had got his letters for delivery—he said yes—he paused a short time, then put his hand into his inside coat-pocket, took a letter out, and said, "God bless me, I have for<lb/>gotten to put this into the bag"—I said, "You must accompany me to the Post-office"—the letter was addressed to "James Somers, Esq., St. John's College, Cambridge"—I took him up stairs to the first-floor, at the Post-office, and commenced searching him—Mr. Smith and Mr. Peacock, the solicitor, were present—in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket I found this letter addressed to "Messrs. Dell"—in his right-hand waistcoat pocket I found several letters tied up, and one not tied up—that one was directed to "Miss Potter, Regency-house, Regency-square, Brighton"—I handed the letters to Mr. Smith, who returned me Miss Potter's letter—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for having these two letters in your posses<lb/>sion?" meaning the two I had taken out of his pocket, directed to Dell and Potter—he said, "I must have taken them up by mistake"—when he gave me the first letter in the shop, and said he forgot to put it into the bag, he said nothing about the letters I found in his pocket—on the 19th, after the examination at Bow-street, Pearce, a brother constable, and myself, took the prisoner to a public-house—his wife was there—we gave him some refreshment, and some money which I had taken from him—his wife complained of Mr. Smith, saying it was all his doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel-road, and keep a cook's-shop. Early on the morning of the 20th of April, the prisoner followed me to my own door—I knocked at my door, and turned round and desired him to leave me—he said he should not leave without something—he made a snatch at my seals, and dragged my watch from my pocket—he ran off—I followed him, and called "Stop thief"—he was stopped by the policeman—I kept him in view till he was stopped, and have not the least doubt of his being the man who did this—the watch was found on him in my presence—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

I heard something fall—I pulled him on one side, and there was the watch—I can venture to say that no person ran by—there was a gas light within five yard, of the place.</p>

On the evening of Friday, the 13th of April, my brother-in-law came to sup with me—we had some beer brought from Mr. Mason's, the Robin Hood public-house—it came in a can, and an empty quart pot with it—I believe Mr. Mason's name was on the pot, but I did not look—my brother left me about ten o'clock at night—I missed the quart pot about twelve o'clock the next morning—I had reason to believe my brother-in-law took it away—I sent for him—he told me something about it, and in consequence of that, he took me to the prisoner's, which is in Church-street, I believe—when I went to the prisoner's place, I knocked at the door—I had my brother-in-law alongside of me—the prisoner said, "Come in"—I went in, and he was sitting by the fire—I asked him whether he had bought a quart pot of this boy, showing him my brother-in-law—he denied it—I asked him again, and the boy spoke up, and said, "You did buy it"—I offered the prisoner the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which the boy said he gave him, and then he said he had bought it, but he had taken it home to the landlord's, and put it into the passage—I requested him to go with me to Mr. Mason's, and we all three went together; and I asked Mr. Mason whether the prisoner had brought a quart pot home to him—he said he had not—the prisoner then said he left it in the passage, and then he said he did not, but if Mr. Mason would let him go home, he would get it—Mr. Mason said be would give him the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pocket if he would give him his pot, and he would go with him and get it—the prisoner said he could not get it without he went by himself—he was then given into custody.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 5th of May, about ten o'clock, I was called into a field of mine at Haggerstone, and saw the deceased and the prisoner—the deceased was on the ground, endeavouring to get up—he got up, and fell down again from intoxication—I said I should give them in charge unless they immediately left the field—they were both stripped to fight—they were going to dress, and the deceased fell again from intoxication, and in about five minutes one of my men endeavoured to dress them, and they went towards the entrance of the field—I heard somebody say "Go it," and turned round and saw Driver reeling from the effects of a blow he must have had from Abbot—I went and parted them—they shook hands, and agreed to go home—I saw no blow struck.</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was passing by Ravenscroft-street, and saw the deceased lying on the pathway in a stupid state, as if he was in a fit—at all events there was a great pressure on the brain—I advised that he should be bled—indeed I would have bled him then, but nobody would assist me with what was necessary—about twelve people were round him—I was called to see him at his own residence the next morning, and bled him—he was then in an almost sinking state—I took about ten or twelve ounces of blood from him—I called again in two hours, and he had just died—I remember seeing a bruise under his cheek, which I thought was the effect of a blow, but I cannot say so—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Monday afternoon—the vessels of the brain were considerably distended with blood, and there were very considerable traces of previous disease in the brain, of rather old</p>

When we came to this country we lived at Mrs. Kerley's—I and Monsieur Laland slept in the same room—there was one room with two beds—I cooked for him, in Mrs. Kerley's kitchen—I remember once, when my master was not at home, Mrs. Kerley and I were sitting in the kitchen—I do not know what month it was in—it was this year—Mrs. Kerley asked me several times whether Monsieur Laland had any money in his boxes, and I replied, "Yes"—Mrs. Kerley asked me if Monsieur Laland was gone to the Post<lb/>office—I said, "Yes"—(it was on a Friday)—she asked me again whether I was quite sure Monsieur Laland's money was in his box—I said, "Yes"—she went into her apartments for some pin, and gave me a glass, and made me sit down by the fire—she said Monsieur Laland had plenty of money in his box, and if I liked to take it she had keys that would open</p>

               <p>it—she got up from her chair, and locked the kitchen door—she gave me two glasses of gin and water before she locked the door—they were good-sized glasses—not very large—the gin stupified me—Mrs. Kerley locked the kitchen door—she made me drink another glass, making three glasses, and then I went to sleep—when I awoke I heard a noise—I went into my master's room, and saw Mrs. Kerley, with Monsieur Laland's money in her hand, and the key, and at the same time she pushed the box under the bed with her feet—he kept his money in a girdle in a box—when I went in, I said to Mrs. Kerley, "You have taken Monsieur Laland's money, and have not left him any"—she said, yes, there was a good deal left; she had not taken all—she said, "Oh, Marie, don't tell Monsieur Laland of my robbing the sovereigns, and ten for you"—she gave me ten—I was not altogether recovered from the effects of the gin—my head was still affected—she gave me the money, and some paper, and told me to put the money into the paper, and the following day we should go to the Borough market and buy a purse—on the evening of the next day we went to buy a purse—it was at a woman's, who sells things in the market—when we arrived there, she said she came to buy a purse to put file money is—I was going to buy one for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but she recommended me to buy one for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which would have two pockets in it, to divide my money—I was going to pay with a sovereign, but she recommended me not; she would give me shilling to pay, which she did—I got home at night, and had some more gin, and oranges, which we bought on the road home—we drank half a pint of gin—I changed a sovereign on Sunday, to buy gin and apples, in he same street—Mrs. Kerley recommended me not to change the sove<lb/>reign where I went for the gin, because my master might go there, and hear of my changing it—she said the next week we would go and buy clothes, and for me to quit my master to go to Jersey—I bought some calico, some flannel, a pair of gloves, and stockings—on Sunday Monsieur Laland spoke to a policeman, who said he would find, as a constable, to come and inquire into it—when I heard of the constable coming I spoke to Mrs. Kerley about it, and said Monsieur Laland had lost a great deal of money, and recom<lb/>mended her to put it back—she said, "You must not tell Monsieur Laland I have taken his money, or we may both be transported"—I cried, and she said, "Don't cry, Marie; never mind"—she did not say any thing else—when Monsieur Laland and the constable were both gone out, Mrs. Kerley old me to put the eight sovereigns which I had, between the sheet and the feather-bed—two sovereigns had been spent—she told me at the same time to put the purse down the privy, as the constable might search her—I gave this account to my master—two weeks passed before I told him, because we had agreed together to divide the money, and go to Jersey.</p>

I was in my shop on the 31st of March when the two prisoners came in—I think it was Tobin called for a pint of porter—I served her, and she paid me a shilling—I think both the pri<lb/>soners partook of the porter—Tobin laid the shilling down on the counter—I gave her a sixpence and fourpence, and put the shilling into the till—it fell in the corner of the till—there was other money at the further end of the till, but none where the shilling fell—I noticed the shilling looked black, but I thought it was dirty—the prisoners drank their beer and went out—in a minute or two Brook the constable came in—he asked to look at the shilling—I marked it and gave it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Tobin</hi>. It rattled against other silver, and if she took it for a good one, it is not likely that she put it into a corner by itself. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It did not rattle against other silver—I put it into a comer by itself.</p>

L."—I found my necklace, which had been taken out of my box in September—the prisoner was going away, and I let her go, but told her I should not pay her wages till I looked over my things—I and my husband looked, and missed a great many things—she came again for her wages—I called her into my bed-room, and asked her if she could give me any account of my things taken in September last—she said she knew nothing about them, and she wished God might strike her dead if she did—I said, "Will you allow me to look into your box?"—she pulled up her gown to search for her key, but I had locked the room where her box was—I then found these things in her box—part of them are mine, and part are Mr. Long's.</p>

I was going out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 8th of May, and saw the prisoner coming out of the prosecutor's parlour—I went into the passage, and said, "What do you want here?"—he said he came from Mr. Jenner's, the dyer's, and he wanted Mr. Jones's office—I detained him—he struggled and struck me—Mrs. Maher came to my assistance—I said she had better go into the parlour, and then she missed these things.</p>

                  </hi>. That is my watch. <hi rend="italic">'Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>.) The first week I was in Mr. Barker's employ<lb/>ment, me and John, Mr. Barker's apprentice, got into conversation about tramping for work, and how much he should like to see the country, and how much he should like to go with me, because, as he said, he though that having travelled two or three times for work I naturally should know the best way of getting an existence on the road, and I told him that if ever I tramped again that I should <hi rend="italic">go</hi> down to my friends in Bris<lb/>tol—we had held a little conversation about tramping several timer during the time that I worked for his master, which was about six weeks About two or three days before I left, he made a proposition to me (<hi rend="italic">having previously heard his master tell me that he should not be able to employ me after the Saturday</hi>.) to tramp with me to Bristol, and if I would go he would lend me his boots to tramp in, because my boots were bad; upon which I left on the Monday—he told me to stop till they were all gone down stairs to their dinners, and then to put on his boots and leave di<lb/>rectly, which I did, and he would meet me at the Black Boy at Windsor on the Tuesday week, with plenty of money. I went straight from there to my lodgings, where there was my fellow lodger, with whom I had been like brothers, and I had, with his consent, the use of his top coat, when he did not want it himself, because my coat was not a very good one. I was not in the habit of asking him for the loan of it every time I wanted it but used to go and take it, as I did on the day in question. I wandered about London for work till the following Monday morning, when, being very short of money, I got a young man to pledge the coat for me, because I had not been in the habit of pledging any thing, and he got me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it I then made the best of my way to Windsor, and got in on Tuesday, where, instead of him meeting me, he sent a young man with the red purse now produced, with a lot of old coins in one end and ten shillings in the other, with the ticket of the watch in a piece of paper, which he sent word was his own, and that his motive for sending them was that I might make money of them to assist me on the road. The young man told me that he was out of work, and he knew John very well, and that he gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and plenty of pastry to eat on the road for coming down. I went down to Bristol, where I called at a place, in Narrow Wine-street, for work, and told them innocently enough my name, where I had come from, and who I had worked for, as I did to the policeman when I was taken.

From information I re<lb/>ceived, I went to No. 10, Kelso-place, Lisson-grove—I went up stairs, into the front room, and saw the prisoner Edward Harding, handing a pot out at the door—I said, "I want you respecting the robbery at Mrs. Heavi<lb/>sides"—he said, "Very well"—I passed him, and went into the room and found the other two prisoners and three females—the two prisoners were lying on the apparently asleep, and the girls with them—I saw this bottle on the mantel-shelf, broken as it is now—I said, "Halloo! how comes this here?"—Edward Harding said, "I do not know any thing about it"—I examined a cupboard in the room, and in it found this clock—I them went to the bed, shook George Harding by the leg awoke him up, and said, "How do you account, for this clock being here?"—he said "A young man brought it her in the morning"—I said, "Who is the young man?"—he shook his head—Elliott said he did not know any thing about it. he only lodged with them—I looked under the bed, and pulled a box out, and there saw some keys—I then went to the window, and beckoned to Reardon, my brother-officer, who was close by—he came, and I left him in charge of the room—on searching Edward Harding in the room, I found son him this piece of paper, which is used to light phosphorous matches—it has been used on the wrong side as if it had been used in the dark—I then handcuffed, them, and conveyed them to the station-house—as we were going along I said, "Who belongs to the room?"—George Harding said, "I do; and my brother lodges with me"—I afterwards returned to the room, and found these six keys concealed on a ledge up the chimney, also this small file, and something which has the appearance of gold-dust—among the ashes I found a screw of tobacco, and in the cupboard a lancet and a box of lucifer matches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of this month, about a quarter to three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty near the prosecutor's shop, which is at the back of Westbourne-ter-race, Paddington—one window looks into a mews—I heard somebody getting over the wall—I stopped about ten minutes or more, think<lb/>ing it was some one stealing plants—I then looked between the cre<lb/>vices of the shutters, and saw the prisoner in the middle of the shop with a light—I saw him take two planes, and put them into a bag which he had—after a while he looked about and got two more., and then took a saw off a nail in the wall—I thought he might be a man who was going to work, and I stood for a minute—at last I saw him get a hammer, a chisel, and a centre-bit or stock, and then put out the night—I expected him to open, the door and come into the mews, but he came up a ladder over the wall—he said, "Halloo," jumped from the wall, and ran away—I got over, and saw him on another wall, and When I got to that, he was over another—Iran after him for about ten minutes, across four or five gar<lb/>dens,</p>

On Friday, the 12th of May, I locked and fastened the shop door about half-past nine o'clock—my attention was drawn to it about six o'clock the following morning, by a policeman, and I then found it unlocked, and the window, which had been closed, pulled down and dipped on one side—there was no fastening to it—these tools were all safe in the shop the night before—these are my shoes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)—they were in the shop.</p>

Will you have the kindness to go to Mr. Laysall, with my best respects, and ask him to have the kindness to lend me seven or eight pounds, or as much as he can spare. I have taken thirty acres of land at Fullham, which I have no doubt will be very profitable. I have got forty pounds to pay down on the 18th of this month. There is ten fat pigs, three cows, two horses on the farm. I have got thirty pounds to take wages and bills at Lady-day, but that will not be enough without I can get the loan of seven or eight pounds. Mrs. Smith, will you have the goodness to send my <hi rend="italic">arrange</hi> bed and bedstead, and all my things, up by Howard's wagon, next Tuesday; and please to go to Mrs. Edwards, and ask Jane if she will have the kindness to lend me three or four pounds. I will return it by Mr. Laysall, when he returns back from London. I will send for Mr. Laysall soon after Lady-day, to settle with him. I should very much like for Mr. and Mrs. Laysall to live with me, but that we will arrange when he comes up: and will you ask him to send me a leg of pork and a country cake. Please to put the money packed up inside the bed; and please to ask Mr. Laysall to pay the carriage, as I shall send a man for it. Please to get Mr. Laysall <hi rend="italic">to</hi> pack the things up for me. Please don't disappoint me in sending the things up on Tuesday, by How<lb/>ard's wagon.

I watched Effingham and Cope—I cannot tell what Cope said, but Effingham wished some silk handkerchiefs to be spread on the counter—she took one piece, and put it under her dress—an officer came in with Barnadine—I then touched Effingham on the shoulder, and told her she had a piece of hand<lb/>kerchiefs—she denied it—I saw it on the ground after it had fallen—I am sure it was not there when I touched her—I am sure it did not fall from the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. Mr. Mew directed me to search the young men's boxes—mine was searched amongst the rest—I collected the keys from the different young men—on opening the prisoner's box, I found this shawl, several pairs of stocking!, and a pair of gloves—the shawl has our shop-mark of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it, and two cards, which were with the stockings in the box are marked 221/2—the shawl would have the shop-mark on it when sold—I cannot say it was not sold, but it is my belief it was not—the stockings were open, and loose in the box, not done up as those in the shop—they are all new, and have never been worn—I cannot swear to their being Mr. Mew's property, but the cards which were in the box with them belonged to the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, and am a furniture-broker. The prisoner was in my service for about nine months—on Thursday, the 12th of April, about two o'clock, I went to look for him in a stable behind my house, and found him there—there was a mare there—(<hi rend="italic">here the witness described having found the prisoner in a certain situation</hi>)—I stood a minute or two, and then said, "You scoundrel, what are you doing? do you want to get yourself hanged?" and told him I certainly would tell my son, who was his master, when he came home—he said be had not been there a minute-nothing more passed—I came out of the stable, and he went to his work—(my son was gone out on business, and did not come home till twelve o'clock at night)—the prisoner was at work in the front shop—there is a parlour behind the front shop which opens into the shop-about four o'clock in the afternoon, I sat down to take tea to that parlour, the prisoner was then in the shop alone—I had taken two cups of tea and put some sugar into a third cup—I use moist sugar-be<lb/>fore I poured any tea into the cup, the prisoner called me into the shop, where I found a customer—I am sure I left nothing in the cup but that sugar I had put into it—there was a bottle of stuff which I use to take stains out of mahogany, on the sideboard—I produce the phial—it has a label with the word "poison" pasted on it—it had been there all the time the prisoner was there, and was often used—he has seen it used—I do not know whether he can read—I have pointed it out to him to be careful, that it would burn any thing, even wood, if it was left too long—I saw the contents of the phial on the Saturday, and had it in my hand that evening before this, just at dusk—the liquid then came up even with this first letter on the label, as near as I could see—I was not out of the house that even<lb/>ing, nor the following day—the stuff had not been used that day at all, nor the day before—I went down the yard with the customer, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I was gone about half an hour-nobody could go into the parlour without the person in the shop knowing it—I was in the yard and nobody could come in that way-when I returned, the prisoner was in the shop—he did not tell me of anybody having been there during my absence—I sent him down the yard with the customer for a screw, and I went into the parlour—I looked into my cup and perceived a liquid in it, which I knew I had not put in—I waited a few minutes to consider, and being certain I had put nothing but the sugar in, I filled the tea-cup up with tea, and put the milk into it—I stirred it up—I noticed it looked a dark colour, and the milk curdled—I poured it into the saucer, and took a whole mouthful—it tasted very pernicious indeed—I spat it out di<lb/>rectly—I did not swallow any of it—I noticed a sediment round the saucer exactly the same as is hanging round the bottle—I do not think I could have swallowed any of it—I did not keep it long enough in my mouth, it was too nasty—I went into the shop, and asked him what he had been doing to the tea-cup—he said, with an oath, that he had not been into the room since I had gone—I told him I was sure he must have done it, and nobody else—he denied it again in the same way—I called over the con<lb/>stable, who lives over the road, and gave him the cup, with what remained in it, to take to a chemist-while he was gone, I went to look for the bottle, which I found in the same place on the sideboard, but all the contents were gone—the constable returned, and said, in the prisoner's pre<lb/>sence, that there was poison in the cup—the prisoner did not say a word—I</p>

On the morn<lb/>ing of Sunday, the 5th of November, I saw the prisoner Hutchinson, with another young man, in my public-house at Watford—they came there about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—that is about eleven miles from Uxbridge—they went into the tap-room-a person named Thomas Green applied to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I lent him—I went into the tap-room about five minutes afterwards, and saw the prisoner, and another young man sitting in company with him, close to one another—the prisoner was sitting close to Green—I did not see any thing pass between them—the prisoner and his companion had some beef-steaks, and then went away a little before ten o'clock-in consequence of suspicion I entertained, I sent for two constables, bat they came too late to stop them, or I should have had them detained on suspicion of a murder at Hertford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in the Strand. On the 8th of March Vincent came to my shop—he stated his name was Wittenham, and that he had just taken a shop for the purpose of his wife commencing a</p>

               <p>little business in Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane, and that he himself was a bookbinder by trade—he said the trade in this shop was for his wife, and that he was about commencing the next morning—I went to the shop, and from the appearance of it, and his representations, I supplied him with a variety of articles in the grocery and Italian line—the whole amount was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first parcel he had was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and before I supplied him with that he said his account should be paid regularly every Monday, but I was never paid any thing. I let two Mondays go by in consequence of a representation made by Wittenham, who called on the first Monday, and said his uncle would be very much obliged to me, as he had a large order to execute, if I would let the account stand over till the Thursday—I said yes; but they did not call—the last time I supplied them with goods was on Saturday, the 24th, and on the Tuesday following I went, but the shop was shut, and all things cleared away, and many of the fix<lb/>tures of the shop were removed—I never was paid any thing at all.</p>

Yes, Mr. William Mason. A. After they had gone in, was the door closed or not? A. It was nearly closed-not latched. Q. Do you mean that it was ajar? A. It was a panel door, with a catch to it. Q.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140168"/>
               <p>that the catch was not fastened? A. No, it was not fastened. Q. Did either you, or Wall, or Plant make any observation? A. Wall did. Q. In consequence of what Wall said to you did you go any where; did you place yourself any where? A. Yes, we went close to the door. Q. Wall said something to you, no matter what; but in consequence of what he said to you, you and Wall, and Plant went close <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the door? A. Yes, Q. Did you hear Mr. Mason say any thing to Mr. Miller? A. I did. Q. What did he say? A. He said that there had been expended, Q. Can you give the precise words of the conversation—was it that there had been 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expended, or that there would be 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expended? A. He said that 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been expended, as near as I can recollect. Q. Well, go on? A. And then he said he wanted 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to buy seven score burgesses, or else Mr. Miller would lose his election, which was just, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece. Q. Did Mr. Mason, at the time that he said 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been ex<lb/>pended, say any thing else? A. I cannot recollect whether he did or not. Q. Perhaps you had better tell the Committee, from beginning to end, in your own way? A. He said he wanted 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy seven-score burgesses; and Mr. Miller made this reply, "I do not know how it is, Mr. Mason, when I go to a poor man to solicit him for his vote, I get bron<lb/>beated in a most shameful manner," which I know he has, for I have he and it myself—I have heard him <hi rend="italic">brow-beaten. Q.</hi> What do you mean by bron<lb/>beaten? A. When there has been a promise of any thing, it has not come forward, and Mr. Mason has pocketed the affront? Q. Can you tell me what Mr. Miller said? A. He answered, and said, he must not lose him election for the sake of that much money—he said, "I wish I had never coalesced with Mr. De Horsey." Q. After that, what did you do? A. After that, when we heard that—it was not me who rushed into the room first, but Wall; and he saw us, and Mr. Mason put his hand into his pocket and offered us a half-crown to drink his health, and we refused to take it. Q. Who was it that went into the room? A. I believe Wall—I saw them both in. Q. Did Plant go into the room? A. I do not know whether it was Well or Plant. Q. Who was it that offered you the half-crown? A. Mr. Mason. Q. Did he open the door? A. It was open. Q. But so as to admit of his going in? A. Yes. Q. When the door was open, did you see who was in the room? A. Yes, Mr. Miller and Mr. Mason. Q. did you see any one else in the room? A. No.</p>

A, No, half a crown among us—he put his hand into his pocket, and offered us all three the half-crown, and we refused to take it. Q. You said you did not go into the room? A. When Plant and Wall went into the room and rushed upon them, Mr. Mason and Mr. Miller came out, and in the lobby Mr. Mason offered us a half-crown. Q. Then you had gone into the room? A. I am not certain whether Wall or Plant had—we were all closed to the door. Q. Did the other parties who went into the room come out? A. Yes. Q. And half-a-crown was offered amongst you all three? A. Yes. * * * * * * * *</p>

I can point him out in this room—he is there—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to a gentleman, Mr. Miller, to he stood behind the learned counsel</hi>.) Q.

Yes, you went there, but how came you to go? A. I went to their, the same as the other electors do. Q. And you were in and out as the other electors were? A. I do not know that I had any curiosity for going. Q. How came you to go up stain? A. Because he spoke up stairs. Q. I thought you told us that you heard him speaking out of the window? A. I was up stairs in the room. Q. Then there can be no mistake about it, that you were in the room when he spoke, in the very same room, on the Saturday night? A. Yes. Q.

We saw them go in, and we went to the door to tee if we could not hear some conversa<lb/>tion—it was through what Wall said—he said, "Let us go and hear some<lb/>thing," Q. What did Wall say? A.

Are you positive that Mr. Miller said that about being brow-beaten, that it was his word, and not yours? A. Yes. Q. you understood what it meant? A. Yes, I have heard of it since. Q.

                  <hi rend="italic">Committee. Q.</hi> You must be good enough to tell us again? A. "I do not know how it is, Mr. Mason; when I go to solicit a poor man's vote I get brow-beaten about in a shameful manner which is truth. Q. Were those the words he used? A. Yes.</p>

After the conversation was over, I understand you to say one of your fellows rushed in? A. Yes. Q. If you went there to listen, why did you do that. A. If you were talking in a room I should like to know what it was about—the door was <hi rend="italic">half-cocked</hi>, as we call it in Staffordshire. Q. If your object was to hear what passed, how came you to rush in, and not hear the con<lb/>versation? A. Because we thought we had heard enough. Q. Who then went in? A. Either Wall or Plant, I cannot say which. Q. You must tell me? A. I would not tell a lie. Q. You must tell me which of these two persons it was? A. To the best of my knowledge, I think it was Wall. Q. Have you any doubt whether it was Wall? A. I think I have not; but I cannot positively say which, but it was one of them. Q. Did I Wall say any thing when he got into the room? A. He said something but I cannot justly say what. Q. And then Mr. Mason rushed out on the lobby? A. Yes, and offered us half a crown amongst us. * * * * * * * <hi rend="italic">Committee. Q.</hi> What sized room was it where the speeches were made at the Castle; was it as large as this room, or was it smaller? A. Nearly about the same. Q.

And you stopped to hear the speeches? A. Yes. Q. How soon after Mr. Miller and Mr. Mason left the room was it that you left? A. It might be half an hour or less; it was between nine and ten o'clock when I left. Q. Did you leave the room half an hour after yon saw Mr. Mason and Mr. Miller leave? A. It might be. Q. If you left half an hour after them, how was it you saw them go into that bed-room? A. Mr. Miller left the room as soon as he had made his speech. Q.

But you could not see him go into the bed-room if he had left? A. I never left the house. Q. Did you stop in the room when you had heard the speeches for any time? if so, for what time after you saw Mr. Miller and Mr. Mason leave that room in which these speeches were made? A. We stopped in the room a little while, but I could not say exactly how long. Q. And if you stepped out of the room you went out upon the staircase? A. We did, on the lobby. Q. And when did you see them go into the bed-room on the left-hand of the lobby? A. It was soon after the speech was made; about half an hour, or thereabouts. * * * * * Q. Can you tell the Committee whether it was a dark or a light passage? A. It was in the evenings between nine and ten o'clock. * * * * * Q.

                  </hi>. I am Member of Parliament for the Borough of Newcastle, in Staffordshire. I have represented that Borough in tour Parliaments—I was a candidate at the last General Election in July, 1837—Mr. De Horsey and Mr. Badnall were the other candidates.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Horsey and myself was of the same political interest, and Mr. Badnall, I believe, was on the opposite interest—the dissolution of Par<lb/>Diament was on the 17th of July, and I arrived at Newcastle on Tuesday night, the 18th—I proceeded to canvass the electors on Wednesday morn<lb/>ing, and continued doing so during that day—I first addressed the electors in a speech on the Wednesday evening alter the canvass, from she Castle hotel, where the friends of Mr. De Horsey sad myself used to assemble—I took up my quarters in the town, at the house of Mr. William Mason—I lived and slept there all the time I was at Newcastle—I have a residence in Scotland, and one in Buckinghamshire, where I generally reside—I slept at Mr. Mason's, on the Wednesday night after I had made my first speech to the electors, and every night while I was in the place—I can<lb/>vassed again during the Thursday, and again addressed the electors, very shortly I believe, in the evening, from the Castle—on the Friday, I again canvassed during the day, and in the evening went with Mr. De Horsey and several other gentlemen, to the Theatre—I did not address the electors on Friday evening—I went direct from the Theatre to Mr. Mason's house-no speech was made during that day by me—the nomination was on the Saturday, I think, at eight o'clock in the morning—Mr. De Horsey and myself went to the nomination, and when we had been proposed and se<lb/>conded, we addressed the electors in the Town-hall—I should think it was then a little after nine o'clock, or between nine and ten—the whole business was over early—after that business was over, I again pro<lb/>can remember, about five o'clock, which Mr. De Horsey, and a number of other gentlemen, I should think fifteen or more—we dined in a large back room on the first floor—I left the Castle, I should think, soon after six o'clock, from six to half-past six—it could not possibly because much as half-past six o'clock—I do not think it was so late—it certainly was not so late as seven o'clock—we then went and canvassed a few voters who Q. Now after leaving the Castle hotel between six and seven o'clock, on the Saturday evening of the nomination, did you again return to the Castle at all that night? A. Not at all that night—after leaving the dinner, I con<lb/>tinued canvassing the electors little more than an hour, I should think, per<lb/>haps an hour and a half—it might be an hour and a half-till about eight o'clock—I cannot distinetly remember what part of the town we canvassed—we passed through several streets, going over rather more ground that the Saturday evening of the nomination,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140172"/>
               <p>as it was only to call on persons who were not at home before—on an canvassing ceasing for that evening, I went to Mr. William Mason's, at whose house I was residing-to the best of my knowledge it could not be so late as half-past eight o'clock when I got there—I think it was about eight, or, perhaps, ten minutes after eight o'clock—it was from eight to half-past eight o'clock, certainly not later—I found Mrs. Mason at home, and took tea with her in the drawing-room—I did not go out of Mr. Mason's house again all that night—I went to bed early, between ten and eleven o'clock—soon after ten I should think—I am quite sure, that after arriving there I did not go out at all—I am quite certain that the day of which I am speaking was the Saturday before the election, the day of the nomination, for on that Saturday I dined at the Castle, but on every other day I dined at Mr. Mason's—the polling was on the Monday—it was over much before four o'clock—I was at the head of the poll—the Nos. were for myself 669 or 667-635 for Mr. De Horsey-and 292 for Mrs. Badnall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have given this account of what took place during the Saturday, I must now ask you, in point of form, did you address the electors, or make any speech from any room in the Castle on these Saturday evening of the nomination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not—I was not there at all between nine and ten o'clock—I did not on that evening go from any room in the Castle hotel into a bed-room on the left-hand side of some stairs, or any other bed-room—I was not followed into any bed-room, nor was I in any bed-room with Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Mason say to you that there had been 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expended and that he wanted 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to buy seven-score burgesses, or else you would lose your election? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not, or any thing of that kind, at any time or place, not that sum or any other sum—I did not say, in answer to that, "I don't know how it is, Mr. Mason, when I go to a poor man to solicit high vote, I get brow-beaten in a most shameful manner"—I never said that, or any thing of the kind—I did not say to him, on any sum of money being mentioned, that I must not lose my election for the sake of that money, nor any thing to that effect-nothing of the kind was ever said by me—I never said I wished I had never coalesced with Mr. De Horsey, nor any thing to that effect—on the contrary, I was perfectly satisfied with the coalition as advantageous to both parties. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did such an occurrence as this ever take place, that you being with Mr. Mason in a bed-room, or any other room in tae Castle hotel, a person named Wall rushed in on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No-certainly not-nor Galli<lb/>more or Plant—they neither of them ever found me and Mr. Mason toge<lb/>ther any where in the Castle hotel—Mr. Mason did not, in my presence come out of the room into the lobby, and, offer them half a crown, or any other sum of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard the alleged statement upon which I put the seven last Questions to you—I ask you, is there one word of truth in any one part of that statement, as far as relates to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as relates to me, there is not one word of truth in it—it is wholly false—that, nor any thing of the kind ever took place between me and Mr. Mason, or between me and any other person—it is my firm belief, that at the last election no person was bribed, or illegally treated in any way on my behalf.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140173"/>
               <p>is the fifth—my political principles are Conservative—they have always been Conservative or Tory—I never sat for the borough of Newcastle as a Reformer—I never sat on any other principles than I now do—I have been a Tory all my life—I have been a member of the Carlton Club ever since it was established.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not now know, Mr. Miller, that bribes were given at former elections on your behalf for the borough of Newcastle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know it—I have never taken the management of any election.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not money of yours at the previous elections for the borough: of Newcastle been, to your now knowledge, applied to bribe voters; and have you not sanctioned that conduct by the payment of that money afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe that the payment of money after an election, even if I suspect some part of it has been improperly applied, implies a sanction of that application—I have not known that any money I have paid has been applied to purposes of that kind—I never had any thing to do with the settlement of any account as to what should or should not be paid—it has been entirely in the hands of my agent, who, without consulting me, has paid or not paid what be thought proper—Mr. Murray, in London-street, was my sole agent, I believe, at all the elections—I will swear he was at all except one, and I believe he was at that one also—that I believe was the second contest I stood, in 1831—I do not know whether he was down there, but he acted as my agent, and he is the only party with whom I have transacted business in settlement of the accounts at all the elections—I always considered him my sole agent—I communicated with him con<lb/>fidentially on all the circumstances—he was my only agent, to my know<lb/>ledge—he was the only person I considered as my agent—my reason for qualifying the answer is, I think I have heard one or two legal gentlemen were employed during the election, and it might have been supposed they were my agents, but I did not so consider them—I will certainly swear I had no agents but professional agents—I believe I have never paid a farthing to any other person than professional agents at any of the elections—I never paid money to, or settled accounts with, Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you authorised Mr. Mason to pay monies on your account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I may have authorised him to pay such things as subscriptions to cha<lb/>rities in the town, and things of that kind-at the last election, when I left his house, I requested bin to pay my private bill for post-horses at the Castle, which, I believe, was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I was short of money—I had given my purse to some ladies who passed through, and I believe I bor<lb/>rowed two sovereigns of Mr. Mason, for I had not enough to take me on to Stockport—that was the only instructions I gave him to pay money at the last election-to the best of my recollection, I never authorised him to pay money on my account at any election; hut, of course, for small things, like the post-horses, it is impossible my recollection can go through the four elec<lb/>tions—they might be such sums as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe I have never au<lb/>thorised him to make any payment for me whatever for what can be called election purposes-as I said before, in going over the four preceding elec<lb/>tions, there may be something which entirely escapes my recollection; but I certainly, on my oath, have no recollection of ever having Commissioned him to pay any sum of money whatever connected with any election, nor any money for me, except, I believe, subscriptions to charities, and the post-horses at the last election—I would wish to state, in addition, that I think, probably, when I have been at his house before, perhaps he has</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be so good as to give me the names of your last committee at New<lb/>castle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word, I cannot give you that, for I do not know—these was a committee <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi>—there were a few gentlemen that were called the committee on the occasion of the coalition between me and Mr. De Hot<lb/>sey—they were stated to be the committee for both, but I have been told that those gentlemen took no part whatever in the election—I cannot re<lb/>member their names—I believe Mr. Mason was one, but I am not sure—he sometimes accompanied me on my canvass—he was certainly an active supporter of mine—he is a man of considerable influence in Newcastle—I recollect one or two of my most active supporters objecting to their name being put on the list of the committee, and I do not recollect whether Mr. Mason's name was put on—I rather think it was—I think he was one of the committee—I have some doubt, or I would not express it—I am not Quite certain, but I think he was one of the number—I think Mr. Joseph Bailey was one, and Mr. Leicester—Mr. Hall was the chairman; but, in answering to their names, I do it not so much from my own recollection of any thing about them at the time, bat from having heard the evidence given before the Committee of the House of Commons, and having my memory refreshed by that—it is not from any recollection of my own that I answer the Question of Mr. Bailey and Mr. Leicester being on the committee, but from having heard the proceedings, which satisfies me they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you attend the committee-room at Newcastle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. De Hor<lb/>sey and I were present in a large room at the Castle hotel, with thirty on forty other persons, when it was proposed that various gentlemen should be named as on the committee of the Red and Blue party,-and it Was pro<lb/>posed that Mr. Hall should be chairman—I was present, but I unhesitat<lb/>ingly answer, that there was no business done by that committee, further than a declaration that the coalition should be generally announced in the town, and I never was at any committee meeting at Newcastle from that hour—I never attended a committee afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the persons named on that occasion Mr. Mason, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Hall, Mr. Eardly, and Mr. Hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have mentioned with regard to Mr. Leicester and Mr. Bailey, I have no certain recollection myself though I have no doubt about it, having ascertained it since-with regard to Mr. Eardly and Mr. Hand I remember still less—the only one I can positively and unhesitatingly swear to, from my own knowledge at the time is, Mr. Hall, who certainly was on the committee—I remember him, as he was named our chairman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have given us the number of the voters who polled at the elec<lb/>tion, did the prisoner vote for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember—I have been told he did—I believe he did—I have no doubt I canvassed him—I have no particular recollection of every one, among nearly a thousand elec<lb/>tors-unless I had seen him vote I could not tell—I believe he voted for me, as I have been told so since—I believe the number of the constituency of Newcastle is nearly a thousand-of that number there are freemen and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. householders—I do not know what proportion the freemen bear to the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. householders—I should suppose there are eight hundred, probably, on the roll as freemen, but a great number of them are also householders-about six-eighths or eight-tenths of the whole, I should say, at least, are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140175"/>
               <p>freeman—Mr. Badnall and Mr. De Horsey were the two who had the majority by the show of hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you have the kindness to tell me any one voter's house to whom you went after half-past six or seven o'clock on the Saturday night before the election? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Indeed I cannot tell you the name of one—I left the looking after them always to the gentlemen who were with me—I know the Lower-street—I do not exactly know where I went that night—I went some distance from the Castle, but what streets I went round I cannot tell—I will not undertake to say I was not in the Lower-street, or whether I was in Church-lane, I have canvassed the town so often—I have always had gentlemen with me, and remember very little of the relative situations of the Streets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you were not in Church-lane after half-past eight o'clock, that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have told you before I am confident I was at Mr. Mason's before half-past eight—I certainly think I may swear I was not in Lower-street and Church-lane after half-past eight, for it is my full conviction I was at Mr. Mason's at a quarter half-past eight at the latest; but if it should be a minute or two later than I suppose, I do not like to swear to a thing of which I am not positive; but it my full belief that I was nowhere but at Mr. Mason's house after half-past eight o'clock—I should certainly say it is impossible that I should have been both in Lower-street and Church-lane, after half-past eight o'clock—I do not remember whether the road from one or the other is to Mr. Mason's, but I do not believe I was out so late—I will not swear to a minute or two, because I did not look at my watch, and had no thought of any subsequent examin<lb/>ation on the subject; and my recollection being first called to matters of time and place, for many months afterwards; at the same tinge, as this was the 22nd of july, a month after the longest day, and as we had not candles at first after my goings into Mr. Mason's, I conceive it was not after the time I mention—we sat by daylight, after I arrived at Mr. Mason's-whether that could be on the 22nd of July in that latitude, I cannot say—I think I have answered positivery whether I was in Lower-street or Church-lane after half-past eight o'clock-for take reasons I have stated, and those only, cer<lb/>tainly I can swear I was not-from the reasons I have stated to you, but not from any recollection of the circumstances through every hour previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You must give me an answer one way or other; will you swear po<lb/>sitively, without say qualification, that you were not in Lower-street and Church-lane after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have given tae qualifica<lb/>tion with regard to the state of the light, supporting the reasons for my recollection—I will swear positively I believe I was not—I shall give you no other answer—I firmly believe I was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you on your oath whether you were not in the Royal Express public-house after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath I do not know that there is a public-house in Newcastle called the Royal Ex<lb/>press—I believe I was not in any public-house after half-past eight o'clock—I have no recollection that I was—I can answer toe question no more positively—I was in various houses that night—I have no knowledge of leaving any public-house after half-past eight o'clock with several other peo<lb/>ple, and going into Lower-street and Church-lane—I certainly did not leave any public-house after that time to go and canvass—I do not know the di<lb/>rection in which I went canvassing—I nave no recollection of being in any public-house, but I was in some eight or ten houses on that short canvass—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140176"/>
               <p>may have been in a public-house, and I may have been in a public-house approaching that time; but I believe it is very unlikely that I was in any house, except Mr. Mason's, after ten minutes after eight o'clock—I do not know a man named Boot—I have not the least recollection of canvassing a man of that name at a public-house of which he was the tenant—I can give no other answer—I can swear to my full conviction that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you without Qualification. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But I will only answer you with a qualification—it is my full conviction, on my oath, that I did not canvass the man you mention, nor any other man so late as half-past eight o'clock—it is my full conviction I am correct as to time, but I know the mistakes which are made as to a few minutes, and I will not on oath say—I did not afterwards accompany any person that night arm-in-arm into the Castle hotel—I do not recollect whether I passed by the Roebuck hotel that night—it is not at all unlikely I might, but I do not remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pass by the Roebuck hotel that night after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will answer that with the tame Qualification as I have an<lb/>swered your former questions—I believe I had taken up my quarters of Mr. Mason's at a quarter or at the latest twenty minutes after eight o'clock, but for ten minutes or so I am unwilling to swear positively—I will swear positively I did not pass the Roebuck at nearly nine o'clock that night—I have told you before the means I had of knowing the time—I did not look at my watch, but the general appearance of the afternoon—I had no other means of knowing the time—I might look at my watch, but I have no recollection of doing so—I will swear most positively that, I did not address one word to the crowd that night from the Castle, nor on the day before—it was nearly dark at half-past eight o'clock—I do not dis<lb/>tinctly remember, but it was so light that we had not candles when I first went into Mr. Mason's; and as it is darker in-door than out, it was most likely we should have had if it was approaching dark—it was getting darker, of course, at eight o'clock-if this was the 22nd of July, and at the same hour of the afternoon, I could swear more accurately than I do now—I will swear I believe I was not out after the time I have named—I can give no other answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you were not in company with Mr. Mason in the Castle hotel that night when it was nearly dark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I will most positively—I did not enter the Castle hotel with Mr. Mason and several others after seven o'clock—I quitted it after dinner, and did not enter again—I did not enter it after seven o'clock that night—I did not address the people on the outside from the Castle that night, and state that I was much fatigued, and hoped the burgesses would be at the poll the first thing on Monday morning-nor did I then wish them good night—I did not do so between nine and ten o'clock, and nearer ten than nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you canvassing in the High-street that night after eight o'clock, or after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I must give you the same answer to that as I gave with respect to the other places—I believe I did not canvass after about ten minutes after eight o'clock, and about that time, and with the same qualification as the similar questions I answer that—I will under<lb/>take to say, I was not seen by one, two, three, four, five, or six persons after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With the qualification I have given before, I certainly answer that—I firmly believe not—I am not certain whether the expenses of the last election have been fully settled</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140177"/>
               <p>or not—I pay the expenses ultimately myself—I have paid a sum of money for the last election—I believe I have paid the expenses of the last election—I have not had any account of them communicated to me—I expect to receive them from the same gentleman I mentioned before—we expect he will give some statement of what he has paid; but hearsay is not evidence, or I could give you hearsay—I rather think I have paid the full expenses of the last election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, what were the whole expenses, including every thing you paid, for the election before this one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word I cannot recollect—I have paid for four elections, and the accounts have often been settled some little time afterwards, and some of them may have been, in some degree, mixed—it is impossible to say exactly—it would even put me to some trouble, if I went home and calculated the communications I have received on the subject—it is really a difficult question to answer, without I might qualify it, by stating, at least some portion of what I was informed those expenses were for-if I am expected to answer the question as nearly as I can, I wish to state, at former elections there was as I have been informed—(I never sanctioned any thing of the kind,) but I have been informed it was the practice at Newcastle, as it is in most boroughs, I believe, for the friends of the candidates to give liquor to voters in public-houses—that has been done, I apprehend, extensively, and to that way, considerable sums may possibly have been expended—that is, as I have been informed—I do not conceive that any species of treating is legitimate—I have not considered myself responsible for the mode in which the accounts, were settled—my agent has paid what accounts he considered it right to pay, and such, I suppose, as he considered it right to refuse, he has refused—I have only paid in that way—I never made any exact statement of what I paid for the election preceding the last—I think the whole expenses, including legal assistance, and all matters, were some<lb/>thing less than 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for the election immediately preceding this—I believe it was not more than 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not undertake to swear it—I will swear it was not 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I do not believe it was 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say it was not 2500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I be<lb/>lieve I have not paid 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that election—I cannot remember what I paid—I believe it was nothing near it—I will swear I did, not pay 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor my thing near it—I have several accounts at different times of differ<lb/>ent sums that were wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they written accounts, or merely verbal statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think my agent may have written to me to desire me to remit a sum of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We want to know whether you have had rendered to you any account, detailing to you the items of the expenses of the election? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word, I am not sure whether I have or not; but I will give, one answer to the question, which you will perhaps be surprised to hear; if I have had any account rendered, which I do not remember, I have not read it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that because you were perfectly well aware of the practice at Newcastle to pay the voters money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—I am not aware, indeed, that it is the practice—I have never scruti<lb/>nised what the money was paid for—I have given my agent such sums as he said he ought to pay for the election; and at times it has not been paid by myself, for a friend has even done it unknown to me; but I must say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140178"/>
               <p>no person ever paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for any election of mine but myself, ultimately, to my knowledge—I have not had a person to act for me for the purpose of preventing any legal knowledge of the fact of paying voters—I have told you I had an agent-nobody else was authorised by me—I know Mr. Christie—he never paid any sums of money for me, except in the way I have said-when I have not had money at my banker's in London, he has several times advanced sums connected with the election, and other sums I wanted to advance money for-if I had said to him, "Be so good as to pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," or any sum, to this person or that, he would have done it—Mr. Christie does not live at Newcastle—he is not connected in business with Mr. Mason—he is a hatter—they deal together, but I understand there is no connexion-not like partnership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I will not fatigue you by going through the three previous elec<lb/>tions, but I ask you to tell me what the borough has cost you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have pretty much the same difficulty in answering—I do not know of any practice of paying voters 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a head—I never heard of it—I have heard of such a practice; but certainly I disavow, on the part of the borough I re<lb/>present, that any such corrupt practices existed—I believe it has been the practice, after the election for a member of Parliament, for each of the mem<lb/>bers, or some of their friends, to give a dinner to the principal voters; and it has been usual for all the candidates, winners or losers, to give, after the elec<lb/>tion, half a sovereign to every elector, who chooses to accept it, who does not attend the dinner—I do not know that I can tell what the borough has cost me—I can give you my belief with regard to the cost of the last election—I suppose, altogether, the borough has cost me something like 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it has not cost so much as 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that positively—that sum has not been expended on my elections, to my knowledge—I have made no calculation; but when you take a round sum, which I know greatly to exceed the truth, I can swear positively to it; but if you go into detail, it is not possible to answer—I do not believe 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been expended-you must give me a quarter of an hour in another room, if I had the accounts, to bring the thing in some degree to my memory—it has not cost me any thing like 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it has not cost me 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it has not cost me 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will not swear it has not cost me 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the last election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that include the half-guinea you have spoken of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is more than I know of—I have not been furnished with any account of the last election—Mr. Christie advanced money for me—I paid him 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be<lb/>fore I went out of town, saying, "If you should be called on for any mo<lb/>nies on my account, I give you that in hand;" and I have been informed he paid that exact sum to my agent—I do not expect to have to pay move—I will swear I do not expect to have to pay much more—I do not know of any practice in the borough of paying the voters 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece—I have heard of such practices, but not of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now have you not paid your election expenses on the footing of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece, being given to certain electors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not paid it on any such footing—I have paid the account in the lump, on the credit and re<lb/>sponsibility of my agent, without ascertaining whether there was any money paid to voters for votes, or not—I have not examined into the ex<lb/>penses minutely or attentively, and do not know to what purposes they were applied, but I was told the chief sums spent at former elections were for publicans' bills—I was told upwards of £2000.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140179"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The question is, whether you have paid money, under<lb/>standing it to be applied to the payment of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you preferred this prosecution, and expected to be examined here, did you not consider it probable you would be asked whether you had participated in any bribing of voters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I did-no money was applied for that purpose to my knowledge—I attended be<lb/>fore the Grand Jury to prefer this bill at the last Sessions, I believe—I cannot say that I directed my attorney to apply for a certiorari to remove the case from this Court to a superior Court—I believe he did make such an application, but it was without any instructions from me to that effect—it was made without my knowledge—I heard that it was refused—I was in the Committee-room of the House of Commons, when Mr. Austin ad<lb/>dressed the Committee in reply—I could not be examined myself as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know any thing of the Mr. Baileys, who you are not quite sure were on your committee, taking a bag with above one hundred sovereigns in it to the Slipper public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of it—I heard Mr. Joseph Bailey examined before the Committee of the House of Commons, on the subject-if any such sum has been expended on my account, which is more than I know, I take it, that is the way in which, probably, some part of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was expended, but I have not the slightest knowledge of it, more than I have been given to understand, at former elec<lb/>tions it was the practice-if any such sum has been expended, some part of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has gone to pay it—I have not ascertained that any money has been paid to the voters—I have assurances from all quarters, that nothing has been spent in bribery, but I have no knowledge of any transaction connected with it—it is all hearsay.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know Mr. Holmes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is a member of the Carlton Club—he is known as the whipper-in of the Con<lb/>servatives—I have not conversed with him particularly on the subject of this prosecution, any more than I have with a hundred others, that such a prosecution would take place—I have named it to him, or he has named it to me—he has not been in any way active in this prosecution—he has had no more to do with it than any gentleman in this room—he has not inter<lb/>fered in it in the slightest degree, to my knowledge—I have never seen him at my attorney's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, living at Newcastle-under-lyne. I have resided there a great part of my life—I am a voter for that borough, as a freeman—I know Mr. Miller—I voted for him and Mr. De Horsey at the last election—I also know Mr. William Mason—I remember meet<lb/>ing him on the first day of the canvassing—I remember going to the castle on the evening of the nomination day, between nine and ten o'clock-Gal<lb/>limore and Wall were with me—we went up stairs to the first floor, and staid there a short time—I saw Mr. William Mason and Mr. Henry Miller there—I saw them go into a small room—I got dose to the room-door, and I heard something said by the persons inside the room—Mr. Miller made an<lb/>swer to Mr. Mason, and said he could not think the reason why he was so ill treated on his canvass: that he could not go into a poor man's house but what he was upbraided of things that were left unpaid at the former elections.</p>

               <p>him, and offered to give us half a crown to drink his health, which we re<lb/>fused, and Mr. Miller threw himself down on the bed—it was a small room, Just to hold one bed, and as much room as a person could go round—there was a light in the room—it appeared to be a candle—after that we came away, and left the Castle—I believe, there were speeches made from the castle in the course of that evening, but very snort ones—they were made from the front bow-window—I believe Mr. Miller end Mr. De Horsey both spoke some few words.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was dark then so as to require a light in the bed-room you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—it was a back room, and that was not so light as the front room, and there was a candle burning in the room where I saw Miller and Mason,-when you get on the fist floor, you turn on the left hand, and there is a small door that leads to the bed-room, on the top of the first landing, up the first flight of stairs—it was on the first floor, not the second, the first flight of stairs—I saw Mr. Miller and Mason go into the room, nobody else-and when I afterwards went into the room, there was nobody else there—it was a small room—I could have seen if there had been anybody else there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Ann's-row, Bromley; the deceased, Thomas Boulter, was my brother. On Monday morning, the 26th of March, I heard what was about to take place, and went down to the marshes in Essex, near the river Lea—I saw Curtis, Tantony, and Blaker, and my brother come in a boat—I saw the prisoner there—a fight took place between my brother and Blaker—the prisoner picked my brother up, and put him on another man's knee—he continued to do so during the fight, and he wished him to leave off—they fought about thirty-five minutes—I saw Blaker strike my brother a blow with the right hand under the left ear—it appeared a chance blow—he fell down, and never was sensible afterwards—he was put into a boat and taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol, at Stratford. On Sunday morn<lb/>ing, the 29th of April, about five o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Ilford, returning from the station, in company with Johnson—near Mr. Thompson's field there was a drove of cattle in the road—I saw two men come from the horse-road down to the footpath—each of them had a bag on his shoulder, which appeared to be full—they came from among the cattle on to the footpath—we followed one of the men towards Ilford—he went up an alley which leads to the Britannia beer-shop—we followed him about fifty yards up this alley—he put down the sack, and we went up to him—it was Skiggs—I asked what he had got—he wade no reply—I opened the sack, and found it contained potatoes—I asked how he came, by them—he said he had found them on the road—he was standing at the door of a house, which was open—I gave him into Davis's custody—in consequence of some conversation with Davis, I went with him and John<lb/>son to Sales' house—before we went into the house, we listened—I heard a conversation, but could make no sense of what was said—we knocked, and Sales opened the door—he was asked what he had made of</p>

               <p>the bag of potatoes he had just brought in—he said he had no potatoes in his house; that he had brought none in, and had not been out of his house from the time he went to bed the night previous—this was about half-past five o'clock—we found a bag in a cupboard in the lower part of the house, similar to what I had seen the men carrying, and it contained potatoes—I cannot speak to Sales being one of the men I saw on the road.</p>

About six o'clock in the morning of at 28th of March, I met the two prisoners coming up the side of the field—they had these two rolls of lead—each of them had one under his arm—I asked where they got it from—they said from their uncle—they left the lead in the road, right opposite Mr. Gunson's lodge, and walked away—I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

On the afternoon of the 21st of April, the prisoner brought this watch to pledge—I asked him whose it was—he said his own—I asked him where he got it from—he said his father gave it to him—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "No. 16, Worship-street"—I could see by his manner he had not got possession of the watch as he should have done, and I called in a policeman, and sent him to where he said his father lived—he brought him back, and said it was all wrong.</p>

The prisoner was in his employ—in consequence of sus<lb/>picions I entertained on the 17th of April, I marked one half-crown, seven shillings, six sixpences, and three fourpenny pieces, and put them into the till—I examined the till the following morning, and found the marked money still there—I then put it into a purse into a desk in the shop, and af<lb/>terwards missed the money from the desk, but not the purse—I sent for a policeman—the prisoner was searched—one marked shilling was found on him, and another the policeman got from the maid servant—I had left the key of the desk on the mantel-shelf in the parlour, and the desk was in the shop.</p>

               <p>said to Bonner, "You put me out of your house once; if you had put me cut as you did my friend, I should have put you down"—Bonner said, "Would you, by G—d?"—he said, "Yes, I would"—Bonner caught the pot that was in his hands, and turned the beer over him, with his left hand he took the deceased by the collar, and struck him a blow on the top of his head—I do not recollect whether his hat was on or off—the deceased rose up, pushed his arm out, and struck Bonner in the eye; then Bonner struck him three or four times afterwards—the blow over the eye was a pretty violent one—I saw Bonner the next morning, and he had a black eye—he had no black eye before he received that blow from the deceased.</p>

I usually attend Mr. Bonner's family—I live next door to them—I was sent for to the deceased—he seemed quite in possession of himself—his head was bleeding—I took the hair off, clearly to see the state of the wound—the scalp was divided, not so deep as the bone—blood was flowing in considerable quantities from the wound, and it appeared to be bruised as well as divided—there were no marks of more than one blow—as there was but one wound, I think it must have been only one blow—I directed him to get his head poulticed—it did not strike me as at all dangerous at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an assistant to Mr. Key, a surgeon, at Guy's Hospital, at the time the accident happened. I remember the deceased coming there about the middle of the day on the 23rd, as an inmate—he remained there till his death—on the top and forepart of his head was a slight contused wound, about an inch and a half long and not very deep—I thought it of little consequence—he had, however, some suspicious symptoms which indicated that the brain had received some slight injury—no portions of the bone ever came away; a piece of the bone became dead, and was undergoing the process of excoriation—I consider the blow had produced a slight injury to the brain, which in about nine weeks pro<lb/>duced inflammation of the membranes, and that produced death.</p>

I have a gold watch, which was brought about half-past nine o'clock on the evening of the 18th of April—we live about ten minutes' or a quarter of an hour's walk from the prosecutor's—we did not take it in as a pledge, but lent 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—it is not usual to take in pledges so late—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I had never known him before—I had some doubt when I first saw him, but I have not now—he did not have the same dress on as when I saw him before—he had a brown Petersham coat on then—I did not make any memorandum of the name he gave me—I did not give him a ticket—he was to come for a ticket the next day, and then he could have more money on it—I rather think he had a narrow-brimmed hat on, but I cannot swear positively—he did not come back the next day for more.</p>

               <p>and only worth old silver; I will give you 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—he said, No; give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" but ultimately I did give him 8<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. for it—a day or no after my father-in-law came to me, and from information he gave me went to the prisoner on the 14th, as I had bought it on the 9th—I said to him, "Jones, you have stolen this box"—I put it quite plain to him, I did not mince the matter, I did not go a round-about way—I do not think had the box with me at the time—I will not swear positively, but he knew hat box I meant—I had but one from him—he said, in reply to my re<lb/>mark, "Who has been feeding you up with such nonsense as that? you go and ask my father, and be will tell you he gave it to me;" or words to the effect that his father would corroborate what he said when he sold it—before I could go to the father to ask him whether it was true, I received further information, which induced me to go the prisoner again on the 16th, two days after—I then said to him, "Jones, it is no use denying it, for you gave stolen this box from a gentleman in the Old Kent-road"—I cannot recollect whether I said a surgeon or a doctor, but I know I said Old Kent-road—he said I might be d—d, and cook it in my pea—soup—he said hat on my taxing him so closely—there were more heard him besides me—I was very much exasperated at his using that vile expression, and I do not know whether I said I should take the box to the Magistrate or to the police, but I said words to that effect, and I know I went away in a direc<lb/>tion to go to the station-house—I was walking away very fast, and he fol<lb/>lowed me, and said, "For God's sake, don't go to do that, or you will transport me, "or" do for me," I will not be positive which—he said, "I took it out of a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, out of the Crown and Anchor parlour, and could not but it back again without them seeing me"—I was very angry with him for selling me a stolen box—he said, "Will you let me have it without the money, to take it back to the gentleman from whom" I took it, for I have not the money to pay you to-night?"—I said, "Yea, with the greatest of pleasure; if you will come home and sign a paper I will give it you back"—he came home and signed a paper—I have not got that paper here—I produced it before the Grand Jury last time, but after the case was over I did not take much care of it, and it is lost—I can tell the contents of it—it said, "I hereby acknowledge to have received a box back which I sold to Mr. Benham, on the 9th of November, for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I will pay him for in two hours"—I wrote that, and he signed his name to it—I then gave the box to him, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money two days after.</p>
