               <p>Q. Do you not know she was upon the town?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The infamy of the question is its own answer. Is it not a question to be put, and I am sure your Lordship will not suffer such a question to be put by a man who has married a woman, whether she was ever upon the town or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have as much right to put those questions in as they have against me.</p>
               <p>Court. You may prove any facts yourself, but you must not put questions in an irregular way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, This crime which I have committed, I was totally drawn into. This first wife of mine which I married, I lived ten years happy with; I used her well, till I had the misfortune to be confined 18 months in the Marshalsea Prison, and this girl was brought there for a mantua-maker's bill; she there used all the insinuating manners that a girl of her description could possibly, and I resisted it; she was upon the town a twelvemonth and more; after this girl had been there a month, she wrote to her plaintiff to make it up with her; she made it up, and I had the misfortune likewise to join in a note with her for that debt, and she got out upon that, and in the course of a month after I got out myself; but while I was in the Marshalsea, and she was out, I used to have letters from her every day, and in all these letters she extolled every thing that was good of myself, and that was bad of my wife, and said she wondered I could live with such a dirty drab; that she herself was an accomplished girl of family, and had given up the first company, that of the Prince of Wales, Duke of Clarence, and Marquis of Hertford, upon my account. To all this I always resisted. I told her she knew that I was married, for in fact my wife was along with me when I came out. I did not go to her, but she found me out, and when she found me out, she got me to her, and after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010005"/>that I was one day from her, she used to send six or seven people after me with messages continually. Soon after this the mother came to town, and took her to Edgware road; the girl sent to me to come there; I went there, and she said I must marry her; I told her it was impossible for me to marry her, for she well knew, as she had seen the certificate of my wife's marriage, that I was married; I told her it was impossible that I could marry her; she was there about a week in the Edgware-road, and after that she went to Chelsea, where I saw the mother; on the Sauturday evening I received a note by Captain 
               <persName id="t18021201-3-person73">Brien</persName>
            's servant to come and drink tea on Sunday afternoon; accordingly I went; when I came there the mother asked me the questions that I have asked her, which I declined; the first question her mother asked me was, what were my pursuts in life? - I told her my circumstances; that I came from the Marshalsea; I was very poor when I came out, and my income could not exceed 150l. a year; she said that was very little to main tain a wife; I told her it was, but the girl had represented me to be a merchant of 800l. a year. I told her it was not such thing, and she said she had a very strong, affection for me; I told her I wished her very well; but as to marrying her, that was impossible, the narrowness of my circumstances would not allow it; after that she said she would consult some friends of her's, and would let me know further about it; on Monday I received a letter, saying she had consulted a male friend, and I was to call at Captain 
               <persName id="t18021201-3-person74">Brien</persName>
            's, in Baker-street, in the evening, where she would meet me; I sent her letter that a lodged at such a place at Islington, where I should be very happy to see any male friend of her's; that was on Monday; or Tuesday night, about eight o'clock, with I went home a cartage alighed at she door, with two footmen; the mother was there, with two other persons, and asked me of there was a possibility of my income being increased; I told her the girl was not a sit person for me; I persuaded her to send her to her friends; she might perhaps come round, and be virtuous once more, but they would not take that answer; then she said she would send to Dr. Drought, at Bath, a relation of her father's; she said she had left her father twelve years ago; they were to try if they could not make a fortune for me; Captain Brien said they could not do less than 50l. a year at any rate; about a week after that I received a letter from Mrs. Drought, saying she had received a letter from Dr. Drought, at Bath, declining having any thing to do with it, and she wished me to settle it as soon as possible; she desired me to get a licence the next day; I hesitated at that, but did not say immediately I would not; but the next night I went and told her I could not get the licence, and then they proposed to have the banns published; I said they might do as they liked about it, and they had the banns published; I desired the girl to inform her mother I was a married man; she laid it was nothning to her two or three times, declining coming near her; but she insisted upon my coming; when the day came I did not go; I was determined to find out my wife; she was in service somewhere; I meant to send her to the girl and the mother, and let her tell them herself; I went in the evening, and told the mother I was ill was the reason of my not attending; I took her into another room, and begged of her to tell her mother I was married, she said her mother knew it as well as herself, and desired me to come the next day; I did not go till eleven o'clock; I was in hopes that would he too late, but they took care to catch me then. Mr Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I must throw myself upon your mercy; this girl was a girl of illfame; she even told my wife she had deluded a better man than ever I was from his wife; that I was not the first, not should not be the last.</p>

            ,; on Lord-Mayor's day, I was going through Cheapside, between twelve and one o'clock; when I came to Queen-street, a great crowd obstructed my passing; I stood up at a door-way, till the crowd apparently was dispersing; there appeared a possibility of getting a cross the end of Queen-street, and I attempted it; I was looking carefully if any carriages were passing, when the man prisoner said, madam, you seem flurried, I said, I was; he said, madam, don't be afraid, I will take care you shall not slip in crossing, and thought he made an attempt to prevent my slipping, he obstructed me, and raised my leftarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an idea at the time, that the obstruction was on purpose? - A. No; a carriage was then turning round, and I made a run; at that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010009"/>time, something appeared to stop me, but I cannot say what; I did not feel any thing about my pockets, and at that moment I heard a voice behind me, saying, ah, have I got you, you could not let the lady pass; I don't know who it was that said so, I was frightened, and ran into a linen-draper's shop, there I found my pocket entirely emptied, it was twisted in a heap under my white petticoat; at first I thought my pockets had been cut off, then I went to the Compter; I lost a pair of spectable, a thimble, and a purse containing two seven shilling pieces, and a sixpence; when I got to the Compter, I immediately said, that was the man that made an attempt to hand me across the road; the officer stood by, and asked me if I had lost any thing, I told him what I had lost, and he shewed me my spectacles, which I knew to be mine, and a thimble which I cannot swear to, but I believe it to be the same that I lost, I have not found any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.There was a very considerable crowd on this day? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How came Mr. Pring to bring you here? - A. Because he knew me, and heard me cry halves, when the prisoner picked up the spectacles and thimble.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to cry halves? - A. Because I was a tailor, and wanted a thimble.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know why Mr. Pring brought you here? - A. No, he came to me last week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a subpoena here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not walking with him on Lord-Mayor's-day? - A. No, I did not see him on the Lord-Mayor's-day, but he saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to come here for? - A. He said, you saw a person pick up a pair of spectarles and a thimble, did not you? and I said, yes; that was the way he brought me forward.</p>

             sworn. - I live in the same house with the last witness: On the 9th of November I heard somebody at Mrs. Stevens's door, I went down stairs, and found the prisoner in Mrs. Stevens's room; I asked her how she came there, and she said, the door was open; the work was tightened up then, as a man might shoot on it; I went up to my room, and came down again in about a quarter of an hour; I found the door bolted; I knocked, and said, Sally, are you there, is Mrs. Stevens come home; she undid the door, and said, she was not; I turned round, and saw the work slack down to the threddles; I said, O, my God, the work is all slack; she said, she knew nothing about it; I heard Mrs. Stevens coming up stairs in a very few minutes, and I stood in the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you parted from the prisoner between that conversation and Mrs. Stevens coming up? - A. Yes; I went to look for her son, and left her in the room; when Mrs. Stevens came in, I said, for God's sake, come up, here has something happened to your work; then she came up, and examined her work; she had twelve handkerchiefs done all but a piece, and when she counted them in the loom, she had but ten all but a piece; then I left them.</p>

                        targets="t18021201-18-defend174 t18021201-18-deflabel103"/>: On Monday the 1st of November he was employed as my carter; I sent him with a load of lime to New Road, Whitechapel; it was what we call coarse stuff, lime and hair mixed, and a little rubbish; I saw him about eight or nine o'clock in the morning; he was then going; we call a load thirty hods, or thereabouts; about three o'clock in the afternoon I received some information; in consequence of which I spoke to Doyle about seven o'clock in the evening, at my father's shed, in Gitter lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Has your father any share in this business? - A. None; I asked the prisoner where he had been that day with the stuff; he told me he had been to the New-road, Whitechapel, and had likewise brought another load to Cullum-street; he had taken out three loads that day, two of them to the New-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How many loads had he in fact taken to the New-road? - A. Two, and one to Cullum-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether he had taken more than three loads from your yard, that day? - A. I do not; I asked the prisoner what he was doing in Aldersgate-street between twelve and two; he made me not answer at first, he seemed to be quite struck, and I told him he had better tell me the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then don't tell us what he said? - A. I then gave charge of the prisoner, and went to a place called Little Greenwich, in Aldersgate-street, where the prisoner Halesworth has some houses, and a stable, or shed; I found a load of lime and hair there.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. The same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it like such as you had? - A. I can positively swear to it; I had mixed some rubbish with it, which rather changes its colour; I did not see Halesworth till the Friday; his attorney appeared for him, and answered for his appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is not your father in partnership with you? - A. Not in the business in Cullum-street; he carries on business in Gutter-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Two loads were to go to the New Road, and two loads were taken to the New Road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Jewin-street leads into Aldersgate-street? - A. Yes, one end of it, and the other into Redcross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he might have gone out at either end of Jewin-street? - A.He might, but it is a long way round.</p>
               <p>Q. This lime and hair was mixed with rubbish? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not other plaisterers mix rubbish with lime and hair? - A. Yes, but when I brought it back to that which remained in my yard, there was not a shade of difference.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that the place you went to was Halesworth's? - A. No, only from Doyle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Humphreys, Halesworth's solicitor, answer for his appearance, and did he not attend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What is the rubbish composed of? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010013"/>A.Sand and old stuff that we knock out of ceilings, and earth; there was as much earth as rubbish; sometimes we use druft sand; it is what we call in the trade coarse stuff.</p>
               <p>Q.That is the term by which it is known in the trade? - A. Yes; it is sometimes called coarse stuff, and sometimes lime and hair; it is understood in the trade as the same thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Suppose you were to give an order to a person to send you lime and hair, and he sent you lime and hair, with rubbish mixed with it, should you think yourself defrauded? - A. Certainly not; I should be perfectly satisfied with it.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Little Greenwhich, Alaersgate-street; it is a place for carts and carriages; the prisoner Halesworth does not live there; he told me be had some houses there upon a reparing lease.</p>
               <p>Q.In the begining of November, did you see Mr. Roberts's cart there? - A. I did, and I saw the prisoner Doyle there; he brought a load of lime, and was going to shoot it opposite my window; that was about one o'clock; I told him he should not shot it there, we had had rubbish enough before; Mr. Halesworth stepped up, and said, draw it up here, either I or we are going to me in; I cannot say which; he took it up, and it was shot close to Mr. Halesworth's premises.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was Mr. Halesworth at the time is was shot upon his premises? - A. With the car man: I then gave information to Mr. Roberts, seeing his name upon the care: I had often seen I there before.</p>
               <p>Def's defence. The horse that I had was a sickly horse and subject to garping, and was I was coming out of Jowln-street the horse wanted to bye down, and I thought I had better shoot the load in Little Greenwich man in the street; Mr. Halesworth came up, and said you had better not shoot it there; and when I was asked what I had done with it I was terrified, because I thought my made was indicted for a nuisance for putting it there; I have been seventeen years with my master, and he was always too good a master to rob; I went through Aldersgate-street for fear I should be stopped in the short was going through Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gregery.) Did the horse appear to be ill when you saw it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you spoke to him about shooting his load there, did he give that as a reason? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts. Nor did he mention that to me.</p>
               <p>Halesworth left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Doyle called five, and Halesworth nine witnesses, who gave them good characters.</p>

(The pint pot was produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q.Had you seen them before? - A. Yes; she has lived in the neighbourhood a long while; immediately upon my asking of her if she would have any gin, she hit me in the face, and took away my bundle, which I had in my gown.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she afterwards come to you to your acquaintance's house? - A.

               <p>Q.Whereabouts had you laid it? - A. I laid it within six inches of the iron bar which goes about six inches from the door jam.</p>
               <p>Q.Might a person going by easily have taken it? - A. Yes, by pulling it hard; I immediately asked a friend's advice, and he recommended me to go to Bow-street; I went there immediately; then I went to Crocker's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Crocker? - A. A Bow-street officer; according to his directions, I went to the top of Doyl-street, and stood within Russell-street, at the top of Dyot-street, in company with John Mountain.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is John Mountain? - A.

               <p>Q. Was that the man at the bar? - A. Yes; we took him to Bow-street; I had not been in Russell-street long, before Crocker brought in a piece of check that answered the description I had given.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your check? - A. It is rather more than a half quarter wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it to be your's? - A. When it was taken from my door, it had a private mark upon it, and was rolled up in a roll; this check answers exactly to the same pattern and the same width.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Tell me all you know of this transaction on the 1st of November? - A. I was at dinner with my family in the parlour adjoining the shop, when the prisoner came into the shop; I sent my daughter Sarah to serve her, and she brought a shilling into the parlour, gave it my wife, and said, look well at it, mother; my wife got up immediately, went into the shop, and rung the shilling on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. No, I heard the shilling ring, and thought it to be a bad one; I went immediately into the shop, and saw it laying on the counter; the moment the woman saw me, she got hold of it with one hand, and threw the halfpence down with the other; I said, stop, mistress, I must see what you have got in that hand; I struggled to get it from her, and she threw it on the floor; I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the woman before? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the shilling ever since in your custody? - A. Yes, I have.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found? - A.There were six or seven bad shillings; in my opinion they are bad.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Has that shilling been mixed with no other since? - A. No, I have kept it in a paper separate.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been always in your custody has it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he take out? - A. He took every thing from me, except a pocket knife he left me; he took money, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you? - A. I had one shilling in silver, and a shilling in copper, in penny pieces and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel him take the money from you? - A. Yes, I cried out, for God's sake, let me alone, and I will give you what I have got; they hurt me in such a manner.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect yourself so far as to say positively which it was that took your money from you? - A. Both of them were upon me, I cannot say rightly which it was; they blinded me almost with knocking me about; I was afraid they would kill me, if I did cry out; I could not cry out, because I was afraid they would kill me.</p>

               <p>Q. The prosecutor knew of it as well as you? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court Q. How do you know? - A. I doubt whether he does or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? - A. Yes; about a week before that he called to give the order for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time he called? - A.About the 25th or 26th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop? - A. No. 119, High Holborn; he gave an order for the best gold timekeeper; I had none ready at that time, and told him I could not provide one by the time he wanted, but would provide one for him by that day week, and the price of it would be sixty-five guineas, for that it was not one of the best; he said he would call for it that day week, which I believe was on Saturday; he did not call till the Tuesday following, when I was not in the way, but I had left the time-keeper for him; he did not take it away, but called again on the Wednesday, when I was at home, and told me he had called the day before, but would not take the time-keeper as I was not at home; I gave him the time-keeper, and, in payment for it, he offered me those Bills, saying his name was Capt. Foote; there were two Bills to the amount of 681. 5s. one of which is for 421. signed

            pawnbroker; on the 7th of October the prisoner came to our shop, and offered a gold chronometer or time-keeper to pledge; I had a suspicion, and put many questions to him, which I thought would induce him to answer clearly as to how much he gave for it, and where he got it; in consequence of which, he shewed me a receipt for it, from Mr. Earnshaw; the nature of the timekeeper is such, that it is screamed down in a box, so that I could not open it; I begged the prisoner would suffer me to send it to a watch-maker to get it opened, but that he declined, saying he would take it to a watch-maker, and get it unscrewed. and bring it back again. As soon as he was gone, I desired my brother to go to Mr. Earnshaw's and enquire as to the truth of what the prisoner had said. As my brother was going to leave the shop, a hand-bill was brought in from Bow-street, describing the watch. I desired him to go to Mr. Earnshaw, and say, in case the prisoner should re-turn, I would secure him. The prisoner returned in about half an hour, as near as possible; but before that, I had given orders to one of our young men, in case the prisoner did come, to shut the back-door, in order to prevent his making his escape. The young man went to the back-door, and in fastening it, the bolts being loose, made a grating noise; the prisoner immediately stepped back, and wanted to know what that noise was, or the reason of it; I told him he must be secured, and shewed him the hand-bill; he begged I would not send to Bow-street, but that I would send for Mr. Earnshaw, who, he made no doubt, would be satisfied by having his watch returned.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got the hand-bill? - A. No, I shewed it to him; but previous to that I had sent to Bow-street for a constable, and in a few minutes Miller, the officer, arrived, to whom I delivered the prisoner in custody: That is all I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not state any particulars of what had passed between him and Mr. Earnshaw? - A. No, he did not.Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010040"/>know the prisoner before? - A. I had seen him the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at all acquainted with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where did you see him the night before? - A. At our house; he offered some telescopes, of which we had the same suspictions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he offered them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I rested my defence principally upon the evidence of a medical gentleman, who is not here, and I applied to the Court to put off my trial, in the hopes of obtaining his testimony, to shew that I was in a state of mental derangement months prior to the time mentioned, which that gentleman could, to the satisfaction of your Lordship and the Jury, have shewn. I have no recollection or knowledge of the charges exhibited against me. I have nothing further to say, only to recommend myself to your Lordship's mercy, and that of the Gentlemen of the Jury. I rested my defence solely on him and the other medical gentlemen, who had known me in that state for three years before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Mr. Earnshaw.) Upon your observation of what passed, did the prisoner appear to be under any mental derangement? - A. Very far from it. There was one circumstance which will let you see he was very keen in his endeavours. He called on Tuesday for the watch, which I had left, with a bill and recept, and finding I was not at home, he went away without it. He told me himself that he had called on the Tuesday," and the reason," says he, "Mr. Earnshaw, that I did not take the watch was, that you were not at home." I apprehended that he suspected it would not have been delivered to him by my people without the money, and I set it down to him as a piece of art. He told me that he called on the Tuesday for the watch, but as I was not in the way, he would not take it, and seemed to hold himself much upon that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any symptoms of mental derangement? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Birkitt) Did you perceive at the time the prisoner called before, and at the time he brought the time-keeper, any symptoms of mental derangement? - A. Not in any respect whatever.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called the Chevalier Ruspmi; who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you count them? - A. I did not count them on the Friday at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of missing them? - A. I took my horse in pursuit of them; I came along the road form Hendon to Kilburn. and upon enquiry I traced the sheep along the road, and followed them as far as Paddington, but could not hear any thing farther of them; I heard nothing of them till Saturday morning last, when, in consequence of information, I went to a field in the parish of Battersea; I there found ten of the sheep; it was nearly dark, and I could not ascertain whether they were my father's sheep or not by that light: On Sunday morning I called upon Crocker, one of the Bow-street officers, and took him with me; Adams also went with me; we went to the field, and knew the sheep; I saw a man in the field, and enquired of him who was the owner; Crocker went with the man to the house of the person that owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know these ten sheep? - A. I knew them by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the marks? - A. They had been marked with a G on the near side, with a pitch mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any pains been taken to obliterate that mark? - A. Yes, a great deal of pains I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the letter G remaining? - A. On some of the sheep there was, and one in particular the greatest part of the mark remained; the others were visible, although pluoked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that one in particular, what marks were there? - A. The greatest part of the G was left; it was only defaced with red ochre; it had been marked with a B on the near hip as well.</p>

               <p>Q. On the same spot where the G was? - A. No; the G was on the side, and the B on the hip.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a pitch mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other mark by which you knew those sheep to be your father's? - A. Yes, I know them by their appearance and the breed.</p>
               <p>Q. You are yourself a farmer and grazier, are you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where are the sheep now? - A. At home, Hendon.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you get home? - A.Twelve; I knew them myself before the mark of the G was put upon them, I had drawn them from a lot of one hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have known them without the letter G then? - A. Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other mark besitles the G when your father lost them? - A. Yes, the mark of the B was upon them when they were bought, and the G was put on afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Has your father any partner? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no property in these sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual when sheep change their masters to put a fresh mark upon them instead of the old one? - A. No; we put our own brand on them, but never take any others out.</p>
               <p>Q. What breed are they? - A. They are what we call between a Dorset and a Somersetshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father had more of the same breed? - A. NO, he had not.</p>

             sworn. - Q.When were you applied to about the sheep? - A.Last Saturday morning was a week; last Sunday morning, Mr. Geeves came to me, and said, he had got some information where his sheep were; I went with him to a close in Battersea-fields, with a person of the name of Partridge, who lives at Hendon, and Mr. Geeves's man, Adams, went into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you took to be the prisoner's? - A. Yes, he looked at the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there? - A. Ten; he came back to Mr. Geeves,and told him they were his property; I observed the last witness at one end of the field, and Partridge and I went up to him, and asked him, if he knew whole sheep they were; he said, yes, they belonged to Mr. cordell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the close-belonged to Mr. Cornell? - A. I cannot say, whether he did or not, or other I asked that question; we went to cordells house, and Bengo knocked at the door, and a child opened it; he asked, if Mr. Cordell was at home; at that time, Cordell came up from out of the kitchen, and Bengo then said, here were two gentlemen, who wanted to buy that little stock of sheep; he looked at Bengo, and said, I have no sheep to sell, I did not buy them to sell; he said it very low, and seemed very much consused; I called him to the door, and told him, I was an officer, and should take him into custody, on suspicion of stealing those sheep that were in the field, then I took him in doors again with Bengo.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make? - A. He did not make any; I asked him if he had any more in his yard, he said, no, he had no more than what were in the field; I left him in the room, and went into the yard to look for sheep; I could see nothing there, but went down stairs into the kitchen, where I saw two sheep alive; when I came up stairs again, I asked him where he got them, he wife made answer, he bought them last Friday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. He answered nothing? - A. He answered nothing at that time; afterwards he said it was on Saturday week last, he bought them at Kilburn, and gave forty-eight shillings a piece for them; I asked him who he bought them of, he said, a drover; I asked him if he knew him, he said, no; I asked him whether it was at a public-house, he said, he paid the money at a public-house; we told him we would go to that house with him; he made an excuse, and said, he did not know that he should know the house again; Mr. Geeves owned the property, and I took the prisoner into custody; this is the coat I took off his back last Monday morning. (Producing a great-coat.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the sheep that were in the kitchen, to MR. Geeves? - A. Yes; on one of the sheep in the kitchen, there had been the mark of a B, Which apparently had been a pitch mark, but pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. This was last Monday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Geeves.) Do you remember being at the prisoner's house last Sunday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Crocker shewing you two sheep in Cordell's kitchen? - A. Yes, he brought them up stairs out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine those sheep? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, upon your oath now, that those sheep were your father's property? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Q. By what marks? - A. By the pitch mark that had been taken out, the same that I have already described; there are the traces of the same marks left in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those sheep of the Dorsetshire breed? - A.They were of the same breed with the other at home, and accompanied them the moment they came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that great-coat? - A. This was on the prisoner's back; I believe it to be the same I saw him with on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that on his back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Can there be a more-common great-coat on any body's back? - A. Not that I know of, it is a very common great-coat, but I saw on his back; I know nothing more of the coat, out I know the sheep.</p>
               <p>Crocker. Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You said, you asked the prisoner, whether he had any more sheep in the yard? - A. He said he had no more than what were in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did You perceive whether his hearing was very quick or not? - A. I thought so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Friday week, about a quarter after five in the morning, I set out to go into the country, to buy some sheep worth my money, or a cow or a horse, or any thing else, to put into my pasture, which I hired to Mr. Jewer, of Battersea, to turn a shilling by; as I was going along Paddington, I met a drover with a lot of sheep; he said, farmer, will you buy a lot of sheep; I said, if you can sell them worth the money, I will buy them, if I can; he said, I have a little of I can sell, worth your money; I said, how many have you; he said, twenty-three; I said, at how much a piece; he laid, fifty shillings a piece; I said, they would not do, for that was too much, but I would give him, forty-six shillings; he said, no; I said, they were not worth the money; he said, they were worth all he asked; I said, I would give him forty-seven shillings; he would not take it, but said, he would abate a shilling a head; I would not give it him, but said, I would give him forty-eight, if that would do; he said, no; I said I would not have them at all, and went on; he said, come back, and you shall have them; then we went into a public-house, and had a pot of beer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010048"/>and I paid him forty-eight shillings a piece for them.</p>

               <p>Q. In his ordinary way? - A. Yes; and the night before I saw him into his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time the night before? - A. About a quarter past ten; I had been putting up a rail for him, and some small hooks, in his stanghter-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a butcher? - A. Yes, we always understood so at Battersea; I have bought beef of him; I saw him backwards and forwards at my house. When I had finished my job, I went in about a quarter past ten, and saw him go into his own house; I left him, and he went in, and locked the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how far your house is from Kilburn? - A. NO, I don't know such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you saw him go into his house at night till you saw him the next morning, did you hear any body go in or out of his house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house next door? - A.Next door but one; but if he or any body had gone out, I think there is a dog at the next door that would have given the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the morning, had he the appearnace of a man who had been up all night? - A. No, not at all.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the circumstance that sixes it in your memory that this was Friday morning was a week? - A.Because I put the job down on the state.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the state here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you look at the state? - A. The day before yesterday, and not before, though he was in trouble before; and the reason was, that his wife came and paid me four shillings and threepence for the job.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a family of children? - A. I have three children, likely to die of the small-pox.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect any other circumstance to six it to Friday se'nnight; but because you did this job for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, when you knew that your next door neighbour was in difficulty, not to look at your state before? - A.Because I never expected to be called for.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it intimated to you that you would be called upon? - A. The day before yesterday, his wife said, I should be subpoenaed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else tell you so? - A. No; she said, I did the work for him, and knew he was at home.</p>

               <p>Q. You never talked with his attorney? - A. I never spoke to him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his attorney know what you were coming to say? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody else there who knew you did the work for him? - A. Yes; there are several here who know that I did the work for him; I don't know whether Mr. Henney did not see me; if he did not see me doing the work, he has seen it since it has been done.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the girl leave your service? - A. On Wednesday, the 3d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been with you? - A. She came to the house in May last.</p>
               <p> Can you tell, from any circumstance, what time in the morning she left your house? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you suppose it was about five o'clock? - A.Because our man was up, and saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first know she was gone? - A. About seven, when I got up, I found her dirty things lay straggling about in the parlour; I told my wife of it, I went up stairs with her, and we found the girl's bonnet there; we came down stairs again, I observed one of the drawers of the bureau open, my wife opened it, and missed some things out of it; then we went up stairs, and searched a chest of drawers; my wife missed three of her gowns; then we went to a cupboard, and she missed a yellow chip bonnet trimmed with black ribbon; my wife then observed the bottom drawer of the same chest rather open, she opened the drawers, and found one of her silk cloaks gone.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, you found a number of other articles gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At seven o'clock, when you got up, and found the prisoner gone, was it light or dark? - A. It was not quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, look to see which way she had gone out? - A. No; because the boy had taken down the shop shutters then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing in the house which shewed any marks of violence by which she got out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure she was in your house the overnight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go to bed? - A.Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her between ten and eleven? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw her as if going to bed? - A. Yes; I saw her go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found your house had been fifted, what did you do? - A. She had a sweetheart at Brentford, I thought he might have some connection with this business; there was a Bench of Justices sitting, and I got a search-warrant, to search his premises, but found nothing; he offered his assistance to apprehend her, and on the Thursday we came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife go with you? - A. No; I and this young man went together; we could not find her at any of the places she used to be at in town; then I heard she was gone to Hounslow; I did not find her there; on the Friday morning, I went to Brentsord, it struck me, that I would go to the Magpye, where this young man used, thinking she might write to him, to let him know where she was; when I got there, I saw the post-man giving him a letter in the bar, which he said, he would swear was her hand-writing; and I opened it, and found where she was; I then went to Bow-street, and took an officer with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that officer here? - A. No; he could not find her; then we went to the Almonry, Westminster, to look for her, according to the direction; I found her at a very bad house in the Almonry; I found she was there, and told the girl, that her sweetheart wanted to see her; her sweetheart went to her, and told me, he would take care of her; I then went to the office, and got Bly and Jones, two officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body in your presence, search the prisoner? - A. Yes, Bly pulled her things off, and I stood by to see what she had got.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - A. She had a pair of pockets belonging to my children.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of those pockets? - A. One shilling, perhaps, I cannot say; I then asked her where her mistress's silk cloak was, and she said, it laid in the window, pointing to the corner; Jones immediately went to the corner, and she said, it laid in the window, pointing to the corner; Jones immediately went to the corner, and took the cloak out of the window, and under that cloak laid the tell of the bundle of things; Bly took the things with him, he tied them in a bundle, and has had them ever since.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: On the 25th of November, the prisoner at the bar came into our shop about twelve o'clock, and offered these handkerchiefs to pledge, (produces them); he asked twelve shillings upon them; I asked him several questions concerning them, and he did not give satisfactory answers; a young man who was in our shop jumped over the counter, and took hold of him, and took him before the Magistrate at Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - A. No; here is a pair of shoes that he pledged on the 16th of November, which I lent him half-a-crown upon.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Moses). Look at those handkerchiefs? - A. I cannot say positivily they are mine, because the mark is gone off; they are the same sort of handkerchiefs, and the shoes never had any mark, but I know them to be mine, they are the sort of shoes we generally have; I cannot swear to them, I never missed them; goods are continually coming in and going out; and therefore I could not miss them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - A. When the officer brought him to my house, he confessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. No; in fact I did not ask him a single question; when the officers brought him to my house, he went down upon his knees, begged for mercy, and said, they were all my property, and he would give me back all that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the goods with him? - A. No, I never saw him with the goods; they were brought to me the next day, and he said they were all mine; I told him it was not in my power to shew him mercy; the law must take its course.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your handkerchiefs kept? - A. In a glass in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he shop-boy? - A. No, he was hired to go on errands.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the shoes your own wear? - A. No, we keep a shop-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son in partnership with you? - A. Yes, the firm of the house is Moese and son.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010051"/>Q.What is the lowest value you can fix upon the handkerchiefs? - A.Suppose about 2s. a piece.</p>
               <p>Q.What are the shoes worth? - A. About one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TROTT sworn. - On the 25th of November last, the prisoner was brought to the Office by one of Mr. Mathews's man, a pawnbroker, in the Minories; he was taken before a Magistrate, and a handkerchief was produced; I searched him, and found a great quantity of duplicates upon him; I asked him if he had any thing else about him, and he said, no; I searched him, and found a watch upon him, which he said was his own, that his father had given him a twelvemonth ago; I found upon him a leather purse; there was a piece of parchment in the purse, with two pieces of paper in it; one paper had got three guineas in it; it was pinned  in his breeches pocket; and the other paper two guineas and a half; I then searched another pocket, and found a sevenshilling piece, a half guinea, three shillings, and a sixpence; I asked him how he came by that money; he told me his father had given it him to take care of for him; I then put my hand in one of his pockets, and found a card, with Moses and son upon it, in Nigtingale-lane; I told him, I am afraid you are a bad boy; you have been robbing your master, and this is a card of his shop; he said it was not his master; he did not live there at all; I then took him before the Magistrate again, and acquainted the Magistrate with what I had found; he told the Magistrate, if he would let the officer go with him, he would shew where his master lived, and his father too; I thought it prudent to take some more officers with me, and search the father's house; he took us to his master's first, which proved to be the same place which the card directed me to; I asked the master if he had lived with him; I asked him if he had sent him to pledge any silk handkerchiefs; he said, no; I then asked him if he had lost any; he said, there were so many things in the shop, he could not tell; I then took hold of his arm, to take him back again to the Office; he said, let me go on one side, and speak to my master; I told him if he had any thing to say to his master; he must say it in my presence; he then said all the things that were pledged at the different pawnbrokers that the tickets belonged to, except the watch and the pin, which I forgot to mention, were his masters; he said the half guinea and seven-shilling piece and the 3s. 6d. were the produce of them; he told his master he hoped he would forgive him, and he would come back, and live in his service.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the shoes and the neck-handkerchiefs part of the things he admitted he had taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not admit that the rest of money came from that? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The three guineas and the two guineas and a half, the watch and the pin, were my own property; and as to the other things, my master said he would be as favourable as he could. GUILTY aged 15.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Then it is not true, that you said up stairs; you would not hurt a hair of her head? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn, - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to Worship-street? - A. I am; I was sent for to the prosecutor's house; the prisoner at the bar was given me in charge, there was a pocket produced by Mr. Smith, and I said, call the prisoner down.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not call her prisoner then? - A. Yes, she was locked inthe club-room; when she came down, the pocket was then open, and from out of the pocket was taken this leather purse, with a key and knife, some penny-pieces, and a few halfpence. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Are those the notes you received at that time with the pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any money? - A. Yes, thirteen guineas and two half-guineas, (produce them;) when the notes were all produced on the table, and the money, I spread them, and seeing the quantity and the value, I said to the girl, Mrs. Smith and her sister being in the room, who do these notes belong to, she said, to my mistress; I then said, who do the guineas belong to, she said, to my mistress; I said, who do the half-guineas belong to, she said, to my mistress, and I thought to harm in taking them; I then went up stairs, taking the key with me, to the bed-room, with Mrs. Smith, and she shewed me a drawer belonging to a doublechest; I put this key in,and found in unlocked it, and locked it again; I then returned to the prisoner, and took her into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was it an upper drawer, or a lower drawer? - A. I believe it might be the third from the ground.</p>
               <p>Court (to Mrs. Smith.) Q.What drawer was it? - A. The third from the bottom.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I knew her friends very well, and being so young a girl I took her to my own house, instead of locking her up.</p>
               <p>The Bank notes were then identified by Mr. and Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My mistress said if I would but tell her the truth she would not hurt me. I told her the truth, and she directly sent for Mr. Armstrong; my mistress told me two or three time she would not hurt me if I would tell her the truth for my father and mother's sake.</p>
               <p>Court (to Mrs. Smith.) Q. You have heard what the prisoner has just now said? - A. I never said any such words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you did not say any such thing in substance? - A. I did not make use of any such expression. Q. You said you could hang her and would hang her? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you do all you could to keep his hand fast? - A. Yes, I did; I still held him fast by the hand, and collared him with my other hand; then another man came to his assitance to rescue him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that other man? - A. No, I do not; the other man laid hold of me and tried to pull me from him; I threw the prisoner on the ground, and kept fast hold of him; they shoved me down, and while I was down I recived a violent blow on my cheek, which is swelled now; there were then two more besides the prisoner; I was afraid they would use me worse, and I let the prisoner loose.</p>

             sworn. On the 27th of November last, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a scuffle between the prosecutor and the prisoner. I know his person perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known him before? - A. Not before that day. I went up to Mr. Bartlett and asked him what was the matter, his mouth was bleeding at the time the prisoner got out of Mr. Bartlett's hands, and rushed into the crowd of people. I then looked round, and saw a corporal of the guards; I said, corporal, call up your men, here are pickpockets here; upon that I saw the prisoner and four or five more, going off from the mob on the other side of us, making the best of their way off. I said to Bartlett there he goes, he was then a hundred yards, or perhaps a hundred and fifty yards, from the prisoner; the prisoner seeing me observe him, immediately began to run and left the other behind him; French and I immediately went off in pursuit of him; we ran after him and cried stop thief; several of those who were in company with him, ran with us and said no! no! let him go; till at last we ran too fast for them, and got into Horseferry-road, the prisoner was a good distance a-head of us; we halloaed out stop thief, the prisoner halloaed out no! no! it is for a bastard child, let me go. I was then got foremost, and several people who had got hold of him let him go. I still continued in pursuit till I got down to Abingdon-street; and just in turning a corner to get out of the way he turned into a public-house; I ran into the house, and French went down the stable-yard; I found him in the parlour; I was in the house in less than half a minute after him; I laid hold of him, and continued my hold, till I sent to Queen-square for Mr. Blys he came and took him into custody, and then we sent for Mr. Bartlett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not upon the green twenty minutes after the prosecutor lost his watch-chain? - A. No, I don't think it was more than five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>- FRENCH sworn. - I joined in pursuit of the prisoner with Mr. Williams; I lost fight of him at the corner of Milbank-street, I did not see him go into the public-house, I ran down the stable yard, while Mr. Willaims went into the house; I afterwards went into the house and found the prisoner and Mr. William in the parlour; he was searched, but nothing found upon him.</p>

I went to see this race, there was a great multitude of people; I was standing before the prosecutor, there were a great number of people round him, and a man in a blue coat snatched the watch chain from him and ran away; he charged me with it, I told him I had not got it, and he let me go; I was walking about there for twenty minutes, and then some people said they were coming to duck me, and I said, rather than be ducked, I would run away, and I did run away; I was in the public-house where I was taken twenty minutes before they came in.</p>

I missed three small silver spoons, but nothing further till my wife came down.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FEETCHER sworn. I am wife to the last witness; we went to bed on the 18th of November about ten o'clock, after my husband had seen the house was fastened, in which he is very particular; a little after three in the morning we heard a noise but did not suspect it ws at our house; in the morning we found the back parlour window open, and the sash quite up; I went into the yard, and found the shutter standing against the side, without any hinges; which were lost on the frame, and the bell was on the ground; which I cannot account for not ringing; I found a tea-chest, a bird-cage, but the bird was gone, and a little short dirty pipe; I then went in and missed the spoons and my red coak, two pocket handkerchiefs, a pepper box, a chair cover, and a pair of nankeen breeches. I have seen the cloak, the chair cover, and pair of nankeen breeches.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTONG sworn. I am an officer, belonging to Worship-street; On Friday the 19th of November, I went with Mason and Vickery between ten and eleven to a house in Nichol-row, Beual-greet, about six or eight minutes walk from Fletcher's when I opened the door I saw Mrs. Blake and Mrs. Robinson in a room below, Mrs. Blake was sitting with a child in her lap, and a little girl standing by her; I said I had a warrant to search the house, and disired Vickery to go outside the door to watch; I left Mason below while I went up stairs to search, I found a bed on the floor, and another on a bedstead; I desired Mason to let nobody to go out for I was in possession of some goods which I had found on the bed, (producing a table cloth, a pair of breeches, and a chair cover, which were identified by Mrs. Fletcher); I secured those goods with others, and chucked them down to Mason; I then went down and asked Mrs. Robinson who they belonged to; Mrs. Blake said, it is nothing to you; in a few minutes after Vickery brought Blake in; then the prisoner were all secured, taken to the office, and committed: On Monday the prosecutrix brought a memorandum to the office of some goods she had lost; I then shewed her the things I had taken from the house with the prisoners, and she owned some of them; I desired William Blake to pick out what was his own, and be picked out the chair cover, the table cloth, and breeches which have been sworn to by the prosecutrix, and said they were his.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - On the 19th of November I went with Armstrong and Mason to Nichols-row; they went into a house, and I went into a public-house very near, which I know Blake used I saw him standing by the fire, I called him out and told him I wanted him, and he must go along with me, for that Armstrong was at his house searching for some goods; he went close before me, and I folowed him into the house where Armstrong was; he was asked what property belonged to him, he ownned some of the things, and some he would not own; when we were taking them to the office, he said he had been in that house three weeks as a lodger, that some little difference had happened to him respecting some business in the city, for which he had left his house, and that his wife had only come down there that morning to bring him some breakfast; I knew him before very well when he used to keep an old iron shop in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street I then went and examined the prisecutor's house, which is next to a corner, and found they were obliged to get over the neighbour's wall at the corner, and there to break through a little fence, that fenced off a garden; I saw the shutter had been forced off by means of a large chissel or a crow; and I saw a pipe with some tobacco in it.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I asked Mrs. Blake and Robinson who was the owner of the house; Robinson said it was her house, and that Blake had lodged there a little while; I asked her how the things came there without her knowledge; she said she was a milk woman, and went out very early in the morning, and they might have been brought in, in her absence.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Policeofficer, and apprehended the prisoner on the Saturday evening; the robbery having been committed the Tuesday night or Wednesday morning before: I went to inspect the place, and Miss Green and the prisoner went up stairs with me; the prisoner held the candle, and I found the lines which hold the weights of the window were cut; but it appeared they were cut in an awkward manner, and not in the way a house-breaker would cut them; and my reason for supposing so is, that the knife must have missed in the cutting, because it broke a bit of the window, about an inch broad; in my opinion there had been no breaking on the outside, there being no marks; I also saw that it was impossible to cut the cord on the other side of the window, because the hole in the window was not big enough to admit an infant's hand, therefore it must have been cut inside; I then thought it proper to ask the prisoner some questions, and took her to the counting-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010058"/>and asked her about her father, mother, and relation; I told her to be cautious in what she said as I did not mean to take any advantage of what she said, but only wanted to know if she could inform me any thing relative to the robbery; she said, that sometime before she had seen a man in a sailor's dress walking very often backwards and forwards before the door; that was all she told me; I called Miss Green, and said I should be obliged to take her servant with me, which I did, to a public-house, near the office, and ordered the master to let her have every thing proper, and not confine her too close; the prisoner did not appear at all agitated, but only pleaded ignorant to the transaction; next day being Sunday, I told the landlord not to let any body see her, she being very young; and as I did not suppose her to be an old offender, I did not search her so much as I otherwise should have done, so that I found nothing upon her that night; on Monday, I took her before the Magistrate, and Miss, Green attended.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. This was the one-pair of stairs window, could a person of the prisoner's description safely get out of it? - A. There is a sort of penthouse under it, which I did not examine; though I don't think it is very probable that such a girl could get down from it, it would be dangerous, as it is a loftyhouse. Miss Green, Daniel White, and the two Daltons, attended at the Magistrate's, who thougth proper, upon the evidence, to recommit the prisoner for further examination, but did not send her to prison; the day following, in consequence of information I received, that she had some letters which she was looking at, I went up stairs, and took the servant of the house with me to be present; I desired the prisoner to set me see her pockets; she took off one which was empty, and handed it to me; I told her, I was not satisfied with that, but must see the other; she said, she had no other, and set herself down upon the bed; I then said, I would not do any thing that was wrong, and desired the servant to take notice of what I did, and had done; I insisted on having the pocket, which was refused; and at length I felt under her petticoats, and found a bundle, I took it out, and found it to be her pocket, in which was this lace, and a small lace called Tooting, (producing them); I asked her how she came by it; she said, she found it, but Miss Green swore to it, and the prisoner was committed for trail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. What part of the window was broke? - A. The window on the right hand entering the room; the cords were cut, and a pane broke.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it large enough to let in an instrument from without side? - A. It might be put in, but it could not cut the line on the other side, and yet they were cut on both sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the prisoner the first night? - A. On the Saturday night, I very gently searched her, I only rubbed her things down, I was very delicate with her, she being a young girl, and not supposing her to be guilty of any former offence.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some letters in her pocket, which she did not like you to look at, I believe? - A. Very likely that might be her reason for refusing her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Does Miss Green keep more servants than one? - A. She has some men who cut corks in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the glass inside the room, or outside? - A. It was a very small bit of glass, I searched for it, but could not find it, it was dark, being eight o'clock at night when I looked for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the street door fastended? - A. It is seldom fastened, on account of there being nine families in the house, and nobody knows who is out; when I got to the street door, I saw a man running on the opposite side of the way, I was in my shirt. but I immediately called, stop thief, and followed him near a quarter of a mile; when I took him, the first words he said, was, he had been in a great deal of distress; I knew him before, he is a weaver by trade, and had been once or twice up stairs into my room; I saw he had my blue coat and waistcoat on over his own; I asked him if he had my watch, he said, he had, and would give me every thing if I would let him go; I called assistance, and going along, he shewed me where he had thrown my boots; he was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. There are eight or nine familes in the house? - A.Nine; I live in the first floor back-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner some time? - A Yes; I suppose, I have known him nine or ten years by living in the same street, but have not spoke to him for four or five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You have played him a variety of tricks, I believe? - A. Yes, and he has played me some.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you frequently been out all night together? - A. Yes, once.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have had a quarrel? - A. No, no particular quarrel. (The things produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>JOHN QUIN sworn. - I searched the prisoner, and found the two handkerchiefs, and a pair of leather gloves on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor has been my acquaintance for a year or two, and has played me several tricks, by which he always had the laugh against me; I, knowing his room, took his things to retaliate upon him, with an intention of telling him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Jury. (To Ryder.) Q. Did you ever take his things from him? - A. He slept with me one Saturday night, and laid his breeches on the bed, with three shillings in the pocket, two shillings fell on the bed, and one on the floor; I picked up one and let him look a long time for it; then I told him I had one, and that if it would make no difference to him, I would return it to him the next Sunday, which I did, and he took a silk handkerchief away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on intimate terms with him? - A. I was, till I heard the badness of his character, and that he would not work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you had any thing of his? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, was gave him a good character. <rs id="t18021201-80-verdict439" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Barnard; On the 1st of Novemebr, between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoners came into the shop, and asked to see some figured sarsent ribbon; when they looked at it sometime, Barnett asked Fisher to take off her bonnett, for them to seen which ribbon looked best; they looked some time, and Barnett took Fisher's bonnet in her hand; I suspected them, and put the drawer away, and put other ribbon before them; after looking at that sometime, I observed Barnett take a piece of pink searsent out of the drawer, she had

               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Which got hold of the ribbon first? - A. Ann Barnett.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other took the bonnet; is it not usual to take off the bonnet to cotnpare with ribbon? - A.Some do, and some do not. (The ribbon produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Q. You know ladies wear bonnets with false linings, and it might drop in? - A. No; I saw her take it, and found it in the bonnet.</p>
               <p>Why did you not tell her? - A.She took it; I did not know where she put it; I suspected them I did not ask her for it; I saw it drop out of the bonnet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. Who enquired for the ribbon? - A. Ann Barnett, her bonnet was taken off, and the ribbon was in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Did he charge the woman who pulled off her bonnet with taking it? - A. Yes, I think he said you have taken a piece of ribbon.</p>

               <p>GEORGE STOKELEY sworn. - I went out of the accompting-house as the prisoner went in; I had just put down half-a-guinea, and a seven-shillingpiece on the desk; I knew the half-guinea again, and described the marks on it before it was found, but I cannot swear to it; I have no doubt it is the same, it was an old half-guinea, bent down in a particular way on one side, not in the common way. (The constable produced a half-guinea found on the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was my own property, as I pawned a suit of cloaths for eighteen shillings, and shewed the ticket at the office.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL JOHNSON sworn. - I work with Messrs. Stratton, and know the prisoner; I went to work on the Thursday morning, about half past five, and found a hat with the him cut off, behind some sender plates, which I believe to belong to the prisoner. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>PETHER DEANE sworn. - On the 20th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock-at night, as I was going between Northumber land-house and the corner of Scotland-yard, Milton came up, and laid hold of my rightarm, and said, sir, I think you are a little in liquor, we will see you home; Coffey was at his left-hand; I was rather intoxicated, but knew what I was doing, and was walking home quietly to my lodging, from Claremarket; I said, I want no one to see me home; then he said to Coffey, but we will see you home, won't we, it is our business; I asked them what they were, whether they were constables or not, and they said, they were; I asked them where they belonged to, Coffey said, to Bow-street, very well, said I, then one laid hold of my right arm, and the other of my left, so that I found myself between the two, and could make no resistance; we walked on about one hundred yards, when we came to a public-house; I said, will you go in, and have something to drink, which they did; I had a suspicion they were not what they represented themselves to be; we went in and called for a pot of beer, the prisoners wished to have something else, and we had a shillingsworth of brandy and water, and a shillingsworth of oysters; after which, I changed a seven-shilling-piece, and received six shillings; at the time I had the change. I felt the prisoner Miston's hand at my right hand pocket, as he sat at my right hand in the box, directly one said to the other, we will go, and they left the box in about three or four minutes after, and I never saw them till they were taken, three days after; I was sent for by the constable, to know if Milton was one of those who had robbed me, I knew his face directly; Coffey was not taken till the Sunday following, and I knew him directly, though he was not dressed in the same clothes he is now.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was your money? - A. In my right hand pocket, I felt it when I pulled out the last seven-shilling-pieces; I changed two, but did not pull out the rest of my money; when they were gone, I was a little intoxicated, but I found I was robbed, and sat there for some time; I put my hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and my finger came through exactly where the money was.(Produces the breeces, which were cut across the right thing, and a hole cut at the bottom of the pocket.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Where had you come from? - A. From Portugal-street, Clare-market; where I had been on business, and had had part of three sixpennyworths of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you alone when the prisoners first spoke to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you always given that account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, when you got into the public-house, you complained of their treatment? - A. I asked for the landlord, and the landlady said, he was busy, so I did not complain, as I did not see any body to complain to; there were two or three soldiers, but I was afraid they all belonged to the same party; I sat down with the prisoners, thinking, if they had a little liquor, I should get rid of them.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you drink? - A. We drank a pot of porter, and three shillingsworth of brandy and water; there was another man in the box who followed us the whole way, but he is not taken.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you not to mention this before? - A. I mentioned it to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did that man sit? - A. At the far end of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the box? - A. No, it was a close box with a door, which is very uncommon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no woman, upon your oath? - A. Upon my oath there was a woman, who seemed to be connected with one of the prisoners, Milton was the man who spoke to her, and said, we were a party by ourselves, and no body but our own company; by what they said to one another, I should conceive they were acquainted; she wished to come in to have something to drink, and Milton said, leave it to me, we are a company by ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there was no more than one woman, who looked into the box? - A. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were sober enough to know all that passed, you can tell whether there was more than one woman who came into the box? - A. She did not come into the box, she was at the door, no woman came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord? - A. The landlord came to hand me into the coach, pretending I was very much in liquor, and a soldier with a red jacket came along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away in a coach? - A. Yes; I wanted no help, but they helped me into the coach; I was going to No. 13, Tuston street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you order him to drive you to the Borough? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not true you ordered him to drive you to the Borough? - A. I told them to tell the captain to drive to Tuston-street, and the soldier wished very much to go along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you had found out that the money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010067"/>was gone? - A. I found it out two or three minutes after the prisoners had gone from the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any complaint when you got into the coach? - A. I saw no one to make a complaint to, I was afraid of getting abused if I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see? - A. I saw the soldier, and the landlord come and just handed me into the coach, that was all I saw of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord's mother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the house? - A. I suppose, very near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any watchman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go alone in the coach? - A. Yes, the soldier said he would go with me; no, said the coachman, you shall not go with him, the man has been robbed; I went by myself, and gave a proper direction where to drive to; the coachman said to the soldier, the man has been robbed already, you shall not go into my coach, I will take him home, and you have the number of my coach; he knew I had been robbed, because he saw my breeches were cut, and my hand through my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to change two seven-shillingpieces? - A. The first I changed to pay for two shilling's worth of brandy and water, and a shilling's worth of oysters for the prisoners; I put the remaining silver in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, but when I came to look for it to pay for another shilling's worth of brandy and water I found it was gone; the landlady said, you have silver, sir, have not you? I said, no; and Milton said directly, we have had some oysters since you gave change.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you, you treated these men after you suspected them, and after losing you silver, and changed another seven-shilling-piece? - A. I treated them through fear.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to mention only paying one shilling at first? - A. I meant the last shilling's worth, I paid three shillings for brandy and water, and one shilling for oysters, besides a pot of porter.</p>
               <p>- BLY sworn. - I am a constable belonging to Queen-square; on Saturday the 23d of October, in consequence of information, I apprehended Milton, who appeared to be dressed in new clothes; on the night of the robbery, I was coming from Covent-garden Theatre, about eleven o'clock to my house, at Westminster, and a little below Northumberland-house, I heard two or three men hooping out, boy, boy, I could not distinctly see their persons, but from the shadow they appeared to be tall men, ronning; I suspected that something amiss had taken place, and immediately crossed towards the Admiralty, nearly opposite to where Deane was robbed; I went very fast, till I came to Lord Melbourne's, where there is a stall with a light for selling cakes and saloop, I there saw two or three men; I came up with Milton first, who I knew before, he was holding something like writing-paper towards the light at the stall, I looked in his face, and I believe he spoke to me by name; I then faced the other two men, one of them was Coffey, who I knew also, the third I did not know; Milton was very anxious for me to take a glass of some thing to drink; I refused at first, but our of curiosity I did, in order to discover the person of the third, who is not yet taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you mean to say, that from the circumstance of seeing the men together at that place and time, and from the description the prosecutor gave, you procured the arrest of the prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the paper Milton had, like a Bank-note? - A. No; when I apprehended them, I searched them, but found nothing.</p>

             sworn. - My son keeps the Duke of Clarence public-house Charing-cross: I remember that on the 20th of October, I saw Milton and Deane there, but do not recollect the two others; they came in about ten o'clock, and all four went into a box by themselves, and had a pot of beer, then they had a shillings worth of brandy and water, and Deane gave a seven shilling piece; I gave him six shillings in change; after that they had another shillings worth of brandy and water, which I was paid for in silver; they then had some oysters, how many I cannot say; after that I made another shilling's worth of brandy and water; and Deane gave another seven shilling piece to change; I said I thought he must have change about him, as he had paid but one shilling; they said he had been buying oysters, and had no more change; I then changed the other seven shilling piece and laid six shillings on the table; one of the men said he would look at it, and see it was good he did so, and said it was good; sometime after that they went away one by one, and left Deane behind; I told him I thought his friends had used him very ill to leave him behind, as I looked upon it they were all friends and neighbours; I did not see any thing the matter with his pocket, nor did he complain in our house; a coach was then sent for; but I did not go to the door.</p>

             sworn. - I am a hackney coachman, and was called to the Duke of Clarence public-house, a little before twelve, the 20th of October, and took Mr. Deane into my coach; he was rather intoxicated, but told me where to drive, No. 13, Tuston-street, Westminister; when I went to take up my fare, a parcel of soldiers came out with him, and I observed on Mr. Deane slepping into the coach, his breeches pocket had apparently been cut; I said, why this gentleman has been robbed, which was all I said; he put his hand into his pocket to feel for his money, and his fingers came through; there was a soldier who appeared to be very busy with him, and wanted to get into the coach to drive home with him, but I objected to it, and said his company was not wanted; I then drove Mr. Deane home; I cannot swear to either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Who helped him into the coach? - A. The soldier was very busy; there were two or three people about him, the landlady and mistress of the house lighting him; that is all I know.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw Mr. Deane in a back room, taking some supper with a friend; he stopped till about half past eleven; he was then very much in liquor; I helped him into a coach; after he had got into the coach, the coachman asked who was to pay him, my mother said the gentleman had money in his pocket for she had not long since given him change for a seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010068"/>shilling piece, the gentlemen put his hand to his pocket and I then saw that his breeches were tore or cut, and he told the coachman he had no money; he first told him to drive to No. 19, in the Borough, and afterwards to Tufton-street, Westminster; on the Saturday following the tallest of the two prisoners called upon me, in company with two or three more; but I cannot say that I saw them that evening; there were four men sitting together in a box, but who they were I cannot say.</p>

I went to this house on the Wednesday, and the landlady said you are one of the men that was in the box that night, I said I was; she immediately said the gentlemen was robbed; I asked her where the gentleman lived and she could not tell me; I heard Mr. Bly was after me, and I went to his house to deliver myself up.</p>
               <p>Bly. He might have come to my house, but I did not see him; I met him while I was looking for him; it is very probable he might have come, for I knew him before; he told me he meant to do what he could towards public justice, and in consequence of that I had a little conversation with him.</p>

               <p>- MARTYN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of June 1801, where did you live? - A. In Well-street in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a clergyman of the Church of England? - A. Yes, in Priests orders.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first become acquainted with Colonel Thornton? - A. At the latter end of May, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you employed by him to do any thing for him? - A. Yes, to arrange a great quantity of papers, and to peruse them with a view to their being published, which I did, and he paid me 34l. 14s. I believe on the 30th of January, 1800.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had arranged those papers were you employed by Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person692">Thornton</persName>
             to compose any work in his vindication, and was any specific agreement made between you, and when? - A. Yes, on the 23d of February, 1800, both for the quantity, and the price; the quantity was twenty sheets of letter-press, or three hundred and twenty pages for seventy guineeas; to be compleated time enough to be published on the 30th of June, 1800, the composition was to come down to 1794; I composed and finished it about the middle of May, 1800, and saw Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person693">Thornton</persName>
            , to whom I delivered it, and he was perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the seventy guineas stipulated? - A. No, I had received 26l. 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive any more? - A. I did not specisioally on that account, but I received money on account; it was afterwards agreed between us that the memorial should be extended to the end of the year 1795; no time was fixed at the agreement for its completion; but in December following I delivered a great part of it, and it was then agreed that fifty guineas should be paid for it, twenty-five of which was to be paid immediately, and that it should be completed by the end of January, 1801. which it was.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the nature of the business on which you employed this composition? - A. Upon the Courts Martial; there had been five Courts Martial and a Court of Enquiry, in which Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person694">Thornton</persName>
             was the prosecutor, respecting the West York militia, and the Court of Enquiry was appointed to enquire into his conduct; Col. Thornton said there had been two other Courts Martial, before which he was defendant; with regard to the Courts Martial, I was to do every thing in which the Colonel was prosecutor, and to make such objections as occurred to me, and he reserved the desence of those Courts Martial where he was defendant to himself; he furnished me with hints and instructions, with letters and minutes of the Courts Martial; I had a prodigious quantity of papers some thousand sheets I suppose; while I was composing this last memorial, he applied to me to review those two Courts Martial before which he was defendant, and after I had finished the first, I undertook it, and finished that sometime in May, 1801; no price was stipulated for those two Courts Martial; but in May, 1801. I saw Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person695">Thornton</persName>
            , and read the whole over to him; but prior to that, he came to town, and I delivered him the memoir that ended the 31st of January; I then read part of the strictures, and delivered to him a copy of the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you then received any money from him? - A. I did; for the stricture I finished in January, I received twenty five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive in the whole? - A. One hundred and eighteen pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that amount to the sum Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person696">Thornton</persName>
             engaged to pay you for all the prior parts, exclusive of the strictures? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.After you received that money, and had read the strictures, did any conversation pass between you respecting the price to be paid for those strictures? - A. Yes; I demanded one hundred guineas for the extra statement of a great part of his case, and the correction of the press. which before had been agreed upon at half a guine per sheet; I had estimated the statement at 30l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you reckon for those strictures on the two Courts Martial? - A. I reckoned the remainder, the corrections of the press, and the strictures, at one hundred guineas; Colonel Thornton said, he would consider of it, and let me know next day; the day but one after the 3d of June, I saw him, and he offered me 50l. which I refused; he said he was going out of twon the next day for Yorkshire, and that he should set out in three days for France; I still refused it, and he wished me good day: On the 5th of June I was arrested by him, at the house of Mr. Bateson, the printer of the work, employed by Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person697">Thornton</persName>
            , who was present; I called at Bateson's house, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010069"/>shewn into a parlour, without any thing being said; I there saw Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person698">Thornton</persName>
             and two or three other people; he desired me to walk in; I said I was going home; he said, we may as well settle our business here, and wished me to walk in; I said, I certainly should not settle it there, and Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person699">Thornton</persName>
             then said, you must give me leave to arrest you, and in an instant two officers came from the back parlour; Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person700">Thornton</persName>
             said, "officers, do your duty's, that is Mr. Martyn;" the officers then said, they had a writ against me at that gentleman's suit, pointing to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person701">Thornton</persName>
            , and I went to a spunging-house, where I remained till the evening of the next day, when I got bail.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person702">Thornton</persName>
             so arrested you were you indebted to him in any thing whatever? - A. No, never; I never had been.</p>
               <p>Q.It is hardly necessary to ask, were you indebted to him one hundred pounds? - A. I never was indebted to him one shilling in my life time.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever received any money from him, except the one hundred and eighteen pounds in part of payment for the labours you had performed? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. As a matter of form, more than as a matter of substance, you have stated that you are a Clergyman of the Church of England? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your preserment? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you do duty? - A. At no place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it long since you did any of the duties of a Clergyman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years? - A. I have done duty as a Clergyman repeatedly, but not in any employment.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately? - A. I believe ten or twelve years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the same Mr. Martyn who was the Curate of St. Ann's, Soho? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the same Mr. Martyn who was a silversmith in the neighbourhood of St. Martin's-lane? - A. I am the same Mr. Martyn into whose hands the business sell by the death of my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. And who conducted it? - A. I had a person who conducted it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not interfere in it youself? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was at the corner of Hemmings's-row, I believe? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you occupied it for some years, Mr. Martyn, did you not? - A. About two years, and the object was to dispose of the stock, to prevent the value of it being reduced.</p>
               <p>Q.During that period, it would have been unseemly to have had the air, dress, or appearance of a Clergyman, therefore you cast them all off; one cannot forget these things, because we all remember seeing you in your pig-railed wig and brown coat? - A.It was not a brown coat; if not black, it was blue.</p>
               <p>Q.Indulging in all lay habits? - A. If you please, let it stand so.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not have been decent to have been seen in your shop in a clerical habit: it seems to me to be an odd thing, but we have heard something about a reserence to an arbitration; did he order this blow composition of your's to be burnit? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was it burnt? - A. No, the arbitrator ordered it to be burnt, if the parties should desire it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. I know who the man is to whom it was referred; he is a man of no sense or religion to do that? - A. He has the reputation of being a man of tasle and religion too.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he order it to be burnt by the hands of the common-hangman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then his award was good for nothing? - A. You speak-from your own opinion.</p>
               <p>Q.You have written a great deal of one sort or another, I should rend your sermons with much pleasure? - A. You shall, if you think they will edify you.</p>
               <p>Q.It seems an odd thing to me, that a grave reverend clergyman should have been selected to compose such a work as this - pray did the arbitrator take it into his head that it was libellous? - A. I don't know what was Mr. Maurice's motive.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he kept his own secret, and did not declare why he rodered it to be burnt? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not order it to be burnt as a most atrocious libel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you have not the least imagination why he ordered it to be burnt? - A. I have an imagination that he might have had that opinion of it, but that he never intimated it.</p>
               <p>Q.We collected from the opening speech, that you cannot be much of a judge of that, because you are no lawyer? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q.That Mr. Martyn was a very good lawyer, who pleaced his own cause in the Court-of-King's-Bench, was that the same Mr. Martyn, who was curate of St. Ann's, Soho? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the subject of the law of libele, you cannot be supposed to know much? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.This was the first libel you ever had the misfertune to write, if it was a libel, and Mr. Maursee was foolish enough to call it so? - A. You say it is.</p>
               <p>Q.I put it as a question - where were you when Mr. Thornton first had the honour of becoming acquainted with you? - A. In the King's-Bench prison.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it so happen that you were unrighteously there? - A. I dare say, you know. I was suffeering the judgment of the Court for a libel, for endeavouring to guard against a new sangled imposition, under the deseription of country Banks, and sell onder the imputation of having written a libel against

               <p>Q.Was it upon a verdict found? - A. It was by an indictment.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect the first conversation that Mr. Thornton had with you in which he desired that you would take care you would not get him into the same situation with yourself; and that you made answer there was no man in England who kinew the law of libels better than you? - A. To the first part of the question I deny that I ever said any thing, or that Colonel Thorn - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010070"/>ton two mentioned the word libel, for I was to write nothing, it was to arrange the paper which he said contoined full justification; I had nothing to do but that; as to making a prosession that I knew more of libels than any man in, England, my situation gave the lie to it, because he found me in prison for a libel.</p>
               <p>Q.Which proves, that with all your knowledge of the law of libels, the deveil deserted you for once? - A. You did not give. me the opportunity of having your opinion upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.You had better opinions than mine, for you had the opinions of the Judges, who gave you a sententious opinion, and sent you to prison? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q.I will ask you who 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person704">drew</persName>
             this indictment? - A. A Mr. Dogherty.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said otherwise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Be a little cautions, Mr. Dogherty drew it? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to be understood, and I desire you to be cautious, that you never said you drew it yourself, and for a special reason? - A. I drew one myself first, which was afterwards laid aside.</p>
               <p>Q.You 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person705">drew</persName>
             an indictment for perjury against Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person706">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. I did; I sketched the plan of an indictment, and slibmitted it to Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q.You took down a volume of Bishop Atterbury's fermons; and sketched the plan of an indictment? - A. I did not prefer that indictment.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said the present indictment was drawn by youself, and that afterwards it was found, and have you not said it was known to nobody but the Grand Jury and yourself? - A. I swear I never said it was drawn by myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said it was drawn by myself, and at the time you were speaking, known only to myself, and the Grand Jury, or that no other person is acquainted with it, but the Grand Jury and me? - A. I do not recollect ever saying any such thing.</p>

               <p>Q.Now you come to recollect, will you swear you never did? - A. I cannot; I am aware, by experience, of the evidence that may be brought against me, and although I may be able to speak positively, I think it necessary to speak with that guard which I know to be nesessary with respect to truth; I say, I do not remember it; I 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person707">drew</persName>
             the form of an indictment first, I then I had's second drawn, and this third was drawn by Mr. Dogherty.</p>
               <p>Q.By your direction? - A. By the direction of Mr. Davison.</p>
               <p>Q.I shall remind you of the time, and occasion on which this conversation took place, and ask you if you mean to deny it - do you recollect being applied to by the solicitor, for Mr. Thornton, to know what the warrant was for, which you had against Mr. Thornton? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not say to him, you had better not stir in it, for I 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person708">drew</persName>
             the indictment myself, and nobody knows any thing of it but myself, and the Grand Jury? - A. Upon my oath, I never said any such thing; it would have been very absurd, and you will do me the credit to suppose I should not express myself in those terms, or that I should syllogistically shew that, because I 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person709">drew</persName>
             the indictment, and that because nobody-knew of it but myself, that I should say to him, you had better not stir in it.</p>
               <p>Q.There are few to whom folly is torbe for tenderly imputed, but I am not asking whether it was wife to do it or not; am I to take the fact to be that you never said so? - A. I never did; the whole conversation that passed between us was, he asked me in so arrogant a manner that I refused him; I thought I had done a courtesy to Mr. Thornton in telling him I had done a courtesy to Mr. Thornton in telling him I had such a warrant, and that there was no occasion to make the prosecution more severe by taking him into custody; and there was another motive, to let him plead to the indictment that Sessions, to prevent it being delayed.</p>
               <p>Q.It would have been an unhandsome thing to prevent a gentleman from his pleasure? - A. It was to prevent the prosecution being delayed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you bound over to prosecute? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was it a part of the same conversation, where you said, no person could interfere between you and Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person710">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. I certainly did object to any conversation with any person but him; I have refused it repeatedly, for I have experienced the dangerous consequences of conserning with people.</p>
               <p>Q.Would to God that Mr. Thornton had taken the same precaution; then all the money you ever received on the subject of this work was 118l. 6s. - A.That was the whole.</p>
               <p>Q.And you insisted that before you would deliver the remainder you would be paid one hundred pounds? - A. I had no remainder; I delivered the whole I had engaged for.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had no manuscript work in your hands? - A. Yes, I had; but you will not perplex that point.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any manuscript to prepare by order of Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person711">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. Yes, which he was at liberty to take or not; but there was 30l. due to me for the extra statement; my engagement was finished and delivered in, the 30th of January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I shall prove the tender.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I admit the tender was made to get out of the hands of Mr. Martyn.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You claim a sum beyond the one hundred and eighteen pounds which you received? - A. Yes; I delivered up what would come to one hundred and ninety pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q.What had you still remaining in your hands, for which Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person712">Thornton</persName>
             was to give you 100 guineas? - A. The strictures on his own Court Martial, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sometimes, by way of filling up a leisure moment, written the Thorntonian? - A. I wrote a journal of all the proceedings in this matter, between Colonel Thornton and me, when he was in the situation from which I extricated him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was exactly the fort of thing that a man of rank and taste would like to have published about him? - A. It contained such facts as I think the man who was guilty of them would not be ashamed of having published; I stated the way in which Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person713">Thornton</persName>
             treated me.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not such a thing that any man would empty his strong chest to prevent being published? - A. No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not calculated to represent him as a man of dishonor? - A.As far as the facts that I stated went, no farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that journal of facts, or pretended facts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010071"/>calculated to destroy his character as a man of honor? - A. No; every transaction between Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person714">Thornton</persName>
             and me, was explained in what I called Thorntoniana.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not threated to publish it upon your oath? - A. There was no threat.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not say, unless he gave you a sum of money, you would publish it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it to you again, with a very remarkable expression for a Clergyman of the Church of England. Upon your oath did you not say you would publish it, and that you would send him to the devil and damnation? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor any such expression? - A. No, nor any such expression; I have heard such an evidence given, but I swear I never did use any such expression.</p>
               <p>Q.Or that you would blow him to hell? - A. Never; I never said I would publish it; I have said I would print it as an answer to the calumnies that Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person715">Thomton</persName>
             was throwing ever lastingly upon me.</p>
               <p>Q.In what event were you or not to print it? - A. I did it to give an opportunity to any person who told me the things Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person716">Thornton</persName>
             had said of me, instead of entering into a long explanation to shew what passed; there is all that passed between Col. 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person717">Thornton</persName>
             and me; I put things down as they arose; they were derogatory to a man of honor, but it was the behaviour I had received from him; if I had related any thing between you and Col. 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person718">Thornton</persName>
             that was derogatory to a man of honour, your objection might have been good; there were some very extraordinary circumstances attending it; and if my life had been depending upon it, I could not have been more careful in making that journal.</p>
               <p>Q.In relating such circumstances as no man of honour could bear to have stated? - A. I never printed it.</p>
               <p>Q.But you did a great deal worse; you threatened you would print it? - A. I said I would print it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then threatening or saying depends upon the tone of voice in which it is pronounced? - A. No, I don't agree perfectly with you; there I intended it for Col. Thornton's own inspection.</p>
               <p>Q.To reform his life? - A. No; I will tell you why; so many disagreements had arisen between us very early in the writing of the work, that we had every thing to run over again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you begin your journal, I should be glad to know? - A. It was sometime in 1800.</p>
               <p>Q. In which there were many remarkable circumstances, as you have told us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And many of them confidential? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Martyn, the Clergyman, having a knowledge of the Court Martial, and of the transactions of the West Riding militia? - A. That was not in the Thorntoniana.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any part of the book that might not be the subject of an indictment for a libel? - A.I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it a dispassionate statement of facts, not reflecting upon the character of Colonel Thornton? - A.It was a fair statement of facts.</p>
               <p>Court. You surely forget yourself; you are a man of great abilities, I know you are, and therefore one expects precision from you; you have said enough to convince any body, that you have stated that which no man of honour would wish to have stated to the public, and you must know that that is a libel upon him, because you are not an author of to-day; we have known your works long, your poems, and other writings, and therefore you can give a direct and positive answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will help you, because, for old acquaintance sake, I should like to get you out of this scrape; did you do it in your best manner? - A. I don't know as to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it poetry or prose? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was prose, because that conveys the sting the better; the jingle of the rhyme sometimes throws one out of one's way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the libel against John King that was more severe than this against Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person719">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. A thousand times more.</p>
               <p>Q. The Stool and the Blacking-brush? - A. No; the Stool and the Blacking-brush were hypothetical.</p>
               <p>Q. To come to plain English, because, though we may have our laugh, this is a very serious subject to the gentleman who is brought here; I am really so ignorant of the ways of the world, that I wish to know what Thorntoniana means; I like to get information from a master, and upon the subject of libels from Mr. Martyn? - A. The meaning is an ideal one.</p>
               <p>Q. Give it us? - A. That I leave to yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. I want the fence you annex to it? - A. The fence is expressed in the book itself.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know the fence of the word; we have Diaboliads, and various other names in this fashionable world in which you and I have the good fortune to live; now I want to know the meaning of the word Thorntoniana? - A.Thorntoniana is in the manner of Walpoliana, publishing things produced by great men.</p>
               <p>Q.Great men have their biographers, and you in kindness to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person720">Thornton</persName>
             did the same by him? - A. If I were to speak of your as an eminent Counsel, if I had opinions of your's to encounter, I should certainly call them Garrowniana; now you understand by that what I mean by Thorntoniana.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean my cross-examinations; perhaps you would call them Garrowniana? - A. No, I should not think them worth -</p>
               <p>Q. Not worth taking notice of? - A. There are so many things more worthy of the man, that I should not think of them.</p>
               <p>Q.Now one question more before we part with Thorntoniana. When you communicated its contents to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person721">Thornton</persName>
            , did you do it as a matter of gratisication to him, or the contrary? - A. No; I did it to prevent our traversing the ground we had gone over 50 times before.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to deter him from permitting this Thorntoniana to be published? - A. No; my object was to give him a state of facts, that I am sure he would not approve in another, and to induce him to come to a fair settlement of the account between us, and that we might settle it amicably, I shewed him the particulars of all the transactions between us, that he might see the manner in which he had treated me, and that we might not go over the same ground again, but that we might come immediately to the point of settling the copy that was then before us.</p>
               <p>Q. Which copy you would not deliver without being paid one hundred pounds? - A. No, the copy was not agreed for then, and my purpose in meeting Colonel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010072"/>Thornton was to read the copy to him, and to agree upon the price.</p>
               <p>Q.The price of what? - A. The second part of the memoirs; Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person722">Thornton</persName>
             wanted me to state to a gentleman now in Court what I meant.</p>
               <p>Q. A gentleman of the Bar you mean perhaps? - A. A gentleman of the Bar; Col. Thornton said I had written a memorandum of the whole that he wanted to enter into conversation about, and desired I would either shew it to him or his friend; that it would save a great deal of trouble to us both, and would prevent altercation; I consequently read the copy of the memoirs.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you read them just by way of sample of this mirror, which was to be held up to Colonel Thornton, to reform his life? - A. I read a part of the memoirs.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not read any part of the Thorntoniana? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.To Mr. Sinclair? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose; it could not be calculated to reform the life of Mr. Sinclair, to hold up this mirror to him; was it to raise Col, Thornton's character in the opinion of Mr. Sinclair? - A.No; to acquaint him with all the transactions.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it was to debase Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person723">Thornton</persName>
             in his estimation? - A. I did not do it for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to state that if Mr. Sinclair had read what was stated in that book, it must not have degraded Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person724">Thornton</persName>
             in his opinion? - A. I do not think it was so degrading as you represent it.</p>

               <p>Q. I see there are degrees of comparison - it might have been a little worse - you could have thrown a little more spice into it ? - A. There was nothing in the book that Mr. Sinclair did not say was less than he deserved ; he said, it would do him no harm .</p>
               <p>Court . Q. Perhaps he said, what was said by you would do no harm , because , by your own account , it was a very severe attack upon Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person725">Thornton</persName>
             ? - A. No, I don't think it so .</p>
               <p>Court . Q. You have said as much - in other words, you have said , no man of honour would wish stated what was stared in this work ? - A. I mean to say, if there is any thing improper , no man of honour would wish to have it said of him , and yet it might be no libel . Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person726">Thornton</persName>
             agreed to pay me two guineas and a half a week .</p>
               <p>Court . Q. How did you represent that in your book , as not being a man of honour , nor a man of his word ? - A. No; I represented that he did not fulfil his engagement . I was not in a situation to keep a work two years in hand , and receive nothing ; and I had other literary engagements , which I relinquished to do this. Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person727">Thornton</persName>
             never fulfilled his engagement in any instance ; and if I relate that , it is no libel .</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney . Q. At the time that Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person728">Thornton</persName>
             arrested you, had delivered as much composition as came to seventy pounds more than he had paid you? - A. Yes; I include in that the correction of the press.</p>
               <p>Court . Q. Was any body present at the agreement between you and Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person729">Thornton</persName>
             ? - A. Nobody was present , but I will prove the acknowledgement .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow . Q. Who was present at the acknowledgment? - A. Mr. Bateson .</p>

             , Esq. sworn . - Examined by Mr. Gurney . Q. You are a gentleman of the bar ? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. To you these matters in dispute between Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person733">Thornton</persName>
             and Mr. Martyn were referred ? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that reference , was Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person734">Thornton</persName>
             examined upon oath , before you? - A. He was. I will read from the notes I took at the time , all that Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person735">Thornton</persName>
             said upon that subject . ( Reads ), "We went in to Mr. Caton's chambers , Mr. Crawford , Mr. Caton , and myself , and we extracted from letters and papers , the sum which Mr. Martyn had received ; I thought , that having made a bargain with Mr. Martyn, and bargains , that Mr. Martyn had not delivered up the up the work complete to the time he had named, and being determined to bring this matter to a final issne, I thought I might with safety swear to his owing me one hundred pounds, and upwards." It had been previously admitted before me, on the part of Mr. Martyn , that he had received one hundred pounds , and upwards , I think, one hundred and eighteen pounds . I perhaps ought to state this, that the only way in which it could have been material for my attention to have been drawn to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person736">Thornton</persName>
             , was with a view to any damages which Mr. Martyn might have been entitled to receive at the hands of Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person737">Thornton</persName>
             , for the arrest; I considered that as one of the subjects of difference between the parties; one Mr. Martyn's claims before me was damages for this arrest; but from the evidence which has been already alluded to , to have been given by Mr. Sinclair , before me, I did not think I should have been justified in giving Mr. Martyn any damages , in respect of that arrest, from the expressions he was sworn, by Mr. Sinclair , to have made use of, with respect to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person738">Thornton</persName>
             , I did not think him entitled to any damages from me upon that subject , and therefore I did not give him any .</p>
               <p>Court . It did not appear to you to be a malicious arrest ? - A. I was not called to look at it in that point of view, because there was a collateral ground upon which I felt myself bound to withhold damages ; in that respect the terms were much stronger than those which have been repeated to-day .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow . Q. And I believe you gave orders , for the interests of the public , that the work should be burnt ; I am afraid that has not been done ? - A. I thought it right to order it to be burnt .</p>
               <p>The Court being of opinion that the prosecutor had not made out his case, the Jury found a verdict of</p>
               <p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow . It will be understood , I hope, that there are a great number of witnesses attending to this gentleman's character . You will understand , Gentlemen , that I don't call them , because the learned Judge thinks it unnecessary .</p>
               <p>Court . The Counsel has told you truly that they have a great number of witnesses to the character of Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person739">Thornton</persName>
             , but you have attended here long enough to know that the reason why a defendant is not called upon for his defence is, that there is no case made against him.</p>
