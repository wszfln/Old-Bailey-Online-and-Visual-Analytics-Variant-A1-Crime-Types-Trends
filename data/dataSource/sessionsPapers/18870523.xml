I am an insurance agent, of 13, Caledonian Street, Islington—on the morning of 8th May my wife showed me this coin and put it on the shelf—later on, at eight o'clock, I looked at it, and weighed it with a half-sovereign, which was about as heavy again—I informed the police, and Sergeant Diddums came and went up to the prisoner's room, and brought her down into my parlour—I said to her, "You know it is a bad half-sovereign"—she made no answer—I gave it to Diddums.</p>

               <p>this coin, and asked her if she could account for her possession of it—she said, "I have been working at Patton's, Ludgate Hill, and they must have paid it me in my wages; I had a half-sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—I lifted a vase up in the room, and the prisoner came and picked up this other coin from under the vase—she said, "Here is another one, I was going to have a pair of earrings made of them"—Mr. Davis gave me this half-sovereign—going downstairs the prisoner said, "I have told you a lie, I did not get that from Patton's; I don't know what made me do it"—I took her to the station—these coins were bright when I received them—they have since been tested and are now discoloured—I told the prisoner I was from King's Cross Police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. These two coins are brass whist markers; they are similar in size and colour to a half-sovereign, but there is the Queen's head on one side and the Austrian eagle on the other—it is milled and knerled—the legend is totally different—the value of this is perhaps a farthing—they cost so much a gross.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, of 12, Fenchurch Street—on 5th May, about 11.30 a.m., I was at the corner of Fenchurch Street and Gracechurch Street, and wearing a chronometer watch, value about 40 gs., attached to a gold chain, which went through my waistcoat buttonhole and into my waistcoat pocket—I was just turning from Gracechurch Street into Fenchurch Street—I had a bag in one hand and an umbrella in the other—some men hustled me, and two men stood in front and one on each side of me, and I saw the prisoner, who was in front, take my watch and twist or cut it off, I cannot say which; it was all done in a moment—I grasped him by the arm, and he passed the watch to his other hand, and then to the man at his side—I made a grab at him, and the prisoner slipped away—I called out instantly "I have lost my watch," and within a quarter of a minute the prisoner was brought back by a policeman—a gentleman came forward, and said "Here is your watch," and said he had picked it up on the kerb—the prisoner was taken to the station and charged—he said "You caught hold of another man first"—I am perfectly sure he is the man who took my watch.</p>

I am a horse-keeper, of 7, Fakehham Street, Isling<lb/>ton—on 7th March between 9 and 9.15 I was in Market Street—I had just taken my money and been to a tailor's and got a new waistcoat, for which I gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I had about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my coat pocket—I went through a narrow avenue to the slaughter-houses—the three prisoners met me, and Hall said "Have you seen anybody running up here with a parcel?"—I said "No"—he immediately worked round me and made a snatch at my parcel, which was under my arm, and Wickenden struck me on my mouth—I reeled and went down as the others were pulling at the parcel under my arm, and Hall and Coleman came behind me and gave me a kick in my back and I was disabled, and as soon as I recovered myself I got up and went to a public-house, but saw nothing of them till the next day—I gave information to the police; they were arrested, and I picked them each out from six or seven persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hall.</hi> I am positive it was you; you wore the same clothes as now, and you pulled the parcel from under my right arm—you made a plunge at my parcel before Wickenden struck me, and after that you went on struggling for the parcel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Wickenden.</hi> I did not look at your clothes but at your features, and I had time while you were questioning me to take stock of you all three—there are five lamps in the avenue, but this was a lonely place—a woman came up and said "You have got one right man and two wrong ones"—I said "I was told Wickenden was concerned in it."</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant.</hi>) On 30th March I was a constable of the S division—during the night of 29th March I was on duty in Woodside, Grange Road, outside Dr. Turle's premises, Woodside Grange, which is a large house with extensive grounds—there is a lodge and gate in Woodside, Grange Road, and a drive which passes in front of the house and leads to Woodside Lane, where there is another gate—about 12.30 a.m. I noticed a light on the south side of the house, nearest the road, as of someone lighting a pipe, it appeared to be at the house; I watched and saw a second light of a similar kind—I then entered the lodge-gate and placed my back against the pillar and watched the spot where I saw the lights, and then saw a third light, which lasted half-a-minute—I crossed the lawn, keeping on the grass; when within 20 yards of the house my leg got entangled in something which threw me down; I sprang to my feet and heard two men running from the place where I had seen the lights; they ran from me in the direction of Woodside Lane—I blew my whistle and followed along the drive, and on getting into Woodside Lane I saw two men, dimly, making their way towards the railway bridge to my left; they were about 35 or 40 yards from me—I threw off my cape and continued the chase—I had a stick but it slipped out of my hand when I was undoing my cape and I did not stop to pick it up—when three or four yards from the bridge they parted from each other, and the nearest one faced me; I closed with him and we both fell, he being undermost—I endeavoured to draw my truncheon, which had worked to the middle of my back in running, and whilst doing so the one in front turned round and dealt me two blows—I saw that man while drawing my truncheon; I saw his back before he struck me, and then I saw him turn round—one blow struck my helmet and knocked it off, and another struck my forehead—I cannot say with what I was struck; it was some heavy instrument, I did not see it at all—the blow on my forehead cut and bruised it, and caused blood to flow—at the same moment I was turned on my back and they both escaped—I saw the one I had struggled with getting over the rails near the parapet of the bridge; he had no hat on; I did not see what became of him—I was without my helmet—I recovered my feet, drew my truncheon, and followed him down the railway line as I could hear him there; I think he must have stumbled on the rails as I could hear him distinctly; I again overtook him; I am quite sure he was the same man; he turned round and faced me, and said "You b—, I will kill you this time"; I struck him a heavy blow on his head with my truncheon, which cut his head open and made the blood Row—we struggled together and both fell on to the metals—when he was underneath</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188705230017"/>
               <p>he screamed out "Smash his b—head, <hi rend="italic">Joe.</hi>" or something of that, it sounded like <hi rend="italic">Joe.</hi> and in the same breath he cried "I will give in"—I was about to pull him off the metals when I received a blow on the back of my head and another on the small of my back, I don't know what with—I then relaxed my hold and staggered forward, and remembered no more until I was found; I was knocked insensible—it was the other man who struck me, not the man I was struggling with—when I became conscious I found Dr. Turle leaning over me; my right foot was off, and I was otherwise injured, but I didn't know to what extent—I was taken to Dr. Turle's house and attended to, and then I was sent to the Royal Free Hospital—the man who struck me wore cord trousers and a dark coat; he had a hat too large for him, which seemed to come all over his head; he had no whiskers, but wore a moustache—I gave a description to Inspector Bannister 24 hours afterwards—I could see the men by the starlight and the light from the signal-post, which reflects slightly from the bridge—my foot underwent amputation at the hospital, and I remained there five weeks—on 12th April, six or seven men were brought to my bedside, and amongst them I saw the prisoner, I said on looking at him that he was exactly like the second man who had assaulted me, but I would not swear positively to him—he had a moustache—it might have been a minute or two after he had been brought there that I said that, because I could not see him at first on account of the cradle in the front of the bed, and he was at the foot; I rose myself up, and as soon as I saw him, I said" That is exactly like the man who assaulted me, but I will not swear positively to him"; he made no remark to me whatever, although he distinctly heard what I said—my opinion now is, looking at the man, that he is exactly like the man who assaulted me, but his whiskers have grown now, he only had a moustache then—I was first examined on 2nd May—I am still of opinion that he is like the man who assaulted me; that is as far as I go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I saw him at my bedside there was the absence of whiskers, and there was the absence of whiskers in the man who attacked me—I described the night as starlight, with intervals of clouds; it was rather calm, there was no moon—I had not seen either of these persons before, to my knowledge—I didn't see the second man on the second attack; I could we him before I closed with the other—I saw him twice, once with his back to me when they were running away, and once when I saw him with his arm upraised to deliver the blow, when I was kneeling on the other one; I knew he was close, and I looked up to see what would be the result—the blow followed immediately, and the blood rushed into my left eye—I am informed that I was lying on the rails an hour and a quarter before I was found, and I was at Dr. Turle two hours—he did not have any conversation with me, he only kept asking me if I was better—I believe I had a conversation at the hospital with Dr. Turle before the prisoner was apprehended, it was about the man who had committed the outrage; I said to him I should not like to swear on oath to the second man, but I was quite certain of the first; I said I could pick him out, but there was a possibility that in the darkness of the night, and in the struggling, I might make a mistake at to the other—I feel certain in my mind that the prisoner is the man, but I would not swear to him on oath.</p>

               <p>and heard a moaning coming from the direction of the line—I went in that direction, and in the road I found a constable's cape and stick, and a little further on, on the bridge, I found this felt hat (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) and a constable's helmet—I should describe this as a felt hat which has been a hard one once—I found it at the commencement of the bridge, and the constable's helmet within a foot from it—I then got over the fence at the side of the railway bridge and down the embank<lb/>ment on to the line—I knew Barker was on duty that night, and I called after him, and he answered—I found his foot first, and then I found him lying at the side of the line on his back, bleeding from his face, with his helmet gone—the truncheon was by his side, and this iron <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) was lying under him—his foot was six or seven yards away—I got assistance, and he was taken to Dr. Turle's, and afterwards to the hospital—it was a dark night—this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) is a rough sketch of the railway bridge and the rails and signal light.</p>

I am single—I was 17 last November—I am now living at the St. Pancras Infirmary—in March last I was living with the prisoner as his wife—we used to sleep in Mr. Cook's shed, near the Green Man—it is also near Finchley Cemetery—I had been sleeping with him in that shed in March for a fortnight—I had not lived with him anywhere before that—his name is Jesse John Cox; I used to call him Jesse—I saw him on Tuesday afternoon, the 29th, in the Green Man, between 3.30 and five—there were other people with him in the bar, and I thought I saw Jockey Smith there, the son of the landlord of the Green Man—I tapped at the window to get the prisoner to come out, and he beckoned for me to go away—I waited there about an hour, and then I went up to Highgate—I didn't like to go in—I did not return to the shed that night—I walked about Highgate all night, and got back to Finchley about nine o'clock next morning—I didn't go to sleep at all; I spoke to a good many people—I stayed out all night because I wanted to speak to him, and he would not come out, and I went away in a temper—he was dressed on that night in a pair of corduroy trousers and rather a dark coat, and a hard black felt hat, only it had been knocked about and got</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 80, Englefield Road, Islington—about 11 o'clock on 20th April I fastened up my house; I can swear all the doors were all right, and I usually fasten the windows, but I could not swear to them that night—there are long bars to the windows inside and out—I was awakened about 4 a.m. by the police whistling—I got up and came downstairs, where I found the wash house window had been opened from the outside, one of the long bars having been forcibly wrenched away so as to admit of anyone getting into the kitchen—I found in the kitchen three drawers had been ransacked—a tablecloth had been taken from one of the drawers and placed on the table—two cupboards had been opened and a basket of cutlery had been taken and placed on the kitchen table—my wife's Ulster was found rolled up and thrown down in the corner of the kitchen by the door—in the breakfast parlour I found this cruet-stand had been taken from the book-case and placed on the table—a parcel of unbound "Matthew Henry's Commentaries" had been removed and placed in the centre of the room—two cupboards in that room were wide open—in the parlour upstairs a cruet-stand and traveller's satchel had been removed from the sideboard and placed on the table—a wax candle was burning on the centre of the table on the tablecloth.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant.</hi>) On Monday morning, 2nd May, with Detective Davidson, I was called to Mr. Bennett's premises, 50, Ludgate Hill—No. 70 in the Old Bailey joins No. 50 at the back, and there is a party wall between the two—I entered No. 70; there is a street door and an inner door at the foot of the staircase, and on the left</p>

               <p>it is a shoemaker's, in different occupation—I found the door at the foot of the stairs had been forced open—that gave access to the roof of No. 70—I went to the roof and then found that a hole had been cut through the brick wall, which gave access to the whole of Mr. Bennett's premises, No. 50, Ludgate Hill—the hole was large enough to admit a man—I went to the first floor of No. 50 and found the lid of a safe in the office had been forced off and two or three drawers had also been forced—on the ground floor I found another safe and desks had been forced—on the third floor I found a boarded partition had been cut by a centre-bit and boards had been taken from it, giving access to Messrs. Hudson's pre<lb/>mises, 52, Ludgate Hill, a provision shop—on the ground floor there I found a safe had been forced and several desks and doors also—I made a further examination of the top of Mr. Bennett's premises and I found this bar or chisel, and a file, which was afterwards identified as Mr. Bennett's—it had been used in order to make the hole through the brick wall larger—there are marks on it—the thieves appeared to have gone through the hole and back again into No. 70, and let themselves out by the street door there, which fastens on a spring lock.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The synopsis stated that salary would be </hi>150<hi rend="italic">l. per annum, with a commission of.</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">per cent, on direct and.</hi> 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent. on agents' premiums, and that the candidate would be required to hold fifteen.</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">shares fully paid.</hi>) I wrote this letter of 24th October, and then this of the 25th October. (<hi rend="italic">This applied for the post of sub-manager for the Southampton district, according to the terms, stated his qualifications, and gave two references and testimonials.</hi>) On 29th October I received this letter from the Com<lb/>pany signed J.B. Henry. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had been elected manager of the Southampton district, on the understanding that he returned, duly signed, the share application, with the amount of the qualification therein.</hi>) A share application was enclosed—I filled up the application and called on 30th October at the Company's office, 171, Queen Victoria Street—I saw the name of the Company on the door post—I inquired for the secretary, Mr. Henry—I was informed he would be in shortly—I called again and was shown to the prisoner, whom I supposed to be Mr. Henry—I did not hear his name, nor did I address him by name to my knowledge—I said I had called to inquire as to the condition of the Company, to know whether it was a thoroughly sound affair; the prisoner told me that it was in a thoroughly sound condition, doing a large and increasing business, and that it had doubled within the last year—I stated what I had been doing, and that I had considerable influence with many gentle<lb/>men; he said I might fairly use the name of Lord Garmoyle as the president—I said I had not brought the money with me, as I had simply come to inquire—he said I must, if I thought of the appointment, bring the money very shortly, as another gentleman was recommended by one of the directors—I asked to see the balance-sheet; he said the financial year of the Company was just concluded, and the balance-sheet would shortly be issued—I then left, and called again on 2nd November, when I paid the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took this form of application, signed, and handed it in—I had this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed A.

(<hi rend="italic">Clause.</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">of this stated that the witness must bring.</hi> 47 <hi rend="italic">new cases into the office every year.</hi>) I had not seen this before I paid my money—I signed it; I asked the prisoner as to the mode of payment after reading it, and calling his attention to clause 6, and saving I did not see how in the first three months it was probable I could do that amount of business; he said I need be under no apprehension, as they settled everything monthly—I asked if I should attend at the office to get some notion of the working of the business—he said it was perfectly unnecessary, as the travelling inspector would visit me shortly, and give me all information—I had seen the travelling inspector's name, Cotton, on the prospectus—I signed the receipt of the appointment; I received the scrip for the shares some</p>

               <p>days afterwards—in consequence of being appointed I removed from London to Southampton—I received the form of appointment—I did my best in every way to do business for the Company from 15th November to January—I had considerable correspondence about the business I was endeavouring to do, asking questions and receiving replies—ultimately I wrote for my salary several times; I never obtained it—I received this letter of 10th January, 1887. (<hi rend="italic">From the Secretary, saying that he would submit his request, to the Board, and that in the meantime it would help the matter forward if he referred to the business he had done, and especially as to clause.</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">of the agreement.</hi>) Ultimately I received a letter rescinding my appointment. (<hi rend="italic">This said that at a Board meeting on.</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">th January it was resolved that E. Keen, having failed to carry out the conditions of his appoint<lb/>ment, it was thereby terminated; this was enclosed in a letter stating that if he made up in that month the arrears of business as per clause.</hi> 6, <hi rend="italic">they would consider favourably any application for the withdrawal of the notice rescinding his appointment.</hi>) I never received back any of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was on the faith of the representations as to the condition of the Company, that I paid the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been asked nor influenced by any person to say that—I came up to town on other business, and I then called on the official liquidator to know what was being done about this Company—that was somewhere about 6th May, I should think—I did not know an examination had then taken place at the Mansion House—I first learnt a prosecution had been commenced at that time, and I offered myself as a witness—I might have got business—I sent up one proposal, which was accepted—I took the premium and kept it—it was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think—that was in the course of December—I knew I was taking shares in the Company—I read the synopsis of terms, and saw clearly from that, that I was to take 15 shares—I called attention to clause 6 before I signed the acceptance on 2nd November—I did not see the prisoner, to my knowledge, on any other occasions than 30th October and 2nd November—I was shown this after I had paid my money on 2nd November, as far as I recollect—I was not shown the form of appointment before I paid my money—this is the appointment, I believe—I called attention to clause 6 in it after I paid my money, on 2nd November—I was shown no form of appointment before I paid my money—November 15th is on it, because it was sent down to me after<lb/>wards—I had forgotten the date on which I signed the acceptance of the appointment, it was the 15th—I saw from clause 6 that my remuneration would depend very much on the premiums I got and the business I did—I simply asked as to the solvency of the Company—I did not know whether the Company was doing a large business, so that I could procure the payment of my salary, I asked no questions on these points, but only as to the position of the Company—Mr. Sayle told me they were doing a largely increasing business, I asked him nothing about the business—I did not ask to see any books which contained entries of business done and insurances effected—I asked to see a balance-sheet—I relied on his statement and paid my money—he said a balance-sheet would be pub<lb/>lished shortly—at the end of December it was sent to me as a shareholder—I have not made any inquiry as to the actual amount of business done by this office in any way—I called on the liquidator to see if there was any chance of getting my money back—I don't know that they went into</p>

I am the official liquidator to this Company—the petition was filed on 4th February, 1887, and the order to wind up on 19th February—I produce the two balance-sheets—accounts were kept at the Central Bank of London and the Royal Exchange Bank—on February 5th the balance at the Central Bank of London was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and at the Royal Exchange Bank on 19th February 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the defendant Sayle claimed the office furniture and all the furniture at 171, Queen Victoria Street—the available assets were the agents' balances and the claims unpaid for shares—I have only got in 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the agents' balances; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was also sent to me, but when it was found that the Company was in liquidation it was claimed back—between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is outstanding for unpaid calls, but I have received nothing—3,990 shares, I believe, were issued according to the allotment book, over 3,000 of which are held by agents—at the time of the last balance-sheet in 1886 there was, by the banker's book, a nominal balance of about 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Central Bank of London, but if some cheques which were outstanding had been presented there would have been no balance—there was nothing at the other bank then; they were not doing business there—there was nothing against which cheques could be drawn for a single halfpenny—I have been through the claims under policies for which judgments have been signed so far as I can, but the plaintiffs' names not being registered there was a difficulty—the claim register was, I believe, not properly kept—the Company was not solvent in October, 1885, and it was considerably worse in October, 1886—I agree with what Mr. Plumb has said.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 139, Gray's Inn Road, my premises are at the back—the prisoner and his wife occupied my kitchen, which is about eight yards from my workshop—on 3rd May I heard screaming in the kitchen as of some one in pain or struck; it was "Oh, oh!" in Mrs. Fyfield's voice—I have heard her voice frequently—at the same time I heard the prisoner using foul language, which appeared to be directed at the woman.</p>

Mr. Lee come down and see"—he had on a pair of corduroy trousers, a flannel shirt, and no coat; he was not in his bare feet, but I cannot say whether he had any boots on—I went downstairs, opened the door, looked in, and saw Mrs. Fyfield lying on the floor between the bed and the fireplace; her head was, I think, slightly raised, but I did not go sufficiently near to see what with—the fender was in its usual position, I believe, and all the furniture as usual—I left the prisoner there and went for Dr. Smith—I had heard no noise in the basement that night—the prisoner and his wife seemed always on pretty fair terms.</p>

On 5th May, about 9.15, Fox spoke to me in Guildford Street, and I went with him to 139, Gray's Inn Road, and saw the deceased in the basement, lying on the floor between the bedstead and the fireplace—her head was against the wall, resting</p>

               <p>on a pillow, and her feet towards the window—she was covered with a woollen shawl, and only had a short black bodice on and a pair of grey stockings, no shift or anything—the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed; he had on a pair of lace-up boots, but they were not laced, and a coat and trousers—I said to him "How do you account for her having that black eye and bruise across the chin?"—he said "I am sure I do not know, policeman, unless she got it by falling about; we went out together last evening and had a glass or two, and came home about a quarter-past twelve; I then undressed and went to bed, leaving my wife sitting on a chair; I said 'Ann, why don't you come to bed?' she replied 'All right, Jack;' I then went to sleep again, and woke up about a quarter-past 7; I called to her, but getting no answer, I got out of bed, and commenced to feel about, and I discovered that she was dead and cold; I then went upstairs to Mr. Lee, the landlord, and told him, and he went for a doctor"—I found on the mantelshelf a small bottle containing laudanum and a bottle and glass on the window sill—the bottle contained nothing—I smelt it, and it bad contained gin, and there was a very small quantity of gin in the glass—the prisoner said "When we came home last night she brought home a bottle of gin with her at a quarter-past 12"—the fender was in its proper place, and nothing appeared to be disarranged.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector E.</hi>) I was called from Hunter Street Police-station about a quarter to 10 o'clock, and on going into the room I saw the prisoner—I did not make these notes till the Saturday, when I found the gravity of the case—I said to him "Can you give any account of this?"—he said "We were out drinking last night; she <hi rend="italic">lowered.</hi> three half-pints over the way; I asked her not to have any more; we got home all right; we took home a quartern of gin with us; I asked her to go to bed; she said she would sit in a chair, and she did so; I went to bed, and woke about 3 o'clock; she was still sitting in the chair; I asked her to get into bed; she said that she would lie on the floor, and she did so; I woke again about 7 or half-past, and called to her; she made no answer; I felt all round for her, and found her on the floor, and I found that her face was very cold; I felt further, and found she had dirtied herself, and I put my hands in it; I then thought she was dead, and called the lodgers"—I said "Can you account for the mark under her chin?"—he said "She must have done it by the fender"—I do not remember his saying anything about the bottle in the night—after hearing the doctor's report as to the post-mortem, I directed the prisoner to be taken in custody, and I followed him to Hunter Street Station—I said to him "You will be charged on suspicion of causing the death of your wife, Ann Fyfield, at 139, Gray's Inn Road, yesterday morning?"—he said "She must have knocked herself about</p>

               <p>by the fender"—when the charge was read over to him he said "Why was it I was not brought here yesterday?"—I said "I was not satisfied"—he was about being removed from the dock, and said in a low tone "I am dissipated and a drunkard, but I can't help that"—I made notes of his statements.</p>

                  </hi>. M.R.C.S. I am medical officer of St. Pancras—on 5th May, about 9 a.m., I was called to 139, Gray's Inn Road, and saw a woman on the floor dead—I should say she had been dead three or four hours—there were several recent bruises about different parts of her face, and the remains of a black eye, which was not recent; by recent I mean within a few hours—there was an abrasion of the skin, an abrasion at the end of the nose, a scratch by the side of the nose, a bruise on the left cheek, a bruise on the left temple, and a bruise on the upper lip, with the flesh lacerated—the lower lip had a mark, but I think that was an old ulceration—all those could have been inflicted by her tumbling about in the room, except the upper lip, I am doubtful about that, and the scratch on the nose I do not think could be self-inflicted—I examined the pupils to see whether they were dilated, to see if there were evidences of poison—next day I made another examination with Dr. Smith, and found nine ribs broken on the left side; the second rib was broken in three places, and the third in two places, the fourth, fifth, and sixth in one place, the seventh in two places, and the eighth, ninth, and tenth in one place; the third, fourth, and fifth were torn from their cartilages—on the right side eight ribs were broken, one fracture each, and the chest-bone was broken between the first and second ribs—there was no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188705230047"/>
               <p>connection between the death and the other organs—there was an abrasion in front of one leg, it might be called scratches, and we then saw that the lobe of the left ear was lacerated—I think she died from shock to the system produced by those injuries—I found no external marks of violence on the chest, corresponding with the fractures; the only marks of violence we saw were on the face—the fractures had been effected by force applied to the chest-bone; that would fracture all the ribs and would make them break outwards—I do not think they could have been self-inflicted; she might have done it herself if there had been only one or two ribs broken, but not with 17—I do not think she could have walked from the public-house, or walked at all, with her ribs broken in that way—some of them might have been caused by a man standing on her chest, without boots, and jumping on her, but not all, unless it was repeated—repeated jumps time after time might account for it, or a man kneeling with force on her chest might have done it, but that would require to be repeated—if the prisoner was insensibly drunk during the night, and repeatedly fell upon her, that would account for it, but he would have to fall in a certain way, not on the same spot, but very nearly so; if he fell flat on the body I do not think it would have produced it—I think there must have been some kind of prominence—when I say self-inflicted, I mean by the woman falling about—I saw the prisoner when I went to the house, and asked him when he found her—I did not notice any appearance of his having been intoxicated during the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What I have been telling the Court is my opinion, I have known people have their ribs broken by falling on their ribs—I know Gray's Inn Road, it has a stone causeway pavement; a person falling upon it might break a rib or two, but if she fell a few times it would be rather unusual to break a rib each time she fell—I do not think she would break her ribs if she fell on her breast, but if she fell on her ribs she might break them at the point of striking—I do not think if she fell on her face she would be likely to break her ribs, not unless she caught on the edge of the pavement—this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) is a cor<lb/>rect representation of the human body, showing the ribs—a drunken woman tumbling about on the edge of the pavement, might break a rib now and again—her age was about 58, when the ribs are certainly brittle—I do not think they would be more brittle if the person was fond of liquor; I do not think drunkenness would affect the bones much, but the ribs of a person of 58 are very readily broken—she would certainly have felt the breaking of her ribs—persons have gone about for days with broken ribs not knowing it, but it would give pain; you can tell within a few hours or a day, when ribs are broken—these ribs were broken within a few hours in my opinion; the examination took place on the evening of the next day, and I should say that the ribs had been broken a few hours before death—I do not think she could have done all this injury by falling about in the night—I think the old man (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner.</hi>) could have stood on her body if she were lying on the floor; I do not say that he could have broken all these ribs by treading on her, but by jumping or kneeling—there was not the slightest mark of injury from kneeling, kneeling would not put the marks on her face nor the scratches on her legs—I did not suggest kneeling on her body, it was suggested to me—if the prisoner got up in the night and blindly stepped</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188705230048"/>
               <p>on her, and fell upon her it might have produced a large number of the fractures, but I do not think it would have produced them all—if he had fallen on her and in endeavouring to get up had fallen again, that might have caused the sequence of fractures, that is, the row of fractures, but I do not think it would have broken the bones in two or three places—I saw him about 9.30 a.m., he was then quite rational and sober as far as I could judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Supposing the injuries had been caused by the woman falling and tumbling about, I think it would be necessary that she should fall on some projection; I cannot tell you what projections there were in the room, I saw the fender and a couple of chairs—if she fell on a chair it would not produce all these injuries—there were no bruises on the chest, only on the face—there was no external injury on the chest, there might not have been marks if she was jumped upon; you may have excessive internal injuries without any outside appearances, the clothes would act as a sort of cushion—if you could see the bare chest afterwards you would see a red mark, but it would disappear soon—if she fell on the fender I should expect to find a bruise and a different kind of fracture, by a direct blow the ribs would have been driven inwards, in falling in the street I should expect to find bruises.</p>

I would take that watch from my bosom and put it in my pocket, there are bad people about Woolwich, they could take the watch in an instant"—I took the watch out and put it in my pocket—I went with him to the Carpenter's Arms; I had not been in Woolwich for three weeks, and I knew no one there; I went out, he gave me a glass of beer, and I felt silly; he told me his name was Rastall—he said he would come back again—when I went to his rooms he spoke to a man in the passage—he took me to a room where there was a piano—I said "You have a piano"—he said "Yes, can you play it?"—I said "Yes"—he sat beside me—he said he wished to have an interview with me, and he gave me a glass of beer—I remained there not more than ten minutes—he said he would marry me by special licence on the Monday—he</p>

Woolwich; I am 14 years old, and I work at Mr. Fifield's, linen draper—on 21st March I was on Church Hill, Woolwich, between 8 and 9 p.m., when the prisoner asked me to go and fetch him half-a-pound of Dutch cheese, pointing up the hill where Mr. Webb's shop was in sight—he gave me a half-a-crown—I went to Mrs. Webb's and asked for the cheese, and gave her the half-crown—she gave me the cheese and a shilling, two sixpences and three coppers I fancy, which I gave the prisoner, who had come nearer, opposite to Mrs. Webb's shop—I next saw him five weeks alter at the police-station, where I picked him out from about eight other men, as the man who gave me the money on that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I saw the prisoner was when he sent me in the shop—it was on a Saturday—I can't say the day of the month—it was in April I am sure—I guessed it was five weeks after that I went to the station—I had not seen him in the interval—it took about two or three minutes for me to go and get the cheese and come out again—it was a young man about 17 who sent me for it—the men the prisoner was put among to be identified were older than you, except one who was 14 or 15—I found it perfectly easy to pick him out—after I had had one look the sergeant said "Don't be frightened, but look at them well"—the prisoner was at the end—I don't know how the police got to know about me; he came to me on Saturday evening and said "Are you the young man at Fifield's"—I said "Yes"—he asked me whether I was the lad who took the half-crown into Mrs. Webb's—I said "Yes"—he told me I had to go up to the Court next Saturday and I went—he asked me whether I could pick him out; I said I could, and they asked me if I was sharp—it was pretty dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The lamps were alight in the street; Mrs. Webb had no lamps outside her shop—I had a parcel with me which had my master's name on it "Fifield"—this was in March I think.</p>

               <p>three eggs and threw a half-crown behind the scale—I had to put my hand round to draw it round and I felt it was bad, as it was very smooth—I did not try it—I said to a woman in the shop "Close the door and stop him"—he pushed her very roughly aside, knocking her almost into the street, and ran away as hard as he could—I ran out and cried "Stop thief," but no one stopped him—I kept the coin he gave me—on the Monday week I next saw him in the yard of the police-station—he was with eight others, I knew him at once—I gave the half-crown I had from Norman and that I received on the 9th to Sergeant Ralph—these are they—this is the half-crown I received from the other boy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the prisoner on the 26th—it was twenty minutes or half-past 11 p.m. on 9th April when he came in—I had my suspicions of him having had bad money and I served him at once—directly I took it I examined it, and said to the customer stop him, and he was off in a minute—all the other men he was with at the station were a great deal older than himself—I do not think he was at the end of the row, I cannot recollect whether he was first, second, or third—I had no occasion to look at the other prisoners, I recognised him at once—I did not know I was going to pick him out when I went there on the Monday—the detective came and said they had got a young man charged for passing a bad two-shilling piece, and would I come and see if I could recognise him—I was quite positive about him—one of these coins is dated 1836 and the other 1834—the one of 9th April is 1834.</p>

On Saturday night the last witness called my attention to the prisoner, and handed me a bad florin. I asked the prisoner for his name and address, which he refused. I sent for a constable, and detained the prisoner until he came. I handed the florin to the constable.") On this Saturday, about 20 minutes past 10 p.m., I was sent for to this shop, where I found the prisoner detained—Mr. Stone was standing in front of the door, which was shut—the prisoner was sitting on a chair—Mr. Stone said he had asked for the prisoner's name and address, and he had refused to give it, and that he had brought in a bad two-shilling piece—the prisoner said nothing—Mr. Stone said he</p>

I got from my master"—he did not tell me at the time where he had come from—I received this coin from Mr. Stone—I took him to the station—on the way he said "I suppose I shall have to suffer for other people"—I did not state that at the Court below—at the station, where the charge of uttering to Mr. Stone was read to him, he made no reply—he was asked his address, and gave it correctly as 82, Britannia Street, Hoxton—afterwards on the remand he was charged with the other offences—I received these three half-crowns from Mrs. Webb—I gave the ticket back to the prisoner, as I thought it did not concern the charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I might have been a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes there—I remember 9th April because it was the day after Good Friday—my attention was first called to the prisoner being in the house on 9th April on the Monday week following, the 18th, when his father called and said his boy had been locked up, and asked me to come down—when I got to Woolwich I heard it was for passing bad money the week before at 10 or 11 o'clock, and I said I saw the lad at half-past 9—between the 9th and the 18th I had no particular reason to remember my visit—I made no note of the time; I am positive it was after 9 o'clock.</p>

I am the prisoner's father—he has been a very steady, good lad—he bears the reputation of being an honest boy—on Saturday, 9th April, he was abed when I got home—I asked my missus if all were in, and then bolted the door; I did not go upstairs—on 18th April I was at Woolwich Police-court, knowing my son was charged with passing counterfeit coin—the other persons charged on that day were men as old as I am, none of them were about the same age as the prisoner—I was not present at the identification, but I heard Norman say in his evidence at the police-court, that the men with the prisoner when he was picked out were men who had been charged that morning, and I heard Mrs. Webb ask the same—the men were not like him in any manner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Brown, a corn merchant, of 14, Burnt Ash Road, Lee—I was in my father's shop on Saturday, 30th April, and saw Jesse Rhodes come in and ask for a sack of maize, two trusses of clover, two trusses of hay, and a truss of straw—he paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I gave him a delivery ticket and he went out of the shop—my father said something to me, and I went and con<lb/>cealed myself in my father's yard, where I could see what passed—I saw the two Rhodes and Barker and a man named Taylor there—Barker carried a sack of maize down from the loft and put it into the cart, and I saw the other goods purchased put into the cart—Taylor then went away, and as soon as he had gone up the yard William Rhodes and Barker went to a sack of oats near where the cart was, and carried a sack of oats and put it on the cart, and Jesse Rhodes pulled it on—I heard Barker say before that "How about this half pint of beer?"—the hay was pushed off before the oats were put on, and then it was put on top of the oats, and then Jesse Rhodes drove off—William Rhodes ran near to the part of the building where I was lying and then walked straight up the yard—I want and made a statement to my father.</p>

This is a large yard—there were two or three stacks of oats about—I was in the yard commanding a view of this—it was about half-past 9, and was dark near where I was, but it was lighter farther up the yard—when they were loading the hay they were before me in the light—there was a light in the stable between the two windows; it has a swivel joint, and generally stands out at right angles, and shows a light into the yard—the maize was put on first, then the hay, and then the hay was taken off and the oats put on.</p>

I don't think the Rhodes live so far from us as two miles; it is along a rough country road, part of which is lighted—I am not quite sure whether all the horses were in the stable—the men were not paid off; they were waiting about in the yard—there was one man finishing cleaning his horse—there was not a van in the yard with a horse harnessed to it—it was about three-quarters of an hour to closing time—the men do not come in at once after finishing their work, and all our corn work was done, but our shop work had to be done—Taylor is still in our service; I don't know if Barker is; my father was bail for him—Barker's place is filled up—I don't suppose any other person but Taylor heard Barker say "Now, about this half pint of beer"—a man named Lock was out in the road near the yard where the cart would pass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant, of 4, Burnet Ash Road, Lee, and the father of the last witness—on Saturday night, 30th April, about 9.40, Jesse Rhodes came into—the shop—I sent my son after him into the yard, and in consequence of what my son afterwards told me I immediately went with two police constables to the prisoner's father's house at Mottingham—I there saw Jesse standing by the cart, and I said to the police "Arrest that man"—I did not say what for; I had pre<lb/>viously told the constables—immediately afterwards William drove the horse and cart off as fast as possible and ran by the side of it—I don't know that he struck the horse at all; it did not want much striking, it was a very good horse—I followed and stopped the horse about a dozen yards off—one of the constables then examined the cart and I saw him find a sack of oats—I took that and Jesse to the station with the constable—at first he said "I know nothing about this"; afterwards he said "Will you look over this, Mr. Brown, my father is very ill"—he after<lb/>wards said "This is the first time, Mr. Brown; will you allow us to pay for the oats and I will pay all expenses?"—I said "I cannot do that, I would rather have given £50 than this should have happened; but I could not go back for £500"—I charged him at the station—on my return home I found that Barker had absconded—I examined the sack of oats; it was mine—Barker ought to have been at home when I got back—I usually pay the men myself, but in my absence my son would do it occa<lb/>sionally, and he had paid Barker—it was Barker's duty to come on Sunday morning; he did not do so—he came to my house to see me on Monday night and I gave him into custody—he then made a statement in my presence—on the Sunday I charged William Rhodes—I had received information in the meantime from my son.</p>

               <p>brother, Tom Seeley Brandt, aged 21, and then the prisoner, who is 20 years of age—the prisoner was at school at the Asylum for Fatherless Children at Reedham for six years, from 1874 to 1880—he left there when he was 13 or 14 years of age, and came and lived at home for a little time, and after that he was in the service of several people off and on down to the year 1885—amongst those people was a Mr. Hutchinson, an oil and colourman, of Dulwich, and a Mr. Fleming, a china and glass dealer, of Denmark Hill—from 1885 down to this year he has been con<lb/>stantly at home doing nothing but going errands—he can read and write, he has been very fond of reading—during the time he lived at home he was quiet and inoffensive in his manner—I had had no differences with him, and I knew of none he had had with his brother Tom—so far as I knew they were perfectly good friends—on Thursday evening, 5th May, I was in the company of my brother Tom, and also in the afternoon—the prisoner and we two had had our dinner together on that day shortly after two—the prisoner seemed the same as usual then—we talked together as usual after dinner, but there was nothing in any way to excite attention—we all three had tea together also, about half-past five—we talked as usual then, but we usually did not talk very much—that was the last meal we all three had together—some little time after tea, about six o'clock, Tom and I left the house together, leaving the prisoner behind—I remained in Tom's company till five minutes to 12, and then left him at the Railway Hotel, Champion Hill—on that night we went together into about three public-houses, but we were perfectly sober when we left—I went home alone, and about three minutes after I arrived my brother Tom came in—the prisoner was in the kitchen; it was not usual for him to be up so late—he went to bed generally at 11 o'clock—I said "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Bill.</hi> what's on?"—he said "I have been to the Branch, good com<lb/>pany"—I knew he was alluding then to a music hall called the Rosemary Branch—he seemed then as he always was—there was no signs of drink about him—Tom came in after that conversion—nothing passed be<lb/>tween him and the prisoner while I was there—I said "Good night" to both of them, and having taken off my boots I went upstairs to bed, leaving them both in the kitchen—mother had already gone to bed—I slept in the back room on the first floor—Tom slept in the front room on the same floor, next to me, and my mother slept in the front parlour, underneath Tom's room—the prisoner slept in a room above the kitchen on the same floor as I did—I went to bed about 20 minutes past 12, and about three, as near as I can guess, I heard a sort of a bang—it was only one report—I took no notice of it, arid went to sleep again directly—I did not get up until 20 minutes to 10 the next morning—going down-stairs I would have to pass the prisoner's bedroom, and I noticed the door was open, and went into the room, and saw this lid (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) of a cart<lb/>ridge box on the bed—the bed appeared to have been slept in, and the window of the room was open at the time—I went downstairs then and saw my mother in the kitchen, and made a statement to her, and then she and I went to the prisoner's room, and I showed her the lid of the cart<lb/>ridge box which I had seen previously—on turning down the bed clothes I found this empty cartridge box—I went downstairs then—I then heard my mother go in Tom's room, and then she came down and made a state<lb/>ment to me, in consequence of which I went to Tom's room—I there saw the pillow case of his bed smothered with blood, and he lying in bed in</p>

               <p>his night shirt, on his right side, dead—I left the room immediately and went out and saw a constable, and made a statement to him, and then I went in search of Dr. Hayward, who at one time had attended Tom, but I was unable to find him, and then I went to Dr. Hardy, and he came to the house with me—I was not aware at that time that the prisoner had a revolver and cartridges in his possession—this mallet (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) belongs to me, and is one of my tools—it was usually kept in my tool box in the kitchen—I am a coachman—I last saw it there a month before, the 6th May—I next saw the prisoner on 10th May, when he was in custody—he was away from home all that time—on the 10th, Tuesday morning, I went with Mr. Lane to the cells at the Police-court, where the prisoner was—I asked him what he meant by such dreadful proceedings—he said "Well, Tom annoyed me once; he struck me with a whip last Tuesday"—I said "What for?"—he said "Because I said to him, 'If you can't afford to keep a dog properly you should not keep one at all'"—I said "Because he did that, do you consider yourself justified in taking his life?"—he said "Well, I don't know, it was the brandy that did it"—I said "What brandy?"—he said "Oh, I took half a tumbler of brandy before I did it"—he said he had taken the brandy in his room—I then asked him how he killed Tom—he said "I struck him with the mallet and then I shot him with a revolver"—I asked him if Tom saw him—he said "No," he would not have shot him only he thought he could have shot himself afterwards—I said "You intended killing me as well, did you not?"—he said "Well, you said you would like it"—I said "Oh, that was only in joke"—he said "Ah, but you said it"—I said "When did you alter the lock on my door?"—he said he did that on Thursday afternoon—I then said "Why did you not come into my room?"—he said the report of the pistol so frightened him he made all haste from the house—I then asked him where he went to when he left the house—I understood him to say that he went to some woods round Croydon, and he placed the barrel of the revolver in his mouth, intending to commit suicide, but he had not the heart to pull the trigger—he told me where he had been all day Friday, but I can't remember that—he said that he had fired two shots from the revolver on the Thursday for practice—he said he went into his brother's room at three o'clock on the Friday morn<lb/>ing—besides telling me about the whip he said I did not know half that occurred between him and Tom—he said he had been at Peckham on Friday and Saturday—I asked him if he would like to see his mother—he said "No," and he cried—he said he had bought the revolver on the Thursday at Prescotts and Bingham's, in Church Street, Camberwell, and the cartridges he bought at a shop in the Borough—I asked where he got the money from, and he said that he picked a pocket last February at a Socialist meeting at Peckham, and he went on an excursion with the money last Bank Holiday; that would be Easter Monday, 11th April—I asked him how much money he got—he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him that he had put down a sovereign when he went to buy the revolver, and he said that was correct—he said "I shall plead guilty, they can't give me penal servitude, they must hang me, and then it will be all right, as there is no hereafter"—I had repeatedly heard him speak in that way before, as to there being no hereafter—my brother Tom had been a cab driver—he had a whip, arid kept a dog—the prisoner used to go to Socialist meetings—it might have been a week or a month before this that I spoke about his</p>

               <p>taking my life—it was in joke, all the talk was in joke—he said "I could shoot anybody," and I said "Very well, you had better commence on me at once"—of course it was only larking—he had no revolver at that time—the lock of my bedroom door used to squeak in opening or shutting, because the lock was too near the box: that continued up to 5th May—on the Sunday after the prisoner left I examined the lock, it made no noise then—the box had been knocked back so as it should not touch the lock—I did not see an empty tumbler on the prisoner's mantle-piece on the morning of 6th May—to my knowledge there was no brandy in the house that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I and Tom generally went out together, the prisoner usually went out alone he would go as far as Peckham with me—his mother only allowed him a half-pint of beer at dinner—I never saw him under the influence of drink—at the time I had the conversation with him in the cell he had been remanded on the charge of wilful murder, I had been in Court and heard that—I spoke to him through the grating of the cell—during the greater part of the conversation he was laughing—until I spoke to him about his mother he treated the matter with the greatest unconcern and indifference; he did not appear to realise his position—he and I were the best of friends, and on most affectionate terms—he had no reason for attempting to take my life—I remember once saying that I did not see the use of living if one could not get on—I have no recollection of saying I should like some one to kill me in the night, and then there would be no pain, and saying to the prisoner "Suppose you try, William"—I may have said something having the same meaning—I said to him the week before this Thursday, if one had to die I should like to die in the middle of the night, and no pain—I did also say "Suppose you try, William"—he used to read the newspapers a great deal, especially the police reports—I have heard him discussing Currell's case, the Hoxton murder—he was very interested in that; he would read and re-read the accounts of that case, and discuss it with every one—he spoke in praise of Currell; I heard him say that he was a brave man to take anybody's life like that—I do not know of my own knowledge that he has tried to commit suicide, my mother told me that he had—he told me himself that he had tried to commit suicide by taking chloroform about two years ago, I don't know the time exactly—I don't remember whether it was at the time of the Bartlett case—he was always wishing to be out of the world; he used to say to me "When I lay my head down to sleep of a night I wish that I should never wake again"—he was always talking about dying and making away with one's self; his conversation was mostly like that—he suffered a good deal from pains in his head he used to complain very much of that—he did not say he could not sleep well at night he always told me that he slept very well—there was seldom a day that he did not complain of pains in his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly an assistant-master at Reedham School, where the prisoner was brought up; he was five years under my care, I saw him daily—he entered school at 8 years of age, and left it at 14, I believe—I should describe his conduct perhaps as silly eccentricity, he rather amused the other boys; a kind of silly recklessness distinguished his conduct—he was the butt of the others, both younger and older—in games in the playground he would run about and play about, as if to indicate that he did not know what he was about—he was altogether different from the other boys, and could not fail to attract the attention of anyone especially.</p>

I live at 62, Adey's Road, Dulwich, and belong to the Young Men's Association at Peckham—about eight or nine months ago I casually met the prisoner, who was a stranger to me till then—during these eight or nine months I have seen him on an average about four times a month, once a week; I would have conversation with him—he was constantly talking about death, sudden death and suicide—he said once that he was going to do something desperate, a hanging job—that was between seven and eight months ago—I asked him what he meant, and he said he was going to do something desperate and get hung; he said that he delighted in the thought of death—he said on one occasion "I want you to tell me something"—I said "I will if I can"—he said "There is a little vein or nerve behind the ear, if you prick it it will cause instant death; will you tell me the exact position of it?" I said "I don't know it, but I am sure I should not tell you if I did"—in consequence of his conversations about death we, the members of the Association, used to talk of him familiarly as Sweeney Tod—he was asked into the Association as a friend—these conversations took place every time I saw him almost.</p>

I am head master of the Asylum for Fatherless Children, and I was so in September, 1880; on 30th Sept<lb/>ember, 1880, the prisoner left the Asylum—I was head master fifteen months before he left—during that period he always conducted himself properly at the Asylum, except for trivial boyish offences, nothing serious—he was taught the usual subjects—he was backward; he always seemed to me incapable; he was not a good writer, but he could write and could cipher fairly; he was always reading, and always reading the newspaper—he was not so bright as the other boys—his behaviour was fairly good—I gave him a certificate of his good character when he left—I had my doubts as to whether he would make a good servant; I thought he would be faithful, but I doubted his capacity for doing things—I think he was particularly good at writing from dictation—this certificate cor<lb/>rectly expresses my opinion of him at the time—I had no guide from his previous history at the school.</p>

I have also a paper on which she wrote the address of the van—I asked her to describe the man and woman; I took it down. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "About a quarter-past 3 on the after<lb/>noon of 29th inst. I went with my baby to a hawker's van on the Kingston Road, near the Royal Oak, Leatherhead Common. I saw brooms, brushes, and mats hanging outside the van. I saw a woman and man in the van. I told the woman I wanted to buy a cradle for the baby. The woman showed me a cradle, and asked if I would like to part with the baby. I said I did not mind, and I let her have it. I took the name and address on the left side of the van, 'Mr. Nelson, 39, High Street, Swindon.' The woman said that address would find her, as she had one business there. She said she had no children of her own now, but she once had a little girl and that died. She put a hood on the child, and wrapped it in a black-and-grey shawl. She asked me my name, and I told her, but she did not take it down. The woman was about 35 years of age, rather short, dressed in a brown dress and black hat. The man looked older than the woman, rather short, had dark whiskers.")</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw her on the 24th for the last time—there is no trace of unsoundness of mind about her now; at present I think she is quite sane—she had not been seen by a medical man for three weeks before this act was committed, nor for 10 days after the act—until she was admitted to Holloway she had not been seen by a medical man—she was then seen by Mr. Gilbert—I think that would be a sufficient time for any trace of melancholia to have passed away—in some cases the mere shock incidental to the commission of a crime of this sort tends to bring about an alteration in the mental state—I have heard the account she gave about giving the child away to a gipsy and all those details—that is not at all inconsistent with my view as to this melancholia, because in connection with these acts insane persons will oftentimes tell all sorts of untruths and act apparently in the most cunning way.</p>
