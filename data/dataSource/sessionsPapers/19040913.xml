                  </hi>. I am a porter to Messrs. Waterson and Sons, stationers of St. Bride Street—on August 19th, about 12.10 or 12.15 p.m., I was with a truck in White Street, a turning out of Moor Lane—I know Hackney Road, it is about twenty minutes walk from White Street—I went into a warehouse in White Street, leaving the truck outside un<lb/>attended; there were several parcels on the truck—I was away not more than five minutes; when I came back I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Middleton, who is now serving a month's imprisonment, lifting a parcel out of the truck; he walked across the road and went down the court opposite; the prisoner was following him; I went down the court and caught hold of Middleton—the prisoner instead of assisting me, as I expected him to do, rushed up behind me, let out at me and struck me—I turned round, and as I did so he struck me on the nose again, and then the two of them pummeled me—I held on to Middleton as best I could—he broke away, I followed him; the prisoner ran in another direction—I gave Middleton into custody—the parcel was left in the court and a witness picked it up—the prisoner got away—on September 2nd I went to Moor Lane Police Station—I went into a room where there were nine men in a row—I was told to pick out the man who struck me—I went straight and identified the prisoner; I touched him on the shoulder—it did not take me quarter of second to do—neither of us said anything—I am absolutely positive that he is the man—in the struggle his face was impressed upon my mind—I could recognise him two years afterwards.</p>

I am deputy medical officer at Holloway Prison—the prisoner has been under my supervision since August 26th—shortly after her admission I examined her—she was in an exhausted and melancholic condition and suffering from a complete loss of memory of events up to August 25th—she had a bruise behind her left ear and a small one on her left wrist—both appeared to be recent—events which happened on and after August 25th she remembered imperfectly—prior to that her mind was a blank—during the first six days she improved slightly—up to September 3rd there was very little change in her mental condition—on that date she began to realize her position and what she was charged with—I again visited her on the 4th—she told me her memory had returned suddenly during the night; she said she had had a shock—she said she remembered having given her children their breakfast, but after that nothing, until she was arrested at Hampton—in the course of my inter<lb/>view I found that she had an injury to her head caused by a fall some 17 years before; she said she was rendered unconscious by the fall, and that sometime prior to August 24th she had had attacks of giddiness and singing in her ears, chiefly in her left ear; in each case the attacks had been followed by great depression and feeling as though she must injure herself and others—she also said that during the last four months she had noticed on several occasions a temporary lapse of memory, that she had gone out on an errand and had forgotten what she had gone out for, and had gone home and done nothing—she told me that since her last confinement, 12 months previously, she had had periods of depression, and that such periods had been followed by complications; she said she had a swelling of her leg which was probably from sceptic poisoning following the confinement—she told me she knew she was in a condition of pregnancy—in my opinion she did</p>

'"Who are they?" he said "Englishmen," and shrugged his shoulders—first ho said there were six, then he said ten; he did not say then where ho had met them—I said something about his hat being a different one—he said he went home and fetched another one as he had lost the first one or something of that kind—that day he worked as usual at the club till 10 o'clock—he was arrested on the Monday—on the Sunday he went away before his time—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is his waistcoat; ho wore it on the night before he was arrested.</p>

"No, I have not killed the man. I have no knives. I only used my hands. There were ten on top of me; I saw they were English, and ran away. I saw some Englishmen knocking a woman about and went and spoke to them about it, when one man struck me in the eye and another in the hip. I then ran home at once, after falling down twice. I do not know even the neighbourhood. I go to work at nine in the morning and go home at eleven at night"—that was in reference to the charge of wounding the deceased—in the sime way the charge of wounding Devanny was repeated—I took down his answer; he said. "How can I do it? I never had a knife, and I never carry a knife"—I searched him and found no weapon upon him—he gave his correct name and address—the same day I went to 14, Arthur Street, and saw Mrs. Martin—she pointed out a chest of drawers, and Sergeant Mercer took possession of this knife.</p>

I practice at 41, "Restent's Park Road—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the deceased, on August 1st—I agree with Dr. Rees as to the condition—this knife was handed to me—its longer blade would produce the wound which I found on the deceased—on the blade I observed recent scratches on both sides which indicated the knife had been cleaned by rubbing it on a stone; besides the scratches, in three places on the long blade, and in one place on the smaller blade, I found reddish-brown films, which were firmly adhered to the steel—I also found in the space left for the point of the blade some black fluff, rubbed the lining of a pocket, and some tobacco leaves—I came to the conlusion that the films had been occasioned by mammal blood—Re-examined it under a microscope—in the thumb mark, used for opening the knife, I found a little reddish-brown lump, which on examination appeared to be composed of blood cells and also very large cells such as form the covering of the skin; I should say where the skin is tender—I think it was the skin of a human, they were human epithelium cells—I had the deceased's clothes given me for examination—I have measured the size of the penetrating holes—I think he was wearing a black serge jacket, waistcoat, trousers, woollen pants,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190409130021"/>
               <p>shirt, and woollen vest—the cut in the outside clothes fitted exactly the width of the knife, which is 1/2 m.; the other clothing did not fit so well because it expanded more—I examined Devanny's clothing—I think the cuts in his clothing may have been caused by the same instrument, although the clothes had been washed and the cuts stitched up—I examined the stains on the lining of the prisoner's waistcoat—I found on the left half a series of six reddish brown slightly glistening smears, which on microscopic and other examination appeared to have been caused by mammal blood—the scratches on the knife are subsequent to its receiving the stains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blade of the knife had been cleaned from two-thirds downwards right to the point—I submitted the spots to the microscopical examination—at the present state of medical science it is impossible to say what animal the blood came from, only that it is the blood of a mammal—it is an ordinary knife—I cannot give a definite date as to when the spots on the knife were produced—I cannot pledge myself as to when the spots came upon the prisoner's waistcoat.</p>

"I strangled her; we were struggling for half an hour; she threatened to set fire to my bed to-night; I thought about giving myself up to the police, only the sun was shining, it was such a fine day"—I took him to the station and handed him over to Inspector Daniel.</p>

"These are blood stains?"—he said, "Yes, they came from my mouth; it has been bleeding"—the right sleeve of his shirt was torn—I saw black marks on the deceased's throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at 8, Doughty Street—I have known this family some years, and the daughter as an intemperate young woman—I was called to the house about 4 p.m. on August 2nd—I found the deceased lying on her back on the floor with her head towards the window, fully dressed, dead, and quite warm—on examining her I found a bruise on the right side of her neck—the room was in disorder—two vases were lying on the bed, and a palm had been rooted out of a pot and the earth was hanging about it—the palm was about 3 ft. high—the next day I examined the deceased with Dr. Connor—there was nothing to cause death externally—there was another bruise on the other side of her neck in a similar position to the other, but further back—that had come out since I saw her last—she had a slightly black eye. but that was old—the only symptoms connected with death were the marks on her neck—the cause of death was strangulation caused by external pressure and inter<lb/>ference with the entrance to the lungs—the marks on her neck would explain such pressure—I saw the bruise on her right side caused by a right hand thumb, and an abrasion caused by a nail—the mark that came out afterwards was probably caused by the lingers.</p>

               <p>was a broken flower pot in the room—the palm would not cause the injury, it was not heavy—the deceased's liver was enlarged caused by excessive drinking—the weather was exceedingly hot—the woman's stomach was loaded with food—the hot weather to a person who had been drinking would conduce to a fit, but not to epilepsy—if the glottis closed that would have caused suffocation—supposing she had violently attacked the prisoner and he got her by the throat, not having used sufficient force to strangle her, a fit coining on, a hot day, and the stomach being full of food, death might possibly happen.</p>
               <p>

"Yes"—I told him the charge—he said, "I know; quite right; but I did not ask him for the money, he gave it to me"—I conveyed him to the police station—when charged he said, "That is right; I had 6s.; he knows what it was for," pointing to the prosecutor, "he promised me 10s."—I charged him with, demanding money by threats and menaces, and told him that he had been pointed out as the man who had obtained 6s. the day before from John Robert Pooler, and that, I should take him into custody on that charge—I found on him 7s. 6d. in silver (three 2s. pieces) and 7d. bronze—I afterwards went to him in the cells for the purpose of making inquiries, such as the names of people he had worked for, when he voluntarily said, "I should think the further he goes on with this case the worse it will be for him; he wanted me to * * * he promised me 10 bob; I never asked for any"—he was charged with a further offence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Liverpool Street, King's Cross, and am a diamond mounter—on August 12th I was in Regent's Park, and saw the prisoner on a plot of grass near the flower gardens—there were two little girls with him—I did not know them—they were all lying on the grass, the two little girls on their chests, their chins resting on their hands, the prisoner lying alongside of them—they were talking—I did not say anything to them on that occasion—next day I was in the park, and saw the prisoner meet the same two little girls—I heard him say that he was sorry he was so late; he also apologised for having forgotten to bring a book he had promised—the girls spoke to him—he pulled out a bag of plums and distributed them—I went away, and returned a little later and noticed the prisoner lying full length on the grass alone with Beatrice Guiver—I said to my friend who was with me, "Keep a watch on the man"—ten minutes afterwards the girl went away with the other children in one direction and the prisoner in another—we followed him, and saw him meet the girl again in the flower gardens—we followed the prisoner; he noticed us, because I saw him turn round—he then disappeared—we stopped where we were and saw him join the children again—we followed them, and he disappeared a second time—we saw him rejoin them again, leading them in the direction of Regent's Canal—we stopped him and asked him what business he had with the children and whether they were any friends of his—he said that he knew their mother and was going to live in their house—I did not believe it and asked the girl, but I do not know that the prisoner could hear—the next day I saw the prisoner in the flower gardens—he asked me why I followed him about, and I said I did not approve of this acquaintance with the girls, as their parents knew nothing about it, and I did not think he was a fit companion for them—the previous day I saw the prisoner hand a slip of paper to Beatrice Guiver; I asked her what it was, and she said it was his name and address—I asked the prisoner why he gave his name and address to the girl, and he said he wanted to take her somewhere—I told him he had no business to take a girl of that age anywhere without the knowledge of her parents—he said there was no harm in it—I said it was a matter of opinion, and if I saw him speak to the girl again, I should communicate with her parents—next day, Monday morning, I saw him again hiding in Woburn Mews, on the opposite side of the road to where the girl lives—I had ascertained where she lived, and went to the house and told her parents what I had seen—the father went for a policeman, and 1 saw the prisoner run away.</p>

Mrs. Ayton, came up and spoke to the prisoner—I think she slapped his face—I then went home—the prisoner told me it was Mr. Verebety who had been after the girls in the park, and that he had apologised to him (the prisoner) for telling me what was wrong about him.</p>

I am a tram car conductor, of 608, Holloway Road—on August 28th, at 7.11 p.m., I was going in the direction of Sermon Lane, when at the junction of Holloway Road and Liverpool Road, I was stopped by the prisoner, who was standing on the pavement with two children—he brought them across the road and assisted one of them, who wore a bonnet, on to the car and they went on top—on reaching St. James Road, I went up to collect the fares, and he handed me a 1d. and four half pennies—he was sitting between the two children—I said there was no need to pay for both of the babies, and I handed him back two half pennies—a little farther along a woman shouted, but I did not take it that she was shouting at me—I had to stop about two hundred yards further on to set down some passengers, when a boy ran up and said, "Stop the tram, there is a man on top stealing two children," and ran up stairs and caught hold of one of the children—I went on top and said, "What is the matter?" and—the boy said, "Child stealing is the matter"—I said. I cannot have a fight on the top of the car. you had better come</p>

I am going home"—I took him to where the prosecutor was—he pulled a quartern bottle of whisky out of his pocket, saying, "I am going to have a drink of whisky," and I said, "You are not; you are in custody"—he then threw it to the ground and broke it—Tarbuck was caught in Brick Lane; Humphries got away—at 4 p.m. on September 5th.

"Is that right, you took my stand"—the stand is in Commercial Street, Spitalfields—I said, "I did not exactly take the stand, it was let to me, and another thing, if it was not let to me it would be let to someone else"—I went to make my way to the room when I was knocked down—I didn't know by whom at first—when I tried to get up the prisoner got hold of me—I cannot exactly tell what he did—he got one hand over me and was hitting me with the other—he was pulled off by three men—he said, "Let me go, I'll kill him"—then I was taken to Guy's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jacob Eggar—On July 18th I was livinq at 10. Suffolk Street, Poplar, with my husband and three babies—my husband and I were thinking of giving up the house and going back to Hungary—we had advertised in a German paper that our furniture was for sale—on July 18th the prisoner called about 12.30 p.m.—my hus<lb/>band comes to dinner at one, and goes back at 1.30—about 12.30 I was down stairs—I heard a knock and looked out of the window—seeing the man was up stairs I went up, opened the door, and said "What do you want?"—he said "I have seen the advertisement in the paper, you have one suite of furniture for sale"—I said "I have sold some"—he said "I am very sorry; have you more for sale?"—I said "Yes, I have one wash-stand, one chair bedstead, and one single bedstead"—the chair bedstead folds up. and is made of iron—it has cushions—he said "Show me any<lb/>thing and tell me the price"—I showed him the things, and said the bedstead was 25s., the chair bedstead 23s. and the wash stand 3s.—he noted it on a piece of paper in a book—the bedstead and wash stand were upstairs at the top and the chair bedstead on the same floor as the street door—I said. "Come with me in the front room"—we sat on opposite sides oi the table—he said Is there anybody upstairs?"—I said "yes, nice English people"—he said he would like to look over the house, and asked where the landlord lived—I said "I cannot tell you"—he asked for the rent book—I said, "I cannot give you my rent book, my husband has got it"—he said. "If I have your rent book I will find out the landlord: I have a good reference, you please give me the furniture for. "30s."—I said, "I will tell my husband"—about o'clock he said. "I am now busy, I will come back with my wife at half-past 2"—he went upstairs to the first and second floors before my husband came—my clothes were down stairs in a box—in the back room which opens on to the passage <hi rend="italic">whore</hi> the front door is there was a basket with my clothes and those of my husband and children which I was going to send to Hungary—he said, "What have you got there?"—I said, "My clothes to send to my mother"—in the basket was £14 in gold—he came again at 2.30 p.m.—my husband had come and gone—I asked, "Where is your wife?"—he said, "I will pay for it, I want to see over the house, and see everything, because my wife is" very particular: are there people upstairs?"—I said, "Yes"—he said. "I do not want the English lady; I want to buy <hi rend="italic">horn you the</hi> bedstead; I want to keep a house in Poplar; I like Poplar hotter"—the lodger's wife talked to me in the parlour and went out—the prisoner got on a chair and pulled the curtain to see which way she had gone—he asked where my biggest boy was—I said at school—he said, "You show me the chair bedstead and everything in the house; I want to bee the yard, and the oven, and look in the coal cupboards and every where"—I said.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner is a complete stranger to me—he remained till about 3 minutes to I—23 minutes—only my two babies were with me—I told him my husband was coming at 1 o'clock—he said he could not wait, he had got very busy—we had sold furniture on the Saturday—it had been removed—very few articles had been left in the house—one bed was not to be taken till we had gone—what was left would require a trunk to remove—the prisoner wore glasses first, hut not afterwards—he was not drunk—he was very nice with me—he said, "I don't want the lodger to see"—I told that to the magistrate—my deposition was read to me—they did not understand me—I cannot remember calling attention to its not being written down, nor that the prisoner said, "I want to see which way the lodger is going"—I made a statement to a clerk at the Treasury before I went to the Police-court—the prisoner said that—no one has spoken to me about it since I gave my evidence—I never said the prisoner asked, "Where is your big boy" till now—I remember it now—I saw no stone in prisoner's hand—I never lost my senses—my table knife was lying on the table—he stabbed me with it, and cut my throat three or four times—little grazes—there was not much blood—I was able to get up—he kicked the back of my hand—and—slid, 'I will kill you first and then your children if you scream like that." and "If not I will leave you alone"—the room door was unlocked—I shut the street door and locked it, and had the key in my pocket when I ran into the street—T next saw the prisoner carried out by the police—my baby was not injured: it was ill at the time.</p>

Oxford Street, auctioneers—I know the prisoner—early in October, 1903, he called on me and said, "You remember me, Mr. Bonham, do you not?"—I said, "Well, no, sir, for the moment I cannot say I do;" "Oh," he said, "My name is Butler, you bought some' goods from me seven or. eight or nine years ago"—I said "Oh, yes, I remember you, sir"—he asked me if I would purchase his furniture in the sale way, as I had done previously—I made an appoint<lb/>ment to visit his premises, and went to 495, Fulham Road, on October 9th—the premises contained' new and second-hand furniture—I went through the stock with him and offered him £300 for the whole of it, ex<lb/>cepting some furniture in two or three living rooms—his reason for dis<lb/>posing of it was that he said he had got mixed up with a married woman</p>

"I sent no postcard," but afterwards he said he did so, saving he would be in the City next day—he then produced a ledger showing two entries—one amounting to £1 19s. 10d. bought from F. Palmer, and another amounting to £3 0s. 1d., bought from Palmer &amp;Co.—he said, "These are the goods; I'll write Smith's name against it."</p>

Wills &amp; Co."—all the goods seized are not included in the lists—of the goods seized some were in the window and some were hanging up inside and on the door where anyone could see them—I did not see a sealing wax holder—the prosecutor produced it from his pocket after the evidence at the police court had been taken—Priseman, referring to the entries, said, "I put it down here in the name of Palmer, I thought it would be all right"—he did not tell me Palmer was a name he used for cash purchases—when I asked him if he had, sent Smith a post card he hesitated and then said "Yes"—it was immediately after that, that he brought out the ledger and showed me the entries—he said be bought them in the name of Smith and entered them in the name of Palmer—he gave no reason for that.</p>

"Yes, I did tell him I was coming to the City"—in his presence the prosecutor identified the property—later on Smith said to Priseman, "You asked me to get the goods, and you know that I stole them and you told me that the firm would not "know"—Priseman said "No, I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale merchant of 39. Noble Street, City, and trade as "J. P. Hemming"—Smith has been in my employ about three years as a porter and warehouseman—on August 24th last I missed some things, and I accused Smith of stealing them—after some time he confessed, and I sent for the police—he then made a statement to me and to the police—in consequence I went with two police officers to a shop in Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town—I saw Priseman there—he also had a small office in the top floor of the building where I carry on business—he did not rent it from me—I believe he was a manufacturers' agent—at his shop I recognised some goods belonging to me—I recognise the goods on this list as being my goods—none of the goods had been sold by my authority to Priseman—the prices marked against them at which they are bought are much lower than the proper price—one article sold at 3s. 6d. should be 6s.—another, 4s. should be 7s. (6d.—the next. 2s. 6d. should be 6s. 6d.—the total for that list is £2 1s. 10d., and it should be nearer £7—some years ago for a short time I traded in the name of "C.

I was on duty in Edgware Road when I saw the prisoner inside a gate leading to Grove Park—he said he had been there to have a sleep, and had been awakened up by a man riding a bicycle—I went to where he had been lying down and saw a bicycle—he said he bought it from a man in Tottenham Court Road for £5 10s., and was paying for it by instalments—he did not know who the man was—he gave his name as Albert Jackson and his address 8, Nelson Street, Camden Town—it was a false address—when searched 22 cigars and a bunch of keys were found on him—he said the cigars he had won in a raffle—the cigars and keys have been identified by the prosecutor as his property.</p>

I am a sculptor, and live at Brook Lodge, Hendon—these cigars are similar to those I had at my house—those keys are mine—the articles were safe in my house on August 7th—I missed them the next morning—the cigars were part of six boxes—I did not miss the keys until I was shown them—they are an old set—the total value of the property taken is about £30—I lost a lot of silver—a burglary had been undoubtedly committed at my house—the burglars, I think, got through the billiard-room window—altogether 294 cigars were taken—I don't know the—distance from my house to the place where the prisoner was found.</p>

He informed me that his master had lent him his horse and cart to go over to Hammersmith to see his mother, as it was a holiday. I thought, of course, that it was the truth. He asked me to have a ride. Two police officers stopped me, having no light. I told them Riches was the guv'nor. They then asked him for his name and address, and he told them it was on the cart, and they copied it down. As it was near home I said 'Good-night,' and went to where I live, Acton. William Davis and Samuel Radley came to me and asked if I had seen anything of John Riches, as he had stolen a cart and harness. I told them all I saw."</p>

The clothes will all fit you, and you can have the clothes and bag as well"—this happened two or three years ago—he has not worn any of the clothing since—the field glasses were bought at an auction room—I did not buy them for the prisoner, nor did I tell him that I had—on the Friday previous to my missing the £50 I told him that if he did not give up his drinking habits and keep better hours he had better find fresh lodgings—it was on the Friday previous to that that there was a row about his refusing to do certain work—I have never told him to clear out—there was some jewellery of mine in his room which was not missing—I do not remember his calling my atten<lb/>tion to £2 15s. which I had left in his room—I was instrumental in getting sureties for his bail when he was committed for trial.</p>

Carty"—I said, "C-a-r-t-y"—he said, "Yes"—I took him to Chief-Inspector Arrow and took down a statement which he made—he could see what I was writing—when I commenced to write he said, "Put down 'Carter,' not 'Carty'"—this is the statement: "W. A. Carter, sailor, <hi rend="italic">City of Agra</hi>, Woolwich, says:—I have come to New Scotland Yard of my own free will to give information for the recovery of the Lord Nelson relics stolen from the British Museum. I have been cautioned that anything I say may be used in evidence against myself. The above is my name and the last ship. I have been shown a letter dated. "3.2.04 from the Sailors' Home, Melbourne, containing sketches of a watch and seal, and I say that the letter was written by me, and I made the sketches. I can only repeat what is in that letter. I have possession of the watch and seal referred to in the letter. They are in my luggage in a room I occupy in the Victoria Road,</p>

I am paying a dollar a week. I saw a notice up 'Lodgings to Let' (last Monday), and I took the room. I was paid off a Norwegian barque <hi rend="italic">City of Agra</hi> last Friday at Hamburg. I produce my discharge I came from Hamburg by the <hi rend="italic">Iris</hi> to Cotton's Wharf, London Bridge, arriving last Monday morning. I went by train to Fenchurch Street to Customs House, then I walked down the Victoria Dock Road towards Woolwich for about ten minutes, and then I came to the house where I am living. I say I got possession of the watch and seal as stated by me in the letter. Besides what I have got (the watch and seal) I have seen a medal; it was in possession of the man from whom I took the watch and seal; it was one of the Nelson relics stolen from the British Museum. I have also seen a snuff-box, a gold one. It is in the possession of a man at Melbourne who has befriended me, and I won't give him away. I could get it if I went out there for it. He is a receiver out there, but keeps a tobacconist shop as a blind. I refuse to say what his name is. The man that I took the watch and seal from told me that he was one of a crowd that got some stuff away here, and that was his share. I met him in Flinder Street, Melbourne, and I believe he left on the <hi rend="italic">Borealis</hi> three days after I left, and that was on the 18th February, for Newcastle, New South Wales, and thence to Eureka, California. He signed on in the <hi rend="italic">City of Agra</hi> with me, but backed out of his contract. I don't know his name. I won't describe him. I have seen nothing else except the watch and seal which I have, and the snuff-box and medal which I believe are in Melbourne. The medal may be with the man who has gone to Eureka. I was staying at Woolwich about five years ago. I have been through Greenwich, but I don't know Greenwich, and I don't know Greenwich Hospital. I have never been in the Greenwich Hospital to my knowledge. I did not know the Nelson Relics were stolen from the Greenwich Hospital. I thought they were stolen from the British Museum. That's why I wrote to the British Museum this statement has been read over to me by Chief Inspector Arrow, and it is perfectly true. William Alfred Carter. Witness: William Burch, Sergt,"</p>

Among the relics was Nelson's watch. I am led to believe that I have the identical watch in my possession. I will tell you how I came by it. Some time ago a sailor accosted me in Flinders Street. He appeared to be in an intoxicated state. I, wishing to save him from trouble with the police, offered to escort him to his ship. He said he had no ship at the time, and was in a penniless condition. I gave him a shilling and bid him good-bye. Three days after I saw him loafing round the docks. He did not recognise me, so I thought I would make myself known. He said he had a slight recollection of someone giving him a shilling. One thing led on to another. We proceeded down the docks, he presumably seeking employment. After sometime had elapsed I consulted my watch, and remarked that it had stopped. I asked him if he had any idea of the time. He said he had a watch, but, it was not in working order. He produced the watch for my inspection. I then asked him if he wished I to dispose of it. He said he Would not pare with it under any consideration. This acted as a bait to my covetousness. I was determined. to got it. With that purpose in view I plied him freely with liquor. Thinking. I presume, that he had found a friend in need. he commenced. according to Australian slang, to come his gut. 'He began telling me some of his expeiences in England. I judged by the general drift of his conversation that he had sailed his hand it) crime. I hinted as much, and he admitted that he had been connected with some daring thefts in England I and America. He began to specify some of them; one of them was he theft of Nelson's relics. I asked him if the Witch was one of them. Seeing. I guess, that he was committing him<lb/>self, he said No. I said nothing but thought a lot. I shall not describe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190409130076"/>
               <p>how I obtained the article. However, I think the means justified the end. I will now describe the watch as well as I can. I was informed by a jeweller in Bourke Street that it bore the old George mark, and could not be under 100 years old. It is rather larger than a lady's, but bulky. It is of very thick gold. At the back of the outside case is inscribed the stern of an old man-of-warsman, probably of the time of Elizabeth—It has written across the stern 'San Josef.' The hours are marked with ordinary figures. It has attached to it a small gold slip ring with a seal of some red stone and a common watch key (common). The seal por<lb/>trays a woman holding a snake in the right hand extended. (The follow<lb/>ing is a rough sketch of the watch). If all the above should tally with the lost relic you will kindly let me know. You will address communi<lb/>cations to 'Eucalyptus,' General Post Office, Melbourne, To be called for. I expect to receive a fair reward if this is the right one. I took it to a dealer in antiques and he said that I could easily obtain £100 for it. The case is fully worth £10 for the gold alone. I might add that it would be foolish to communicate this to the police, as I would have it destroyed. Should you feel inclined to get it back without undue publicity and fuss the best way is through the curator or head of the Melbourne Museum. By sending a full description of the relic and a promise not to prosecute with £120 to 'he Director of the Museum, you will probably get it back.—Yours, etc. Eucalyptus. Curator, British Museum"—about 2.30, on July 1st, 1904, I was at Scotland Yard, and received a communication from Sergeant Burch, which was followed by the prisoner's introduction into my presence, and his making a statement which was taken down—"t was afterwards read over to him, and signed by him—I showed him the letter just read, and he said it was his—he then said he would go with me and point out the house in Victoria Dock Road that he referred to; we went in a cab—on the way he said, "I will point out my lodging to you, but it is no good your gong there, someone came to Scotland Yard with me, and I told him if I was detained to go back to my room and get the relics"—as we got to the house, he pointed out 293, Victoria Dock Road, saying, "That is where I lodge"—I took him to Canning Town Police Station, and Sergeant Burch and I went to the house—we saw Mrs. Tuck, and she pointed out his room and luggage, but we found nothing there—I returned to Canning Town Police Station, and said to the prisoner. "I have searched your room and luggage: I am satisfied it is as you left it this morning, but there are no relics there; I must detain you, and charge you with being concerned in stealing and receiving the Nelson relics in December, 1900"—he said at once. "I can prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi:</hi> I left England in 1899 for Australia, and have been there ever since; if you charge me you will never get them back, but if you let me go and give me a written undertaking that I shall not suffer in any way, I can produce them"—I said.

(39 <hi rend="italic">K.</hi>) About 5.30 on Tuesday, August 16th, I was called to 47, Tanner's Hill—after the fire was over I entered—I saw paraffin in the first floor front room on the bed, on the floor, on the picture cords, and on the mantel shelf—I cautioned the prisoner; he said, "I had a row with my wife, and poured paraffin over the shop and bed room and set light to them"—I told him I should take him into custody—as he was going down the stairs he said, I did not tell the children or the servant I was going to do it; they went out at the back door"—when charged he made no reply—he appeared very much upset.</p>
