               <p>Ellis. There was a tankard of hot, made of ale and gin, for some company.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge him with it?</p>

               <p>Q. to Sanders. Had it a gnomon upon it when it was in your master's garden?</p>
               <p>Sanders. It had a gnomon to it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gregory. What did you give for it?</p>
               <p>Gregory. I bought it as old brass, I gave him nine shillings and a peny; it weighed thirteen pounds two ounces; and he brought two brass candlesticks feet, and part of a knocker.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take him to be?</p>
               <p>Gregory. I believed he dealt in old pewter and old brass, and such things. He told me he was a country dealer, and used to buy up these things in the country. I have had a great deal of trouble in this case in taking the Prisoner, and if I had not taken him, I might probably have stood in his shoes.</p>

I went into the prisoner's room, and there Mrs. Dawson found a shaving cloth, that she said was her's then I took the prisoner, and she owned she had taken the gow ns and pawned them in Berwick street, Soho, where I found them; the gowns were wet when I first had them; I found the three caps pawned in the name of Rose Robinson, and the people could not tell who took them in. The mistress said she did not, and the maid said she did not; but it appeared that the ticket which was upon the goods that were pawned was of the mistress's handwriting. <rs id="t17450530-4-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Kyte. It was between seven and eight. I went round the house to count the tankards and mugs; when I came to the table where the prisoners sat, I missed the man in the blue coat [Collyer] and the mug (my master has seven silver tankards, and six mugs. )</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoners the silver mug to drink out of ?</p>
               <p>Kyte. They had a pewter pot first, but Collyer gave me the silver mug afterwards to draw the beer in. Collyer went out, and came in again presently, and then I charged him with taking the mug, and charged a constable with him directly.</p>

            . I went it into the house just before the prisoner came in, and had a pint of ale in a silver mug; they had a pint of beer in a pewter pot. Collyer came in with something in a dirty cloth; and they said, what have you got there? he said, a fillet of veal, what, said they, in that dirty bag? Upon that he threw it out, and there was two or three trowels of mortar in it, which he threw behind the chimney, and said, he would make a cross bunn of it. I went away soon after, and the maid said, the minute I was gone they gave her the mug to fill. I went from Mr. Creed's to the Founders arms in Founders court, and was sent for back again directly. I was not twenty minutes out of the house before I came back again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Collyer. I bid the maid not to frighten herself about the mug, for I would not go out of the house till she was satisfied, and I staid till the constable came, which was eleven o'clock; it was about ten o'clock when the watchmen came down, and I said, Mr. Creed, I will not make any resistance, for I am innocents and we went with the watchmen to the watch-house, and from the watch-house to the Counter without any constable.</p>

I asked him whose servant he was; he said he was my Lord Bollingbroke's servant; I said, I believed my Lord was not in town. I asked him how he came by it; he said, his brother gave it him. I asked him where his brother lived; he said, he lived with a gentleman whose name I have forgot. I said, you say your brother is a servant to a gentleman, it is very odd that he should give you a gold watch: he shall said that his brother gave it him. I said, if he did not give a better account of it, I must stop him. He said, what! do you think I stole it? I told him, to be plain with him, I did believe he had stolen it.

               <p>Masters. It was in an open drawer, but I had not seen it for some months. The Prisoner is a downright country boy, and I believe it is the first fact that ever he was guilty of. <rs id="t17450530-9-verdict57" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 24th of May between three and four o'clock in the afternoon my girl was playing about Spittle Square, the Prisoners picked her up, and carried her into Flower and Dane Street, took her gown off, and carried it to one Mr. Dockery a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they took away your child's gown?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. By their own confession before the Justice, they owned the stealing that gown, and several other things from other children.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your child?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. Six years of age last January.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it in the street?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. It was in a little passage going into a house; the child knew the place again.</p>

               <p>Dockery. She lives in the neighbourhood overagainst me, and I never knew any harm of her. This is the gown I lent money on.</p>
               <p>Carpenter. This is my child's gown.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoners. How came you by the gown?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Metcalf. The little girl desired us to go and play with her, and this other Prisoner and I stripped the child of her gown, and went to the pawnbroker's with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown [a girl about fourteen years old.] We were going along together, and Metcalf pulled the gown off the child.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dockery. How came you to let such a child as that have money upon goods?</p>
               <p>Dockery. Because her mother used to send her with things.</p>

               <p>Barker. I am sure he is the man: I was carrying him and thirteen more who were to be transported, and he got away from me about two miles and an half from Reading, as I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he confined then?</p>
               <p>Barker. He was in irons and handcuffed, but he had cut them off: he carried one of the bazzils along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any more of them get away?</p>
               <p>Barker. No; I carried thirteen safe.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day-light?</p>
               <p>Barker. It was not quite day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Barker. I was on horseback on the right hand side of the waggon, there was another person on the other side of the waggon, and three or four persons with them in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss him?</p>
               <p>Barker. I did not miss him till day-light, and found his irons in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him again?</p>
               <p>Barker. I found him in the Poultry Counter, and he threatened our lives then.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you of his being there?</p>
               <p>Barker. The goal keeper was informed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him at large since his conviction?</p>

               <p>Lancelot Howlet. I am a watchman of Portsoken Ward.

He wounded some of the watchmen in Gravel Lane, and they got a warrant for him that day as soon as they had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a riot in the night, and an abuse of the watch?</p>
               <p>Howlet. Yes; and we went to assist the Constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>

               <p>Q. What creature?</p>
               <p>Howlet. Why, a whore or a harlot, or whatever you please to call it. There was a quarrel at an alehouse in Gravel Lane, and I heard that the Prisoner had got away, but the people said there was a watchman very much hurt, and that the Warder had been knocked down and very much abused; so as soon as possible Mr. Day the Beadle got a warrant and went to his lodging, and my partner and I went with him, and we went in with a design to knock him down for fear of his doing us a mischief: I catched the Prisoner by the collar, and he offered, as I thought, to put his hand in his pocket, and presently he gave a chop, and I was cut, but I do not know what he did it with.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Prisoner that cut you?</p>
               <p>Howlet. I saw nobody but the Prisoner and my partner, and I hope your Lordship don't think the watchmen would cut one another. The Prisoner got away from us, but going up the steps by Devonshire Squire we took him again.</p>

               <p>Howlet. I had hold of his left fist, and with his right hand he made a chop at me, and I received a cut at that time.</p>

When I came to the publick house, he wanted to run away, but I took hold of his collar, and he knocked me down; this was at the alehouse. My watchmen hearing that I was in a fray came to my assistance; but the prisoner being a stout, lusty fellow (and, as I suppose, fearing something of danger if he was taken) knocked me down again, and run away.</p>

On the 13th of May, I saw these things advertised, and they are very remarkable; so I went to Mr. Morton's, and acquainted him with it. The Prisoner came next day, and I stopped her: she used to bring wearing apparel of her husband's, almost every week, and I never suspected her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her husband?</p>
               <p>Sherrar. He is a journeyman carver, his name is Boswell, he is a man of a pretty good reputation, he works with a carver in Long Acre. She said, she lived in Dirty Lane in Holborn; (there are two places called Dirty Lane,) one in Holborn, and the other in Long Acre; and I found she lodged in Parker's Lane in Drury Lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at my chairwoman's house on the 1st of May, from two o'clock in the afternoon, till eleven at night; and Mr. Morton said, they were taken away at two o'clock on the first of this instant. I met an acquaintance of mine, one Mrs. Jones, who lived in Essex, one day as I was going to Clare Market, and she told me, her aunt was dead, and had left her her clothes, and desired to know, if I could recommend her to an honest pawnbroker: I told her I knew a very honest man; then she desired me to pawn them for her; I said, I was not willing to do it, she had better pawn them herself; but as she desired me to do it, I pawned them to Mr. Sherrar, where I used to go, and I would have taken her up to have cleared my self, if I could have found her. She said, she would pull the black gown and petticoat to pieces, to make herself mourning for her aunt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blower. Your landlady said, you had picked that black gown to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Sherrar I was very sorry they were stolen, and that the woman I had them from was at the end of the street.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Chitty. I was in the room out of which the goods were taken at considerably past nine o'clock at night, and I saw that every thing was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know what time it was?</p>
               <p>Chitty. I have a great deal of regard to time; I have a clock in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door fastened?</p>
               <p>Chitty. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you find the door open?</p>
               <p>Chitty. It was about three quarters after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you discover it at first?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174505300015"/>Chitty. My wife, and I, and the maid, were in the back parlour, behind the room where the goods were; the maid looked round her, and said, God bless me, there is something white: my wife and I went into the room, and they proved to be two shirts of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you saw that every thing was fast?</p>
               <p>Chitty. About half an hour. My wife is a mantua maker, and she remembered she had laid five gowns down in the room, she looked for them, and found they were gone, and that we were robbed of a great deal of linen besides: the gowns lay in a parcel behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Chitty. I lost five gowns; there were two gowns of one gentlewoman's, Mrs.

            's, that we are charged five guineas for; there is a gown which is called six pieces of silk, which I think my wife paid a guinea for; a tabby gown of her own she valued at two guineas, 18 shirts which I charge at 4 l. 10 s. though they cost 17 s. a shirt: (there are a great many more things than my wife or I could think of;) and at the lowest I could set them at they amounted to 19 l. 10s. or 11s. which is much less than the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see upon your coming into the room?</p>
               <p>Chitty. I saw the shirts lying upon the ground; I found the parlour door open, and the street door open, but the windows were all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were in the next room while the things were took away, how came you not to hear them?</p>
               <p>Chitty. It was a surprizing thing that we should not hear, but whether we were talking louder than ordinary, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What partition was there between the room you were in and the other?</p>
               <p>Chitty. But a very thin wainscot, and the door was not shut, it was partly open, and I was the more surprized at the robbery upon that account.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Chitty. It was a dark misty night.</p>

            , otherwise Toss off Dick, and Lucas; we went from Lucas's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go?</p>
               <p>Bye. We went out about eight o'clock, when it was just dusk, and went to Gray's Inn, then we went into Hand Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do there?</p>
               <p>Bye. We all four went down to the watchmaker's.</p>
               <p>Q. To what watchmaker's?</p>
               <p>Bye. To Mr. Chitty's; I did not know he was a watchmaker then; when we came there Lucas opened the latch of the street door, and went into the entry, and then opened the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that stand? was it on the right hand or on the left hand?</p>
               <p>Bye. As you go in it was on the right hand; when he had opened the parlour door I went into the house after him, and Toss off Dick and Jeffs stood at the street door waiting for what things we brought out; Lucas stood at the parlour door and bid me bring in a dark lanthorn, which we had for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Bye. I was in the entry, Lucas ordered me to go and light the dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Bye. It was dark, it was a misty night, and rained a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Bye. I went to a chandler's shop and lighted a candle, and brought it out between my fingers, and when I came out I put it into the lanthorn, put the blind before it, and put it under my coat, then I came into the entry and left Jeffs and Toss off Dick at the door; I gave the lanthorn to Lucas, and he went into the parlour with it, and presently returned with some womens clothes. I went to Horton for the bag, and Lucas took it out of my hand and put it into Jeffs's hand through a mistake: when he gave these things to Jeffs he ordered him to go and stand at Gray's Inn Gate; Lucas went in again and brought out as many things as I could carry away in the slaps of my coat and under my arms, and Toss off Dick took as many as he could carry away in his arms, and Lucas came out and brought as many as he could carry in his coat and breast; then we went out to speak to Jeffs. I pulled off this coat [the coat he had on] and laid it upon the dunghill, and put as many of the goods into it as I could, and Lucas ordered Jeffs to pull off his coat and put the rest of the things into it; then Lucas ordered Toss off Dick and I to stay at the dunghill till he and Jeffs went to the house again, and they returned with as many things as they could well bring away; then we took the handkerchiefs off our necks to tie them up in.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of goods were they?</p>
               <p>Bye. There were a great many shirts and stocks, and I remember this damask cap with a gold button to it in particular. We went a third time to the house, and brought a great many more things away; then we carried all the goods to Lucas's house, and we persuaded Toss off Dick to go home, and told him we should not look at the things that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Bye. They were sold to

               <p>Q. What, for all these goods?</p>
               <p>Bye. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you?</p>
               <p>Bye. We had half a guinea a-piece?</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the money?</p>
               <p>Bye. Lucas did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of these goods delivered to Young?</p>
               <p>Bye. I saw her bring some of the goods away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know how you came by them?</p>

               <p>Bye. Yes; very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Bye. No; but she knew it very well. Jeffs, Lucas, and I, sold her as many things another time as were worth 15 l. for 40 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Lucas tell her how you came by these goods?</p>
               <p>Bye. I did not hear him say any thing to her about that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go down this place to Chitty's house ?</p>
               <p>Bye. We went down the court to see what we could get, and tried at several latches in the court, but none of them would open but that.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this was Chitty's house ?</p>
               <p>Bye. It was over against the tavern; for the next day we went down the court to hear what rumours there were about the robbery, and we found it was over against the Vine Tavern.</p>
               <p>Chitty. It is within one door of being over against the Vine Tavern; they might easily know that, for my name is wrote in capital letters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jeffs. Had I any of the goods or money?</p>
               <p>Bye. You took one parcel of the goods away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Horton. Where did you ever see me?</p>
               <p>Bye. I have seen you at the chimney sweeper's in Thatched Alley by Chick Lane, where you used to go.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Lucas?</p>
               <p>Bye. To the best of my knowledge it was much about the beginning of April that I first knew him, just after he came from Chelmsford : he told me that you was his council there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was tried there?</p>
               <p>Bye. He told me so.</p>
               <p>Lucas. What did I open the street door with?</p>
               <p>Bye. You opened the street door by a latch.</p>
               <p>Lucas. What did I open the parlour door with?</p>
               <p>Bye. I do not know; I apprehend it was by a brass knob, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Lucas. Was there any marks of violence upon the door?</p>
               <p>Bye. I believe there were none.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was after dark, an't you?</p>
               <p>Bye. Yes, I am sure it was; it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did your acquaintance and Lucas's come in?</p>

               <p>Q. When you are in the entry, do you turn on the right hand to go into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Rose. Yes.</p>

               <p>Rose. Yes; I was the last person that came in, and I am sure I latched it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Rose. About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master then?</p>
               <p>Rose. He was below stairs in the back parlour with my mistress; he had been ill, and that was the first time he came down stairs after his illness.</p>
               <p>Q. What fastening had the door?</p>
               <p>Rose. There is a spring lock and a latch; the spring of the lock was fastened back, and it was latched, that we might let our selves in without always having the trouble of getting up to go to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wooden latch, or an iron latch?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body in company with your master and mistress?</p>

               <p>Rose. I heard nothing at all, nor saw nothing till I got up from supper; then I went into the fore parlour and saw a shirt, a mantle, and a blanket, upon the floor; then I saw the drawers of the bureau open, and cried out we were robbed, and run to the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Rose. I believe it was about twenty minutes after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door between the sore parlour and the back parlour close?</p>
               <p>Rose. It was not quite close.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did they cut you?</p>
               <p>Tawney. There were two or three words passed between us, and Jeffs cut me upon the shoulder, and then stabbed me into the shoulder; so I took Jeffs up,

               <p>Tawney. He is in the Counter; he is an evidence, but not upon this robbery. When Bye was taken up he desired to go before a Magistrate, for he said he could do something that would be for the good of his country, and desired to be admitted an evidence; and he said I can take two as I go along. I was with the Prisoners at Lucas's house in a Court in Blue Anchor Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that this was Lucas's house?</p>
               <p>Tawney. Bye gave me information of it, and I was there with Mr. Chitty: Mr. Chitty found several things there that were his; and all the things were packed up and carried to the Constable's house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Lucas. Do you know me?</p>
               <p>Tawney. No, I do not: Bye said there was a hundred pounds worth of goods in the house; but the people were all gone, and the house was left open.</p>
               <p>Bye. Lucas had the whole house, and I lodged in one of the rooms.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I lost a spoon and a tobacco box; I was not at home when they were lost. I am informed the Prisoner was let into my house by a little girl; and that the spoon was conveyed into my house again last Saturday, by a woman who came for a pail of water.</p>

            . I catched the Prisoner at Mr. Hawkins's house, on Saturday was seven night.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she keep a publick house?</p>
               <p>Painter. No, a private house. A neighbour came and informed me, that there was a thief in Mr. Hawkins's house; I looked in all the rooms, and could not find any body; and when I came into the back garret, the Prisoner was behind the door; when she saw me, she run down directly: the next morning she was taken up, and she owned before the Justice, that she stole the spoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkins's son. I heard there was a thief in my father's house, and that my daughter-in-law and she were shut into the house together; I said to her, if you will deliver the things back again, you shall go about your business: then she said, she had taken a spoon, and thrown it into the soil hole in Tuttle Fields; and that when the soil comes to be emptied, the spoon will be found; she said before the justice, she had taken nothing but a spoon and a tobacco box; but was so drunk then, that she could not tell who she sold it to. She pulled the tobacco box out of her pocket, and said, if I would, I should have that.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came the spoon into the house again?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkins's son. Her landlady came to beg a pail of water, and talked about being lame, and one thing and another; and afterwards, the spoon was found lying open, upon a chest of drawers in the room. She stole five shillings one time off a, mantle piece, and when she was charged with taking it, she said, she had thrown it into a ditch: and I have been told, that she has stole brass-weights, and any thing she could meet with, and has been a common pilfering thief. <rs id="t17450530-19-verdict125" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 25th of April last, about a quarter before ten at night, I was going by the New Market, and enquired for Shoe Lane: I asked those two gentlewomen the way, and they said, they would shew me the way: they took me down a passage, which, as I have been informed since, was <placeName id="t17450530-20-crimeloc130">George Alley</placeName>

                        targets="t17450530-20-off128 t17450530-20-crimeloc130"/>; when they came about the middle of the place, one of them said, that is the way to Shoe Lane, and said, Sir, won't you give us something to buy a dram; I put my hand into my pocket, and I had but a penny, which I gave her; she said, D - n your blood, that is not enough to buy a dram; I said, I had no more half-pence; she said, D - n you, you have got money enough, and we will have it before you go. I laid hold of them, with a design to take them to the watch; I did not think they would rob me. Then a fellow in a white frock very dirty came up with a stick, knocked me up against the wall, and gave me several blows with the stick, I was very ill used by him, and in a very bloody condition. Then Rush came up with a penknife, and said, D - n your blood, if you don't deliver your money, I'll cut the ball of your eye out; then a fellow came up in a blue waistcoat, with a long knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Greenaway any thing in her hand?</p>
               <p>Thorne. No, I did not see any thing; then they robbed me of 8 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the money from you?</p>
               <p>Thorne. Greenaway took the money, for her hand was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing else?</p>
               <p>Thorne. Yes, they took my hat off my head, then Mr. Keys came up, and the man in blue followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that the man in blue came up?</p>
               <p>Thorne. I was robbed before he came up, but he came up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>Thorne. He only held up a knife, and said, D - n you, what are you doing here? and Greenaway said, it is but seven or eight shillings, and the man in blue said, D - n you, I wish it had been as many pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you robbed when Mr. Keys came up?</p>
               <p>Thorne. Yes, and I told him, one of those women had robbed me; I had hardly spoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174505300023"/> the words before the man in blue came up. I had hold of both the women, and should have kept them, if those fellows had not come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hold of both the women?</p>
               <p>Thorne. Yes, I had hold of them both.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was not robbed till the man in the dirty frock came up?</p>
               <p>Thorne. No, I was not; and when he came up, he said, D - n you, what are you doing of? And Rush said, D - n this country cull, I'll cut the ball of his eye out, if he don't deliver his money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time was there between the fellow in the dirty frock coming up, and Mr. Keys coming?</p>
               <p>Thorne. Mr. Keys came up presently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man in blue come up, when Mr. Keys came?</p>
               <p>Thorne. He was not; but there was not a moment's difference between their coming. When I told Mr. Keys I was robbed, he said, he was very sorry for it: he went away, and said, he would run to the watch, and acquaint them with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Keys run away?</p>
               <p>Thorne. I believe he was frightened, for there was a desperate fellow that came up to him?</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after that?</p>
               <p>Thorne. After the Prisoners had robbed me, they went away. I met Mr. Keys coming from the watch-house, and he said, the watchmen told him, they were vile wicked creatures, and I had better come and look after them in another manner. Mr. Keys told me where he lived, and advised me to come, when I was in a better condition, for I was very bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Thorne. I took them the 7th or 8th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you take them?</p>
               <p>Thorne. I went into Black Boy Alley, and heard of them; I went to Mr. Berry, who lives in Chick Lane, and told him, I was robbed by two women, and described them, and he ordered me to go to the Pump ale-house in Chick Lane, and Mr. Berry came to me: he went and shewed me several women; I fixed upon the two Prisoners, and told him, those were the two women that robbed me: he said, don't say a word now, for there are a parcel of sad cattle live here, and if you do, there will be murder committed; but about two o'clock in the morning, the constable and the watch secured them, and Mr. Berry sent to me about eight, to let me know they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the Prisoners are the women?</p>
               <p>Thorne. I took particular notice of them by the lamps, I saw them very distinctly for a considerable time, and I know their voices, and I know them by their gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoners before that time?</p>
               <p>Thorne. I never saw them before the 25th of April.</p>

            . On the 25th of April, between nine and ten at night, I was going up the Fleet Market, and in George Alley I saw two women and a man, the man was very bloody, and told me, he had been robbed by those two women; one of the women had a penknife in her hand; they were telling some money over, and they took his hat off his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take it off?</p>
               <p>Keys. Yes, they took it off his head just before I came up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they telling the money?</p>
               <p>Keys. One of them was telling it out of her hand into the other's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was there?</p>
               <p>Keys. There were about seven or eight shillings. I went to lay hold of one of the women, and up came a fellow behind me in a blue waistcoat, and a tall fellow in a greasy frock, like a butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fellow in the greasy frock there when you came up?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, he was not there then; one of them (he in the blue waistcoat) had a knife in his hand, like a butcher's knife; he swore a great oath, that he would be the death of me, if I assisted the Prosecutor in taking the women. I went into Shoe lane, and called out watch, and said, there was a man robbed. I met the Prosecutor in Shoe Lane; and he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174505300024"/> the women were run away; he would have pursued them then, but I said, I will not go after them now, for they have knives, and we shall be in danger of our lives: he asked me my name, I told him I lived at the Cross Keys Tavern in the Strand; and when the Prisoners were taken up, he sent me word of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the women?</p>
               <p>Keys. Yes.</p>

               <p>Berry. I have detected some of them in Black Boy Alley, because they were a pest to Gentlemen who go that way; but I am a great dealer in horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that is that says you are a thief-taker?</p>
               <p>Berry. I believe that is Gentleman Harry, he is as great a rogue as any in the world. I have known him these twenty years; I knew him when he was postilion to Mr. Hide.</p>
               <p>[Sims cried out again, he is a very great thief-taker, my Lord.]</p>
               <p>Berry. He is a very great rogue, 'tis a pity he had not his deserts as some others have had. The Prosecutor came to me, and informed me, he was robbed such a time by two women; gave me a description of them, and told me they used Black Boy Alley and Chick Lane. There is a hill near that place, where twenty or thirty will fit together, may sometimes forty or fifty of them will fit together in the day time, smoaking their pipes and drinking. I took him to a place, where there were I believe four or five of them together; he fixed upon the Prisoners, and said, they were the two women that robbed him: I said, if we were to attempt to take them then it would be dangerous, and we might run the risque of our lives (for they are a pesterous sort of people, there is a great resort of them there, and they grow very troublesom; indeed there are more women than men now, because the men have been pestered very much lately) so I did not think it safe to take them then, and we took them about two o'clock in the morning in Chick Lane.</p>

I said, if he would get me my watch again, I should be glad, for I wanted to go about my business; and I proposed his depositing five guineas as a security for the watch; and the people advised him to send for a friend to bring some money: the Prisoner sent a man with a note to the Goat at Charing Cross for the man to come to him, and sent another to carry a note to a friend of his in Paul's Alley Aldersgate Street, for five guineas as a security for the watch, and it was to be deposited in Mr. North's hand, for I only wanted a security for my watch to be lodged in his hand: when we went from the alehouse he was carried to Mr. North's house, and about nine or ten o'clock a porter came to ask for Mr. North, and said he had a parcel for him: Mr. North said to me, I'll lay you 20 l. there's your watch again: the porter was admitted into the room, and I had my watch again: this is the watch I lost that day.</p>

               <p>Brown. Not till I had my watch again; when I had my watch again, Mr. North said, you must go before a Magistrate before the Prisoner can be discharged. We went before Justice Fraser, and we were to tell him we had some words and a quarrel in the Park, and I came to have him discharged: (not knowing so well as a great many people do,) and the Justice said it was a felony, and he could not discharge him.</p>

               <p>Tinling. He used to go about with rabbets and fowls, but he has left that off about a year.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of the women took it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Prisoner the woman?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you put your hand into your pocket to feel whether your handkerchief was there? or did you only put your hand into your pocket occasionally?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I put it in to feel for my handkerchief to wipe my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I had been drinking pretty plentifully of Yorkshire ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you had your senses so as to know what you did?</p>
               <p>Barnes. Yes; I knew very well what I did</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You did not charge me in the watch-house with taking it.</p>
               <p>Barnes. I did charge you with it in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he was not so much in liquor that he fell down in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Barnes. I did not fall down at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Constable desired me to give him the handkerchief, and said he must prosecute me; and one talked of a reward of 10 l. and another talked of 10 l. it is only for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Barnes. When I took her up, the Constable said there was a reward of 10 l. for every one that was taken in the city.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said in the watch-house he would not charge either of the women with the handkerchief.</p>

            . The 16th of this month at midnight the watchmen came to the watch-house about twelve o'clock at night with the Prosecutor, the Prisoner and another woman; the Prosecutor appeared to me to be as sober as he is now, and talked as reasonably as he does now, but the women appeared to be almost fuddled. The Prosecutor said, Mr. Constable, I have had my handkerchief picked out of my pocket, and I desire you would take charge of these women. I asked the Prisoner how she came by the handkerchief; she said the Prosecutor desired her to take it out of his pocket, and he said, he did not say any such thing. When we came before the sitting Alderman, she said she took it out of the right side waistcoat pocket; but when it came to be examined, it was so bad it would not hold a handkerchief; then she said she took it out of the left side pocket, and that was as bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they talk any thing of the reward?</p>
               <p>Barnes. The watchmen I believe did talk of the reward, but I did not much mind what they said; I believe nobody here does it for the sake of the reward.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you order him to prosecute her for the sake of the reward?</p>
               <p>Rybright. I told him I understood the Prisoner was a common nusance, and that prosecuting her would be doing his country justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor said he did this for the sake of the 10 l.</p>
               <p>Barnes. I never said such a thing; I can call a great many people to my reputation, for I always behaved well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They drank two shillings in beer, which I gave to the watchmen, and they wanted me to give them a crown, but I would not; I said I have no business to give you a crown when I never did any body any harm.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did the Prisoner give the watchmen?</p>
               <p>Rybright. I did see one of the women put something into a watchman's hand, but what it was I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Barnes. There was no beer while I was there.</p>
               <p>Rybright. There was a man before the sitting Alderman, who I believe is one of the thieftakers, and he said the Prisoner was one of the Black Boy Alley crew.</p>

               <p>Connell. They had been about a month there: it is a ready furnished lodging, and they have a lock and key to themselves. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174505300029"/> action was done three doors off my house: they lodge in a separate apartment from my house.</p>

               <p>Connell. It was done the Friday before May Day: the deceased was alive and well, and came to me with a pair of upper leathers between three and four in the afternoon.</p>

About three quarters of an hour after six the Prisoner came to my house, and desired I would go into the chamber to his wife; he was in a good deal of confusion and disorder. I asked him what was the matter; he said he was afraid she was dead: I said I hoped there had been no quarrel, or that she had not fell into a fit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use to fall into fits?</p>
               <p>Connell. I cannot tell: he said he wished I would make haste up, for there was a great effusion of blood: I said, I hoped they had not been quarrelling; he said with a great deal of concern, it was a very bad quarrel, for he was afraid she was dead. Said I, I hope you have not killed your wife; he said, he had given a helping hand to it, for she was stabbed; I told him I was sadly surprized at it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you this?</p>
               <p>Connell. I cannot tell; he came himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he behave well to her?</p>
               <p>Connell. He always behaved in a very pretty handsom manner to her, and as I think in a very loving manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner offer to run away?</p>

I thought to find the Prisoner in my husband's room, but when I came he was gone. I was very angry at it, and said, there was a very barbarous murder committed, and we should be undone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they quarrelled that day?</p>
               <p>Connell. I never heard of any quarrel before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to conceive he had done such a barbarous murder?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search the wound?</p>
               <p>Connell. No; I only laid my hand upon her head and forehead; as she lay quite still, I spoke to her, and desired if she had any breath in her to move or lift up her eyes, but she did not do either. I went there afterwards, and the Prisoner with us, and there was this knife upon the seat that he worked upon [a shoemaker's knife.] I asked him how the knife came there; he said he put it upon the seat himself. The knife was bloody, and there were no sparkles of blood upon her fingers, hands, or face, and hardly any upon the sheet.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any great quantity of blood?</p>
               <p>Connell. The blood run through the bed upon the ground, but there was no blood upon the upper sheet. There was no appearance as if she had made any struggling or opposition, and it is my opinion she was killed in her sleep.</p>

            . On the 27th of April I was sent for to open the body of the deceased; upon viewing the body I found a wound on the left side of the breast, I examined the wound, and found it two inches transversed near the sternon into the pericardium, and into the left ventricle of the heart, and this must be attended with sudden death. I put this knife into the wound, and it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that she was asleep when the wound was given?</p>
               <p>Killick. It is most probable that she was asleep, because there was no spring of blood: there can be no circulation of the blood without its going into the left ventricle of the heart.</p>

               <p>Oake. The knife was bloody, and there was a great deal of blood in the bed, and upon the bed. I went to his master Purdue's where he worked and enquired for him, and desired them, if he came to lay hold of him, and send for me, for I believe he had murdered his wife. I went to several houses in Clare Market where the shoemakers use, and could not find him. I went to the house where he lodged before, and he was not there, but they gave him a very good character; then I went back to my house, and found him there drinking a pot of beer with two men. I told him I must take him into custody; he said he was very willing to surrender himself to me. I said, are you the husband of that unfortune woman who is murdered? Yes, said he; I am the unfortunate man who gave her that mortal wound.</p>
               <p>He seemed to be vastly concerned, and said, he could freely take the knife and cut his throat for what he had done. He said he believed he should be hanged, and desired nothing but to submit to justice; and desired I would not let him be ill used by the mob. Then he prevaricated, and said, she had got the knife at her breast, and that she said, Now you rogue thrust it in; and that he thrust the knife into her breast.</p>

She took the knife off the seat, which is just by the bed, and desired I would kill her, and I dissuaded her from it, and we both struggled, and both fell down upon the bed, and I fell upon her, and run the knife into her.</p>

            . This unfortunate man has worked for me and my father twenty two or twenty four years, and in all that time I never saw him strike or abuse his wife, but has used her with abundance of good manners. No body knows what he has undergone with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see him strike or abuse her?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I never saw him abuse her; whenever she wanted money of me she had it, and he paid me again. She had a shilling of me that day this unhappy accident happened. I was surprized when the Constable and his landlady came to my house, and said, he had killed his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something of his suffering very much by her, how did he suffer?</p>
               <p>Purdue. He did suffer very much, for the poor man could not keep a coat to his back, for she was very much addicted to drinking. He came to my shop about half an hour after the Constable had been there: said I, Stevens, what have you done? They say you have murdered your wife; then he said, if I have, I will go and surrender myself to Justice De Veil, and he said he would go to the Constable who lives in the Coal Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Purdue. It might be half an hour after six, or near seven.</p>

            . On the 26th or 27th of April, on a Friday night, I heard of this unhappy accident; I was the more surprized at it, because Mr. Stevens and his wife had always behaved very civilly and endearing to one another : to be sure the woman was very much addicted to drinking; and he has said, Mrs. Wyman, what must I do with this unhappy woman? And he said, he was afraid she would make him do what he would not do; either to make away with her, or to make away with himself. I said, Mr. Stevens, you have had a great deal of patience, and you must have patience. I never heard him abuse her or say that she was a drunkard; and she was not abusive neither; for if she got a little liquor, she would go to bed.</p>

I belong to a benefit club with Stevens, where they allow some money for burying wives; and hearing of this accident, I went to look at the woman, and the Prisoner desired me to go up to help his wife, or she would die for want of help: when I saw her, I said to him, you have killed your wife; God forbid, said he, but we have had a scuffle, and in this scuffle she has got an unlucky cut. She lay close to the side of the bed-stead, and it was easy for her to reach the knife. He is a very temperate man, and I hardly ever heard him swear an oath.</p>

               <p>+ This was made a capital offence by an act made in the 9th year of King George the First.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grigson deposed, that he had part of a stack of hay burnt, and that he suspected the Prisoner, because he had been informed he said he would do for him. That he is a farmer in the same neighbourhood, and there had been some law suits between them, and that he is forced to carry arms to defend himself from the Prisoner, because he would lye lurking about the fields with pistols to do him a mischief.</p>
               <p>Several persons were produced by Mr. Grigson, who saw the hay on fire, but could not prove any thing against the Prisoner, not even so much as seeing him near the place under any suspicious circumstances or unreasonable hours: they could only say, that there had been differences between them, and that the Prisoner had threatened to do for Mr. Grigson. <rs id="t17450530-29-verdict182" type="verdictDescription">
