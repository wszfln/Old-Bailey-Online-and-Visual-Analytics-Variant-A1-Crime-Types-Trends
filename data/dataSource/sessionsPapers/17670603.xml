She asked the other prisoner, if any of that lace would do for her; Saunders took up her apron, and laid it over the goods on the counter; I begged her to take her apron off, fearing the lace should stick to it; she then let it down. I took them to the other counter; then I saw a piece of lace lying on the ground, close by the counter; I am sure there was no such lace at that counter before. Gibbons wanted to see several pieces; Saunders called her Mrs. Myner; Saunders turned her head round to me, and desired me to look at the lace on the back part of her cap, and said, the other prisoner wanted such; this I thought was with intent the other might have an opportunity to take something; I still kept my eye looking towards Gibbons. I saw a piece of lace in Gibbons's bosom, one of the doubles hung out under her handkerchief; I took hold of it, and took it out; there were nine yards and a half of it; I saw a piece of edging in her hand; she put her hand behind her under her cloak; I desired her to give it me; she swore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030003"/> many oaths, and used me in an insolent manner. I, by trying to take it, saw the edging drop behind her; Saunders saw me both take the lace from Gibbons's bosom, and take the edging up behind her, yet she stood up very much for her character, and said a thousand times she would ruin me, and she would not depart my house till she had brought people to take an account me; then she continued using me ill for an hour and a half at least. I desired my girl to fetch a constable, but she could not get one; a neighbour came in; Saunders sent Gibbons out to bring in a man to ruin me, but my neighbour went out and brought her back; (three pieces of lace produced in court that were found by the counter; that which fell behind Gibbons, and that taken from out of her bosom; the latter, by mistake, was not in the indictment.)</p>

Last Monday morning was a week, I got up at half an hour after twelve o'clock at night, and went to shift the lighter, that is, to bring her within the reach of the crane to take the stones out; I saw the prisoner in the barge's cabin; I asked him what business he had there; he said he came to look after a corn barge; I saw a boat lying on the inside the barge; I saw in it two parcels of rope lying; he was going out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030004"/> barge down into the boat; I got in her too, and stopped him from going away; there were more ropes than ours of other peoples; I asked him where he had them; he said it was a parcel of old rope which he had got, and said in a lighter head; I perceived they were wet; I said, they have been lately taken out of the water; he said, I might have them if I would let him go about his business; I stopped him, boat and rope too, and took him through our yard to the watch box, and charged the watchman to go along with us to the watch house; going along, the prisoner dropped a case knife; when I went to the barge again, I found one end of the cable was loosened, and the other end was fresh cut.</p>

            . About seven o'clock that morning, I went to look at the boat that was lying on the outside Mr. Fletcher's barge, I saw many pieces of rope in it; there was a sling belonging to Mess. Fletcher and Arnold that I could swear to; it is a large rope we use to put about a block of stone, when we move them with the crane; we took the prisoner before Justice Miller, there he said he never was on the wharf where the sling was taken from.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ward. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner at the bar brought this gold watch to me (produced and deposed to) on Thursday the 21st of May; she said she brought it from a watchmaker that lived in Baldwin's-gardens. I stopped it; she was to have brought a gentleman to prove it; but never returned. Soon after I was going out, and a man came from Clerkenwell Bridewell to enquire about this watch; he said she was committed there; I said, I should not satisfy him as to the marks of the watch, but I went to her; at first she said she had it of a journeyman baker, that he was ill in bed, and it was his own watch which he used to wear; then I went to Baldwin's-gardens, but could not find such a person she had mentioned to me. I then went to her again; she told me the journeyman baker was named Delmey, and his master lived in Moor-lane; we enquired all over Moor-lane, but could not find an owner; then we went into Little Moorfields, there was a baker; I went into his shop, it was the prosecutor's shop; he described the watch, and owned it directly, but had not missed it till I went there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

I heard it rattle, but cannot tell the sum. Then he took down a large cannister of tea, and filled a large paper bag with tea out of it; when he had done, he replaced the cannister, and brought the bag, and set it down, while he placed the chair again, and got upon it, and hung the key on the bracket again; then he took the bag of tea in one hand, and the chair in the other, and went up stairs; he staid there a few minutes, and came down with his hat on, and went out at the entry door, and pulled the door after him; it has a spring lock; he was gone about half an hour, or thereabouts; then he came in again, and went up stairs, and was there some time; in the interim there came an acquaintance, named Lyes, and knocked at the door; he came down; the person enquired whether Mr. Bacon or his wife were at home; he said, no; she asked where we were gone; he said he did not know; he seemed rather willing she should not come in; she came in; it was then I believe, pretty near six o'clock, the maid-servant came home about seven; I had bid her come home about that time, in order to release the porter; in a few minutes after she came in, and was gone up stairs, the prisoner came down with the paper bag of tea tied up in handkerchief; I saw the paper bag in it, and believe it to be the same bag he had filled with tea; (I had observed he had nothing in his hand the first time he went out;) he carried the bag out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the maid see him go out?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bacon, No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bacon. I got a constable, and took the prisoner in my shop on the 11th of May; I charged him with taking the tea; he would not confess for some time; I ordered the constable to take him back to the counting-house; when he found we had such positive evidence, he confessed he took about six pounds, but he soon did acknowledge the whole to an ounce; there was eight pounds and upwards; he owned to whom he had sold it, and directed me to the man he had sold it to, where I went and found it; the man and tea are here now in court.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of favour in order to this confession?</p>

I went home, and after some time I was sent for again, and told they had stopped the prisoner with the bag; I opened the bag, and found in the whole four pieces of solder, which, before broken, was one compleat piece of solder, about forty pounds weight of it. I asked the prisoner could use me so; he begged I would forgive him, and was very sorry for what he had done, and said, if I would let him go, he would be very honest for the future. I took him before my Lord Mayor on the Monday, he had been doing business at my Lord's house; he was asked, how he came by the solder; he said, he carried into his Lordship's house, and concealed it among some rubbish, but did intend to carry it home again to my house.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Paterson's on the 2d of May; Mr. Paterson took me into his yard, and told me the prisoner had left a bag, which he suspected had something in it that was not honestly come by; he asked me what was best to be done; I went and fetched Mr. Salter; there were some old brass cocks and some solder in it. Mr. Salter desired it might be there till his men had done work, and were paid, to see who came for it; the prisoner came there again, and put something into it, and went and drank some beer, and after that took the bag and was going away. I stopped him, and told him, his master had been and seen what was in it; then Mr. Salter was sent for again; there was then about 40 pounds weight of solder, and three old brass cocks.</p>

On the Friday in the afternoon, I was sent for by Mr. Coleman in the Minories, I was there informed he had stopped a broken silver cup; he is a dealer in old cloaths; I described it before he took it out of his drawer; I described on paper a sketch of the foot (the paper and cup produced, they agreed;) he told me, the boy that brought it was to come the next day for a watch in exchange; he said he knew him, that he looked like a Jew barber's boy, and blinks with his eyes; I went and told the sexton, that Mr. Coleman looked upon the boy that brought it to be a Jew barber's boy; the sexton soon brought in the prisoner, upon which I sent for a peace officer and Mr. Coleman; Mr. Coleman said, he was the lad that brought it to him; the prisoner said, if I would shew him mercy, he would directly tell me where the castor was; I told him it was out of my power; the peace officer and he went out together, and brought the castor in; (produced and deposed to.)</p>

I perceived nothing broke, so as to let any body into the house; I do not charge the prisoner with breaking into the house; there was somebody concealed in the kitchen, as I imagine; I suppose he got out by opening the street door, that was bolted when I went to bed; but in the morning it was only on the spring-lock, unbolted, and the bar off; I missed my silver buckles out of my shoes, a silver cream-pot, and a hat, all out of the parlour; the next day I went to Justice Fielding, and got it advertised;

               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>F. Jeggot. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room when you went to sleep?</p>
               <p>F. Jeggot. My husband was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room?</p>
               <p>F. Jeggot. No, she was not; my money was in my pocket, and my pocket by my side; when I awaked, I missed my money directly, then the prisoner was in the room and my husband was gone; I asked her where my money was gone; she said my husband had got it; I went to see for him, and was almost murdered in going after him; I never got my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask your husband about it?</p>
               <p>F. Jeggot. Yes; he said he had not 50 s. of it; he said Mrs. Smith laid it before him, and said he was a d - d fool if he did not take it all. The prisoner d - d me to my face, and said she had part of the money, and if it was to be done again she would do it.</p>

               <p>Marshall. She has been married about five or six months I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live near her?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his ill treating her?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No, I do not; she sometimes is very foolish.</p>
               <p>Q. In what?</p>
               <p>Marshall. In regard to her speeches, in not knowing what she is going about.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I live in Cock-lane, Shoreditch; she lived in the same place when she was out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner ever lived there at a time?</p>
               <p>Marshall. She has lived there a week or a fortnight at a time, and she was in my apartment at times; she lived chiefly at public-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had wanted money, should you have been willing to lend her any?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot say whether I should or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, for what reason?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Because it was not in her power to have paid me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other reason?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did she come to you as a married woman?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She told me she was married?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trust her in common about your house, how was she as to understanding?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She had the care of a child four or five months old, and took a great deal of care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live at your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. About two months and a half.</p>

On Wednesday the 6th of May, in the evening, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I would buy a dozen of brushes; he asked half a crown for them; I thought that was much   under the value; I decoyed him within doors, by telling him I would send for a neighbour, to know whether they were worth the money. I asked him how he came by them; he said, he had them of one Mr. Moor, in Mark-lane, in exchange for thrums. I was going to send for Mr. Moor, but the prisoner desired me not to send for him; soon after, he said he found them by London-bridge, and after that, he said by Westminster-bridge; he seemed to be poor, and out of compassion I did not take him up; I sent my boy to watch where he lived; then by enquiring, I found the brushes belonged to Mrs. Grant.</p>

               <p>Steward. He pulled out two or three shillings, and a sixpence or two; my master charged a constable with him, and took him before my Lord-Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you give the prisoner any bread?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did, after he was committed; he asked me for one, and I gave him one. I should not have given the Court this trouble, only within about six weeks I have lost twenty-two quartern loaves.</p>

I have a shop at the 'Change, and my apprentice came and told me of it; after that, it was advertised in the Saturday's paper, and a gentleman came and informed me about it; he had before heard we had lost it; I sent our boy to the constable's house where it was to be seen. The constable came to me on the Sunday morning; I told him if it was mine, it had a single cannister in it, and described it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Houghton. I have seen him before, but I know nothing of him.</p>

            . I live in Basinghall-street. On the 7th of May, about twelve o'clock in the day, I found the prisoner in my parlour, he had this tea-chest in his hand; I asked him what business he had there; he said he was an apprentice to a cabinet-maker, and he brought it for one Mrs. Walters, and that he came from one Mr. Walters in Foster-lane; he told me a great number of lies, the street-door being open, I stopped him, and sent a person to Foster-lane, to know if there was any such person, but found there was not. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030020"/> was taken before the sitting Alderman; there he said it belonged to one Mrs. Swift; there was one of that name sent for, but she said she knew nothing of the chest or him either; we advertised the chest on the Saturday, and Mrs. Houghton came and owned it on the Monday; (produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Waldron. He had been up to my bureau, I could see the marks of his feet.</p>

I said, I'll see what you have got, or I'll hand you to the watch-house; I took him over to the watch-house; said he, you dog, I make such things as these. I had it to bind round; when he was at Guildhall he said he found it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wellings. I live in Camomile-street. On Monday Mr. Salvadore sent me word he had lost one of his coach-seats, and ordered me to advertise a guinea reward, for that and the man that stole it; the next day I was informed the prisoner had been before the sitting Alderman; I went to meet him; there I saw the seat, which, by comparing it with the other, I believe to be the property of Mr. Salvadore; I mean by the quilting, colour, and every particular.</p>

               <p>Bolton. No, never; he never would trust me in his room alone; I never knew him part with the key to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys were there to the room where the lace was?</p>
               <p>Bolton. There were three keys to that, but the drawer in which the lace was, Mr. Douglas keeps that key himself.</p>

Rutherford was taken and brought in soon afterwards; I asked Gibbs how he came by them spoons, (I called them silver, thinking they were so then;) he said, a young woman gave him them about twelve months ago.

            . I am a watchman; there were several houses attempted to be broke open; we saw six men in Red-lion-street; they separated, and two come by us (they were the two prisoners ) we stopped them; they said they would go very civilly to the watch-house; when we came to the corner of Buckle-street, Rutherford made a chop with a bill at Lambeth, and got away, and said to the other, d - n you, blow his brains out; we took Gibbs to the watch house, and found three spoons, a knife, and a pocket-pistol upon him; then we went in pursuit of Rutherford; we met with him by Saltpetre-bank, and brought him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I found this linen here produced in Great Ayliff street; it was all of a heap, wringing wet; it lay near the second door after I came by the meeting-house; this was about four o'clock that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stains. Were the prisoners asked concerning the linen?</p>
               <p>Stains. They were in my hearing, but I cannot tell what was said in answer; the Justices thought one would turn evidence, so they took them separate into another room; I did not hear all their examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lambeth. Which way did you pursue the two others?</p>
               <p>Lambeth. We pursued them down Great Ayliff-street, by the meeting; (the spoons compared with the others, and inspected by the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Gibbs's defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from Stepney about half an hour after three that morning; I had been drinking, and was a little in liquor; I was along with this man (meaning Rutherford) and a watchman came and laid hold of me, and said I should go with him; I did not refuse; they took hold of him; what he said to them I cannot tell; then he made his escape. I lived along with a girl at Bristol; she came up to London with me, and was here about a month, and then went away; she left these three spoons with me; I having a value for her, put them in my pocket. A young man that is gone to Greenland gave me that pistol; I never made use of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much were the prisoner's wages a year?</p>

             (to whom I am clerk;) he obtained a search-warrant, and I was ordered to assist the constable in examining the prisoner's box, at Mr. Viner's house; the suspicion was against the prisoner at the bar; her trunk was brought into Mr. Viner's parlour by some of his servants; it was opened in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Viner, the constable, and myself; the prisoner was present, when her wearing apparel was taken out; in a short space of time I discovered a paper snuff-box; I took it out, I found it to be very weighty; I brought it to a table, and opened it; I found it almost full of guineas, half guineas, and some silver; I counted it, and found there were 65 guineas in gold, (exclusive of the 7 now in court,) seven half guineas, and 13 s. in silver. Either Mr. Viner or his lady told me in what manner the guineas he had missed were marked, before the trunk was opened; I began to look out for guineas as they had been described to me; I found seven, I believe they were new guineas, they are these produced by the constable; they were all marked alike, as near as could be, and sealed up by Mr. Spinnage's seal, who came in at the time, and put into the hands of the constable; I went to Mr. Roger's house, desiring he would come and bring the money, at her second examination, to Mr. Spinnage; Mr. Rogers was not at home, but he came there a few hours after; Mrs. Rogers delivered the money in the paper out of a chest of drawers; it never was opened at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the Justice's the whole time the guineas were there?</p>
               <p>Adams. I was, and am sure they were not opened?</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Viner. Did you miss any thing else?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Viner. There were three sheets of mine in the prisoner's trunk, they are what we call servants sheets; they might come with something in them from our country-house.</p>

               <p>Fredrick Cook. I am a confectioner; I have known the prisoner about seven years; she lived with me almost three years, and behaved very faithful and honest; she was my shop-maid.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she leave your service?</p>
               <p>Cook. Between four and five years ago; I know nothing of her character since she left my service.</p>

               <p>"My Lord, it pleased God before the honour</p>
               <p>"of knowing your Lordship, that I fell down</p>
               <p>"and cut the main artery of my right-arm, which</p>

               <p>"for I have tried and could not; but I have married</p>
               <p>"a woman that is a black milliner, that is,</p>

               <p>"again; I have sent this petition by my wife,</p>
               <p>"for I have sent several before, and could not</p>
               <p>"get any answer from your Lordship, for I suppose</p>
               <p>"your servants have kept them, and you</p>
               <p>"have not seen them, so by that means I have</p>
               <p>"made my wife privy with that unnatural freedom</p>
               <p>"which your Lordship has taken with me;</p>
               <p>"and your Lordship knows, such freedom makes</p>
               <p>"persons take such impertinent liberty; for I am</p>
               <p>"sure of this, if you had not taken such freedom</p>
               <p>"with me, I had not taken such liberty in sending</p>
               <p>"any petition to your Lordship. But I verily</p>
               <p>"believe, that as God thought good to deprive</p>
               <p>"me of the use of my hand in manner he</p>
               <p>"has, so he, in the dark abyss of his providence,</p>
               <p>"brought it about that I should come to you in</p>
               <p>"the manner I did; and I hope, that as God</p>
               <p>"has blessed you with abundance of this world's</p>
               <p>"goods, I hope your Lordship will incline your</p>

               <p>M. Quin. He gave it me in my own house, and he brought me a gown to go in: he said I should have a guinea if I would carry this to the Marquis, and he shewed me the way to Southgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. It was on a Sunday morning; Williams the prisoner went along with us; Preston shewed me the door; they put up at an alehouse after he had shewed me the door, and I left them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030032"/> there and went to my Lord's house. I offered to deliver the letter, the gentleman would not take it in, and I came back to them, and told them the letter would not be accepted, and delivered it to him again. He made a riot and a disturbance, and said he would write another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between Preston and Williams there?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. They had some conversation, but I am thick of hearing, and could not hear what was said. Williams helped me up upon a post to see the garden, while Preston was writing in the alehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams there when Preston made the riot?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. He was. Preston said he would write another letter; I had not seen Williams above six or seven times, I asked him if he would go instead of me; he said a woman might do it better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Preston and Williams seem to be acquainted?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. Yes; I asked Preston if there was any danger in going with that letter; he said, no, none at all. Williams was by, and he said there was no danger at all. After they had both assured me there was no danger, I carried the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you Preston's wife?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. No, I am not; I don't know whether he is a man or a woman.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Brown. I am a constable. I was sent for to the Cherry-tree at Southgate, and charged with Williams and Preston; Preston said he received four letters from Lord Carnarvon, when he was in the coach coming to town, and he had a 10 l. bank note in each of them, and he would not be his secret-keeper no longer, for he was a sodomite, and d - d him. He said he had wrote to my Lord several times, and he would again. I asked Mrs. Quin what she came for; she said she came for profit, and so did Williams; Williams said he came for a country walk, (I knew nothing of the design they came upon then.) Said Preston to Williams, you persuaded me to write a letter over night, and you put words into my mouth; Williams said to him, you have brought me into a fine premunire here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Williams deny what Quin said of his coming for profit?</p>

I saw the horse-shoe moulds upon the ground, and the prisoner by them; I asked him where he had them from; he said he had them from out of a basket, that stood under the wall at the bottom of the yard; if so, they are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030033"/> Mr. Champain's property; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said he was going to sell them. I asked him if he knew who to sell them to; he said he did, for he had a parcel before, and had sold them to a man at Horsleydown, and that he was led into that by another man who had shewed him where they were, and where to dispose of them. We charged the constable with him, and carried him before my Lord-Mayor: upon relating the circumstances to my Lord, his Lordship thought proper we should go with him to the man in Horsleydown, that proved to be one Walden. We got a warrant to search for some moulds which the prisoner said he had sold to him the Saturday before; the prisoner told us he bought them, and put them under his counter, there I found one. We took Walden up and had him before a magistrate, and he was committed to Bridewell in the Borough.</p>
               <p>J. Jones. I was going to my work at six o'clock in the morning; I met the prisoner coming out at the gate with the horse-shoes in his pocket, I had seen him there before; I asked him what he had there; he took them out, and laid them down on the ground in the yard; I went and called Mr. Booth and the watchman, the watchman called a constable; we took the prisoner to the Poultry Compter. I asked the prisoner where he had the moulds; he said from out of a basket where the others lay, belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

On the 12th of April my servant came up to me, and said a young fellow was below with a message from Mr. Poultney, or some such name, to know if he was to have my company that morning; I told him I had no engagement with a person of that name. I went down in about two minutes after, and asked where the man was; I was told he was gone. My servant asked me how many coats I had that hung in the hall; I said there were four: she said there were two taken away. I looked and missed them; I gave them over for lost. Some time after this I found there was a man in Clerkenwell Bridewell for stealing great coats and hats, this was about a fortnight ago; I went to see him, it was the prisoner; I asked him if he remembered any thing of stealing two great coats from my house; he told me, if I chose to go to Justice Girdler where he had made his confession, I might hear of them. I went there, and found he had made a confession of stealing my two coats in particular, describing my house; the Justice told me I might go back and ask him any questions I thought proper. I went back to him; he was very open, and said he had taken the two coats, and directed me to two pawnbrokers where he had pawned them; I went by his direction and found them.</p>

               <p>Q. Who received the money?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Peak received the money, there was a guinea in gold; Peak said he had some silver in his pocket, so he shared the money, and gave every one their share; they had 6 s. 6 d. each; after that, Cowen asked me to sell the silk gown for him; I said I would not; then he asked Lazarus Abraham to go and sell it; he ordered him to get a guinea and a half for it, and told him he should have 2 s. for his trouble.

The watchman told me one of the men was a Jew in a white coloured coat, a shortish man, and that he had taken him out of bed once in Buckle-street, and that he had a blue apron on.

            . I am a lighterman, I was coming over London-bridge; before I got to St. Magnus's church I looked through the ballusters, on the 4th of May in the morning, I saw the prisoner upon a lighter; he was wringing a piece of a leaden spout off at <placeName id="t17670603-44-crimeloc282">Fresh-wharf hole</placeName>

The spout went over the wharf into the river; the tide was not low enough to take it away then; Mr. Williams secured the prisoner, and when the tide fell the lead (produced in court) was taken up; there is 24 pounds weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is Fresh wharf?</p>
               <p>Gladish. It is about the length of this court-room from London bridge.</p>

            . I am servant to the proprietors of the buildings, Mess. Latward and Co. Gladish informed me what he saw the prisoner do; I went and laid hold of the prisoner, and charged the constable with him. We found the lead afterwards on the campshire in Fresh-wharf hole, at about half ebb; it was part of the leaden pipe that carries the water from the top of the building to the ground, fastened to the building.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was on board a lighter, she heel'd off at high water from the key; I made a snatch at this pipe with my hand to save myself, and it fell down in the Thames, I could not hold it in my hands. The gentleman came and charged the constable with me; had I not catched hold of that I had been overboard; I am just come home from Antigua.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gladish. How did the prisoner do it, or was it as he has mentioned?</p>
               <p>Gladish. He took it in his hand and wrung it round, (describing it by that of a man boring with an auger;) the lighter could not heel, she was made fast at both ends.</p>

            ; being informed she had received a blow on the head, I inspected it, and found a small wound, the scalp was just divided; I removed the scalp in order to see if the skull had received any injury, that had received none at all, not in the smallest degree: I then removed the skull and examined the membrane that covered the brain, which was unhurt, there was no apparent appearance of any external violence; I removed the membrane and examined the brain, there was no appearance there of any external violence. The next morning I received a letter from the Coroner, signifying the Jury were not satisfied with the examination of the head only, but desired I would examine the whole body, imagining she might receive some injury on some other part; I examined the body very carefully, both belly and breast, and indeed her whole frame; in the cavity of the thorax was a very large quantity of water; there was such an appearance, as implied a very irregular intemperate course of life.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the fall was the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Pott. There was no apparent reason why she should die of the fall. I have great reason to think she had lived a very intemperate life, and that a disease was brought on herself by intemperance, which was the cause of her death.</p>

I left the prisoner in care of her and two other children on the 13th of May, a boy of three years of age, and a girl between eight and nine months. I found soon after the girl was not right; I examined her; she told me about the prisoner, and what he had done; I was struck with terror, I could not examine the part, I only examined her by speech; then I called

               <p>Mr. Thomas. I am a surgeon. The prosecutrix sent for me on the 21st or 22d of May to look at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030040"/> her daughter; I inspected her, and found she had got the foul disease, her private parts were much enlarged and lacerated, and she had a great discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the child was actually penetrated?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Seemingly there had, as much as a child of eight years old could admit of.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the foul disease be communicated without a penetration?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Not to such a child as that.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a greatdischarge, of what kind?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Of the same as most venereals are in 8 days standing. After I had examined the child, I examined the prisoner at the bar, I found he had a gonorrhoea; I asked him how long he had had that distemper; he told me about four days; I asked him how he could injure such a child as that; he said, no, that was all his answer.</p>
