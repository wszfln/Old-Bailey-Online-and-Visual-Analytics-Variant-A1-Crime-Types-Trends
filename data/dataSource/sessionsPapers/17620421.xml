            . After the prisoner was gone out of the shop, my master missing the pound of tea, sent me after her. I overtook her about 3 or 4 hundred yards from our shop; I looked in her apron and saw the tea; I took it out. I asked her, how she came to take it? She said, she did not take it. When I got her in the shop, my master and mistress asked her, how she came to take it? She then fell down on her knees, and asked pardon.</p>

The prisoner at the bar lodged at my house in October 1759; there was a bureau in the room where he lay, in which were the tankard, mug, and large soup spoon; it was kept locked. The six table spoons were in a case with some knives on a shelf in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let the room ready furnished to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Currie. No, he only paid for the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these things there last?</p>
               <p>Currie. I saw them in the bureau in the day time on the 24th of October 1759. I had a suspicion that he was not honest; and that night I double locked the street door, and took the key up to bed. In the morning we found the window upon the stairs open that looked into the street, and a lamp iron just by it, which was bent, I suppose, by his holding by it to let himself down. We went up to his room, and found the bureau door open, and he was gone; then I missed the things laid in the indictment, and have found neither of them since. After I had searched for him and could not find him, I went to justice Fielding, and had him described in the Public Advertiser, which was about the 26th. About a year, or a year and a half after, the prisoner sent me a letter,</p>
               <p>"That if I would</p>
               <p>"send for him from Doncaster gaol, and secure him</p>
               <p>"in any other gaol, he would make me satisfaction</p>
               <p>"for the injury he had done me; and the</p>
               <p>"sooner I sent the better." I found he was sentenced to be shot as a deserter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Currie. I do not, but my wife can speak to that. Justice Fielding has the letter; there was the prisoner's name to it; and I know not who could direct such a letter to me but himself. After that he was brought to the Savoy, I saw him on the last fast day in the morning, and charged him with taking the things here mentioned: he denied it.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I was in the prisoner's room on the 24th of October 1759, and brought the candle down, and he locked the door after I went out of the room; this was about 10 o'clock, or a little after when he went to bed. I had been to the bureau; he saw me lock it: I then saw the silver tankard, mug, and soup spoon; they were all together: the silver table spoons were in a case on a shelf in the same room; he saw me examine them. I locked up the case which they were in, and took away the key which used to hang to it. Our dwelling-house door was double locked, and there was no other way out of the house, but by that door. In the morning I was up first to get the irons ready against the men came to work. I went up to the shop (the room above the prisoner's) he laid up two pair of stairs, his door stood a jar; I saw the bureau open; I missed the things mentioned; then I came down, and saw the window open over the door, and the lamp iron pulled down. He might go from that window upon the leads, and by the lamp iron get down easy; there had not been a living soul in the room but himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the letter your husband speaks of?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Currie. I did, and know it to be the prisoner's own hand writing. I have heard him dispute with another man who could write best. The contents of the letter were, if my husband would take him from that gaol to any other of his majesty's prisons, he should have the things again, or else satisfaction for the injury he had done us.</p>

I said, I did not expect him till the next day or day after. He said, he had something particular to say to me; he shut the door, and came and tore me about in the kitchen from one place to another; he forced me upon a chair by clapping his knee upon my belly; he confined both my hands behind me, and then got his ends of me; that is, he was concerned with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by force?</p>
               <p>Denman. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman?</p>

               <p>Denman. He had carnal knowledge of my body to all intents and purposes. I come here to say nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you resist him?</p>
               <p>Denman. I did all in my power to resist him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Denman. He did all in his power to keep his mouth over mine, and endeavoured to prevent my speaking or crying out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay after this?</p>
               <p>Denman. He staid but a very little while after; I believe not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any application made to you afterwards?</p>
               <p>Denman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Denman. I told him I would acquaint my husband with it as soon as came home; which I did. Mr. Clark sent three gentlemen, and after that two gentlemen to me: they asked me, if I would make this affair up?</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they?</p>

She said; there was to have been a meeting at Mr. Hill the officer's to make it up. I said, is the meeting to be by your consent? She said, yes. I said, I heard Mr. Plunket had said, if Mr. Clark would pay forty pounds, you would stop all prosecution; is that true? She said, yes. Mr. Gofton went with me. He said, who is it to be paid to, to Mr. Plunket your attorney? She said, no, it must be paid to me. Mr. Gofton said, suppose Mr. Clark was to pay that money to you, will you prosecute him hereafter? No, said she, it shall be all void for ever; then she called down a woman: the woman said, do not make it up without your husband.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go?</p>
               <p>Gofton. He gave me a beckon to go, and said Mrs. Clark had said to me, if it lay in his way to get somebody to go along with me to see if it was by her consent that she was to make it up for forty pounds: she desired me to see if she had given her attorney power so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention this to Bare?</p>
               <p>Gofton. I did going along, and got him to go with me. Mr. Bare asked her at going in, how she did? She said, pretty well. Said he, how does this affair stand between you and Clark? Said she, I do not know, there was to have been a meeting at Mr. Hill's in Rosemary-lane. Said I, was it by your consent? She said, yes. I asked her, if Mr. Plunket was her attorney? She said, yes. I said, he has made a demand of forty pounds, was it by your consent? She said, it was; and if he had made any other proposal since, she would not stand to it. I said, is it to be paid to you or your attorney? She said, to her, for he had had money enough. I said, if it be paid you, you do not mean to prosecute Mr. Clark? She said, no; then there will be an end<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210006"/> of the whole affair. Then a woman called down stairs, and said, do not do any thing without the consent of your husband. Then we went away. Mr. Plunket had spoke to me about it, and when I talked to Mr. Clark, he said he was innocent, and would not give her a farthing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rogers. I was drinking at Mr. Clark's on the 7th of March. Mr. Bare said he was going to the prosecutrix, and asked me to go with him. I went; he joked about the matter; he asked her if it could not be made up? She said, she did not care to hurt a hair of his head. I said, it is a sad thing a man should be kept from his family so. She replied, he should not be out of his family many days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any terms upon which she would make it up?</p>
               <p>Rogers. No; she did not.</p>

I had some reason to suspect he was not honest by being out one evening, and laying out about 12 l. in cloaths, and he had not received any wages of me. I went to a house in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and desired Mr. Adams to send his boy to my shop for half a pound of ten shilling tea. I took the marks of the money, and the years they were coined, of half a crown, and 2 s. and 6 d. and they were delivered to the boy.</p>

The boy went and bought half a pound of tea, and paid that money for it, as he told me. I went home and looked in the till; there was only half a crown and a sixpence of the marked money, and three or four shillings more. I then said nothing to the prisoner, but kept a stricter eye upon him, with an intent to discharge him: there was nobody in the house but my sister and the prisoner, and I gave her a strict charge to be out of the way when the boy came. When I charged the prisoner with it, he trembled and could not move, if I would have given him 50 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe him any wages?</p>

               <p>Galendine. I had information against the prisoner. I saw him going up into the gallery. I said to Mr. Abbot, have an eye to that man, I mistrust him: he said he would. A little time after he and another man came down. Mr. Abbot called to me, and said there goes the two men. I ran after them. I saw Noaks give the prisoner a watch at the top of the passage almost in Hart-street. I stopt Noaks; the prisoner came and rescued him. I said, if he gets off, I'll stop you. The prisoner said, d - n you, you rascal, do not stop me, I'll knock you down: then Mr. Abbot came up; the watch was put down, and Mr. Abbot took it up.</p>
               <p>Hen. Abbot. I always open the door at half an hour past four o'clock. Just as I opened the door leading to the crown gallery on the 10th of March, Mr. Galendine said, I wish you would give an eye to those men, meaning the prisoner and one Noaks. About a quarter of an hour after, I saw them both come down; they passed me. I called Mr. Galendine; and said, there goes the two men; he ran after them and secured one of them. I saw South run up towards him, and there was a scuffle. He called out for me. Before I could get up to him, the other was got off; then the people called to me, and said there lies the watch; it was upon a bench in the passage. I did not see it put there. I took it up and went to South. He said, Mr. Abbott you know me. I said, I do. Said he, you never knew any harm of me? I said, you never did me any. We secured him, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>I had been with an order about some holland's gin A relation of mine had a mind to see the oratorio. We went; they asked a crown to go in. I was coming promiscuously by; I thought there was a quarrel. A man pushed his hand out, and gave me a watch in my hand Mr. Galendine said what have you got there? I said, a watch, and laid it down directly. I asked him, what he wanted with me? and went contentedly with him. I once kept a public house in covent-garden a great many years.</p>

The other asked him, who he was? He said, he was the butcher name Baruch. Rockom Polock had one bundle with him. They were carried up stairs. Abrahams said, he could perfectly guess where they came from, and he would have nothing to do with them. Said the prisoner, I will lend you money to buy them; he would have no concern with them. Then we took them away. Then coming along Houndsditch he pitched them on the steps, till we went back for the other three Bundles; then we went to Duke's-place, and called to

We carried three bundles back into the house, but in the hurry some of them were left by the door in the street, the watchman being coming his beat.

I said, I did not know no more than he did. Then I went to Mr. Marks, and told him the whole affair. After this I gave the same account to the prosecutor. We were examined before my lord-mayor; the prisoner denied it. I told my lord I had a sheet of his. My lord asked him if he lay with one sheet or two? He said with one because he had the Rhumatism, and he sweated pretty much; after that, he was asked if he had any servant? He said a boy. The boy was sent for; he was asked where he lay? He said in the same room and bed with his Master. He was asked if he laid with one sheet or two? He said two.

Spencer said let them alone; I'll warrant you, you shall come to no harm: then I said to Spencer, I am very drowsy, go and make my dough for me; he did.

             is my daughter. I live at Hammersmith. My child complained to me on Friday the 14th of this month that she was sore. I examined her, and found a great running, of what I take to be the venereal disease. The parts were swelled very much.</p>

            . The prosecutor brought the child to me last Saturday was se'ennight. I found three venereal shankers on the labia, and a swelling upon each groin, with an ulcer of matter issuing through the virginale: it appeared by all circumstances that a man had entered her body. When I talked to the prisoner about it, he asked me how could shankers come since last Tuesday? I apprehend she had the venereal disease.</p>
               <p>Q. If there were only the venereal disorder about his private parts, and he was only to attempt it, would not there be the same symptoms?</p>
               <p>Duddle. Certainly he entered her, for there was a laceration on the parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think shankers could come between the Tuesday and the Sunday?</p>
               <p>Duddle. I do think they could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked him, if he would examine me, whether I had the venereal disorder or not?</p>
               <p>Duddle. He did. I did not examine him; it is impossible to examine those things, except we take a proper catheter.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been so infected so as to have given<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210011"/> her shankers in that time, would there not have been a running on him?</p>
               <p>Duddle. I might not have seen it, except I had pressed the instrument along the said tube.</p>
               <p>The Child examined, but not sworn.</p>
               <p>Child. I went to carry my grandmother's shoe to the prisoner, He put me upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Child. This was in the prisoner's shop below in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>Child. He said I must not tell my mamma. He laid me down on my back and hurt my groin, and put his cock to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he doing this to you?</p>
               <p>Child. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put any thing into you?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Child. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not generally cry out when you are hurt? Did you not shed tears?</p>
               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not frighted?</p>
               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you complain and tell your mother?</p>
               <p>Child. I told my mamma on the Sunday. I do not know how long that was after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any any thing to your cloaths?</p>
               <p>Child. He pulled up my petticoats when he laid me on the table. But he laid me cross his lap after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he put something into your body?</p>
               <p>Child. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Was any body in the room at the time?</p>
               <p>Child. There was Mrs. Barnard, the prisoner's grand-mother in another room, not in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Mother. Did the girl complain to you?</p>
               <p>The Mother. She did, in the same way she does now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she complain before you asked her?</p>
               <p>Mother. She complained of her groin being sore first.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, this was done out of spite, because he would not deliver the shoes when he had done them without the money.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barnard. I was in a room over head when the child came in with the shoes to be mended. I never saw or heard any disturbance.</p>

She told me, she came from a customer of ours, Mrs. Broomfield, that lives about five doors from us; and said she would have come herself, but was not well. As she was looking over the pieces, she said she was fearful she should not please her, and desired me to let her carry it to shew her.

I went to his lodgings on the Monday morning, and there found three yards of blue huffily. I lost six yards; and two yards of Manchester velvet, and five yards of fustian. I found him at the Thistle and Crown, an alehouse in Russel-court. I charged him with stealing some duffil out of my shop that same day. The landlord said, he had courted him four or five days to have a remnant of Manchester velvet, which he said was in pawn. I said, I had lost a piece torn at the end. When I saw it, I found it was my property. The remnant of the other duffil I found at a pawnbroker's. I found the fustian at a piece-broker's shop, named Reynolds, in White-horse-yard.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor's wife takes in washing. The handkerchiefs mentioned were delivered to her to wash. They were missing. The prisoner worked for her. She was charged with stealing them. She confessed taking one out of a parcel of linen which she was employed to carry home. They were all four found at a pawnbroker's, pawned by her at sundry times.</p>

I got into company till the gentleman I wanted came; after I had done with him, I met with two or three of my acquaintance; we sat and drank till about half an hour after twelve; after I parted with them, I met with this woman at the bar; she pretended to be a country girl; she asked me to go along with her to see her apartment; through persuasions I went to her house; when I came there, she wanted something to drink. I said I had been drinking, and would not drink any more. She said this is only my lower apartment, I should go up stairs and see that above. I went up with her; I did not want to stay all night, but through persuasions I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any thing?</p>
               <p>Charlton. I gave her a shilling to stay with her all night. She said, there is another girl in the house who was a partner with her; she gave the other girl the shilling; then she and I went to bed. I had then half a guinea in gold and the rest in silver, about 17 or 18 shillings. She saw it as well as I; we put off our things, and I laid my breeches on the head of the bed, not quite under the pillow; we had not laid above twenty minutes, before she snatched hold of my breeches, and put her hand into the pocket, and gave the money to the other woman, who ran down stairs directly; I not having any thing on did not follow her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other girl come into the room?</p>
               <p>Charlton. I saw her come in. I took care to secure the prisoner; and then took a candle, and looked under the bed and pillow, to be sure whether she had got it or not. I found no money. I called the watch directly, and had her secured and taken to the watch-house. I went before justice

             the next morning about nine o'clock; as soon as the justice saw her, he called her by her name, and said, are you come again? I missed half a guinea and three shillings in silver; she had left me three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210013"/>Q. What condition was you in for liquor?</p>
               <p>Charlton. I was not drunk; I knew as well all about it as I do now. She threatened to cut my throat if she had an opportunity, and cut my nose off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been asleep?</p>
               <p>Charlton. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Charlton. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money in her hand?</p>
               <p>Charlton. No, I saw her hand come out of the pocket, and she put it to the other woman's hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He came into my house between eleven and twelve at night, and sent for some gin; he gave the girl a shilling to sleep with me all night. He was excessively immodest: I did not chuse to be in the room with him: I came down out of the room; he came down and called the watch; the constable searched me, but I had none of his money; he sent the other girl to Bridewell for six weeks to hard labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoner's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Charlton. They were in Swan-alley, St. Catharine's.</p>

The two prisoners were found in John's-street sitting together at the step of a door, and the things behind or partly under the woman.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson in his defence said, he was a coachman; he had been drinking with a brother coachman; was got a little in liquor. As he was going home saw Clark sitting; he asked her, what she sat there for? She said, she was not well. He asked her, if she would drink part of a pot of beer; she would not: then he sat down by her; and in about five or six minutes came the chairmen, and asked, if they had seen such things? That he knew nothing of them till the woman got up.</p>

               <p>Zachariah Stevens. On Friday the 2d of March last, Mr. Wogin and I set out in a post chaise from <placeName id="t17620421-20-crimeloc106">Princes-street</placeName>

                        targets="t17620421-20-off104 t17620421-20-crimeloc107"/> that evening. When we were about four miles upon the road about 20 minutes before seven, a man rode very swiftly by us; he crossed the head of the horses, and turning round again to Mr. Wogin's side, he presented a pistol. Mr. Wogin desired him to put the pistol aside; and said, Sir, if you must have it, here is my purse. The man took it, and said, you have more, Sir? - I have no more upon my honour. - Sir, you have more (swearing) I know you have more. I will not be imposed upon. I will have all you have. I will have more. He stopped us matter of four minutes. He said, there is nothing but silver in the purse; then he applied to me. I told him, I had but little. I gave him half a guinea. He said, gentlemen, if you do not give me all that you have, I will make you get out of the chaise. I said, I have no more, but a little silver. He said, give me that. I gave him about three shillings. Then he said to Mr. Wogin, give me your watch. Mr. Wogin slipped his watch out of his fob, and put it towards me. He told him he had no watch. Then he applied to me for my watch. I said, I had none. He said, come out of the chaise, I will search you. I said, this carrying it too far; you had better be satisfied with what you have got. Mr. Wogin got the chaise open. Then the man said, well, gentlemen, I must take your words; I wish you a good night, and rode off towards London. The next morning we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210014"/> had been telling the story with all the circumstances of it; the servants waiting at the table listened to it. Presently came a man with a bill upon Mr. Wogin for post chaises; this man was informed by the servants, that Mr. Wogin and I had been robbed the evening before; he was inquisitive what sort of a man and horse. When he was told, he said, I will be hanged if that very man and horse are not at my master's house, the three pidgeons, at Brentford. Then we were informed of it; we interrogated the man; he gave just such a description of a man and horse as we had given. We walked down to Brentford; when we came there, we were informed a man answering that description had come in there at 10 o'clock; and had ordered himself to be called at six, but had laid in bed till 10 or 11; that he had been there once or twice before; and they suspected him to be a highwayman. We went into the stable, and thought it to be the same horse. I ordered the stable door to be locked, and the horse to be secured; and the man of the house to take care of his boots. The prisoner was then in the coffee-room in his slippers. Mr. Wogin being dressed as he was the night before, and I had pulled off my great coat. I proposed to go into the coffee room without him, to see if it was the same man; but Mr. Wogin desired me not to apprehend him till we were sure. I went in, and saw him sitting in the corner, and entered into conversation with the people; they were talking about highway robberies. I could not recollect him by his face; but was certain if I heard his voice I should recollect him. He had the same hat and coat on (when he robbed us, he had his coat buttoned up to his mouth); something was said which provoked him to speak; then I had no doubt but it was the same man. Mr. Wogin came in. One of the company said, I think Tyburn has not been graced with any some time. Mr. Wogin said, I believe it will be very soon graced with an acquaintance of mine. They asked him, on what account? He said, he had been robbed. The prisoner said, was it between this and London? He said, no, it was in the other road within a mile of Acton. The prisoner looked confused. While the other people were talking about the particulars of robberies, he said nothing, but got up and went to the window, and got out at the door. Then I said, I have no doubt in the world but this is the person that robbed us; and I think it is our duty to apprehend him. I will follow him if any body will go with me, and we will take him in the garden. Then they said, you had better send for a constable. We got one. The constable said, it was better and safer to wait till he came out of the garden; and if you point him out to me, we will take him. We stood together, three or four of us; and as he came, the constable and we laid hold of him: he was conducted into a room, and appeared to have as little fear as possible a man could have upon such an occasion. He asked, what we meant? I told him, he was the person we suspected to have robbed us; and if he had any body to give an account where he was at the time of the robbery, it would be of great service to him. He sat down, pretending to write to somebody. I desired people to go and search his room; and others to search the garden. While he was writing, a person came and told me I was wanted in the garden: they brought me to the necessary-house, and pointed to a horse pistol which lay concealed [ producing one], this is it. This I believe to be the very same pistol that was presented to us. We both had described it; it was loaded with balls; I have them now in my pocket. When I came back, and produced the pistol to him, he would not proceed with his letter, or tell his name, or give any account of himself. He took out a half guinea from his pocket, in order to pay a little bill. I apprehend that half guinea he had from me; it was a new King

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a pistol was it he presented to you?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was a common size horse-pistol. It is a gentleman's pistol; here is the arms upon it; I saw it was a brass mounted pistol, very bright, but not so at the muzzle; it looked as this, appearing dull at muzzle, as if it had got some rust.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the garden at the three pidgeons a place where a person could easily escape over the pales?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I do not think they could very easily.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the garden?</p>
               <p>Stevens. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that was your half guinea?</p>
               <p>Stevens. If a person had been robbed of such a one, by a man of the same sort of voice, hat, cloaths, and the like, it would have raised a suspicion; and I have no doubt but that it was my half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say this is the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I have no doubt but this is the man. I wish I had; but I have none in the world; and I believe so as to the horse.</p>

            , Esquire, Grosvenor-square. The prisoner used to come there; and be at times in the room where pistols used to be kept; we did not miss a pistol till we heard there was one found upon a highwayman, and carried to a gunsmith to see who owned it: then upon searching we missed No. 2. This pistol here produced is the same, my master's property.</p>

            . I am a stable-keeper. The prisoner had a mare of mine. I have not seen her since. It was a brown mare; he hired her I think on the 24th of February, and was to return on the Saturday following. She is about 14 hands two inches high; and is hurt a little above the hock; and has a little bit of a star on her forehead; a genteel mare.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Is the mare this evidence describes like her the man rode that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Stevens. She answers exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Do you remember when I went out of the yard, I told you I believed I should go to Portsmouth?</p>

               <p>The constable. When I searched the prisoner I found some crape in his pocket, and several bills of fare from the houses he had been at, and turnpike tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any of these bills shew a journey to Portsmouth?</p>
               <p>Constable. No.</p>

               <p>When they came into the room at Brentford, I was just going. Mr. Wogin was frighted, and said, he would not appear against the young man for five hundred pounds; and described the young man in a different dress than what Mr. Stevens has: he said, it was so dark he could not describe him. Mr. Stevens says the horse was very swift; as for that horse I rode, he went very lame at that time. I was then going to Kingston to a gentleman that is now in court.</p>

            . I keep the Three Pidgeons at Brentford. The prisoner was at my house twice; the last time he came in over night, before the gentlemen came and charged him. He got up in the morning about nine, and went into the public coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think it was about noon I charged him.</p>
               <p>Allam. The mare he rode on was very lame. He came on her both times.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he have made his escape out of your garden with ease had he a mind so to do?</p>
               <p>Allam. There is a little rivulet at the bottom; sometimes the water is hardly over the shoes. There is a wall on one side, and pales on the other; the latter a child of six years of age may get over.</p>

            . My acquaintance with the prisoner was very little; last summer I had lodgings at Newington, with my wife and niece: He lodged in the same house. We have breakfasted, dined, and supped together; and taken a walk together in the fields, and after dinner gone to Hornsey and drank tea: I never missed him one night while I was there. He was very regular; there was a communication from his room to mine, where were gold watches of my wife's and mine. He has several times gone to prayers with us: His behaviour was exceeding genteel. I looked upon him as a gentleman. I never heard any thing who he was: He told me his money was paid him by some friend at so much a month. He lived at the same rate, and paid his reckoning as we did.</p>
               <p>Q. What expence might that be weekly?</p>

I said, I would give her nothing. She went down stairs, and I went to bed by myself. I had my watch in my breeches, and silver buckles in my shoes. When I had been in bed about half an hour, Mrs. Jones came to fetch the candle away. She awaked me coming up stairs. She asked me, if I would have my cloaths thrown on the bed. I said, yes: She throwed them on me. I heard my watch going as it lay under my head, when she was coming up stairs. She took the candle and went down. I did not bear my watch afterwards. I felt for my breeches, and they were lying on my cloaths. The watch was gone.</p>

When I was going to put my shoes on, I found a pair of metal buckles in my shoes, and my silver ones gone. This I suppose was done when I was asleep. I went down stairs and locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. Then Jones insisted on the door being opened, and took the poker up twice to wrench the lock back. I was sitting by the fire. Then she went up stairs and came down, and said to me, please to let this gentleman out. When I came to the door, there was man standing upon the stairs. I let him out and put the key in my pocket, and sat down by the fire again. After that, I went out to see if I could see Sarah Smith: I could not find her. Then I went in and locked the door. and put the key in my pocket again, till the watchman came at three o'clock. I told him I had been robbed of my watch and buckles: He went to the watch-house, and brought two men and a constable. I charged them with Jones, and a young woman that sat by the fire asleep. Jones said there was another young woman in bed up stairs. I charged the constable with her, and took all three to the watch-house. The two young women were cleared at Guildhall. After this, Smith was taken; my buckles were found in her shoes. I never saw my watch since.</p>

             had the watch and buckles. I asked her, if I should take her out about 8 at night, whether she could find Smith? She said, she believed she could; for she walked up and down Fleet-street with her every night. The other constable did not meet me, but the prosecutor's master did; his name is Woodhouse, a baker. We went to the matron, and she let Jones come out. I took her in my hand. We went up Fleet-market; we met an old woman: She said to her, mother, have you met the full-breasted girl to-night? because here are me and two more in Bridewell for robbing a baker's man that lives in Harp-alley of a watch and buckles, and she has got them; now the constable is so good to me, to tell me I shall be cleared out of Bridewell, if I can find her. The old woman said, then d - n her, a bitch, we will have her to-night. Then they inquired of a girl, who said she was just gone in at a gin-shop. We went there: She was gone. Then he and the old woman walked up one side of Fleet-street, and I and Jones on the other. He laid hold of Smith just by St. Dunstan's-church, and called me. I took charge of her, and took her to my house in Salisbury-court, and sent him home for his man to see her. I asked Smith, how she came to take the buckles out of his shoes? She said, he changed with her. Said I, how came you to change knee-buckles, for we found his knee-buckles upon her. They were black ones, and his silver buckles in her shoes.

Most of those things, when not in use, are put in a chest or press, by a person whom I call my deputy. That deputy has been in a very ill state of health for some time, and therefore he has been forced to call in a person to his assistance: He very unluckily called in the prisoner at the bar. On the 5th or 6th of this instant, Mr. Fosset, one of the vergers of St. Paul's, took me into the vestry to examine there. I found the surplices all there, but instead of four napkins, there were only two. We reported this to the bishop of Oxford, who is dean of St. Paul's. He ordered us to wait upon Mr. Alderman Dickenson, to know what must be done: He granted a search warrant. We took up Barnes, and he confessed that the linen table-cloth was pawned at Mr. Harrison's. a pawnbroker in Bride-lane, in the name of Cook: and the two napkins in Blackfriars, at Mr. Radbard's, by the same Cook. I asked him, what was become of Cook? He said, he was somewhere about the church-yard. I desired one of the vergers to give a good look out for him. We soon took him, and brought him to Barnes; who confirmed what Barnes had confessed. We carried them before Mr. alderman Dickenson: He sent for the pawnbrokers, who came, and acknowledged the pawing of the said goods. They were bound over to appear, and Barnes and Cook were committed to the Compter. The next day we searched the chest of plate; there was the pulpit candle-branch missing. I went to Barnes in the Compter, and asked him what was become of the branches? He told me, they were pawned at Mr. Wilmot's, in St. Bride's-alley. I called upon Mr. Wilmot. He owned he had such in his custody, and was ready to produce them. Two or three days after this, we missed a velvet desk-cloth. Barnes was then removed to Newgate. I was told Barnes had pawned it at Mr. Cates's, a pawnbroker in Chandois-street. I went there, and took one of the vergers with me. We asked Mr. Cates's son or servant, if one Barnes had pawned a velvet cover or cloth at his house? He said, yes, We desired to see it. He produced it; and Mr. Argent the verger, was very sure, that that very cloth produced, was the property of the dean and chapter of St. Paul's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fosset. I am a verger of St. Paul's. I have heard what has been said by Mr. Pierce. I can say no more than he has said, except the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210019"/> branches, which were brought to me on Good-Friday from Mr. Harrison's. I know there were two arms belonging to the branch of St. Paul's. I heard the prisoner confess, that he ordered Cook to pawn the table-cloth at Mr. Harrison's; and also the napkins at Mr. Radbard's, in Blackfriars.</p>

The prisoner was servant to Mrs. Keith: I was sent for after the child was born on the 7th of April: The child was taken out of a trunk and laid upon a large chest; it had no marks of violence upon it; it was in a flannel petticoat. I asked, why she did not send for me before? She said, because her mistress had bolted her into her room, and the child was born at two in the morning. Had it been a married woman's case,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176204210020"/> I should not have been surprized to have found the woman and child both dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it born alive?</p>
               <p>E. Bowman. I cannot tell that. It might have died before it came into the world. She had made provision for it. [ The baby things produced.]</p>
               <p>Q. Had the child gone its full time?</p>
               <p>E. Bowman. It had.</p>

            . I live at Chelsea. The prisoner was my servant for three months. I did not believe she was with child; I had too good an opinion of her. I saw some blood in the room, and I suspected she had had a child. I said, I am afraid there is something in the trunk that should not be. I asked for the key. She gave it me. I then went to a neighbour, and told her; she desired I would not open the trunk till the constable came. When he came we opened it; we found the child at the bottom of it; but I did not examine it, it was a boy; but I am no judge whether it had gone its full time or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bolt her into her room?</p>
               <p>M. Keith. I did, as she said, she was very sick, because she should not be disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her call in the night?</p>
               <p>M. Keith. No. I did not. I charged her with being with child, but she never would own it.</p>

            . I live at Newington in Surry. I was at Chelsea about the time this woman was brought to bed. I came just as the constable came. I saw the child in a petticoat; it was under some linen in a box: it was taken out of the box, and put upon a chest. I saw no marks of violence upon it.</p>

            . I am the constable. I was sent for to open the trunk. I found a dead child in a bit of linen rag, wrapped in a piece of an old petticoat; we took it out and laid it on a chest. I asked the prisoner, how she came to put it there? She said, she was brought to bed about two o'clock, and did not come to herself till about five; she found it dead, and so she put it in her trunk, because her mistress had said, if she was brought to bed there, she would throw her and the child into the street.

            . I opened the body of the child, and took out the lungs, and made the usual experiment, and found they swam, which shews it had breathed: but it might have been smothered without her having done any thing to it; there was no appearance of any mark or outward design to destroy it. I look upon it, it died for want of proper assistance.</p>

               <p>The reason I did not own I was with child was, because I intended to go to my aunt's to lie-in: I intended to have gone away the next day. The reason I put the child in the trunk was, because my mistress had said, if I was brought to bed there, she would throw me and the child in the street. When I was delivered and came to myself, I found it dead. I called out, but nobody heard me; I was spent so much at last that I could call no more.</p>

My wife was brought to bed on the 1st of February. The prisoner had the keys of the child-bed linen, and other things. On the 3d of March at her own desire I discharged her. Between the 1st of February and the 4th of March I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment. She was taken before the sitting alderman. We had a search warrant, and went to the house of Mrs. Higby, in St James's-street, where she had lodged; there we found a great number of the things, which my wife can give the best account of [produced in court and deposed to by Mrs. Stanynought].</p>

            . I live in St. James's-street, Westminster. The prisoner had a box at my house. She brought a great parcel of things the Monday before she was taken up, and untied the handkerchief on the bed. I saw her put the things in the box. I remember a pair of double ruffles. I was the less surprized, as she told me she had a great many good things at her uncle's. She had been with me ever since the month of June. The prisoner told me she gave half a guinea for the ruffles. She had been bringing things from the fourth or fifth of March.</p>
               <p>Avery Tow. I live servant with the prosecutor. I came on the third of March, the day the prisoner was to go away. I was by the fire in the kitchen. She came to me, and asked for some pins to pin her bundle. One of the bundles was unpinned, and the things fell down; I picked up a pair of double laced ruffles; I saw two laced caps, one of muslin with a footing to it, the other a flower'd minionet with a lace; a flowered lawn apron, and a gause apron: the handkerchief in which they were was a red and white spotted one, there was in another bundle a great quantity of lace, some of which had the millener's marks upon them; there were some damask napkins, and three pair of white cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The three pair of white cotton stockings were found at Newington, where the prisoner's child was at nurse.</p>
               <p>A. Tow. The prisoner took out of her pocket a pair of double ruffles, whipped, and put them on her arms. I was surprized to find the prisoner, who was but a servant, should have so many good things. She said, when her mistress was in a good key, and the devil out of the way, she would give her a few things. I asked her, what she did with napkins? She said, her mistress would not allow towels in the family, and so she was obliged to use them. Afterwards I took occasion to speak to my mistress, and said, the last maid had got a great deal of lace, and a great many fine things: then my mistress went to her drawers, and missed the things; this was the first of missing them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts. I am constable. I searched the house of Mrs. Terry at Newington, and found three pair of cotton stockings on the 17th of March [be looked them out from the other things, deposed to by the prosecutor's wife].</p>

               <p>This is quite false what the servant maid has swore against me. She was not in the house an hour and a half before I went away. I was not in the kitchen with her. The stockings I bought for my child. They charge me very wrongfully. I never wronged them of any thing.</p>

She came home at two o'clock to dinner on the third of March; and as she had no fire she dined with me, and went out afterwards to her work. She said, she had locked her door, and had the key in her pocket. After that, I was going into my parlour, I missed my key out of my kitchen door. I looked up stairs. I saw the stair-case lighter than usual. I went up and saw Mrs. Meakins's door wide open, and the lid of a box half off, and one box gone. I went out, and asked my neighbours, if they had seen any body carry out any thing? A man said, he saw the prisoner come down stairs. The prisoner had been with me the forenoon that day. I was in my cellar, and heard the street door open very softly. I came up as fast as I could, and met the prisoner coming out of my kitchen. I said, what do you want? He said, is Mrs. Daniel at home? I said, go up and see. He went up; this was about 11 in the forenoon. I staid in the entry till he came down again. I did not like his looks. I was told by my lodgers above, that he did not ask for Mrs. Daniel, but for Mrs. Thompson, when he was above. The things, all but the gowns, were found in his apartment [ produced in court, and deposed to].</p>

I went and told her I was a Custom-house-officer. I examined her bundle, and found about seven ells of holland, and three quarters of a yard of cambrick.

I bid her go over to the George coffee-house, there is a man that writes petitions, and possibly, upon application to the honourable board, they may grant them you again. She went there. Then I went to the wharf. A soldier told an acquaintance of mine, that the waterman advised her not to land there, and that the woman had more goods about her. Then I went back to the coffee-house, and said to her, I have an information you have more goods about you. There were
