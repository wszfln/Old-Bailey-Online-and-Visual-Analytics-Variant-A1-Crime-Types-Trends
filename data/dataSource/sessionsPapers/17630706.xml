When he missed the money, he called me up; I called the prisoner up and charged her with it, she flew and tore and said, she would take us before my Lord Mayor for scandalizing her. She cried murder. The young man, that had recommended her to us, was below, he came up, and struck my husband, and got her down stairs before him. While my husband was talking to him below, the prisoner got up into a back room, I went to her and desired she would let me have the money again; she fell down on her knees and said, will you let me go if I tell you were it is? I said I would; then she took up one of the feet of the bed and took up a paper and gave it me, in which was one guinea and six half guineas, and the next day I found she had changed a half guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he into your cellar?</p>
               <p>White. He has but very little sight, he came when I was very busy on the morning of the 28th for some salmon kits that I had sold him, he went down into the cellar, and I suppose by groaping about got my money.</p>

            . Mrs. White and I have been partners 20 years, I heard she had been robbed by the blind man, seeing him go by soon after, I went to him, and said, are not you a great rogue to rob her that has been better than a mother to you? he said, d - n you, what is that to you. I sent for her, she came, and charged a constable with him; I saw Mr. Quintam search him, and take the buckles out of his shoes, and gold and silver out of his pocket; I heard him say he threw the bag away, and bought another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Quintam. I am constable; I was sent for to Mrs. White, I went and found the prisoner at the Man in the Moon, I had use to know him before, but he was dress so well I could hardly know him at first sight; I searched him, I found the pieces of money upon him as laid in the indictment; I took him in a coach to go to the Justice, going along he confessed that the money was Mrs. White's property, and every word he told me, he told the Justice; he said he took the money out of the cellar, out of a shoe. The Justice said, have you got ever a watch? he said, no: - how came you by these buckles? - I bought them with Mrs. White's money: the Justice said, take them out; he said, no, blast me, I will not. Then the Justice ordered me to take them out, which I did. He said he took a black bag, and put it into the under salmon kit, and put three upon it, and carried it as far as Mr. Trueman's brew-house, then he looked to see what a prize he had got, he untied the bag, the first he saw was a crown piece, which rejoiced his heart, that there were thirty crown pieces, and all the rest gold; that he carried it to the George, in George-Yard, then he went and bought his cloaths, and turned it all into gold.</p>
               <p>Q. to White. Was your money in a black bag?</p>
               <p>White. It was not black, but it was made black by being in the cellar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I said I had 3 s. and a halfpenny, and if it was that money I could give him as much.</p>

I picked it up in the highway.</p>

I saw the prisoner afterwards at the house of Cole, he said my money was safe; I asked him how he came into the room? he said he gave a knock at the window, and then went in, and took the money from my pocket, and the buckles from my shoes and breeches, and that he did it in a joke.

            . I live in Swan-alley, the prisoner came to my house between 6 and 7 on the Wednesday morning with 2 Irish men, I was in bed, they desired I would let him lie in my house, and said he was very tired; the prisoner delivered to me this purse and 10 half guineas, out of them he had one, the other nine I kept; he said he had been robbed the night before of 2 guineas and he gave me these buckles also; I had insisted upon knowing what money he had about him before he went to bed.</p>
               <p>Anthonio Golsalvis. The night the robbery was done I did not lie at home; I came home to Mr. Francis's about 5 the next morning and found the sash window open, after that, I found the prisoner by inquiring in the house of Cole in bed, and heard him own to every thing as has been mentioned here.</p>

            . I am a Goldsmith, I live at the bottom of the Minories. On the 31st of March, about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar, and another man, who called himself Brown, came into my shop, and said they wanted some plate, I shewed them some, they were both in deep mourning; Brown said, he was going to settle at Gravesend; they bought to the amount of 27 l. 4 s. 10 d. Brown offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060011"/> me a Bank note for 200 l. payable to Castles and Wheatley. I told them there very few tradesmen kept so much cash by them, and said have you no smaller notes? then the prisoner said to the other, you have smaller notes, you may as well give them a smaller, upon that Brown delivered to me this 25 l. note here produced, and the prisoner paid me the remainder in money; they both seemed equally concerned in buying the plate and in chusing it out. The prisoner looked out a pair of gold sleeve mocha buttons, I asked him 25 s. for them, he bid me a guinea; one looked out a silver milk pot, then the other looked out another, they had also two pair of salts; the prisoner looked the things out equally as much as the other. Brown said he belonged to the Hector, Williams, that he had belonged to the India trade 21 years; he look'd very brown, more like a Jew; he was considerably shorter than the prisoner; I observed the prisoner was always putting his left hand up to his neck below his ear. My young man made observation on that afterwards, that he had a fear there, which I observed when I saw him before Sir

            . I was 15 years of age last Michaelmas. On the last day of March, betwixt the hours of 4 and 5, the man at the bar, and another man, both in black, came to Mr. Reynold's house, they wanted some plate; they asked for a tea-pot, they bought a silver tankard, salt-sellers, 2 milk-pots, a pair of stone shoe-buckles, and in all laid out 27 l. 4 s. I think this man looked the plate out as well as the other. The short one said his name was Brown, he offered my master a note, he said he was going to live at Gravesend; he offered master a large note, master asked him if he had not smaller; then the prisoner said to the other, you have a smaller; then Brown gave master a note of 25 l. the prisoner paid the rest in money, which was 2 guineas and 2 s. I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them, I took particular notice of his face, and minded a scar on the left side of his neck, which he kept rubbing with his hand; I mentioned that to my master the same day after they were gone.</p>

            , goldsmith and jeweller, in Aldgate High Street. On the 31st of March last, about 9 at night, somebody rang at the door, I opened it, there were two men came in, they said they wanted half a dozen table spoons, and half a dozen of tea spoons; my master was not at home, mistress came into the shop and served them. After they had agreed for the price, one of them pulled out a pocket book, he said he had not money enough, and mistress must change a 20 l. bank note, there were several notes in it; he delivered a 20 l. note to mistress, and she bid me carry it to my master at the Blue Boar Inn, and desire him to come home and change it; the goods came to about 5 l. Mr. Barlow came home and paid the money. As I was going out at the door for my master, I saw two men dressed in mourning, I passed by them, and looked hard at them, and they at me, I having the note in my hand was a little dubious of them; when I returned I saw one of them standing in the same place, the other was gone, to the best of my knowledge the prisoner was one of them, there was a lamp just by, they had bundles under their arms, I believe the prisoner was the man I saw alone, the other was a shorter thick man. I saw the prisoner since at Justice Fielding's on the 7th of June, and I now believe he was one of them; the people that came in, one was a talk thin man pitted with the small pox, dressed in brown, they went away towards White-chapel-bars, I shut the door, and did not observe whether they joyned the two in mourning.</p>

The book was soon missed, and the gentleman seemed to have a suspicion of Brinklow and me, and followed us, and kept near us till we came to the water side by London-Bridge; he said nothing to us; we called a boat to go over, he called another; the boats came pretty close together; we paid the waterman and got away, he did not follow us any farther; soon after that, Brinklow and I lost each other, being in a hurry I went below London-Bridge, and took water, and then went to one Lumbley's in Golden-Lane, the sign of the Raven and Crown, where I expected they all would have came, (we all frequented that house) I found they were gone to James Hall's, a house in Gray's Inn Lane; I went to the Sun where I used to feed my horses, and was told that Cole had been to enquire for me, and that he was gone to James Hall's; there I found Brinklow, Parsons, Hayes, and Watson, all together. They told me they were glad to see me, they thought I was taken up; there Parsons produced a Bank post-bill for 20 l. they said that was all the notes contained in the pocket-book, it was made payable to

I have known the prisoner some years, she has come often to our shop; on the 16th of March she came for 5 yards and a half of white 3-quarter'd mantua, in the name of Mrs. Minet, she said it was to make a white silk petticoat, she had it. Mrs. Minet is a married lady, and lives in St. Mary-Axe; the prisoner's mother, her sister, and she, are mantua makers; she always asked for a bill of parcels in Mrs. Minet's name, and had it with her. She came again on the 9th of April for 5 yards and a half more, to make another petticoat for Mrs. Minet, she had it.</p>

               <p>Stellings.

I said, no; then, said she, don't carry the bill; here was the first alarm I had; she went away with the man. The man came back again, and said he thought, by what passed, she had not the goods fairly, and desired I would step up to his master, whom he said was a pawnbroker. I went, there was this garnet ground brocade, and she was dressed in this silk gown, the silk she had of me. (Producing a silk gown) Mrs. Minet was then out of town, but all the servants said she had no such order for either of the silks from her mistress.</p>

I heard the watchman going one o'clock, I desired her to give me my money again, and I would make her a present of a crown; I called for a light, the other woman brought a light, I looked all about but found no money; then the prisoner snatched the candle out of my hand, and threw it into the fire place, and ran down stairs; I ran after her, and catched her at the door, and held her while the other woman came down; I thought she had the money in her mouth, the other woman put her hand to her mouth, and I heard something fall between them; she went out at the door, they called two men, one named Joe, and where they were to be found. In about 5 minutes two men came, and demanded what was the matter? the other woman was gone, this I had in hold, one of the men seemed to be going to hit me a blow, then I offered her half a guinea if she would give me my money, she would not own any thing of it; soon after that the watchman came, then a man came down stairs with a light in his hand, I looked to see what was fell, I saw half a guinea; I gave her in charge to the watchman, she was taken to the Compter, and the next day before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall, there she denied it, we did not search her.</p>

What said he, are you a brother? then tip us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060015"/> your Manus, upon which I gave him my hand; upon giving two or three hearty shakes he declared I was no Mason; I said I was very sure he was none; said he, if I am not, here is a brother a coming, a friend of mine, he shall examine you; then Foulder came up; Wright said, here is a man pretends to be a Mason, I wish you would examine him; he said I was a rascal for pretending to be one, and began to abuse me for pretending to be what I was not, and gave me a deal of foul language, and from words proceeded to blows; he struck me I believe three or four times; I told him then I was in my own neighbourhood, and I would charge the watch with them, but unluckily my watchman was off his watch; they kept ill using me; I said I am arm'd with a pistol in my pocket; I pulled it out; Foulder seized it immediately, then Hicks and Cooper came up (all strangers to me) they all four got round me, and I think Foulder wrench'd the pistol from me; then they began to accuse me with being a highwayman or street-robber, and carried me to the watch-house at St. Dunstan's; when we came there, I gave charge of them, and they of me, and we went all to the Compter together; the next morning we went all before Sir

             missed my pocket-book, and begg'd he would have them searched; then the prisoner Wright fumbled in his breeches, and pulled out my handkerchief, and said, here is your handkerchief; then he pulled out my pocketbook, and delivered them to me; I had told them in the Compter it could be of no value to them, and offered two guineas for it, it being all among my friends, I knew I could stop payment when I pleased; they all said they knew nothing of it, and wondered how I could charge them; the book was sealed up before Sir Matthew, and never opened till I came to draw the bill of indictment up, and that in the presence of evidences here. (The book produced, a bond taken out, dated June 19, 1761, for 400 l. A note, dated June 27, 1761, for 128 l. Another, Sept. 24, 1762, for 25 l. Another for 247 l. Another, July 26, 1761, for 20 l.

I seeing it advertized a gentleman robbed of a watch, and a 6 s. 9 d. piece, amongst a list of other robberies, I went to the Justice to see if I could get my watch and things again, there was the evidence Stevenson, he owned he was one that robbed me, and that he sold the watch to a Jew in Hounsditch, which is since gone off.

               <p>Prosecutor. He has not a good character; I never thought him to have a bad character when he lived with me, that is about 5 or 6 years ago, but I think otherwise now.</p>

In searching the prisoner's house I found in his cellar a quantity of leather; I said, Stephen, you go on with your old tricks, I found also a great quantity of buckles and buttons, a pistol loaded, and my hammer; then he said, my dear master, you have been a good friend to me, if you will forgive me I'll tell you of all the things; then he said he went to a public-house in Hogsden fields, there he had left my great coat, saying he was afraid to bring it home in the middle of the day; I asked him what he did with that pistol loaded with stones? he acknowledged that he did go upon the highway, and that there was a man concerned with him, who is since ran away; at that time he said nothing of finding my horses bridled and saddled astray, but cried, and said if I would forgive him he would be very good for the future. My saddles and bridles were upon the horses at the inn. I went to that alehouse by Hogsdon, there I found my great coat, as he had said. (The things produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said, he was in a good way of business, and served many topping people with butter, in Spittlefields, and sells fowls and eggs; when he has been short of butter he has gone to Mr. Allen for small quantities; and that his pleasure cart was of great use to him in his business; that he charged his pistol, as several neighbours had, with intent to shoot a mad dog, and not having bullets, he must have made use of shot, had he not put in a stone.</p>

There was a man lying on the grass about 50 or 60 yards distance, he got up and stared about him, his name is Ellis, I told him what had happened, he looked about and said he saw him; a farmer was riding about looking after his haymakers, he rode down and said he saw the man in a field. The poor man and I ran, some time we saw him, and some time not, we lost him, then we came again into the field where I was robbed, the grass not being cut down, we tracked him about a dozen yards in it, presently we found him lying on his belly in the ditch, the poor man jumped in and took him out; then the prisoner said, I'll give you your watch again; no, said I, you don't though.

            . I have been seven years almost at sea, I came on shore three weeks ago last Wednesday, I met Gray with another man in Wapping, the other person tapt me on the shoulder, and said, there was a man had got eleven guineas, and they were going to game with him, if I would go, I might get some. (They were quite strangers to me, I never was in London before.) I said, I did not want any man's money; then he said, come and drink; I went in with them, but do not know the house; they got the cards, and began to lay a guinea a time, they got me to put money down, I lost a shilling, after that another, and after that a 5 s. and 3 d. piece, so I would lay no more, then the others went away, and I was left with Gray, then we went out together, he would have me go and take share of a pot of beer, so he carried me to <placeName id="t17630706-33-crimeloc198">the King's Arms in Old Castle-street</placeName>

I laid my head down to take a nap, Gray tapt me and said, what o'clock is it? I pulled my watch out of my pocket, he snapt it out of my hand and gave it Colnett, and Colnett went away with it directly, Gray staid behind to pay the reckoning, and he was stopt by

            . My husband keeps the King's Arms. The two prisoners and prosecutor came into the house between 2 and 3 o'clock, I never saw either of them before, they called for a pint of twopenny, then a pen and ink, then for a pint of cold slip; there were three brewer's servants in the kitchen, as soon as they were gone, Colnett went to my husband and asked, if he would let them speak a word or two in private to Harris? Going through the passage, Harris asked them what their names were? Harris appeared to be in liquor. They came into the kitchen and sat down at the table, and called for a pen and ink again, then Colnett desired me to walk out of the kitchen, I said, that was my apartment, and I would not. Harris happened to drop asleep. I saw Gray take the watch out of Harris's hand and give it to Colnett, he put it under his apron, and went out with it. I called my husband and said, that young man's watch is gone, there is something going on I did not like. Harris dropt a shilling between his legs, and Gray took it up, and paid the reckoning with it; when my husband took the reckoning, Gray whispered him and said, I talked what did not concern me, and that Colnett was only gone for a little tea for the sailor. I said, Gray should not go till the young man had his watch again. A man, by overhearing me, went and found Colnett, and returned and said, he would be back in a quarter of an hour; Colnett came in about that distance of time and said, what do you keep the man in custody for? I said, till the young man has the watch, and now you are come, I insist upon your being charged. He used me very ill. Mr. Bird the constable was sent for, I insisted upon his taking them both away, but he would not for a great while, neither did he chuse to take charge of them. Colnett wanted Harris to pay him his charges while he had been gone with the watch, and said, he had pawned it for 1 l. 16 s. and threw that money on the table; this was after Colnett was charged; the young man wanted his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060020"/> watch, and would not take the money, then Colnet said, he should not have watch nor money neither.</p>

He crossed the way towards our house, the light from the shop blinded his eyes, he ran against a post, it took him in his breast, and he pitched over it, and fell on his head; I got past him, he seeing what I was upon, put his hand on his bosom and made off; I hollo'd out, there was a public-house just by, six or eight men pushed out, we all ran after the prisoner; the officer of the night was looking over the hatch in the watch-house, catched hold of the prisoner's collar, and stopped him; I had my eye upon him all the way, he ran, and I was within four or five yards of him when he was stopped. The officer took him into the watch-house, and asked him where he lodged? he said on Saltpetre-bank; he denied having any hand in the knocking down and robbing Mr. Harding, but I am sure he is one of the three, and is the very man that said, d - n your eyes, make off; there were lamps in that part of the road where he ran, and I had my eye upon him all the while.</p>

            . I was the officer of the night. I was at the watch-house at the bottom of Wellclose-square; on the 8th of June, at past 11 at night, as the prisoner came running I ran out of the watch-house and stopped him; I enquired for the person robbed, there I found Mr. Harding with his mouth bleeding, without hat or wig; I took the prisoner into the watch-house, he denied the charge. I asked him what company he had been in? first he said he had been to the Navy-office, the next day before the Justice he said he had been at Shadwell, at the Noah's Ark; Mr. Harding and I went there, the people said no such person had been there; after that he said he had been at a house by Stepney. The hat and wig were found in the road after he was taken.</p>

I came back directly, then these men stopped me, and brought me into the watch-house.</p>

            . My husband keeps a goldsmith's shop on the corner of Tower-hill. On the 28th of May in the afternoon there came a woman with this watch, and said it was her brother's, and if I disputed it, she would fetch him, she said, he was cook to the Sea-horse man of war. A man came and told me the same, and that he had a pension for loosing his leg; I observed he had a wooden leg; he said, he was waiting for his prize-money, and was forced to sell his watch. I sent it to a workman to have it valued, who sent word, it was old, and a very bad one, and not to give above 30 s. for it; I gave them that for it. (produced in court, deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Catherine Cartwright. I was coming home to my lodging, Murphy was standing at a door, he got hold of my cloaths and made me drink with him; after that I went to a chandler's shop and got a candle and lighted it; it was then almost 12 o'clock. I was going home with my lighted candle, the prosecutor came by, I saw Murphy knock him down, my candle went out. One said, That's the barber; and another said, they had got the watch; there were more persons than Murphy, but cannot swear to any but him; I immediately went home to my lodgings, I knew Murphy before by seeing him in the neighbourhood.</p>

I enquired of the constable, where the watchmen were? he told me they had been drinking and quarelling all night; on the Tuesday following I was told the thieves were in goal, and the wigs found; I went and saw the three prisoners in the Court-house, in Well-close-square; the woman at the bar said she found the wigs at the end of Denmark-street; we took them before the Justice, and swore to the wigs, and they were committed.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Anderson. My husband's name is James. On the 4th of March I called the maid up as usual at 6 in the morning; she went down stairs, and in less than a minute came up again; I found, by her speaking to my daughter, my house was broke open; I got up and went down, and found a desk was taken away from off the counter that we used to keep money and plate in, and a parcel of cloaths from off a table, linnen aprons, new cloaths, handkerchiefs, and different sorts of things in our way of business, we are pawnbrokers; I missed the till also from under the counter, and a closet was stripped of other goods; most of my loss was in money. On the 10th of March I advertized several things, after I had got the marks from the owners; about a month after that we were beset by eight boys and two men about 11 o'clock one night, Swift that was executed last was one of them. After that I heard that

After Madin was taken I went to him at the Tower goal, I asked him how he came by that box? he said it was given him by a young man that is gone to sea; he said the same before the bench of Justices.

             . My husband came to my lodgings a month ago at night; he is the man at the bar. My throat was cut that night, but I was fast asleep, there were my two children in the room, and he and I, and no body else, we were all in bed together, I don't know what it was cut with, as soon as I felt the blood run, I got out of bed, and went down stairs. He came that night to me in kindness, telling me, he would reform his life, and I forgave him; he might be in liquor for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to you?</p>
               <p>A. Lee. He came about a quarter after 12 at night, as he used to do when he did come.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any quarrel with him?</p>
               <p>A. Lee. No, none after I said I forgave him.</p>

               <p>A. Lee. He allowed me but 3 l. 12 s. a year, since I lay in last.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether you never pawned my cloaths?</p>
               <p>A. Lee. I did at the time when he would not allow me a farthing; he deserted me, and would not allow me any thing till taken up by the parish officers.</p>

            . I live in the same house where the woman lodges, she has a three pair of stairs room. I thought something was at the door that night, I called, who is there? no body made answer, presently my wife said, Lee and his wife are quarrelling above; I got up to go to the door, and Mrs. Lee came down and knocked very hard, I opened the door, the woman burst in, I thought she wanted to go to bed to my wife, or to speak to my wife, they were intimate, I thought her words proceeded more from her throat than her mouth; I took and put her out at the door, and shut the door, and ran up stairs to her room, as I was going in at her room door, she came up directly after me as fast as I could run; there is a little long passage before I got to the room door; I catched her in my arms, and found my shirt all over blood, she seemed to utter some words, but I could not understand her, I put her down upon her own bed-feet, then I perceived the front of her shift all over blood, and her throat cut, I cried, Good God, what have you done? speaking to her before I perceived him; he made answer, she has done a fine job for herself, she has cut her own throat; then I perceived him standing on the floor in his shirt before the chimney corner, he had his hand close be his side, his shirt was all over blood on one side, but his hand being close to his belly, I could not see how that was. She seemed to justify herself upon hearing what he said, she said, O Will Lee! O Will Lee! this she spoke more plainer than she spoke before; my wife was coming up stairs, and I ran down directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else in the room?</p>
               <p>Frazier. I am pretty well assured there was no body in the room but themselves and the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any body was there?</p>

               <p>Frazier. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Frazier. She is a very honest industrious woman, I always looked upon her as such, she works hard for her children, a poor industrious woman; he used sometimes to come in secret, late at night when he did come.</p>

            . I am one of the constables of St. Martin's in the fields. (Produced a shirt, the right hand sleeve very bloody.) This the prisoner owned to be his shirt, he had just took it off when I came, and was putting a clean one on. On Sunday, the 12th of June, I heard a woman call for assistance, between 3 and 4 in the morning, Help me for Christ's sake, for my husband has cut my throat! I knocked hard at the door, and demanded entrance, a gentleman in the house asked who was at the door? I said, the constable; he opened the door. I saw Mrs. Lee standing on the stair-case, with her shift all over blood, bleeding at that time, I asked her, who had done her that injury? she said, her husband did it in her sleep, and they had had no words; I asked where he was, she said, up three pair of stairs; I met him, and laid hold of him, and said, he was my prisoner; he said, he was innocent, she did it herself; he was in his shirt; I took this bloody shirt from upon the bed; he begged leave to put his cloaths on, I granted him that, and went into the room with him; we asked, what it was done with? Somebody found a razor under a stocking, I believe his stocking, on the ground in his room. I took him to the watch-house, after that a person came and said, to all appearance she was dying, he said, she might die, and be d - d if she would, for she was no wife of his. I searched his pockets and found in them these chips, (producing a parcel of dry deal chips proper to kindle a fire with) he said they were to light his master's fire in the morning, and that be used to light his fire; but upon enquiring I found he did not. He said at the Justices, he found the woman had cut her throat, and he put his arm cross her to keep her from struggling; this he did to account for his shirt being bloody.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I lodge up one pair of stairs in that house. On Sunday morning, the 12th of June last, I was alarmed with a noise in the house about 3 o'clock in the morning, I jumped out of bed, and listened at the door, I heard these words, A doctor, for Christ's sake, my husband has cut my throat! I shut my door till I had dressed myself, by that time the constable came up stairs, I went up after him; when I came into the room I saw the prisoner, I asked, what it was done with? he said he did not know; I looked about the room and found a razor by the bed-side on the floor, (produced in court with the appearance of blood upon it) there seemed to be a stocking or dirty rag over it; I saw the shirt after the constable took hold of it, it was bloody. (The Jury inspect the razor, and declare there is blood dried upon it.) The woman is a very industrious woman; she said, they went to bed very lovingly, and drank a glass of wine before they went to bed, they had not cohabited together for some time, and that she forgave him. A surgeon came, he asked me for a light, I lighted a candle, and when I came there I found a candle lighted in their chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the room when you first went in?</p>
               <p>Witness. There were no body but the man and his wife and two children.</p>

            . I was reading the paper stuck up in this Court-yard, which gave an account of the prisoners to be tried; having an occasion for my handkerchief, I put my hand in my pocket, and found it was gone. The prisoner was standing directly at my pocket. Two young men came and said they believed he had got my handkerchief, for they had observed him attempting to pick another person's pocket. The prisoner had his hand in his trowzers, endeavouring to conceal something; I saw my handkerchief hanging between his legs; I took it, and had him secured, and brought into a room here to an Alderman, and he was committed.</p>

We lay in that room, and I used to keep my money there, it is a room behind the tap-room; they went into that room, where the cloth was laid, at that time there were the two appraisers, and Mr. Whitebread's clerk, and some other people that has just dined.

I went up stairs after the two appraisers, where we settled our accounts between myself and the man that came into the house. The man that came into the house paid me for the things in two bank notes, one of 22 l. the other of 30 l. and some cash; I gave my wife the two notes to carry down to lock up among the rest , which she said she accordingly did.

I put them together in a box in the cupboard, in the room where these men dined, on the Sunday morning about an hour after I received them; there were six notes in the box after my wife had put in them she carried down. In about an hour and a half after I delivered them to my wife, I wanted 9 l. odd shillings to pay the clerk the discount, I sent my wife for one of these notes, she came back and told me three of these notes were gone; then I directly locked up my house, the two prisoners called out to have every body searched, saying, they had not been out of the house; they were first searched, and nothing found; after the search I sent to Mr. Welch for a constable, (there were some cards found in West's pocket) I took the two prisoners to Mr. Welch, they both denied it, and said they had not been out of the house at all. The person I had these notes of was then upon the circuit; I wrote to him at Winchester, (he is a porter of Sergeant's Inn) he wrote me word the numbers were in town; I advertised them twice without the numbers; when he came to town he delivered the numbers to me, then I advertised them twice more, and hearing nothing of them gave them over. About a fortnight ago John Purcell came with an information to me, and told me that two or three days after I had lost these notes, he was grinding a knife in the street, the two prisoners called to him, and told him they wanted to speak to him; they took him under a gateway, Mr. West pulled out a pocket-book, and took out three bank notes, and gave them to Mr. Hinchcliffe, and he gave them to Purcell, and asked him if he could put them off, as he was acquainted among the Jews in Duke's-place, and they would give him seven or eight guineas for his trouble; he said he refused it, and would have nothing to do with them; they desired he would get them off if it was for less than the value, and they would give him more for his trouble.</p>

I brought them down by the ends in my hand into the room where the two prisoners were, and unlocked the cupboard door and took out this box, (producing a wash-ball box) and opened it, there were four other bank notes which I took and rolled up all together, and put them into the box, there were then six notes in it; I took out half a guinea, and put the box in the cupboard, then I locked the cupboard, and carried the half guinea up to my husband; the two prisoners were at dinner, and the brewer's clerk sitting by, the prisoners saw me bring the notes and put them up; I came down into the bar directly, and did not go into that room till my husband sent me for a note about an hour and a half afterwards, then he bid me go and fetch a 10 l. bill to pay Mr. Slater. I went into the room, there were then in the room the two appraisers and Mr. Hinchcliffe, the appraisers had not been out of the house to my knowledge. I went to unlock the cupboard door, I put the key in and it would not turn, then I put my two hands to it, it would not turn, I put my hand to the door and snatched the key out, and the door came open; I saw the box lying in the cupboard, then I looked at the lock of the door, and strove to lock it; I took out the box, and locked it, and carried the box to my husband in the tap-room; I opened it, and took out the papers, and in opening the paper I found but three notes; I said, O! Lord, what is become of the notes! there were six here just now, and burst out a crying. Somebody said in the tap-room, shut up the house, and let every body be searched. The door was shut up, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060034"/> two prisoners were searched, and Mr. Slater, I think he had 400 l. about him, I saw a great bag stand in the window, and gold in it, the appraisers also were searched.</p>

            . I am a brewer; on Saturday the 1st of March I was at Mr. Evans's house after the notes were missed. I saw Hinchcliffe come out of the house with a pipe in his mouth as I stood at our brewhouse opposite Mr. Evans's, about three quarters of an hour before the notes were missed; I did not see him return back, he went under the gateway joining, where people frequently go to make water; he came from under the gateway, and went directly out of the coal-yard, I cannot tell where he went to; he flung his pipe down between two sacks of foot, a little distance from the gateway, in the Coal-yard, that goes into Drury-lane, which way he turned I cannot say, I cannot say I saw him go quite out of the Coal-yard, but he went up the Coal-yard that part that goes to Drury-lane.</p>

            . I was attending at the prosecutor's house on the 1st of March, to settle the account between him going out, and a man coming in; I was to receive between 9 and 10 l. to ballance the account, (I am clerk to Mr. Whitebread the brewer) and had then upwards of 300 l. about me; just as we had dined in the back room, the two prisoners came in, they desired Mr. Evans to get them a steak, he told them he was very busy, and there was some beef left, if they pleased to accept of that they were very welcome; they came and sat down to dinner, the rest of the company were gone all but me; while they were at dinner, Mrs. Evans brought down two bank notes in her hand; and opened a cupboard that opens in the wall, and took out a wash-ball box, which unscrewed, and went to put those two notes in the box, she could not rightly put them in, but she took the other papers out of the box, then folded them up, and put them into the box all together, and screwed the box, and put it in the cupboard, and locked the door, and went up stairs; I seeing the notes brought down, imagined the business was done, upon which I went up stairs to settle the accounts with him, and left the two prisoners in the room, and the maid servant. I said to Mr. Evans, I see you have done, we may as well settle, he told me they had done, then I said if it would be convenient for him, he might go down and settle with me; he came down presently after; the balance due to me was, I believe, between 9 and 10 l. we settled in the fore-room; (that is, Evans, his wife, and I) he ordered his wife to fetch a 10 l. bank-note, she went and fetched the box, she unscrewed it, and took out first a note, I think, of 10 l. the next a 30 l. and the next a 10 l. as soon as she took out the last, she fell into a great surprize, and said she was robbed, Mr. West standing by us. (Hinchcliffe was then in the back room.) West said, fasten the doors, let all the doors be fastened, let every body be searched, he was sure neither Hinchcliffe, nor he, had been out of the house. Accordingly the appraisers were searched, (they had not been in the room all the time) then the two prisoners were searched, and the cooper that attended, and I, were searched; I had not been out of the house, nor had I been in the back room some time; after every body was searched, Mr. Evans insisted upon it, that the two prisoners had the notes, and took them before Justice Welch. The cooper is cooper to Mr. Whitebread, he was out of the room before the two prisoners came in, he went to gauging the beer.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Evans, and eating my dinner at the dresser, Mr. West and Mr. Hinchcliffe were by the fire-side, ( this was the day the notes were lost) Mr. West said to me, where do you wash your dishes? I said, don't you know? I began to gather my dishes up together, (this was after they had dined) Mr. West said, it looks creditable for servants to keep the plates and dishes clean; I gathered them together, and went out to do my dishes, he took the water off the fire, and told me it was boiling hot, and gave it me in my hand, I took it to a little narrow place, a back place, (I went through the tap-room with it) I had taken the dishes all out before: as I was stooping to wash my dishes, West came and opened the little door, which stood a jar before, he opened it a little farther, I thought he wanted to come in, he never spoke to me, nor I to him; then I went out and came round into the tap-room, and went and bolted that door, because the dog was there, as he opened the door, I thought the dog might push out and break the dishes; I never went in afterwards till I had washed my dishes, which I believe was better than half an hour, then I gathered my dishes together and carried them in, and found West and Hinchcliffe in the room where I left them, I stirred the fire, and went out directly, and did not return till the notes were missed and the outcry made.</p>

            . I have known the two prisoners at the bar for years. On the 2d or 3d of March last, it was one of them two days I can swear, that they applied to me to put off three banknotes, they knowing my business lay among the Jews in Duke's-place, and particularly one time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060035"/> of the year, just before the Passover. I am a grinder. I was grinding in Broad St. Giles's the 2d or 3d of March, between 3 and 4 o'clock, they came to me, Hinchcliffe said, you are the man we have been looking for, come here; I said, stop, Mr. Hinchcliffe, while I have done the man's knife, for he is waiting for it; after I had done it, he called me under a gate-way of the George ale-house, St. Giles's, I went there: West said to Hinchcliffe, come under the other gateway, then we went under the second gate-way that was a little farther on. Hinchcliffe said to Mr. West, Lends it. West pulled out his pocketbook and took out three papers, there came out the 6 of the hearts with it, and fell upon the ground; Hinchcliffe said, West, pick up the old gentleman; Hinchcliffe said, he had got three bank-notes, a 40 l. a 15 l. and a 10 l. and if you will get these off in Duke's-place, you shall have 7 guineas; I said, I don't understand any thing about notes; Hinchcliffe said, you shall have 8; I said, I did not understand any thing of the affair of bank-notes, and I would not trouble myself with it; I had them all in my hand, and judged they were not real bank-notes. Hinchcliffe asked me if I could read? I read them; he asked me, why I thought they were not banknotes? I said, I thought bank-notes were better paper, for these were more like gold-beater's-skin than bank-notes, I never had one in my hand before, you might blow it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the notes?</p>
               <p>Purcell. I did. Hinchcliffe said, if you will have no hand in it, ask any of your acquaintance in Duke's-place, and they shall be satisfied, and you shall have something for your trouble, and here take down the notes; (he produced a paper) I took these out with my pencil, at Hinchcliffe's own desire, as I always carry paper and a pencil about me to take directions for my work, I wrote this before the two prisoners on the back of the pocket-book. (The paper was read: 694 - 40 l. 144 - 15 l. 450 - 10 l. bank-notes.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice who they were payable to?</p>
               <p>Purcell. No, I did not take particular notice of that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are you?</p>
               <p>Purcell. I am a grinder, and go about the streets with a barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before had any transactions with the prisoners about money?</p>
               <p>Purcell. About ten months ago Hinchcliffe and I were together, there was a hundred pound not lost, and 10 l. reward offered, I said, without this comes into honest people's hands, they will never have it, if they are acquainted with any of the Jews they will change it for 10 l. less than the value. I thought they had got these notes by card-playing, I did not apprehend they had stole them.</p>
               <p>Q. If you continued positive you would have nothing to do with the notes, what could induce these men to give you the numbers and value of the notes?</p>
               <p>Purcell. The reason was, Mr. Hinchcliffe bid me speak to some of my acquaintance of the Jews, and said I should have something for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them down against your will?</p>
               <p>Purcell. I rather did against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Evans?</p>
               <p>Purcell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first read the advertisement?</p>
               <p>Purcell. I never did till since I made the information.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make your information?</p>
               <p>Purcell. That was about last Tuesday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to make that information?</p>
               <p>Purcell. The gentlemen alledge it was through spite, but I have two witnesses here, if they may be examined, who will prove to the contrary. About six or seven weeks ago Hinchcliffe called me out of the Two Brewers, Mr. Boswell keeps it, there was a soldier drunk who had pulled out three guineas and a half, or four guineas, and Hinchcliffe said he would get the woman out of the room if I would touch him; I made this reply, If you have a mind to do any thing of that sort, do it yourself, for I'll have no hand in it. He said, if West was along with me he would not give a halfpenny for what is left in the soldier's pocket. As soon as Hinchcliffe was gone I acquainted the two women of this affair, but one of them heard him herself; this came to the knowledge of Hinchcliffe again; the next time I saw him I said, How do you do Mr. Hinchcliffe? he said, d - n your stagging head. I asked him what he meant by that? he said, go along, and would not drink with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any reason at that time to think you would be a man concerned in cheating or robbing the soldier?</p>
               <p>Purcell. I apprehend it was his ignorance more than any thing else, for he knew I refused him in the notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060036"/>Q. Have you ever had any quarrel with either of them?</p>
               <p>Purcell. No, never, only Hinchcliffe was angry with me for what he called turning stag.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel between you?</p>
               <p>Purcell. He struck me at the Two Brewers without any occasion, he knocked my hat off twice as I lay with my head on the table; I said, you make yourself more free than welcome; then he came and struck me; West was there, he took hold of my hands, and said I should not sight, and Hinchcliffe struck me on the side of my face and cut my eye. One Sunderland said I was used very ill. Then they put me into the Crown Office; all this was for my speaking about the soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you speak a word about the three bank notes?</p>
               <p>Purcell. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you this paper in your pocket at that time?</p>
               <p>Purcell. I had, but I did not know who was the man that lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never declare you had a revenge against the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Purcell. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to the knowledge of the Prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Purcell. One Smith, a chimney-sweeper, and I, were drinking just by the Three Canns, and it came in discourse about the quarrels with Mr. Hinchcliffe; he mentioned a man in the Coalyard had lost three notes; I went there, but the man did not live there then, so I was directed to where he did live.</p>
               <p>West's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the matter, I declare I am innocent of all I am charged with.</p>
               <p>Hinchcliffe's Defence.</p>
               <p>So am I; I never was in the room by myself all the whole time.</p>
