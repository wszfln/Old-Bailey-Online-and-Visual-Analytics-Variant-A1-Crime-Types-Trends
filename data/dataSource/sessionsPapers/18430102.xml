                  </hi>. I am warehouseman, in the employ of John Is<lb/>may Nicholson, who has one partner. They have a wharf, called Nicholson's wharf, China and East India warehouse, near London-bridge—the prisoner had been in the prosecutor's service, and left about a fortnight before the day in question—on Saturday, the 10th of Dec. I saw him several times in the day, hanging about the premises—he was not employed there then—I thought it right to watch him, and about a quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon I was in a warehouse on the lower floor, and he was standing at the corner, in a recess in the gateway—I could command a view of his person—there is a loop-hole to every floor—I saw a bag come down from tht loop<lb/>hole on to the ground under it—the prisoner immediately picked it up, and ran away with it up the gateway, towards Thames-street—I left the wave-house, and ran, and was in pursuit of him before he got out of the yard—he saw me, and then dropped it about twenty yards from where he picked it up on the wharf—I ran across Thames-street—I saw him in Love-lane—I was unable to stop him, and having left the warehouse open, and a desk contain<lb/>ing money, I returned to the warehouse—I picked up the bag—the constable examined it in my presence—it contained black tea—there was tea in the warehouse above—I went the <hi rend="italic">same evening</hi>, about six, to where the prisoner lives, with the constable, inquired for him, but could not find him—I waited for half an hour, and he came to the door—I advanced towards him—he saw me, and ran away—I went in pursuit of him, with the constable, and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, employed by Nicholson and Co., to watch their wharf. On the 10th of Dec., about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, Lock gave me a bag containing 8lbs. of black tea—between six and seven o'clock the same evening, I accompanied him to No. 29, Lower Ber<lb/>ners-street, St. George's-in-the-East, and inquired for the prisoner—he was not at home—we waited about for about half-an-hour—I then saw the pri<lb/>soner coming up to his door—I walked from the end of the street towards him—Lock crossed over to go to him—he saw Lock, and ran away directly—I went into the road to take hold of him—he turned, and ran up a street—I followed, crying, "Stop thief,"and afterwards secured him—he asked what I wanted him for—I told him, for stealing a bag of tea that afternoon from Nicholson's wharf—he made no reply.</p>

Within three or four yards of him—I left him standing nearly opposite the prisoner's door—I went to the end of the street—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I knew he was employed in the Docks—I have endeavoured to find Nevill—I got into the house where he was one night, but he escaped behind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Nicholson and Co. On the 10th of Dec., about a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the fourth floor of the prosecutor's warehouse, and saw a bag there containing tea, lying about two yards and a half from the loop-hole—there had been a chest of black tea broken, and the tea that came out was put into the bag—one Nevill was at work near the loop-hole—he has never been seen since—the bag belongs to the prosecutors—the tea had been put into it properly—I have compared it with that in the chest—it is the same, in my judgment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, Q. Was Nevill in the employment of the prosecutors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he worked on the wharf as a lumper, and occasionally in-doors-he had been in their employment four or five years, backwards and forwards—I saw the bag about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before three—it was removed from where I had placed it—I took it up and put it on the chest it belonged to—Nevill was then sweeping the floor—I have endeavoured to find him.</p>

I went into the room—he was in debt for rent, and I had given him warning—I missed different articles when my wife fetched me up into the room—she was crying to see so many things went gone, and the prisoner gave me seventeen duplicates of my property—he said he had not done it himself, and neither did he advise it or sanction it, but he handed me the duplicates—all the bed-things were gone, they had scarcely anything but a carpet to cover them—he must have missed the articles every hour he was in the room—there were three paintings in gilt frames, a looking-glass, and all the articles mentioned in the indictment—the brass knobs were taken off the drawers, the feathers from the bed, and part of the bed-ticking gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to John Cook, of the City of London public-house, Berwick-street, St. James. At half-past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 29th of Dec., I saw the prisoner in front of the bar—I knew him before—he called for something to drink—I refused to serve him—master came, and ordered him out of the house, and he began wrangling with a cus<lb/>tomer in the bar—he was drunk—master went to turn him out—I assisted him the first time—he would not leave without being turned out—he was turned out easy the first time, not roughly—he returned in about ten minutes, and asked for Cook—he said, "I am ready for him"—Cook was in the bar parlour—he came out, and said, "Mind the stones, James," (meaning that the prisoner had something in his hand which he ought not)—the prisoner then threw a large shell at Cook's head—it missed him, and struck a large cask—Cook then went round to turn him out—I jumped over the counter, and put my left arm round his waist, to assist to turn him out—as I was doing so, his wife's sister struck me with her fist under the ear—she was in the bar—as I was turning him out, somebody opened the door, and I got him outside—as I was returning, my arm was bleeding very much, having been stabbed—my coat was off at the time—the prisoner must have wounded me, for nobody else touched me—I have been to a surgeon—my master had turned the pri<lb/>soner's wife's sister out while I was turning him out—that was after she struck me—there was a knife found on the prisoner at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 66, Wardour-street. On the evening of the 29th I examined the prosecutor's arm—it was a punc<lb/>tured wound, not to any great extent, in the upper part of the fore arm, about the middle, just to the depth of the integument, extending a little under it, a little below the skin, not touching the muscles—it was not an incised wound, but punctured, such as might be inflicted by the stem of a tobacco pipe—I do not think it such a wound as a knife would make—some little in<lb/>flammation took place the second day—I dressed it—it is going on very well—I think it will be well in two or three days—it is very little more than skin deep—the end of a screw, in his scraping against the door, might very possiby do it—I am of opinion that it was not inflicted by a sharp cutting instrument, but by a blunt-pointed substance—it is what surgeons understand by being a punctured wound—it had a lacerated, torn appearance—it appeared to have been done with considerable violence—I can hardly say it was a stab—in extent it would have admitted the point of my little finger, and passed under the skin about two inches and a half, but not dividing the skin—I think his running against any pointed iustrument would have produced it—I under<lb/>stand his arm was uncovered—the instrument might be pointed obliquely——the act of pushing might tear it along his arm.</p>

               <p>again, went to open a box, and found all my boxes broken open, and my hus<lb/>band's box empty—I had seen it three months before with three coats, five waistcoats, two pairs of breeches, and other things in it—every thing was taken out of the boxes that was worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the bonnet, shawl, and silk handker<lb/>chief were gone from the band-box, and the band-box removed into another place in the room—I found my late husband's hat-box, which had been set on fire, was on a chair in the room, but it was not alight—I found two bits of candle in the box, and a great deal of tallow round the crown of his hat, and the oil-skin burnt to a cinder—there had been no candle or tallow in it when I had seen it last—there was a bit of an apron, which belongs to the prisoner, in the room, within half a yard of where the fire was—this is it—I have seen her wear it—she had it on about a week before—she was apprehended six or seven hours after the fire, she was brought home to my door by a mob of people a little after four o'clock in the afternoon—I have seen her wear the apron more than once or twice—this cloak was in a white deal box in my room—I missed it at the time of the fire—when I saw it last it was in the white deal box, locked up, and I had the keys in my pocket—this is my husband's great-coat—I had seen that in the box not above three months before the fire—I am sure it is his, and these breeches I know to be his—they were in his box with the coats and waistcoats—it was an elm box—here is another coat which I know to be his, and which I saw about three months before in a box in the room—I have not recovered a twentieth part of my things—I never went to the store-room from the time of giving out the bedstead to the prisoner, till the fire—I kept the key of the room all the time—I had not seen the prisoner for a day or two before the fire.</p>

On Monday evening, the 12th of Dec., about half-past five o'clock or a quarter to six, I was in the kitchen with my sister Eliza, and there was a little hoy six years old also in the house—the kitchen-door was open—I heard a noise in the passage, took a candle, and went and found the prisoner in the passage, just by the side of the stairs which lead up stairs—I asked what he wanted—he appeared very much confused, and asked for a man named Davis—he said two men had come in, and he had come in after them—he did not say how they had come in—Mr. Morley, the witness, called from the parlour window that I was to keep him—he called out loud enough for the prisoner to hear—he said, "Keep the door shut, there is a thief in the house "—I do not know whether the prisoner opened the door, or whether I did, but he got out into the street—Mr. Morley caught him, and tustled with him some time, but he got away from him, and ran up Plummer-street, into the City-road—no one hallooed after him—I returned to the house, and shut the door—Morley did not go in with me at that time—I went up the stairs And saw the apron on the stairs—I went quite up the stairs, but the apron was about seven or eight stairs up—it was a woman's apron, belonging to Mrs. Warwick—I have often seen her wear it, but I cannot say when—I had been up the stairs about ten minutes before, and it was not on the stairs then—I took it up, and took it into Mrs. Warwick's room—she lodges in the house, but was out at the time—I saw her about an hour after, when she came home, and showed it to her—I went into her room with her—she lodges in the parlour, from the window of which Mr. Morley called to me—I found the apron where I had put it in her room—when I put the apron into her room the window was wide open—I had pot been into the parlour all that day before—Mrs. Warwick went out about three o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see the prisoner again for a week and three days, when he was at the station in custody—I had never seen him before he was in the house to my knowledge—I am quite positive he ki the man I saw in the passage—no person named Davis lived in the house—I know no such person—I had not seen anybody in the house but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Ratcliffe-highway, in the parish of St. George-in-the-East. The prisoner was in my service at the latter part of August as foreman, and remained up to the 4th of Dec.—about a quarter before four o'clock that afternoon I and my wife went out and left the servant Rosetta Kershaw at home with our little boy—the prisoner was not in my service then—I returned home at half-past eleven at night, and found some policemen there—I went up stairs to the front room first floor, which is my bed-room, and saw the drawers removed from their place—one was moved into the middle of the room, and the back of the chest of drawers was broken out, three bottom drawers were unlocked, but the back of them was not dis<lb/>turbed—my wife's wearing apparel was taken out of them and strewed about the floor—those drawers, I believe, had not been locked—I missed out of a small drawer at the top, which bad been locked, two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, fourteen sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns, in a purse in a sample bag—those were all in that drawer—one note was a Bank of England—the other was a London and Westmin<lb/>ster Joint Stock Bank note—I am sure they were there when I went out, as before I went out I went to the drawer—the money was in a purse in front of the drawer then, and I moved it to the back part of the drawer when I took a cravat out—I felt the money in the purse—when I missed the money I found the back part of the drawer torn to pieces—I came down stairs, went into the parlour, and found the door of a folding cupboard wrenched open, and a till which had been in it was on the table—I missed from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver from it—that was safe when 1 went out—I had locked it just before I went out—I have seen a chisel and chopper and knife since in the hands of a policeman—the chisel and chopper are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. On Sunday, the 4th of Dec., I was left in the house with the child, master and mistress being out—I was in the kitchen between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and about five minutes after six I let the prisoner in—he came to stir the sponge—he was alone—I asked if he wanted a light—he said, "Yes"—I gave him one in the bakehouse—while I was putting the light there the pri<lb/>soner was pulling out a rope from under the trough—I went up stairs to the kitchen—I went into the parlour to get some tea, when I got the tea I shut the parlour door, and left it on the latch—there are two doors to the parlour, one leading from the shop, and the other to the passage—they were both shut</p>

               <p>when I got the tea, but not locked—they were latched—just before I sat down to tea the prisoner came to me, and asked me to lend him a knife—I gave him one—he had a rope and the chopper in his hand—he went up stairs and called me, "Lucy, I want you"—I said, "What do you want John?"—he said, "Step up stairs"—I went up to the top of the stairs, and asked what he wanted—he said, "Come in here"—he was in the back attic, stand<lb/>ing with his back against the door—I went in, and said, "What do you want?"—he said, "No matter"—he came out of the room, and pulled the door after him, shutting me in—I tried to pull the door from him, and opened it some space—he told me if I made a noise he would soon be my butcher, he would soon despatch me—I called him a cruel young man, and told him he was going to take an ill advantage after master and mistress were out—he said that was what he wanted—I begged him to let me have the child with me—he said he would bring the child up—he did bring it up, opened the door a short space, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the child in, and fastened it again—I had tried to get out while he was down stairs, but could not—he went down stairs, and I heard a chopping, and after the chopping I heard the sound of gold jink—the door was fastened on me with a rope tied to the banisters and run through the key-hole—there is no lock to the door—I called out to him, and begged him to let me out—he said he would let me out in a few minutes, but if I did not keep quiet he would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me—I heard, after that, one single sound of silver jinking—I endeavoured to get the door open, and did get it open eight or ten inches, sufficient to push the child out—I got out myself at last on my knees—I pulled the door open sufficient to force myself through, and rushed into my own room—I pulled the bedstead against the door, went to the window, and called for assistance—somebody answered me from the street—a policeman afterwards came, and I went into master's bed-room with the policeman—I found the back of the drawers chopped off—the three lower large drawers were open, and mistress's wearing apparel was strewed about the room—the two top drawers were broken open, they having been locked—I had been in the bed-room about half-an-hour before I let the pri<lb/>soner in, and the things were in their proper order then—I went down with the policeman to the parlour-door leading to the passage—it was open then—I saw a candlestick which I had been using, on the corner of the parlour-table, and the knife I had lent the prisoner—the chopper was on the side-board in the parlour—I saw a till on the table with some copper in it, but no other money—there was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the table, near the till, which I put into the till after the policeman came into the room—the cupboard doors were broken open—I had dusted down the table half-an-hour before, and there was no 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it then.</p>

I live in Great Tower-street; I have also a small house and garden in Church-passage, Stepney; it has four rooms in it; my sitting-room is on the ground-floor, and there is a small bed-room over it. On the 30th of December I slept there—my wife and one of my children were with me—we were the only persons in the house that night—the house was fast<lb/>ened up when I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock—I was dis<lb/>turbed by a noise, just before nine in the morning, underneath where I slept, at a door which opens into the lower room from the garden—thinking it was my daughter who slept at Tower-street, coming to get breakfast for me, I looked out of window to call to her to wait till I came down, and saw the figure of a lad—I could not see the whole of his person—I came down stairs, and came in at the other door on the opposite side to where he was breaking in, thinking I should get down before he broke in; but when I got in I found that, while I had been coming down, he had opened the door and got in—my opening the other door caused him to run away—I looked out, and saw him running along the garden, and out of there into a passage, and then into Church-passage—that door had been fastened with a padlock on the outside—there are two doors, a front and a back—the entrance was made at what we call the front door—the padlock was wrenched off—when I saw him I shouted out, "I know you, my lad, I shall know you again," and called, "Stop thief" two or three times—I lost sight of him by his turning into Church-passage—I exa<lb/>mined, and missed a hat, my wife's bonnet, my child's bonnet, and a small shawl from the lower room.</p>

On the 14th of Dec., Williter gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay a deposit for a room, and to buy a ring—I showed it to Mrs. Edwards, a lodger in my house—I did not lose sight of it—it was not changed—I put it in my bosom—I had no other note there—I went with Williter to Messrs. Wallis and Southwold, in Parliament-street, and bought some things for her which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for them, and got change—I gave</p>

               <p>my name and address, which was written on the note in my presence—I am sure the note my name was written on was the same as I received from Williter—I took the change off the counter, and put it into Williter's purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the B division of police. On Wednesday evening, the 14th of Dec, in consequence of previous informa<lb/>tion, I was inside the house No. 12, Carpenter-street—the prisoner came to the door, and I apprehended him at the door—I told him he was charged by the witness Williter with having uttered a forged note to her—she was pre<lb/>sent at the time—I think I told him it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—I told him it was my duty to caution him that whatever he might say I must name else<lb/>where, and if he wished to say anything it was my duty to hear it—he said, "I shall say nothing at all about it," but immediately afterwards he said, "I will tell you all about it, I took it at the fight down the country" (when he knocked at the door a female opened it—he refused to come in—I was in the parlour—he could not see me—the female asked him to walk in—he declined, but asked if Ann was in—the female said, "Yes, walk in"—he de<lb/>clined to come in, and waited at the door—I went out to him) I searched him, and found on him a key, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a note addressed to Williter—he at first said his name was Henry Miles—he afterwards said his name was not Miles, that they called him <hi rend="italic">Miles's boy</hi>, but his name was Henry Eastgate—he at first said he lived at No. 5, Arundel-terrace, White Conduit-fields—I said I should go there—he then said he did not live there, but his friends re<lb/>sided there—I afterwards learnt that some notes had been found in the street, and a spot was pointed out to me in Carpenter-street, about twelve feet from No. 12, where he was apprehended—in going from the house to the station with him, I had passed that spot, but the notes lay on the right, and he was on my left—I do not think he could pass that spot on leaving the house, but in coming to it he might, or anybody standing at the door might easily have thrown them there.</p>

On Wednesday, the 21st of Dec., at a quarter after one o'clock in the morning, I was coming over Westminster-bridge, and felt unwell, and sat down on the middle recess—I heard three or four men on the opposite side—one said to the other, "Go over and see what that man is"—the prisoner was one of them I am certain—I do not know who spoke—the prisoner immediately came over, and was going to put his foot over on the footpath—I said, "You need not come, old fellow, I am not asleep"—he immediately came up, caught me by the collar of my coat, and thrust me against the wall—he was alone—he knocked me down against the wall, and took my handkerchief from my hand—he ripped the button off my coat, which was buttoned, in an attempt to pick my pocket—he thrust my coat open, and put his hand towards my breeches pocket, which was buttoned—he tried to unbutton it, I am quite sure, but he did not—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—directly he tried to do that, I got up, and in the scuffle I managed to get the handkerchief out of his hand—I saw a policeman's shiney hat down below</p>

                  </hi>. I am an actor, and live in Kenniston-street, Gibson-street, Waterloo-road. At the time in question I had no engagement—on Friday, the 16th of Dec., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I had been at the Queen's Head, Piccadilly, and was going home through Castle-street, Leicester-square, in company with a female, I met the male prisoner, in company with four more persons and the female prisoner—I was knocked down immediately by the male prisoner—I had not spoken to him or to either of them—no words had been exchanged between my companion and them—I received the blow on the left temple, which felled me to the ground—the four others, who made their escape, seized hold of me by the arms and legs—my hat was knocked off—the female prisoner laid hold of me by the hair at the back of my head, and pulled me along the stones—they attempted to rifle my pockets, but could not find which pocket I had my sil<lb/>ver in—here is the coat I had on, which is torn—they put their hands into my pockets—I was as silent as I possibly could be—I had about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of halfpence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301020033"/>
               <p>in the pocket of the coat, which was torn—they were taken, and I had two keys with the halfpence—one was the key of my box, and the other a very small key of my theatrical dressing-case, which was not taken out of my pocket, being so small, but the large key was taken out by the male pri<lb/>soner—I saw him take it out while I was on the ground—the other four were holding me at the same time, and the female by the hair of my head—the female who was with me immediately went in search of a policemen—I was not on the ground more than a minute before a policeman came up with her—the male prisoner at that time had left me, and was standing at the corner of a court—the other four had made their escape—the policeman took the male prisoner into custody—after he was taken I picked up the key off the stones at the place where I was knocked down—it was the key the male prisoner had taken from my pocket—I am sure I had the halfpence about me, and had not parted with them before I was knocked down—I did not men<lb/>tion the halfpence before the Magistrate, because I could not swear he took them out, though I swear he took the key out—I did not see the halfpence taken from me, but am sure I had them about me at the time I was knocked down—the young woman I was with was a stranger to me—I saw her going towards Waterloo-bridge when I left the Queen's Head.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301020034"/>
               <p>and I said I had some halfpence, but would say nothing about that, because I could not swear they were taken from me—I cannot swear they were taken from me at that time.</p>

Mr. Phillips, who was a stranger to me, was going home, and I was walking with him through Bear-street, Leicester-square, which leads to Castle-street—the male prisoner was walking along behind us very quickly—he came along the front, suddenly turned round, and knocked Mr. Phillips down—the female prisoner was in his com<lb/>pany—after he knocked Mr. Phillips down, four men came across the way from the corner of Castle-street, and came round Mr. Phillips—the female pulled him by the hair of his head—I was frightened, and went at once for a police<lb/>man—I could not see what the other men did—I found policeman C 59—the four men who surrounded him went along Bear-street, as quick as they could, towards Leicester-square—as soon as they saw the policeman, the prisoners went across the road to the corner of St. Martin's-court, and stood there—when the policeman came up the male prisoner came across the road, and I said, "That is the man that knocked Mr. Phillips down"—he is the person, I am certain—the policeman took him—I did not hear him make any observation to the constable—the woman was not taken till the next morning at the office.</p>

I have got no chain"—I pulled him off the wall—he struck me two or three times—Seymour then came behind me, pulled the skirts of my coat, pulled me away, and they both escaped—I sprang my rattle—sergeant Walker came up—I described the prisoners to him, and he apprehended Barnes—about seven in the morning I went down to the wharf, and saw Seymour on a boat in Pad<lb/>dington-basin—I told him I should take him for being in company last night with a man who had some chain—he said he had been in bed all night, I must be mistaken, he was not the man—I took him.</p>

I was at home on the 5th of Dec., in the early part of the morning, but I went out to spend the day—the prisoner did not on that day give me this cheque, or account to me for the produce of it—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the amount of it on the 6th, on account of Mr. Hart—the amount of Mr. Hart's bill that week was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remember the policeman coming to our house—I was ill in bed—I saw Haines on the Sunday morning before Christmasday—the pri<lb/>soner slept in a room adjoining the kitchen on the basement—it would be his duty to receive letters, if any came, for Mr. Hart—he gave me no notice of his</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the A division of police. On Sun<lb/>day, the 18th of Dec., in consequence of information I went to the house of Miss Proctor, and was shown into a room on the basement, next the kitchen, said to be the prisoner's room—I there found these two books—I produced these books before the prisoner at the station on Friday the 27th, and he said this with the yellow cover was his book, and the other was not his, but he was going to have some fresh leaves put into it—I saw the prisoner write this note—having seen him write this note, I can form a belief as to the hand<lb/>writing of this 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I believe the cheque to be the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing—there are several of the letters very remarkable as well as the figures—I have likewise a letter sent to his wife, which he acknowledged to be his handwriting—I got it from his wife—he told me he had written to her—I showed it to him, and said, "Is this the letter you wrote?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Is this your handwriting?"—he said, "Yes"—I have compared that and the cheque together, and have not the least doubt whatever that the cheque is his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Snowley, who keeps the King and Queen public-house, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green. There is a bar in the house, and at the back of it is what we call a company parlour—there is a cupboard in the bar, the back of which forms a partition of the company parlour—it is also lined with sheet iron—we are in the habit of keeping our cash there in a cash-box—on Thursday, the 22nd of Dec., I was in the bar, and while there all the prisoners came in together, and appeared to be companions—they merely ordered what they wanted—they did not speak as they passed through—they went into the company parlour—that was the first time I saw them—before they went into the parlour they ordered a pot of half-and-half, and remained there nearly an hour—I did not see them go away—next day, about a quarter after ten o'clock in the morning, they came again, and ordered a pot of half-and-half, and went into the company parlour—it was very unusual to have any body in that parlour so early, and there was nobody but them there that morning—they remained there about two hours and a half, and then we heard, apparently, a scratching in the cup<lb/>board—I and my sister were sitting together in the bar—we thought at first it was a cat—we looked more than once, but found no cat—we heard the same noise the second time, and again looked for the cat, and felt for her, but there was no cat—after that we heard a crash of wood splitting—my sister opened the cupboard, and I took out the cash-box, and I saw a light through the back of the cupboard—if it had been as usual no light would have been observable—I took the cash-box away, and put it on the sofa—I then saw the prisoner Jones hurrying out of the parlour to the front of the bar—he brought a pipe, and asked me to fill it—he looked towards the cupboard— after I had filled his pipe he went back into the parlour—I communicated to my husband what I had heard—when Jones looked towards the cupboard it was shut—I had shut it after taking out the cash-box—Jones had frequently been to the bar before, and had asked for change for half-a-sovereign, which I took out of the cash-box in the cupboard, and put the half-sovereign into the cash-box—he saw me put it into the cupboard.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ about two months—I have two houses in Bridgewater-square, which had been lately built—I had to do the plumbing, painting, and papering—there was a man and his wife taking care of the premises—I generally took the white lead in my cart, for the supply of the job—the prisoner was employed to work on the premises—there was a can there for the purpose of taking white lead to the job—my apprentice generally used to put the white lead up, and get it ready for me to take down in the morning—I took a pot of white lead down, weighing 28lbs.—I used to leave the prisoner, and had the white lead sent to him there, to use at the place—on the 13th of Dec. I looked at a white lead firkin, and noticed there wan deficiency—I made inquiries, and afterwards went to the job—I received in<lb/>formation there, which I communicated to the police—I went at five o'clock the same afternoon to Ann-street, Pentonville—I saw the prisoner there—I told him I had missed a quantity of white lead, and had every reason to be<lb/>lieve he had taken it—I said, "Perhaps you will permit me to look over your premises?"—he said, "If you wish to search my premises you may get a search warrant"—he shut the door—I waited about for a quarter of an hour—he then opened the door, and said, "Now you may search if you like"—I went to the station, and got a policeman—I came back, searched, and found the can, which I generally used in taking the white lead from my shop to the job, near the water-butt, in the yard—this is the can—it is mine—I found no white lead—he said he was going to take the can to the shop, to get white lead to use the next morning; but there was a sufficient quantity there—he need not have gone to the shop for white lead.</p>

I was on duty at Shepperton—I saw Norcott come out of the farm yard belonging to Mr. John Saunders, of Shepperton—I asked what he had been doing—he said he had been to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Jiggle to order some barge horses for Mr. Mason—I allowed him to pass—he had nothing with him—he was going towards London—on turning from him I saw two more men come out of the same gate—one of them I took into cus<lb/>tody, but being stronger than me he made his escape—I believe the one I did not take to be Humphreys—the man I caught had two large bundles, and the other man, who I believe to be Humphreys, had a smaller bundle—after the man escaped, I took the bundles he dropped back to Mr. Saunders—the man, who I believe to be Humphreys, dropped his bundle, and it was picked up later in the morning—one of the bundles I took up contained a goose and a turkey—the other a goose and a fowl—I have the legs of them here—I traced Humphreys to Weybridge, between nine and ten in the morning—I after that went to Egham, found both the prisoners together there, and took them.</p>

On the 1st of Dec., about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of some information, I went to Mr. Lampson's counting-house, in Queen-street-place—I made a communication to him—he gave me directions what to do, in consequence of which I watched the two prisoners—about five the same evening I saw Bebell going into Mr. Lampson's counting-house—he had a box under his arm—he came out alone in about ten minutes—he then had nothing—he crossed Queen-street-place from the right-hand side to the left hand, and went towards Blackfriars—he set off to run, and looked round all the time—I do not know that he saw me—I know the premises of a man named Bresler, in Bell-yard, Doctors' Commons—I went directly to Bell-yard, and waited there about ten minutes, and then Bebell came with a blue bag in his hand, from Doctors' Commons through Bell-yard—I stood in a narrow passage—he passed Bresler's—I followed him into Dean's-court, which goes into St. Paul's churchyard—when he got about twenty yards off, Prior was standing on the left-hand side of the court, and Bebell held him over the bag—I caught hold of it, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Nothing, nothing," and Bebell tried to run away—I catched hold of him—Prior was very quiet—he held the bag in his hand—I caught hold of him, and called, "Police, police"—Bebell said, "Take it, take it, come in the dark and settle it "—another gentleman came up, and assisted me in taking one of the prisoners—Prior said, "This spoils our trade"—the policeman came up, and I delivered them into custody.</p>

I never, to my knowledge, saw Sherwinski till the 1st of December—he called on me that day, and made a communication to me—I gave him directions to watch the prisoners—Bebell was superintendent of my warehouse—he received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, and had accumulated between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he placed in my hands—I mentioned that to the Magistrate—it has since been restored to him</p>

               <p>—Prior was foreman in the deer-skin warehouse—he had been six or seven years in my service—it was Bebell's business to see that the warehouse was secure after the others left—his father is locker of the warehouses for the Go<lb/>verment, and he introduced me to his son—some time before the 1st of Dec. I found one of the warehouses with the lock off—these skins (<hi rend="italic">looking at then</hi>) are marten-skins—they come from America, in casks, tightly headed up—I had casks of these in my warehouse previous to the 1st of Dec.—I had taken the last cask from the bonded warehouse on the Monday or Tuesday before, and opened it—the skins were counted out by me that evening—Bebell was with me alone—about five or six o'clock, on Thursday evening, the 1st of Dec., I was sent for to the station in Smithfield—I found the blue bag and skins there—I thought I could recognise them as what I had handled on the Tuesday before—this wrapper round them is precisely the same sort of paper which we put coney wool in, and when I first saw it there was a little lock of coney wool on it—I asked Bebell how he came in possession of the skins—he said Mr. Bresler left them at the warehouse, to take to his house, about a quarter before four o'clock—I afterwards saw Prior—he said Bebell gave him the skins to take up Thames-street, and said he would follow—he said Bebell had taken them out of his box or cupboard, or from under the cupboard, and given them to him—Bebell had a cupboard between two of the bonded ware-houses, of which he kept the key—I had forbidden Bebell some time ago to have skins at all about him, or to be seen with them, unless he was ordered by me—I was not aware that he had any in his cupboard—I never had access to it—after that I went with the policeman to Bresler's—the policeman found him—I waited outside—he was asked, in presence of Bebell, if he owned these skint, and if he had given them to Bebell—he said he had not—I pointed to Bresler, and asked Bebell if he was the man that gave him the skins—he said, "Yes"—Bresler said, "No"—to the best of my belief, these four skins, found in the cupboard, that are in the blue bag, are not part of my stock—I think they are so peculiar, that if they had passed through my hands, I should have remembered them—the next morning I went to look at the skins which had been taken out of the barrel by me and Bebell two or three days before—I found twenty-six skins that I thought had been substituted for mine, and three or four of which I was doubtful—on Thursday, the 1st of Dec., I was at the warehouse, at ten minutes to four o'clock—the lockers are in the habit of turning us off at four, and I looked at my watch to see the time—Bresler did not come that day, that I saw—Bebell, I think, was engaged in the room opposite to mine, down to ten minutes to four o'clock, with a man named Davis—I think he was waiting on him when I left—I have public sales it my warehouse—Bresler deals in skins—I think he bought some in March last from my broker—these skins are not part of those bought by him in March last—the twenty-six skins I found in the cask were very bad ones, worth about half-a-crown or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—the others were worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I examined the cask I had some difficulty in getting the skins out—I tore one considerably, which is not here, but here is one I tore—I received this letter, and handed it over to my attorney.</p>

               <p>there joined by Robins—they appeared to know each other, and were talking and walking together—they went down Alie-street, and into Rupert-street, where they turned up a passage, which is the back way to the King of Prussia public-house—they were in the passage a few minutes, and then came out—I followed Robins to Rosemary-lane, and when he got near his own house I said to him, "Are you going home?"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Fogg"—I said, "I am going home with you"—we went in, and he went up stairs—I went up after him—I said, "You have got some tobacco about you, give it to me"—he said, "Yes, I have"—he pulled off his coat, and I took about a pound of tobacco out of each pocket—he then pulled off his hat, and said, "You may as well have the rest," or, "You may as well have all of it"—I took the rest of this tobacco from his hat—I asked where he got it—he said he bought it of a man for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but did not know his name, nor where he lived—I asked if he knew Cullum—he said he did not—I asked what he did up the passage of the King of Prussia—he said he went to see if anybody was playing at skittles—I took him to the station, and then went to the passage, where I picked up two or three small bits of tobacco—I took them and what I found on Robins to Mr. Huxley's shop, and after I had been there some time, Cullurn came in—I called him into the counting-house, searched him, and found two or three small bits of tobacco in one of his pockets—I asked what he was doing up the back way of the King of Prussia—he said he was not there—I said he was there with Robins or Rawlins—he said he never knew him—all the tobacco I found was 2 1/41bs.</p>

"236 and 237" on them, and "I M A "—they are the covers of the two bales I had there—I saw the wool at the station—it divided itself into two complete bales—I saw them put into these covers, and they fitted exactly—I saw the wool weighed—it corresponded with the weight of these two bales that I have in my books—one, No. 236, weighed 1cwt. 3qrs. 17lbs.; the other, No. 237, 1cwt. 3qrs. 2lbs.—I found a wrapper round the wool as the policeman found it—I cannot swear to it—I have 100 such about my premises—that wool has not been repacked—it had been on public sale, consequently one end has been pulled out—they pull out an immense mass of it at the end which has been on show—it had been sold, but I think they must have escaped the recol<lb/>lection of the party, as they have never been fetched away—Alger had been in my service seven or eight years—he left my service on the 10th of Dec.—I have heard that he and Scott are brothers-in-law—I have no means of know<lb/>ing that they are so—the wool is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerks hire labourers—I have heard that Scott has been employed occasionally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Henry Pounce—we live in Ed<lb/>ward-street, Portman-square. On Friday night, the 16th of Dec., I was in Park-street, Dorset-square, between six and seven o'clock—I saw the pri<lb/>soner soner and two other persons—the prisoner was the middle one of the three—when I left home I had a purse in my pocket, containing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, with the name of Mrs. Gilby on it, four sovereigns, and six half-sovereigns—I had seen it safe not two hours before I left home—while I was walking in Park-street, I felt a push down at the bottom of my pocket—I went on a step or two, and put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I then turned round, and saw the prisoner and the other two walking straight abreast away towards the bottom of the street, and the prisoner was the middle one of the three—when I turned round the prisoner spoke to the other two—he turned, and saw me following them—I saw the one on the right hand turn round his face a little as it he was going to have a sight of me, and immediately they all made a very quick pace forwards, abreast—when I first turned round after I felt the push, they were twenty yards from me, if not more, and they were then going forwards—I had not seen them before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you said anything to the prisoner before he said that, or had you said anything that he might have heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called to the policeman to take those men, and he said, "What have they done?"—I said, "They have robbed me"—they could all hear it—they were close by—when I said that, the prisoner ran—the policeman ran after him and took him while running—when I turned round after I felt this push at my pocket, there was no person near me but those three, and when the prisoner was brought back to the baker's shop, before I had said anything to him, he said, "You are mistakes, I was walking alone."—I said, "You was not walking alone, there were three of you, and you was the middle one of the three, there was one on your right hand, and one on your left"—the prisoner said nothing to that—a coach<lb/>man then came into the baker's shop, and said, "That is not the man you want, that one has gone round the corner, I heard the money rattle in his pocket"—I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing when he heard that said.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it a card similar to this?—(<hi rend="italic">producing one.)

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and now live at No. 21, Albion-street. I lodged at No. 10, in that street—I entered on the 28th of Nov.—I saw a bill in the window, and I was ordered to be in that street, on account of my daughter Sybella Jane Baker who is very ill, and cannot come here—I went to No. 10, and the prisoner Garner opened the door—I conversed with her about the lodgings, and agreed upon some terms—she said her name was Holt—I did not see Holt at all—I wrote this paper, and I asked that it should be signed—Garner said she could not write, but she would take it to her husband to sign—she took it, and brought it back signed "M. Holt"—on the 28th I entered in possession of the lodging—I had my daughter's things put into her room, and mine into mine—there was an eye-glass, a bracelet without a clasp, some silk, two bags, some parcels of cord, some braid, and woollen-cloth, belonging to my daughter—there was a cork-screw belonging to me—it was kept in a bag in my room—it was only used by me, not in common—from time to time I missed some things—in consequence of a communication made to me by my daugh-ter, I made a search—we searched for the bags and every article in them, on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at Boyle's Court Guide-office, in Regent-street. On the 23rd of Dec. I went to Mrs. Holt's house during the time the policeman was in the house—after they had left the house, Holt told me she had found the glass in the rubbish-drawer, but the girl had not given it to her, but to prevent the girl getting into trouble she would wish to put it out of the way—we went down stairs, and Mrs. Holt asked me what she should do—I told her, possibly, as she had denied all knowledge of the glass to the officer and lady, it might be advisable if she could place it in the lodg<lb/>ing which Mrs. Baker had originally occupied—Holt said she thought it would not be advisable, because, by so doing, it would show the glass was in the house, and would coincide with the statement the girl had made of having given her the glass—I then asked her where the property was—she said in</p>

               <p>the register of the front-parlour-stove—she again asked me if it would not be advisable to place the glass in a box which she believed had not been ex<lb/>mined by the policeman, and which was in the room, under the bed—she then placed the eye-glass in a piece of cloth, and placed it in the box—after that she altered her mind, and proposed that the handkerchiefs should be de<lb/>stroyed, and whether, if the eye-glass were put down the water-closet, it would effectually keep it out of the way—I advised her not to destroy the property—I was then speaking in presence of her son—she took the eye-glass out of the box, and brought it into the kitchen, and thought it still advisable to de<lb/>stroy them; but sooner than have them destroyed I agreed to take them away—she gave me the eye-glass, and told me to go to the pump in the passage, and look inside, I should find two handkerchiefs—I went, and found two handkerchiefs—I had called at the house in the first week in Dec., and saw Mrs. Holt there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 301.) My beat is in the parish of Wan<lb/>stead, in Essex. At twelve o'clock, on the night of the 19th of Dec., I heard a dog barking in the direction of South-lane, adjoining Wanstead-park, which belongs to Mr. Boyle—I went there, and stood and listened—I heard a noise in the direction of Blake-hall, which belongs to Mr. Brown, as though some per<lb/>sons were bustling in amongst some bushes—I got over the pales, and went on till I came to a wall that runs between the park and Mr. Brown's premises—I could then hear the same noise—I stood by the wall on the park side for half a minute till I heard as though some person was climbing a tree—I jumped on the top of the wall, and saw the prisoner Brooks come within about three yards of me, through some laurel shrubs, on Mr. Brown's premises—he came as though he was on the look-out—he turned his head and saw me, and, went back again through the shrubs—this was at the back front wall of the premises—I then crossed from the first path into the second—(Brooks was then running away from me) and went to a holly-tree, which was amongst some shrubs—I went under the tree, and saw Emmerton on the tree in the act of cutting the holly—(I knew both the prisoners well before)—I found a great many branches cut from the tree—some were tied up in a bundle, pretty nearly as large as a man could carry, and some were loose about under the tree—Emmerton was cutting them either with a knife or a saw—I saw his arm in motion—I said, "Halloo, what do you do here? come down"—he did not speak, but after a time he came down—I caught him by the collar, and we had a long struggle together, for I suppose ten minutes—I said, "It is no use, I know you very well, you had better go with me quietly," and he consented to go to the house with me—I went towards Mr. Brown's house, and when I got him within about twenty yards I met Mr. Brown's servant, who opened a door, and I took Emmerton through the door which led to the gardener's house—when I got him inside I took the handcuffs out, and Em<lb/>merton said he would not be handcuffed—I could not do it myself—I charged Mr. Brown's two servants to aid me, and I took him into, custody—</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. William Brown. I was alarmed in the course of that night by the dog barking and the noise of the rattle in the garden—I got up, looked out of the window, and saw the officer with Em<lb/>merton in charge—I went down, and let the officer and Emmerton in, and Mr. Brawn's groom—I saw the place where the holly had been cut—it is on the left-hand side of the back front of the house—the tree stands on the border in amongst the plantation—it could be seen from the window of the house—there was as much cut off it as two men could carry—I should say the injury done to the tree would amount to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a large holly tree—it stood about fourteen or fifteen feet high.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been a gardener? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These last twelve months—I have not had much experience as a gardener—I was a groom before that, but I nad been a gardener before I was a groom—I know about as much of horses as I do of holly—I have not had many hollies to do with in my life—I have planted two or three score—I never bought any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know, as a gardener, that a holly loses its beauty when it grows up to a height, and is it not straggling and unsightly when it doet not cleave to the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This tree was in good health—I know the leaves cease to grow at the lower part when a tree grows up high—cutting tree will make it sprout out and become bushy below in the course of time—that is the effect of cutting trees in general—this tree was somewhat cut down—I think the part that remained was damaged to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wanstead. This tree was in my back garden—it was so placed as to be quite exposed to view—the damage done to it is considerable—twenty guineas would not replace it—they have cut down the main stems and main top branches and the leading branches—there were three or four kinds of holly on it—it was from eighteen to twenty feet high—it was a very valuable tree—I believe the prisoners live in the neighbourhood, but I do not know them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you are speaking as a man of taste as to the value of the tree? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, not its intrinsic value—I could not replace it at any price—the house is my dwelling-house, and is in the middle of the garden—I can walk out of my dining-room to this tree directly, without going through any palings or gate—it belonged to me, and is in my garden—I should say Lord Wellesley has no claim on it whatever—I pay my rent to that family—I have a lease of my premises—I did not plant the tree—I have the use of it, and I suppose I am to leave it to the Wellesley family—I should not feel myself justified in cutting it down—I could not sell it without their consent.</p>

On the night of the 14th of Feb., 1839, my shop was robbed—it was left locked at dusk that night—my son locked it—I was with him at the time, and I took the key and hung it up behind some timber, where it was con<lb/>cealed—there was considerable property of mine in the shop—it was left safe between six and seven o'clock—my man went the next morning, and I had lost a mortise-guage, two hand-saws, a 3-foot rule, and other things—I took out a search-warrant, I think about the 26th, and the officer went to the pri<lb/>soner's house and found some things, but I did not go with him—the property that was found was mine, it had been safe in my shop, and was stolen at the same time as the others—the property that was found is not here—it was pat into the hands of the inspector of the Lee police, and he has ab<lb/>sconded—I am able to say it was my property—there were two gimlets, and a mortise-guage, and two saws, which belonged to a man of mine, but they were in my shop—the place where they were found belonged to the prisoner—it was not far from my shop—the prisoner worked for me—I have seen him and his wife there, and know they lived there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and an agent to Mr. William Carpen<lb/>ter, who resides at Greenwich. On Thursday afternoon, the 1st of Dec., about three o'clock, I was returning home from collecting orders, and I saw Mr. Carpenter's wagon in the Kent-road—it was standing still opposite the prisoner's house, and the prisoner was standing at his door—Johnson, who was tried here last Session, was the wagoner, and had charge of the wagon—I saw a man whom I did not know, carrying a sack of flour from the wagon to the prisoner's house, and the prisoner was looking on at the time—I saw Johnson beckon with his finger, and the man then crossed the road with the sack of flour—the man went into the house, and Onions followed him, and johnson went in after him—I drove up to the door, and had some conversa<lb/>tion with Johnson—in consequence of what passed between him and me, I went down stairs into the bakehouse, and found the flour shot out of the sack into a trough, and the flour that was left by the side—Onions was sweeping it up into the trough—I asked where the ticket was for that sack of flonr—John<lb/>son said he had not got one—I said I would not suffer the flour to be left, unless they could produce me the ticket—Johnson said Onions had given an order at the mill for the flour—I said I would have them both into custody, as they could not produce the ticket—Onions said, if I liked to leave the floor, he would pay me for it—I said no, I did not want the money, I would have him—I went up stairs, and sent my boy for a policeman—during that time Onions and Johnson put the flour back into the sack, an I said I would have it pot up again—when I took the wagon back I found in it thirty-two sacks, thirty sacks of flour, and one of meal—a man may make a mistake in the sacks put in, but the person who saw these things put in and checked them is still in our employ—he has not been charged—when a person orders flour, he goes to the counting-house and orders it—if he pays for it he gets a ticket out of the ticket-book—if he does not pay, le has a ticket out of a delivery-book; and when he gets it he signs the other ticket that he has received it—we cut the ticket off at the counting-house, and there is a ticket to ihow what they have—if the ticket is delivered to the wagoner, he takes the proper de<lb/>livery-ticket and gets the flour for it, the customer receives it and signs for what he has received—Onions was not at this time a credit customer to Mr. Carpenter—he had been several years ago—the prisoner has been accus<lb/>tomed to pay the money at the mill before be has had his goods, and gone to the mill and taken the flour with him in his own cart—Johnson had no autho<lb/>rity to deliver flour in this way, which had not been paid for, and, to my knowledge, Onions was perfectly acquainted with this course of business—when a person receives flour, he receives a delivery-ticket, and signs the other part to show that he has received it—Johnson produced, in Onions's presence at Camberwell station, delivery-tickets for thirty sacks of flour and one of meal, as the only tickets he had, except some which had been signed on previous days—when a ready-money customer goes and gives an order at the counting-house, he gets a ticket, and gets the flour, and takes the ticket home with him, and that was what Onions had done—we never allow anything to go without it—this sack had Mr. Carpenter's name on it.</p>
