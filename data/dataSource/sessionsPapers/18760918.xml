As a married man and have been so to that lady whom you saw for thirty-three years, I feel disgusted to confess that she has not told you a hundredth part of her infamy; with respect to the document her man showed you. I pronounce it a forgery, so well she knows—should you desire to have proof I will pay all your expenses and take you to certain houses where she has committed herself. They were compelled to leave their den of infamy called the Green Man, Price's Street, Blackfriars, in consequence of giving barmen false characters, the truth of which you can ascertain by reading Tuesday's paper, where you will find one convicted and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. They were likewise turned from a house in Brick Lane, in consequence of her disgraceful conduct, the truth of which you can ascertain from inquiries in the neighbourhood. Dear sir, should they continue in your house your place would be a scene of riot every day. Yours respectfully, S. Garcia. P.S.—A fellow living with them is a married man who has deserted his wife and lives by defrauding the public") (<hi rend="italic">The document referred to in the letter was signed S.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was engaged with Marony, another officer, to watch the premises of Mr. Bumpus, 13 and 14, Milk Street—on Friday, 18th August, about 1 o'clock, I was in Milk Street, opposite the warehouse—Dance was employed there—I saw Williams and Barker, and a man named Toby waiting at the end of Clements Court, opposite the ware-house—Dance came from No. 13 and 14, and the two prisoners and Toby crossed the road, and they had a conversation together for a minute or two—Dance then went back to the warehouse alone, followed shortly after<lb/>wards by Toby—Williams and Barker remained outside, in about five minutes Dance came out followed by Toby, who appeared to be very bulky in the chest—they went down Aldermanbury together, till they came to Fountain Court—they simply looked in the direction of Williams and Barker, and passed on—Toby left Dance and went through. Fountain Court along Basinghall Street, and they met again in Milton Street—about half<lb/>way down Milton Street, Toby turned round, looked in our direction and ran away through a court; I have never seen him since—I followed Dance to his lodging, 6, Lambs Passage, Chiswell Street—he went round White-cross Street, and met us—we went up and searched his room and found some pieces of linen, not any of these pieces of lawn—I took him back to the warehouse, about 2.30 I found Williams and Barker standing in the passage—Barker had got this piece of canvas over his arm—Dance said "Those are the two men I spoke to you about"—Williams said "We don't know you, we have just run in here out of the wet"—it was not raining and had not been for sometime—I took the three prisoners up into the warehouse and waited until Mr. Bumpus came, in half or three quarters of an hour, and Dance said in their presence "I will tell you all about it"—he stated it first in private to me and Mr. Bumpus; I said it reflected upon the other two, and they must come in and hear it, and they did come in and Dance in their presence made this statement to Mr. Bumpus, which I took down. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "About a week after coming to you I met these two men, and two men not in custody, in the City Road; they asked me where I was working, I told them that I was working in Milk Street, and that I sometimes had the keys of the place; they said 'You ought to let me have samples of those keys." I said 'Who is <hi rend="italic">they,"</hi> he pointed to the two prisoners and continued: "I said I don't know about that; they said well, can you get us any stuff; he said you can come up and see; the four of them came, and I gave them a quantity of stuff; they came the next day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180015"/>
               <p>and I gave them some more; they came another day and I gave them some more, and that was all the transactions that I had with Williams up to the present, but Barker and the other two men have been a number of times, and I have given them stuff on each occasion. Last Wednesday Barker came up and I gave him a quantity of muslins; I had nothing for the first transaction.") I forget the sums he mentioned as having received afterwards—he said "On Wednesday night I met Barker at Islington, and I waited out<lb/>side a street near Albert Terrace, and he brought me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mr. Bumpus said "How did they know I was not at home"—Dance said "I used to write on a piece of paper like this 'Come up and take,' and take it down to them, and that signified that Mr. Bumpus was out"—he said "I don't remember that I have got anything more to say now"—I then said to Barker "You have heard what he has said with regard to you"—Barker laughed and said it was all wrong—I then said to Williams "You have heard what he has said with regard to you"—Williams said "Yes, let me ask him a question. Did I ever take any stuff?"—Dance said "No, but you used to come up with Barker, and he used to take it and you bad a share of the money"—he said "Coming up and having share of the money is nothing; did I ever-take any stuff?"—Dance said "No"—we then took them to the station; nothing was found on them; they gave addresses, but I could learn nothing of them there.</p>

I live at Shepperton—on 4th September, about 9.15 p.m., I was going home, and saw three men near Doomsday Stile—the prisoner was one of them, he had a straw hat, the others had black hats—I went over the stile into the meadow, and when I had gone about 200 yards the prisoner passed me about 4 yards, and then turned round and hit me a blow on my forehead with his fist, and I fell on my back—I struggled to get up, but he took a stick from my little grandson and com<lb/>menced beating me over my head and arms—I was knocked down again twice, and was very much hurt, you can see the bruises now—I screamed "Murder!" and put up my arms to save my head, and received the blows on my arms—I begged him to leave me alone—I got up in a stooping position, and he struck me a blow on the back of my head and knocked me down again—I lost my senses, and when I recovered, I went to the Cricketers—I found the stick and gave it to my little boy—it was a large withy stick—I had a basket with a candle in it, and a clasp-knife and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a coachman found the basket next morning, but I have never seen the money or the knife since—a doctor attended me till last Saturday, he is not here—this was on a Monday night, and on the Wednesday I was sent for to the station and saw ten men standing together—the prisoner is one of them, and I identified him as the man who robbed me, he was wear<lb/>ing a straw hat—my grandson was with me all the time—there are several gaps in the fence which runs by the pathway in the field.</p>

Don't be afraid, my friend, I will pay you, and do all I can. I am, &amp;c., George Powlesland."

What I have stated arises from what I learn in the counting-house—I cannot tell you the amount of money drawn for in October last, or how much in bills was met in October, November, or December, or in the months between December, and the time of this enquiry—the terms of 1 1/4 and a clear month include transactions from the 20th of one month to the 20th of the next, dated from the 1st of the. following, so that if a person bought on 21st October, that would go into December—the draft would date from 1st November—I believe from our business transactions with Powlesland, we gave references in his favour, that he was a responsible man, thoroughly businesslike, honourable and straightforward—I cannot say whether it was in writing, or by word of mouth—It was to persons to whom he applied to sell him goods-up to the very moment of his running away in May, we believed him to be so—I do not know when the last money were received from him—I believe he was never represented to us as a defaulter for not meeting his bills.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer H</hi>). About 1 o'clock on the morning of the 20th August I was passing through the Commercial Road, with Detective Newman, when there was a very heavy thunder storm and it was raining very heavily-as we passed from the south side of the Commercial Road to the north, there was a very vivid flash of lightning—I heard a struggle, and looked round and saw the prisoners struggling—I rushed to where they were and caught hold of Murphy and Curtis—I saw an old man there, and I said to him" What have they done?"-Newman at the same time caught hold of Robinson—he said "They have robbed me, and taken my few half-pence"—they said "All right; Mr. Foster, we have done nothing"-Newman called "Police!" and another constable came up and I handed Curtis over to him—I heard something drop—I had Murphy in custody, and he turned round to the old man, and said "You old be you ought to be pole-axed"—I said "That a nice thing to say; to rob a man, and then say 'you ought to be pole-axed'"—he said "I shall get off with 'six months"-when we got to the station, the prosecutor made the charge, that he had lost 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In coppers—the handkerchief found on Robinson by Newman, and the papers, he identified as his property before the prisoners, and he charged them and attended at the police-court, and gave evidence there—I have since then made inquiries as to where he is, and have received some information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was very dark until the flash of lightning-that was the first that attracted my notice—I was about 5 or 6 yards off them we were crossing the road in a slanting direction—they were standing on the pavement close to a doorway—I searched Murphy—I did not see any<lb/>thing of the halfpence that the prosecutor was robbed of—I was holding the two, and did not look for anything that dropped—I went back the next morning and looked down the area-two of them were standing over the grating, an iron grating, let into the pavement.</p>

I was with Foster when the prisoners were taken into custody-a vivid flash of lightning came, we were hurrying home—I saw a tussle among three or four people immediately after the lightning—I saw Murphy and Curtis holding the old gentleman, each one holding an arm, Robinson was rifling his pockets, and I could see the left pocket of the old gentleman turned inside out-Foster caught hold of two and me the third, and we pushed them all three up against the shutters in a row—I said to the old gentleman "We are policemen and they are thieves," and the old gentleman said "You don't mean that, you are companions of theirs"—he appeared doubtful as to whether we were or not, and I repeated it again, and he said "Oh; thank God, I thought they would have killed me "-while holding them up against the shutters, I saw Robinson drop something on the pavement—I picked up these pieces of rag and these papers, and Murphy said "Look here, don't you put anything in my pocket"—I said "If you talk to me in that manner I will put my knee in your belly"—I then called out" Police "-we took the three to the station—I did not hear the prosecutor say what he had lost; I assisted him-we got to the police-station and the charge was made in the presence of the prisoners, of stealing 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers from the old gentleman—I showed him these memorandums and asked him if he could recognise them, and he said "Yes, they ought to be in my pocket"—I told him in the prisoners' presence where I picked them up—I searched Robinson's tail pocket where I found these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which the old gentleman said</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bar keeper ran out in a hurry to close the bar the action of holding up his hand was hardly distinguishable from that of pushing the bar—I have driven horses for five years, and I believe I am a judge of pace—It was impossible for him to pull up his horse and avoid the accident, considering the short notice he received from the bar keeper-the van was I should think 12 yards at the utmost from the open space when the barkeeper ran out—the man was hidden by the sentry-box, and I could not see him till he was in front of the bar—I cannot say whether the flourish of the whip was as he was trying to pull up, but, as a rule, they flourish the whip to stop anything—I took it as a signal that there was danger ahead the bringing the whip down would be done by bringing his hand on to the reins-as the van passed the bar the prisoner pulled on one side—I did not notice whether the horse went faster when the bar struck his chest-when the van had got some distance down Pont Street, I saw the boy speak to the driver, and as soon as the boy spoke to him he pulled up-a gentleman, whose name I do not know, was a dozen yards from the van, when it stopped but he did not stop it, and he and the prisoner came back together-the prisoner was' perfectly sober—In my judgment, as a driver, he used every</p>

               <p>precaution to avoid the accident—I have no doubt about it—I am a perfect stranger to him and to all the witnesses—I saw the policeman, and volunteered to give my evidence—I was at the inquest on one occasion, and was at the police-court—I told the policeman that I did not think the carman was to blame, and I should like to appear and tell the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reexamined.</hi> I cannot recollect saying before the Magistrate that when he was 50 yards from the gate he hit his horse; I may have—he held his whip up, I saw him hold his arm up, but cannot say whether he hit the horse; he did so first about 50 yards before he got to the gate, and then 15 yards—I cannot remember whether I said that the horse went faster after the prisoner struck it and I do not know whether it did—I have not mentioned to-day about his raising his whip 50 yards from the bar, because I was not asked the question-that was before any one appeared at the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Enfield House, Tottenham—I am super<lb/>intendent to Messrs. Beck and Pollitzer, of Brooks's Wharf, of which they were managers for Mr. Robert Warner, they were also proprietors or occupiers of Upper Brooks's Wharf, next to it-this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced) (marked A A</hi>) is a correct plan of the premises of Brooks's Wharf, the ware-house is—divided into three blocks, marked here A B and C; those are bonded warehouses—the part behind is not bonded—the bonded part extends to the basement, but does not include the boiler room, that is below ground, underneath the archway-A and C consist of seven floors and a basement, and B of six floors on the land side, and five on the river side—there is a communication between A and C on all the floors across B, by an opening, which is closed by iron doors, which slide to—there are two doors on each floor, and there is an opening of about 4 feet between each door—the doors do not meet, they overlap each other, so as to form a double protection against fire—there are three openings on each floor between B and A, which are not protected by iron doors, that is so all the way up there are small arches, but no doors—the access from the outside is by a staircase, through C, it is an opening into the loading area; that staircase runs right up to the top in C—there is no communication to B, except through C by the iron doors-you have to go through C and B to get to A up that staircase; there is no other staircase—there is no staircase in A only to the ground floor—It is called the ground floor, but it is about 6 feet above the ground, and therefore it necessitates a staircase up to it-the boiler room is underneath the archway, there is a communication with that from the outside-when the door in C is fastened there is no access to the premises, except to the ground floor of A, and that would be locked at the same time by the Customs authorities—there are four engines, two of which are in C, one in B and one in A—there' are two boilers below, which com<lb/>municate</p>

               <p>with the engines on the second floor—the engines are enclosed in engine boxes, they are Nos. I and 4 in C-No. I is at the back, and No. 4 in front-No. 3 is in B at the loophole, facing the river, No. 2 is in A by the loophole at the side, looking towards Southwark Bridge—the steam communication runs through the first floor to those engines—there is a stop cock by which the steam can be shut off on the first floor; that shuts off communication with all the engines, but it must be turned off in the engine boxes as well—there is a stop cock to each pipe in each engine box on the first floor, when that is shut off, no steam gets to the engine—It is not necessary to turn it off at the engine box, but we always turn <hi rend="italic">it</hi> down as an extra precaution-at the time in question in the basement and ground floor of C, wines and spirits were stored-B has no ground floor—the second floor is the Colonial floor-on the first floor were teas; on the second floor straw boards, in bundles, bales of gunny, hydraulically pressed, with four or five iron bands round each bale, some cases of mother-of-pearl shells, and one case of gum benzoin; those were all in C and on the third floor, and all above there was nothing but tea-on the first floor of B there was tea, on the second floor, pressed packed bales of gunny and lac dye in wooden cases, and on all floors above that, nothing but tea—In the basement and ground floor of A, were currants and raisins, bales of gunny, and a few bags and cases of sundry goods: on the first floor, tea; on the second floor, coffee in casks; and on the third floor, and all above, tea—the case of gum benzoni was <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the front engine bos, No. 4—It is there now, as shown in this photograph, marked A E; I have seen it there since the fire, it is an ordinary wooden packing case lined with tin and bound together by nails—the prisoner was the engineer; his duties were in the boiler house and in the four engine boxes on the second floor—he had an assistant named Buckle—It was the prisoner's duty to see whenever the engines required any oil—he started the engines from the boiler house, by a verbal signal from above-that was Howe's duty, he worked the cranes; he worked any one that was required we seldom required all at once—the prisoner's duty would take him to the engine box once in the course of an hour, I should think, to see that the machinery was working easily—If the crane was not working he would not be required to go there at all—he kept his fitting tools in the boiler house; he would take them up as he wanted them-his hours were from 8 a.m., until the cranes ceased working, which was generally at 4-on Thursday, 15th June, there was only one crane at work, that was No. 3 in B, and that stopped work about 2 o'clock-after that he would do any small repairs that might be wanted in the boiler house-his duties would not take him upstairs in the ordinary course—I saw him between 1 and 2 o'clock that day in the boiler house—I told him there was a leakage of steam in the basement. of C warehouse, and told him to repair it—he said "I understand you are going to get another engineer and you had better get him to do it;" and as he was leaving he said "I shall serve you out in a private sort of way"—hat was all that passed—I saw no more of him before the fire, I returned to the warehouse; my duties lead me all over the place—I was away at the time the warehouse was closed that day—I did not see it until after the fire had broken out; Coombes the foreman and Buckle told me of it—I was then standing in High Timber Street at a few minutes to 5 o'clock—I went down to the wharf by the archway and saw smoke in dense volumes coming from a window in C warehouse, facing the loading area—I immedi<lb/>ately went under the archway down to the river, and saw smoke and flame</p>

               <p>issuing out of B warehouse loop-hole in the second story—I then came back and saw smoke issuing out of B warehouse on the land side, out of the second floor loop-hole-after I had seen the smoke issuing out of the window of C, and before I went to B, I sent Coombes the foreman off for the fire engine, and went over to Messrs. Beck &amp; Pollitzer and informed them of the fire—it was not more than five minutes between seeing the smoke from C and seeing the flame from B front—I stayed on the premises—the engines came down with Captain Shaw—the fire spread very rapidly from the first; it was burning all night-about 8 o'clock I was in High Timber Street and saw the prisoner and his wife, he seemed to me partly intoxicated—he was coming down towards the wharf from the west end of High Timber Street—he said to me "A nice mess you have made of it now"—I took no notice but passed on to Upper Brook's Wharf, that is the adjoining premises—I saw him again between 11 and 12 o'clock just behind the office, he seemed intoxicated and rather quarelsome—I told him to leave, that he was not wanted there; there were several persons there, some of them strangers, Coombes was one of them—I spoke to the lot generally—he left and I saw no more of him that night-next day the fire burnt on and caught Upper Brook's Wharf and burnt that out-the floors all fell in, except the first and second floors in B, they were left-two or three days afterwards I went in and saw the gunny cloths, the bales were burnt at the edges and about 4 inches into the stuff; that applies to all that I saw, every bale was more or less burnt at the edge—the cases of lac dye were broken by the action of the fire and the contents scattered about; the engine box was destroyed—I did not at that time observe the condition of the floor of the engine box-about three weeks or a month after that I noticed that the floor was charred; the fire seemed to have run along by the bales, as represented on this photograph, it extended for about 6 feet round the base of the pile of gunny bags; there was a space of 3 or 4 inches between the charring and the gunny bags—there were marks as if the flooring had been burnt in a line, starting from the engine box near the doorway; it was thicker and wider at that end—the floor of the engine box itself did not seemed charred—I first noticed the gum benzoin three weeks or a month after the fire, I found it intact—Isaw the straw boards a few days after the fire, they were burnt at the edges; the cases containing the mother-of-pearl shells were partly burnt, the shells were left; about three weeks before the fire I was present at a conversation between the prisoner and Collins; the prisoned said to him "You accuse me of stealing tea, do you?"-Collins said "I have not, but if I did, perhaps I should not be far wrong "—the prisoner then struck him two blows—I told him I could not tolerate that conduct, I should have to report it to the firm—he said nothing in reply to that—I did report it, and in consequence we advertised for another engineer-we had persons come in answer to that advertisement—I did not give the prisoner any official intimation of that—It was the duty of Howe and Attfield to close the iron doors; if Howe was working the crane Attfield would have had to do it himself, at other times they would assist each other, just as they liked-that applied to all the iron doors except on the second floor, that was the duty of Coombes, the foreman, because colonial goods were stored in that floor, and he was in charge of that floor; it was his duty to close those doors or see them closed as soon as we were going to shut up—they would commence at a few minutes to 4 o'clock, there was no fixed time, 4 o'clock was the time for the people to go away-we have to pay for overtime if the warehouse <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not</p>

               <p>shut by 4 o'clock—I only know about the closing of the doors on this day from what has been told me since—I saw them on the Saturday after the fire-this photograph (A B) represents the condition in which they were then-on the fourth floor the doors were open, on the second floor they were half open, and on the first floor they were wide open; they were all wide open except on the second floor—I have often seen the doors. being closed, they run easily.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am rather young for the position I occupy there—I am twenty-two years of age—I have been there about five years, the pri<lb/>soner has been there seven years, during the time of the present owners, and their predecessors—he did not behave impertinently to me on the occasion of the row with Collins—he accused Collins of stealing tea, I did not inquire into the matter-Collins accused him first, I am sure of that I had reason to be dissatisfied with Coombes, in consequence of missing some sultanas-his wages were to have been raised, and in consequence of miss<lb/>ing the sultanas they were not raised—I think that was about a week previous to the altercation with Collins—I have no recollection of the prisoner having said that some of the men were a d——set of theives and the firm should know of it—I will not swear he did not say so in my pre<lb/>sence, but I have no recollection of it—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about the floor being burnt in a particular way—I was examined three times, there were five or six hearings—I did not discover it, it was pointed out to me—the prisoner would bring up the oil to oil the engines in a small can from the boiler-house, he would not have a can for each engine box, he would only have one for the whole—the chain of the crank would have to be greased—I believe the engines had ceased to work at 2 o'clock on this day, I could not swear it positively, but as far as my memory goes they did—I do not understand anything about the engineering department—I don't know what "packing "the engine means—I know that it cannot be done while the engine is at work, it is to stop a leakage; in order to do that, the prisoner would have to go to the engine box while the engine was not at work—there is a tool used by him called a spanner—I don't know that on that day he left the spanner in one of the engine boxes; the materials kept in the warehouse are entered in a book called the housing book, it is here, it is kept by one of the clerks in the office—the store room is at the corner of the yard, next to the office near High Timber Street—there is a store room on the second floor in C, that contained hessian (which is a kind of gunny stuff used for packing canvass), rope, and string, paper bags and old tea lead—the hessian would be in rolls, it is a kind of canvass made of jute—there was no quantity of it in the B warehouse, there was some on the ground floor, I don't think there was any on the second floor, I would not swear it-Palmer was the sampler, he is here, he was under fore<lb/>man to Coombes-a man named Frost was gatekeeper; there was no gate for him to keep, he kept the entrance to the wharf, to keep strangers out; he is here-Thomas Wallis was a casual labourer taken on when required, I could not say whether he was employed on the day of the fire; the labour books are here and can be referred to; I could not swear as to the men who were employed that day—I am perfectly well acquainted with the iron doors and their working; they were never locked, they work on wheels, they do not require more than one man to move them; one man can move them easily, I have moved them myself; there are two doors, one on either side of the wall, one pulls one way and one the other, they cover each other</p>

               <p>when closed—It may have been seven or eight weeks before the fire that I saw them closed, they were working properly then-Robins, the carpenter, would see to their repair—the first time that I knew of the doors being open was two days after the fire-Attfield had charge of the gas all over the premises—there are two meters, one in the basement of A and one in the basement of C, and there is gas all over the premises, all over A, B, and C, on every floor; there is only a gas jet on one staircase, that is the one lead<lb/>ing to the first floor of C—there are gas jets on every floor—it was Attfield's duty to report to Cook that the gas was out—the only complaint I am aware of about the gas was that one jet was left in the office one night, about two years ago; I have not known of any other—there was gas in the store-room at what is called the watchman's box which was not properly connected with the main, that was a fraud on the company, but I did not know of it till four or five days ago; the prisoner never mentioned it to me—the prisoner came daily to the premises after the fire, up to 23rd June, he showed no anxiety to leave—It is the duty of the man who shuts the doors to see that there is no one on the premises—I never heard of a tea chest taking fire from a jet of gas—I have never heard of the doors being left open—It was in Buckle's presence that the prisoner said he would serve me out in a pri<lb/>vate sort of way-to the best of my belief it was a few minutes after 5 o'clock when I discovered the smoke, I could not fix the time-this matter was in<lb/>quired into before the prisoner was given into custody; the inquiry was con<lb/>ducted by Mr. Beck and myself; I took down the men's answers, Mr. Beck asked some questions and so did I-we did not examine all the men who were on the premises the day of the fire-Thomas Wallis was not working on a crane that day, not according to this labour book; it is kept by different foremen, that day it was kept by Brown, under the superintendence of Coombes, he is not here—I could not say of my own personal knowledge that Wallis was not there that day-according to the labour books Thomas Daley was not there that day—the wages are paid according to these books; I have not got the wages book here-this book contains simply the names of the casual extra men; the wages book is a copy of this—the casual men are paid daily.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Brooks' Wharf was originally in the occupation of Messrs. Cousins Renshaw and I was in their employ—I became superintendent last November, I had worked my way up from a clerk—the gas jet was in the office outside the bonded warehouse, and was connected directly with a pipe leading to the main and not through the meter, I did not know that until inquiry was made about it at the Mansion House, I was told of it by Buckle that morning; since that it has been set right—the distance from the outer office is nearly 200 feet—the store room on the second floor in C is practically untouched by the fire—the gas jet that was left burning in the office was some two years ago; that was inside the bonded warehouses, I did not see it buring; the police made a report and wrote to us on the sub<lb/>ject—I had not seen the charring of the floor in B when I was examined before the Magistrate; it was not examined until after the committal-the leakage of steam that I complained of on the afternoon of the 15th was in the basement of C.</p>

               <p>second floor, and all the floors above—I bad not to look after the machinery, only just to turn the steam off when we had done—there were three cranes in front and one at the back-on 15th June, I was at work at crane No. 3, in B on the river side; that was the only steam crane that was at work that day; there were hand cranes—I left off working the crane at 2 o'clock-first, I had to shut off the steam in the engine box in case of accident, that was my duty—I am quite sure I did that; I then went to the first floor and shut off the steam there—It was my duty, in conjunction with Attfield, to close all the doors communicating between C and B, with the exception of the doors on the first floor, a foreman named Bass does that, and it is Coombes' duty to close those on the second floor-on the afternoon of the 15th, at 3.45, I was at the door leading onto the stairs on the second floor in C, it is a wooden door, opening directly on to the stairs; it is never closed—I saw the prisoner coming from No. 3 engine box through the iron doors on the second floor, he came towards me, and went downstairs, he passed me, I went upstairs to the third floor, and he went down—I told him I had turned off the steam—he said "All right!"—I closed the iron doors on the third floor, and then went to the fourth floor and closed the iron doors there; they would not go quite close, because they were rather out of re<lb/>pair on the third floor, they were all right on the fourth and fifth, I went up and closed them-on the fifth I found three men at work on a hand crane dropping goods down, I know one of them was James—I then returned to the second floor and there found Robins, I helped him in getting a board out of a stack of deals, they were just inside the store room in C; they were kept thereto mend chests of tea, or anything that was required—It was then from about 3.55 to 4 o'clock-while doing that, I saw the prisoner again, he came upstairs on the second floor through the doorway, and went in the direction of No. I engine box in C, by the loop hole—I could see the engine box from where I was; I could not tell whether he went into it or not, you could not see the door open, it was just round the corner, he went in that direction—I remained there about two minutes after he had passed me—I then saw him come out of No. I engine box and go into No. 4 on the same floor fronting the river-Robins and I then left that floor, leaving him there Robins went downstairs, and I went up to the top floor—I there found Attfield doing some work, I waited till he had finished; he was wiping out the hand crane that they had been using in the day—he and I then closed the iron doors on the top floor, they worked on rollers; they did not work very well, they were rather out of repair, the stones had dropped along where the wheels ran-we could not get them quite close together; one would go close, and the other would not, because the stone had dropped on one side—I am sure we closed them as far as they would go—I and Attfield then went down to the fifth floor, and closed the doors there; they closed easily and properly—I saw the three men out of that floor, and followed them downstairs, and they went out-as far as I know, I left everything safe upstairs—there was no smell of fire—It was about 4.15 when I got to the bottom of the stairs—In coming down, I did not go into the second floor, it is not my duty to go there-on, my way down, I turned out three gas burners, one on the stairs, between the ground floor and the first floor, one in the delivery office, and one in the Customs locker office, opposite the delivery office on the first floor in C—there was no other gas alight, I am quite sure—there had not been any gas burners lighted in the ware-house that day; I am able to say that-after putting out the jets, I turned</p>

I live at 2, High Timber Street, Thames Street-at the time of the fire I was in the employ of Mr. Warner—I assisted the prisoner generally, and also acted as watchman after the premises were closed; it was my duty when they were closed to look round and see that all was right—I was on duty as watchman from 4 till 8 o'clock, then there was a night watchman-on Thursday afternoon, 15th June, I was assisting the prisoner in the boiler room-about 10.30 that morning he went out—I saw him when I returned from dinner between 12 and 1 o'clock, and I told him that there had been a man after his situation; I don't think he took much notice of it-at 3.30 I saw him in the boiler room and toldhim again "There are one or two men after your place"—he said "I will go up and see them"—he went up—I don't know whether he spoke to anybody or not-steam was not up then—I think I turned No. 3 crane on about 9 or 8.30 in the morning—I did not turn it off, only from the main engine room—I can't say when I ceased feeding the boilers, I was not there all day, the steam was off when I went down and told him about the man calling; the fire was out—there are two boilers—the prisoner went up once or twice at 3.30, I don't think he was absent more than ten minutes or quarter of an hour, I could not say for certain—he came back about 3.50 or 3.45—he went up again leaving me in the boiler room—he showed me how to undo the nuts of some tubes in the boilers—I think that was about 4 o'clock—he did not say where he was going, he had nothing with him that I know of, no tools, or can, or anything in his hand that I am aware of—I don't know that anything wanted to be done, no further than going up to see that everything was right, he generally did that of an evening, to see that the engines were all turned off before he went away—he was absent twenty minutes I should think, I can't say to a minute, or five minutes, it may have been a little more or less—he then came back to me in the boiler room and asked me if I would have a glass of ale—I said yes; that was the habit after work, and we went up the yard together, he took off his jacket and put on his coat—It was about 4.30, as near as I can say, when we went up the yard-we went to the King's Head and Lamb in Thames Street and had a glass of ale, and as we came out again I saw the prisoner's wife coming along Thames Street, and we went in again and bad another glass of ale-we were in the public-house, I should think, a quarter of an hour—I then left and came away—I was looking up at the G ware-house next the stores, when the boy Eade came up and spoke to me, and I went through the archway on to the quay as far as the water's edge and looked up in the direction of the second floor of B warehouse and saw smoke coming from the loop hole of B-that was about 4.50-on seeing the smoke I ran and gave the alarm to Mr. Moore, he was at the top, turning round to come down the yard from the office—I then went up into Thames Street and gave the alarm to the police; that did not take me a minute—I went back to the quay and saw Palmer beckoning and calling to the float to come; I did not see it come, I went up the yard again, and after that I and the gate<lb/>keeper kept the people back from coming down-about 8.30 that evening I saw the prisoner, I did not speak to him or hear him say anything-about</p>

I am a clerk in Mr. Warner's employ at Brooks' Wharf—I received the alarm of fire, about 4.55 I was at the top of High Timber Street; I ran down the yard and saw smoke issuing from B loop<lb/>hole on the second floor on the land side—I saw smoke issuing from B loop<lb/>hole second floor, and glass falling—I called to the float; about ten minutes after I saw smoke coming from the loophole in C—I used to weigh all the goods into the warehouse—I know what goods had been weighed into the second floor; in A there were barrels and tierces, and bags of coffee; in B tea, barrels of gunny cloth pressed, and iron bound; and in C, gunny; straw boards, mother-of-pearl shells, and lac dye and shellac, and one case of gum benzoin; that was all to my knowledge.</p>

I am in command of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, and have been since the formation of the brigade in 1866, and previously under the old regime—I have had plenty of experience of fires in this city, large and small—I was not well acquainted with Brooks' Wharf before the fire, I was acquainted with it externally, but not internally-on the afternoon of 15th June I was at Watling Street at 5.11—I received the alarm—I at once proceeded to Brooks' Wharf with a party of men and an engine, I got there in three or four minutes—there was smoke coming out of the colonial floor, the second floor, and from the windows of the floor above it, on the street front-we came down Thames Street and passed under the arch in D warehouse, going to the loading area—I did not see any flame at first—I think there was no smoke below the second floor when I arrived, and certainly no flame—I proceeded to the door of the staircase of C, that was burst open, and I went in as far as to stand for a moment on the colonial floor—the smoke was very dense, it was impossible to. remain there-smoke was issuing from the doors of on the second floor—I did not get to the door of the colonial floor, the smoke was too thick, I only got up to the top step of the stairs, and stood for a moment there, and then came down—there was no smoke issuing from the lower levels as I went up—the density of the smoke at the door of the second floor indicated that the smoke was not able to escape through the roof and was beating downwards; it also indicated a very considerable amount of flame in some part of the centre of the building, which was invisible at the time from the density of the smoke; it indicated a very severe fire raging in some part of the premises—the glass was just beginning to break in the upper windows over the second floor; that indicated very great heat and that the flames were approaching the windows—I then returned into the loading area-at that time perhaps two engines were at work and one floating engine—I was not able to get the hose inside the ware-house at that time on account of the density of the smoke, which was then beating still further downwards—the fire burnt with great rapidity and fury—all that could be done at first was to bring the water to play on the out<lb/>side—I was not able to get the hose inside until after the roof fell through, that must have been two hours after, I should think; it was ultimately arrested at the second floor, it did not burn below that point—the second floor in B remains now, the others all fell through—I have observed the second floor in B by the loophole where the engine box stood, as depicted in this photograph; it does not exactly represent it as it is now, but as it was after the fire; no material alteration had been made in the premises when this photograph was taken-part of the floor within the wooden partition which divided off the engine box was considerably charred, and outside in the passage, which was between some bales of goods, there was the appearance of some liquid, as if some inflammable liquid must have passed along it and burnt to a certain extent into the flooring-while we were preparing to break open the door of the staircase of C, I went to the opening in front of the loading area at the river side, where one of my engines was just getting to work, and I saw smoke pouring out of the win<lb/>dow</p>

               <p>close by the engine box of which we have been speaking; there was also some flame coming out there and of such a colour as to indicate the presence of a very severe fire in its vicinity; that was in fact the first actual flame I saw in connection with this fire—there was no flame issuing from any other aperature at that moment—the flame I saw. was coming from the window where I afterwards found the charred floor—I know as a rule the character of flame arising from different substances; it was very difficult to say in this case what the substance was, the smoke was very thick, it certainly raised the presumption in my mind of the presence of some oil or grease, or fatty substance; that was what I thought at the time-spirit would not make such a dense smoke, and the colour would be quite different; it would be very much brighter, not so lurid—I am not quite sure that it is exactly safe to go upon this presumption as to colour, because these liquids seldom burn without something else burning with them, and spirit fire will sometimes make very dense smoke when burning with other things, but not alone—I have examined the floor since the stock was cleared off, and I have seen that some inflammable liquid must have passed along the floor in the space between the bales of goods marked on the photograph and other bales to the left, and it had burnt to a considerable extent into the floor, it runs round from about where the door of the engine box would be, about in a line with the flooring boards, they were not such burns as would be caused by materials falling from above, they were such as would be caused by a flame of thick oil or' melting grease—I should say it would take fifteen or twenty minutes to burn before it would eat into the wood, a good deal would depend upon the nature of the substance; melting grease would be very much slower than mineral oil—I should be inclined to think it was melting grease that did that particular injury, or oil that had been standing along time and was not very liquid—It was impossible to avoid the con<lb/>clusion that some very 'slowly running inflammable liquid had passed over that part of the floor in the early stage of the fire—I think some of the flame out of the window may have come from the inside of the engine box; that indicated that some of the liquid must have got out there also—the liquid did not flow much in the direction of the gunny bags, it began by the door of the engine box and passed away to the left, as shown in the photograph—the outside of the gunny bags was charred—I was not able to get within the building so as to examine it properly for some days; it was left in charge of my men—I could then form a judgment as to one place in which the fire originated, but I think it probable there may have been several fires together—the engine box is the one place of which I speak—assuming the stock to be as it has been represented, I think it is very dif-ficult to suppose that the fire could have spread so rapidly unless the place had been lighted in several places together—the engine box No. I in C was destroyed, if there was one, there is none there now-considering the materials described as stored in the warehouse, it is very improbable that a fire could accidentally arise; of course it is not impossible, but it is very improbable—I should say such materials would not burn rapidly; the wooden tea cases would certainly burn, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> not rapidly—I observed the iron doors when I got on the premises; they were fully open from the colonial floor up, and on the colonial floor they were about half open—the fire would not open them; they were buckled out a little from the heat—If the iron doors had been closed it would very much have retarded the pro<lb/>gress of the fire, and I think it very probable we could have got from C Into B warehouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it quite possible and probable that the place may have been set on fire in four or five different places—I think it very probable that the floor of an engine box used for eight years would be con<lb/>siderably moistened or saturated with oil—the running marks I saw on the floor might be caused by grease used for the crane pulleys, if in large quantity, but not the ordinary quantity used for such purposes; if there had been a store of oil that would account for it—If there had been a large quantity of grease, say half a ton, kept in the box, that" would account for the condition of the floor—It presented the appearance of having been run over by a very large quantity of liquid-what I saw inside the engine box I think would be accounted for by the oil having soaked into the floor, or by small quantities of oil from the oil feeders—I did not give any evidence before the Magistrate as to this floor, it bad not been cleared at that time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>)., On 28th June I received a warrant and went to the Rainbow public-house, in Queen Street, Ratcliff, in company with Sergeant Moss, I there saw the prisoner-Moss read the warrant to him—he said "Yes, I know about it, it is a bad job; I left about 4 o'clock and went with Buckle and my wife to the public-house at the top of the yard, we had some ale, I then left with my wife and went straight home by rail, getting home about 6 o'clock, I had not been in-long before a Mr. Smith, who keeps a shop, came in and said 'There is a fire in Thames Street close to your wharf,' and I went with my wife and Mr. Smith to the fire"-that was all—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). We used common engine oil for the engines, nothing else, most of it was kept down in the boiler room—some times we used to keep a little can which we called an oil feeder, about as large as this testament; we used to keep that in the engine box, not one in each box, we used to leave it in the box we were last in-we filled it when it was wanted—I can't say how often, some times in three or four days or a week, according to how many cranes were used-we oil them about every half hour or hour when they are in full working order-we have no stock of oil up in the floors-we keep a two or three gallon can down in the boiler room, from which we supplied the feeders-both the prisoner and I did the oiling, it all depends, if I am left there alone I do it—the two-gallon can is replenished when empty—I could not say what quantity of oil there was on the premises at the time of the fire; it never exceeded the two gallons-we did not use two gallons in three weeks, I could not say how much we used, when it was empty I used to tell the prisoner, and he would tell me to go to the</p>

I am a van boy in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company-on the 15th August, about 4 o'clock or 4.30, I was in one of the company's vans with Dufty—I went to Goodman's Yard and we took in, there several articles-when there, Murphy spoke to Dufty-Dufty told me to go on one side while they were speaking—I did not hear anything that was said then—I saw Ridley there-after that Dufty and Ridley went away and returned—the van drove on and stopped at John Street, Minories—I saw Ridley and Murphy there together-Murphy said "Won't you do anything?'—Dufty said "No, I will not"-Murphy repeated this question three or four times—I then <hi rend="italic">drove on to Jewry</hi> Street—I saw Murphy and Ridley there together-Murphy spoke to Dufty there—I did not hear what was said-Ridley was a little way across the road—they went into a public-house and had beer-Murphy came out first, he shifted the load and put the tarpaulin over it—he got underneath the sheet in the middle of the van—the others came out afterwards together-Ridley got on the tailboard and Dufty got up and drove away-as he was driving away from Jewry Street I was in the middle of the van and I heard a noise of breaking a case open, it proceeded from underneath the tarpaulin—It was loud enough for Ridley to have heard' it on the tailboard—the van next stopped at White Street—some gentleman then stopped the van just as it was beginning to go on again-Ridley had gone away-Dufty was on the dickey; Murphy was underneath the tarpaulin—the gentleman asked Dufty who he had got underneath the sheet-Dufty said "No one, as I know of, is in the van "-Duffy then got down and untied the tarpaulin-while he was doing so, Murphy got off the van and ran away—the van went on to Barbican—I then saw Murphy, but not Ridley-Murphy said to Dufty "All right, you can go on now "-Murphy took the tobacco away on his back in a sack—the van was standing in some lane out of Barbican-Dufty drove it there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this offence—upon the 15th August, I was driving a van-William was with me—I was sent from Crutchet Friars, down to Goodman's Yard-at Goodman's Yard, I saw Murphy and Ridley, opposite the Vine, Ridley sitting down, and Murphy standing up-Murphy asked me what I was going to load—I said tobacco—he said "Will you do anything? you can do with a few shillings, and I know I can"—I said "I don't know what I am going to load"—I saw Ridley, and I said "Have you left the Great Western?"—he said "I have left about three weeks"—I then went into the warehouse to see if there was room to draw in; but there was not and I came out again—Murphy asked me what I was going to load—I said four hogsheads and a case—he said "We can do the case a trick"—I refused, Murphy made the remark, but Ridley was standing beside him-Murphy asked if I would do a hogshead open—I said "No, it could not be done"-Murphy referred to Ridley about opening a hogshead somewhere down Victoria Docks-Ridley said "Yes "-Murphy asked me if I was frightened at the money—he said "If you are, I live at No. 4, Signlong Court"—If you come down this way to-morrow and call there, you will find the money there, or I will meet you wherever you like to say "-one of the foremen called out—I put the van under the hydraulic inside the warehouse, and put six bales into my van—when I went on the platform I asked if the hogshead and bales were all he said "No"—I then stood outside-Murphy asked again whether I would have the hogshead done—I said no, I was not going to load a case, I was going to load a bale—he said "We can do a bale; you can send the boy for the <hi rend="italic">deck</hi> "(<hi rend="italic">that is the declaration</hi>) "and while he has gone we can do it, and he will be none the wiser"—I said no, I would not have the bale touched <hi rend="italic">on</hi> any consideration—he said "Have a hogshead done; if you load the hogshead, on the near side, three will go into the bottom, the fourth on the top, and the sheet over them, I can do that, we can have a drag to follow you up to Paddington; you can drive up Oxford Street,</p>

Murphy before—I had been working with Ridley at the Friars, before he left the Great Western.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Ingoldby &amp; Lamb, 3, Whitefriars Street, City, publishers-one of our publications is known as the International Guide, it comes out every two years—the object of it is to enable foreigners to know where to purchase any thing they may require—I employ men as canvassers for advertisements for that guide—In 1873 the prisoner was in my employ as canvasser—he was with me about three weeks—I think it is very likely he left of his own accord-this letter, dated October 30th, 1873, is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been unwell; could have made money at it if he had not been prevented from following it up, and enclosed a statement of account.</hi>) Since that time he has never been in my employment—In 1873, when he was in my employ I used orders of this kind, and he would be in possession of such orders-when he left our ser<lb/>vice in 1873 I do not remember whether he handed in the orders or not—In consequence of information I received I wrote him a letter and received this letter in reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 19th March</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">in which the prisoner said:</hi> "I will, as you wish me call to-morrow, Friday.") I believe he did so</p>

               <p>call—I was there—he said he had not called upon anybody to collect any money—this receipt, marked A is in the prisoner's writing "March 9th, 1876. Received from Messrs. J. Fulgar &amp; Sons, 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for insertion of adver<lb/>tisement in International Guide"—neither the prisoner or anyone else has ever accounted to me for that order—he had no authority to take it. (<hi rend="italic">Two orders were here produced signed by the prisoner, also receipts dated October</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">from Messrs.

                  </hi>. I keep a farm at Whetstone about a mile from Barnet—on Monday, 4th September, I saw Reed in Barnet Fair-we had a conversation about a horse, on the Tuesday, he came to the fair with a brown horse which he wanted to Bell—I offered him first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he asked 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and eventually he agreed to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with an old light chestnut horse of mine in exchange—he examined my horse and looked at its mouth and legs, it had a short tail coming down to about its hock; it was' a short-necked horse, its legs had ringbone, which is an enlargement round the fetlock—he complained that it had ringbone—I gave him a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and told him to take the brown horse to the farm and fetch away the one he bought—I also said I would recommend the light chestnut horse to anybody in the fair, and waited about" for that purpose—about 3.30 I had a. communication from a man and went to look for the, prisoner—I met him with my man, who said "This man has got the wrong horse, "he has taken away Tommy"—the prisoner said that he had sold the horse for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Well, I cannot help it, you must get him back, or you will hear something more of the matter"—then he said "I am sorry if I have made a mistake, we will go through the fair and see if we can find the horse"—he and I and the bailiff went through the fair together; he could not find the horse or the man he sold it to—we went round the fair and eventually stoped at the entrance to a booth—I was on horseback and did not go in—my bailiff was close to the prisoner; he went in—several people came around talking about it, and suddenly the prisoner disappeared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180078"/>
               <p>—I sent the bailiff to High Barnet Station and I went to the police-station and told the inspector about it—I went to the other station and arrived two or three minutes before a train started—I saw the prisoner on a seat at the far end of the station—atthe fair and at the farm he had a black mackintosh on; it had rained heavily all day—at the station he had the mackintosh white side out and the black side in—I said "Well, have you got my horse "—he said "No, I have not found him"—I said "I must have you," and I sent for a policeman—it was the light chestnut I sold him, the dark chestnut was the taller of the two by 2 or 3 inches—I know a good deal of horses; they are both aged horses—in my judgment, nobody knowing anything about horses could have mistaken the one for the other—the prisoner, in my interview with him, did not. look at the dark chestnut or examine it at all—we had no conversation about it—both horses were in the same field—he told me he came from Hickenham, near Uxbridge—at the police-station he gave his address, St. George's, Bristol—before then I know some papers had been found upon him by the policeman.</p>

On 21st August about 10 p.m. I was on duty at Old Swan Pier with Lloyd on the arrival, of the excursion boat—as the people were leaving the pier I saw the prisoners and a man not in custody push amongst them in a very suspicious manner; they ran against the people who were coming out, and the prisoners were pushing towards them as though they were going on to the pier—there was a stoppage at the barrier where they take the tickets in consequence of a man not hav<lb/>ing his tieket—Ebell placed himself in front of the prosecutor and Lovett on his left side, and the man not in. custody close behind him—Ebell placed his left hand under his right elbow to the prosecutor's left waistcoat pocket—I could not see. his hand, it was under his elbow at that moment—the gate was opened and the people were moving out—the prosecutor said to Ebell "I have lost my watch and you have got it"—Ebell said "I have not"—I got hold of him the same moment—he said "I have not got his watch, I have one of my own"—I said "I shall charge you, with others, with stealing it"—I took him into custody and Lloyd took the other-at the station both the prisoners said they had been to Rotherhithe—the inspector said" You had not passed the barrier, where are your tickets?"——they said "We gave the tickets up on the pier" they do not sometimes give, them up on the pier, but always at the barrier-neither of the prisoners Had passed the barrier, but Ebell passed through in my custody, and he gave up no ticket then, and no ticket was found on him at the station—I found upon him a ring and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pipe and case and fusees—Ebell gave his name, but refused his address, saying that he did not like to be disgraced.</p>

Bell"—we were both in plain, clothes, we do not usually appear in uniform—I heard the altercation at the barrier about the man who had not got his ticket—I seized hold of Ebell and held him; that was directly the man said he had lost his watch; I kept him in my custody—we were 4 or 5 yards from the barrier—there were a good many people coming from the boat, it is a large boat coming from Rotherhithe Gardens—the pier is 60 yards long I cannot tell whether the boat had started when 'the man. shouted out that he had lost his watch—the barrier was shut not more than a minute and a half—the inspector in taking the charge asked where we had brought the prisoners from—I said "Swan Pier"—he asked ""Had you passed the barrier"—I said "No."—I. found on. Ebell a silver Geneva watch and this metal chain worn in the usual way.</p>

On Sunday morning between 5th and 6th August I was in Northumberland Avenue at 1.30, I there saw the two prisoners—Lornen way carrying a large brown-paper parcel, and wearing along Ulster overcoat—they turned into Northumberland Street; I followed them—I allowed them to go on for some time, and then I went up to them</p>

               <p>—Booker turned round and threw Ms parcel down—I cried out "Stop theif"—I was in the act of catching hold of Lornen when he shook the Ulster coat off, and 399 came out of the Strand and caught hold of Booker and I caught Lornen and took him into custody—I found afterwards that there were two more small coats inside the Ulster coat—I told him I should take him into custody for being in possession of property supposed to be stolen—he said" You have made a mistake, the right man has gone"—the brown<lb/>paper parcel was addressed "Mrs. Denenlain, 9, Craven Street"—I went to that address, I saw Mr. Ehrlick and he aroused Miss Denenlain—he found his portmanteau and drawers and cheffionier had been broken open; Miss Denenlain's room had been broken into and was in confusion, and on a large round table were marks of grease from a lamp—I also found seven coats, six books, one dress, one skirt, one silk polonaise, and other articles—at the station I found three keys, one upon Lornen, and two upon Booker—the whole of the keys opened the front door of No. 9, Craven Street.</p>

I am an M.D. of the University of Edinburgh, and a Burgeon, and reside at Woolwich, about ten minutes walk from the prisoner—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination of this child by order of the Coroner—externally the body was free from any marks of violence; it was not emaciated, it was in very fair condition, fairly nourished—as far as external appearances it appeared to be the body of a healthy child, except the enlargement of the maxillary glands; that would come from disease—I found a large glandular swelling on the right and left sides of the throat—the brain and membranes were all healthy, the heart was healthy, and the lungs, except trivial congestion, which would be accounted for by its lying two or. three weeks—the "stomach contained a small quantity of fluid nourishment, with probably a little wine—the liver was healthy, the spleen much congested; both kidneys, especially the left, in a state of degeneration, the bowels and other organs were all in a healthy condition; in my judg<lb/>ment death resulted primarily from scarlet fever, secondarily from disease of the kidneys; both those are amenable to medical treatment; by that, I mean that many cases suffering in a similar manner recover under treat<lb/>ment—taking the fact that the child was apparently a healthy one, apart from these matters, if medical attendance had been called in, its life might probably have been prolonged; of course I cannot say positively, no one could—I think the chances of its life were lessened by the absence of medical aid, and the health seriously endangered and injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Clerk to this Court—I was present at the previous trial of the prisoner, and, afterwards, when (the point of law having been reserved), sentence was passed upon him by Mr. Baron Hud<lb/>dleston. The learned Judge commenced by saying that he believed the opinion which these people had brought themselves to, was an honest one, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180093"/>
               <p>they were acting <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi>, but that now the Court had decided that the law was against them, and however much right they might have as grown up persons to deal with themselves in any way they thought fit, they had no right whatever to deal with helpless children, who were under their charge and who could not reason or judge for themselves; that the statute, to which he called the prisoner's attention, made it the duty of a parent having charge of an infant, to provide medical aid for it whenever it was necessary, and that if hereafter they neglected' the duty of calling in medical aid when it was necessary, they must be prepared to put up with the consequences; that it could not be permitted that they should allow their children to be without medical aid when the law stated that they should provide it; thereupon, the prisoner, in substance, said that he would communicate with the elders of his people, and now that the law—was clearly ascertained, he for himself and the others, he had, no doubt, would abide by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never thoroughly understood that we were com<lb/>pelled to have medical aid, not when I was here before. I don't think I should have broken the law if I had known it had been kid down distinctly as the gentleman says; My lord spoke very nice, and I was no doubt rather excited at the time. The child was sucking at the breast, and we gave it a little sherry and water, and a little brandy and water, or port wine, and we prayed earnestly to the Lord to deliver it. We have seen the goodness of the Lord displayed many times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable on duty at the South London Palace not in the police force—at 12.45 on the morning of the 10th August I was leaving my duty—when I got down as far as Meadow Row I heard the scream of a woman—I proceeded to the spot, when I saw the prisoners and seven or eight more men quarrelling with two women—I cannot say whether there were any blows before, but there was no blow afterwards—I took no part in the disturbance—Brooks turned round to me and asked me for a match—I said I had not got one, when he asked me for a bit of tobacco—I said I had not got any, when he put his finger in my side <hi rend="italic">fob</hi> pocket and took out my tobacco and threw it behind him—I asked him what he had done that for, when he deliberately struck me on the nose with his fist, say<lb/>ing "That is what I done it for"—I fell on the ground—I then put up my arms to stop other violence, when I was struck from behind, by Moss, in the back of the neck—I know it was Moss, because I turned round at the time and saw no one but Moss behind me; he was drawing back his arm to hit me again, I got up and seized Brooks, when Moss caught hold of me and struck me again—I then kept hold of him and Brooks till a constable came up and I gave Brooks into custody—the other went away—I saw Moss again, I should think, about two minutes after in the Falmouth Road, when Brooks was in custody, as we were proceeding to the station—I then charged him with the assault and gave him into the custody of another constable—I had known both prisoners before, so I could not be mistaken.</p>

I shall stand it all myself"—he told me next morning that he saw a man a few hundred yards from Mr. Phillips, and saw a man under a tree with a writing desk, a paper knife, and some other articles, which have not been recovered, and he asked him if he would have the things, and he said "Yes," and hid them; that he pawned the desk and table cover, and tore the ticket up, and that he knew at the time that the things were stolen.</p>

I am an architect, of 260, Camberwell Now Road—on 25th August I was in Walworth Road and was attacked by three people—I received a blow on my mouth which knocked me down, and I felt a pull at my chain—my watch was stolen, but my chain was left unbroken—the men ran away, I followed them and lost sight of them—about an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner at the station, but could not identify him—he resembles one of them in size—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabdriver, of 74, Burton Street, Hack<lb/>ney—I was driving in Walworth, and saw Payne getting up off the ground and three men running away from him—I followed them some distance;, they ran round by the railway arch of the Elephant and Castle station into New Kent Road—I pointed them out to a policeman, who took the pri<lb/>soner—the others ran away—I heard something fall when the prisoner was taken, and told the inspector so.</p>
