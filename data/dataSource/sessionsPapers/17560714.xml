               <p>Q. Had you your tankard then?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I never miss'd it at all. The prisoner went out of the house, and I happening to be on the other side of the way saw her hustle something out of her left hand under her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she by herself in your house?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. Yes, all the time she was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I never saw her before. I ask'd her the reason of her staying so long; she said a young man had promised to come by eight o'clock, and as he did not come she would stay no longer. I mistrusted she had got my tankard, and call'd out, Mistress, Mistress, thinking that if she had it she would discover it by running away. She ran away, and I after her; I saw her stop'd by Mr. Spencer: we were almost all together. She drop'd the tankard, and he took it up in my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the prisoner when it was taken up?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. I believe I was about 5 or 10 yards from her when I saw it drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drop it?</p>
               <p>M. Nash. She was the nighest person, I saw her drop it. She ran, after the tankard was taken up, but was soon taken. I got a constable, and charged him with her. [The tankard produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>

I examined the girl, and with a good deal of talking to her she confessed she had taken the things mentioned, told where she had pawned them, and went along with me; where I found them accordingly.

            . I am a carpenter, and was at work at the same house. I was coming from breakfast, and met the woman in the passage. I stopped her to see what she had got; she said she wanted some shaving, and asked me for some. I told her there were none and so let her go out. Then I went to look into the parlour, and seeing nobody there, I followed the woman to see what she had got, and turning her apron aside I there saw this basket. I asked her how it, and she said a chare-woman her for it. I knowing it was my brother's property, called him up, and he owned it directly.</p>

               <p>Samuel Toon. The prisoner was washing at my house on the 4th of June. Her pocket bulged out, and as she was going by my wife she said, what have you in your pocket? Perceiving money they searched her, but I was not there. I know nothing more than what she confessed before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that confession taken in writing ?</p>
               <p>Toon. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sign it ?</p>
               <p>Toon. No.</p>
               <p>Jone Toon. I am wife to the prosecutor. I took out one hundred and seventeen farthings and nine pence halfpenny out of the prisoner's pocket. I ask'd how she came to take that money from me. She made me no answer. There were several trifling things in her pocket, and the pillowbier was taken from about her waist. The handkerchief was found upon her, and she owned that all the things and money were mine, and that she took the money from our bedside.</p>

She came again on the Monday night to help me out of my bed, when I spoke to her to come again on the Tuesday morning, which she did; that morning I missed a shirt. Then I sent to the pawnbrokers about, and at one the corner of Russel-Court I found the stockings and shirt were pawn'd in the prisoner's name. [They were produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>

            . I am servant to Ive Whitebread, Esq; and company. The prisoner has come to our warehouse for several sorts of goods in the hard-ware way. Of late we had reason to suspect she had stolen goods from us. On the 29th of June we laid out seven parcels of sundry kind of things on purpose. On the 30th he came between eight and nine o'clock into the warehouse and I watch'd him having suspected him before. Out of the seven parcels, one of the parcels was wrote upon four silver watches, but in reality they were only one dozen of knives. The prisoner took that parcel up, and put it into his pocket. About two minute after he was going off, when I call'd my fellow servant and we stop'd him at the door and secured him; a constable was fetch'd, but before any constable came the prisoner desired us to take the parcel out of his pocket, which we did. We took him before my lord mayor, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he own or deny it there ?</p>
               <p>Stewardson. He said, he supposed it tumbled off the counter into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Stewardson. He has dealt with us some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a silver watch being left with you?</p>
               <p>Stewardson. It was a metal watch Iv left in my custody, as security for money for goods he had bought, not having present money by him. The good came to 30 s. When he was taken with these I looked at the watch, and it appeared not to be worth 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you paid that 30 s.</p>
               <p>Stewardson. Yes, I was, when the watch was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you paid no more ?</p>
               <p>Stewardson. I was paid 9 s. for a groce of watch I had paid for not half an hour before, and I charged him with taking them away, a it could be nobody else; so his friend paid me the 9 s.</p>

            . I deal in French paper boxes. On the Friday after the prisoner was committed to Newgate, his father came to me, and desired I would go and take out a watch that was pledged for 30 s I went on Thursday Mr. Stewardson shewed me the watch, and said he must yet have 9 s. because his master had lost 9 s. in goods, and he must pay his master. I said it is hard to pay it, if you could not swear it upon the prisoner; for he said he suspected the prisoner, but could not swear it: however, I paid it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Is the park fenced in?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. It is all round with pales and posts as other parks are. There are ladder stiles, and gates upon them, and there is a park-keeper on purpose to look after the deer. My late lord bought it about 22 years ago; it then was a farm, and he made it a park to keep deer and hares in.</p>

             came to my house and called for a pot of beer, and after that another, which they paid for, and staid about half an hour. After they went away, I thought by their scouting and leering about in the road, on the backside of people's house, and in the fields, that the park would be robbed that night. In the morning, about two o'clock, I got up to go a mowing; and going up the park, I saw a place where there had been a great deal of trampling about, and I smelt something like blood, and saw something on the ground which I ran my hand into, and found it was blood. Then I went to the ladder-stile near it, and found blood on both sides the ladder; and I also found blood upon the wall, about the quantity of three pints. This is a wall to keep the deer from going into the pleasure gardens. I looked over the wall and saw a paunch lying. I then went on the other side of the ladder-stile, and found a place where another buck had been stain, another paunch lying there.</p>
               <p>Q. What place was this in?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. It was in the garden. I went down the path towards Barnet, where I traced blood on both sides of the stile that goes that way. I ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140010"/> back to the keeper, and told him what I saw. He came with me with a gun, and we followed the track of the blood out of the park and across two fields. Then he said, I'll turn back and acquaint the Steward. I said, I'd find out the deer if I could. I went into the third field, wherein there were beans, amongst which I found a large white buck lying across the land, covered with the beans, and a little farther I found another buck tied up in a sack. Then I was afraid to stay, so came back and told the keeper what I had found. He came and saw them, and gave me his gun, desiring me to lie under a hedge, and take the person or persons that came if I could. The gun was loaded with pistol balls, and powder. The keeper went away to London to the steward, and came back to me again. I thought it not proper he should go quite up to the deer, fearing it should put the persons by from coming. He went home again, and in about twenty minutes after the prisoner at the bar came over the stile from Barnet way, ran directly to the first buck, and turning himself round drop'd on all fours, in the same manner as a Hawk drops upon a bird, and as quick; he turn'd it, and took it into the furrow.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. I was about thirty yards from him, or something better.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the deer lie from the path way?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. About twenty-five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the stile from the place where the deer lay?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. About forty or fifty yards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. It was about five in the afternoon. I had lain there all that time, there had not a christian gone by but I saw them. I jump'd over the hedge, and went up to him. I said to him, Friend design, I insist upon your life, or your body dead or alive, for you are my prisoner; he ran five or six poles on his hands and knees. I told him, I had rather he'd design than to shoot him. I knew his life was better-than a burying. He had a great stick in his hand. He designed so far as to walk before me up to my house. We walked into the park, where he sat down at the root of a tree, and said, I'll go no farther, you may shoot me if you please; if I have done any thing, shoot me. I hallow'd out for help, and then he took his walk back-towards Barnet. I kept about fourteen yards from him, fearing his stick. When he saw other people coming after him with guns and other weapons; he ran, and I ran and kept distance with him till we came upon the top of Barnet-Common, where he cry'd out murder, and several people came out to assist him. I desir'd them to help me, and said I'd shoot the first man that assisted him, and said he was my prisoner. Then he fell into a ditch, and would not design then. There were some people that I feared would strive to save his life, and take away mine. There was a man on horse back that was on my part. I gave him my gun. The prisoner with his stick, and said he'd beat my brains out. I ran up to him, and flung him down. Then he said sixteen of you shall not bind me, I want only two good fellows. I found all the mob round for taking his part. I got his stick away, and then he was going to fight me with his hands. I took him into an alehouse and bound him, and then carried him to my lady house, and from thence to mine, and kept him there all morning. There was neither constable or a justice to be got in Barnet at that time. We brought him in a cart to justice Fielding's, and he committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the justice ?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. He made himself very innocent; he would not know any thing about it. He said he did not know me or my house, nor the way to my house neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the park-keeper live?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. His name is Mr. Yakesly; he lives in my lady's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does my lady live there now?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. It is two summers ago since my lady has been there. The steward is there may be twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays the workmen and servants there?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. The steward pays me, but whether it is my lady's or my lord Bury's money I know not; it was never my business to enquire into that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live there after my lord was dead?</p>
               <p>Marlbrough. I can't be particular. I know they kill a great deal of venison, some for their own use, and some to make presents of. There was also another buck found with his back and jaw broke; it was the second best buck in the park.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellis.. I am the officer that had the prisoner in custody, and carried him to justice Fielding. He was delivered into my hands between seven and eight o'clock on Monday was se'nnight at night, and I was with him at the other evidence's house all night; he would not own any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. At South Mints.</p>

He insisted upon my going along with him; so with a great deal of persuasion I went. He lives at Whetstone, and I at Barnet. He turn'd the dogs into the park, and they killed these deer. I would have had him to have left them there.</p>

             had some word about pileing some coach fellies in Mr. More's wharf. They went backwards into the stern of the barge and strip'd to fight. They went at it at once. Philips was naked, the other in his shirt. Beck knock'd Philips down on his back. They got up again, and I'd have had them put their cloaths on, but they would not and went at it again; they had three or four blows, and the deceased received two blows, one on his ribs, the other on his temples, upon which he fell and never spake more.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he fall ?</p>
               <p>Price. He fell upon his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he die of the blows he received at that time?</p>
               <p>Price. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in good health before?</p>
               <p>Price. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did this quarrel begin?</p>
               <p>Price. In the fore part of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go backwards by consent to fight ?</p>
               <p>Price. They did, and had a fair set to. I'd have had the deceased put on his cloaths and he would not, but would fight on. The prisoner is a good natur'd man.</p>

            . I was on board when the prisoner and the deceased fought. I heard them quarrelling as I was pilling of the fellies in Mr. More's wharf, and heard them agree to go back in the barge to fight. At first the deceased knock'd down the prisoner. They both fell, and they got up again and fell to it again; and I saw two blows strack upon the deceased by the prisoner, one on the head, the other about the belly part; he then fell forward on his hands and face, and never spoke a word, not living ten minutes after. There was a surgeon fetch'd in order to let him blood, but he did not bleed. The prisoner put on his cloaths, cry'd very sadly, and ran out of the barge immediately.</p>

I told him the man of the house was dead. He wanted some money upon this draft, and said he should bring a chest and bedding, in which there was the value of 400 l and a sword and ruffles in it. He produced the draft, and said he was afraid of being pressed. He said he came from Bristol, and the chest was come up in the waggon. I lent him a guinea and a half upon the draft, according to his desire, to pay for the carriage of the chest. He would not go without my man with him, on which I sent him in a coach, but he flung him and went away. I never saw him since, but in New-Prison this day week. He said when he came he was a boatswain, and could not write his own name, but he put a mark to the note. He had served several other people in the same manner.</p>

On the fourth of June, a little before eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner at the bar came to the house, and asked if my lord Radnor was at home. I told him he was, but that he had been very ill all night, and was not stirring saying, Sir, if you are going further, and will please to call again in an hour time, he will perhaps be stirring then. Sir, said he, I am going as far as Teddington, and will call again. I gave orders to the other servant, if such a person called, to shew him the way into the parlour, and go up and let my lord know (I having told him of the person's calling after he was up which when he called the footman accordingly did. My lord said to him, Go down and tell him I will wait on him immediately. My lord went down, and I follow'd him. The first word that passed when my lord got into the parlour was. Your servant. Your servant, said my lord. Said the prisoner, you have a very pretty place here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room?</p>
               <p>Haines. No, but I could hear every word that passed; the door being open at the bottom of the stairs, and the wind at east, prevented the door from being shut close. My lord next said, a very small place; pray. Sir, sit down on this side me, because I am a little thick of hearing. The prisoner said, are you deaf, my lord? My lord said, a little. Then he said, I will not detain you any more. I must have your money immediately; this is my business with your lordship, and if you don't give me your money immediately, I'll shoot you thro' the body, or head ( I am not certain which;) my pistol is loaded with white powder, it will make no report. On hearing this, I said to the footman where is my blunderbus? He said, it is not charged. No matter for that, said I, fetch it; he ran and fetch'd it. I took it, went to the prisoner, and said, If you stir hand or foot I'll blow you into the wainscot this moment, and stood with the piece level'd at him. He said, do, shoot; so I will if you stir, said I, and stood like a pointer at him. I called for assistance, and the footman came with the jack in his hand that we pull off boats with. I order'd him to go up and lay hold of the prisoner, or else I told him I would shoot him thro' the head that moment. Accordingly he did, and then I trip'd up his heels, and thresh'd him very handsomely. We took him before justice Burkhead; and the pistol he had in his hand, who ordered us to see if it was white powder. I knock'd it against the pavement, and found it to be common black powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ball in it?</p>
               <p>Haines. There was a ball slit in two pieces. (He produced a letter). This letter the prisoner deliver'd to my lord, and own'd it was his writing; he afterwards said he wrote at Teddington, the hour he was gone thither.</p>
               <p>It was read in court to this purport:</p>
               <p>'' My Lord, being in the greatest distress obliges '' me to make this bold attempt; deny me not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140013"/> '' your lordship's purse, for I am loaded with white '' powder, and my resolve is dreadful. What '' through your goodness your lordship grants me, '' shall in three months with grateful thanks be '' returned. ''</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether you saw a pistol presented to your lord's breast?</p>
               <p>Haines. No, I did not, I was not in the room then.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did you see a paper in his lordship's hand, and whether I delivered it him, or how he came by it ?</p>
               <p>Haines. After we had taken the prisoner, my lord gave me this paper, which he said the prisoner delivered to him; I did not see him deliver it. I took it and put it into the prisoner's pocket book, which I have here (producing it.)</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it?</p>
               <p>Asplin. I think it was Friday the 4th of June. I was down below combing out a wig that I was to shew his lordship. I heard a very great noise above. I went out of the passage, and asked what noise it was, fearing his lordship was taken ill. I heard Mr. Haines's tongue plain. The footman told me there was a thief in the house robbing his lordship. I went into the room, and there saw the prisoner on the floor, with both his eyes bruised. I helped to hold him while he was searched. I saw a sort of a memorandum book, a silk handkerchief, and a pistol taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice ?</p>

            . I am gardener to my lord Radnor. My son came to me in the garden, and told me there was a great disturbance in the house, for a Man was robbing his lordship. I ran to the house as fast as I could, and to his lordship's room, when his lordship ordered, me to go back and call Mr. Wyne, a neighbouring, gentlemen that lived just at the back, of the garden, who is a great acquaintance of his lordship's. When I came back the prisoner was tied with his hands behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the justice with him?</p>
               <p>Martin. I did. There he own'd that he wrote the note with his own hand at Teddington, for my lord Radnor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say for what purpose he wrote it?</p>

               <p>As to the fact I am in utter ignorance of it. I know not that ever I saw him, or that ever I was at his lordship's house in my life. I have often been catch'd in my own room, and stop'd from murdering and destroying myself. I know nothing of it, not so much as a dream, nor the least single thought of it; let them swear or say what they will. People in London have seen me walk about, and have pitied me for being miserable, travelling about like a wandering spirit; I can rest no where. As to hurt mankind I never meant it, but I would willingly resign my life, it is not that I want to save it, (to send me hence is to free me from misery) I only beg your lordship to give me but a lawful chance, that's all I desire. I think I know a gentleman of the jury that I believe knows me, if he'll please to speak for me (pointing to Mr. Geff.)</p>

She was suspected by us all to be with child, but she denied it to he, mistress, and every one of us. One time I went up stairs with a bushel of coals for her. She said she was short breath'd, and could not go up four or five pair of stairs. She call'd me up into her own garret, to fetch her up two pails of water. I ask'd her what was the matter with her. She said she was short breath'd. I said, you are certainly with child. She said, no, she was not. I said, you surely are as much as ever my wife was; and with a great many words she own'd that she was with child, and that one Mr. Jones a taylor was the father of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this Jones ?</p>
               <p>Buckle. He is a master taylor in York-Street, Covent-Garden. She had lived there before she came to live with Mr Low. I endeavour'd to persuade her to swear the child to Mr. Jones. She said she would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a child being born?</p>
               <p>Buckle. I was at the taking a child out of Mr. Bailey's vault, and I help'd to wash it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this was her child?</p>
               <p>Buckle. I took her out of her mistress's room and carried her to the watch house, and said to her, how could you be so cruel to throw this child down the vault? She said, I do not deny the child's being mine, but I beg you'll take no farther notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you had this conversation ?</p>
               <p>Buckle. This was as we were going along.</p>

               <p>Buckle. No.</p>

               <p>Buckle. I am a soldier, but am also a weekly servant to Mr. Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. When the child was taken out of the vault, how did it appear?</p>
               <p>Buckle. It seem'd to be full grown, as far as I could judge, in all shapes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any wounds upon it?</p>

               <p>M. Hewit. I can't tell the day of the month. She did not resolve me then, but cry'd. I went in the afternoon, and ask'd her again, when she told me she had put it into a clout, and flung it down the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of the child when it was born?</p>
               <p>M. Hewit. No, I did not. She ask'd me to lie with her that night, but I did not, it did not suit; I had lain with her several nights before. As I declined it, she ask'd my fellow servant.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your reason for declining it?</p>
               <p>M. Hewit. Because I was to get up soon the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child after it was taken out out of the vault ?</p>
               <p>M. Hewit. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear?</p>
               <p>M. Hewit. I did not see any bruises.</p>

            . I was sent for on the 22d of June before the justice, and ordered to search the prisoner. She was at the Round-house. I found she had had a child a few days before. I desired she might be put into a bed and taken care of. Accordingly she was. The coroner and jury ordered me to get the child cleaned, and bring it to them.</p>

               <p>Gamble. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman live in that room?</p>
               <p>Gamble. I can't take upon me to say that; here in a person to be called can give the court an account of that. After I had looked at the man I asked the woman at the bar who had done that: she answered me pretty smartly, my Son. I asked her where her son was; she said he was not in the room, he was run away she could not tell where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing of her being present at the time this murder was done?</p>
               <p>Gamble. No, I thought it proper she should be secured, so I called a city officer, one Mr. Sands, and he took her to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire how the murder happened?</p>
               <p>Gamble. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman?</p>
               <p>Gamble. I knew her former husband, but this man, the deceased, I was little acquainted with. After this I went to my own watch house, and about one o'clock in the morning we heard that the boy was at the Three Jolly Butchers in Swan Alley, Goswel-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was she carried to the compter?</p>
               <p>Gamble. Between ten and eleven. We went and took the lad, whom we found in bed with his eldest brother. I brought the two boys to the watch-house; the little one, now at the Bar, cried and said he did it, that he threw a knife at him, and described the knife by saying there was How on the bride of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe him?</p>
               <p>Gamble. I could not tell now to think a child of his age could do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he kill'd the man ?</p>
               <p>Gamble. he said he did it. The lads were both committed to two separate prisons. After that we went before my Lord-mayor, who committed the woman and the little boy, and ordered the bigest boy to be detained; his name is George.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say?</p>
               <p>Gamble. When I asked her the question, she said her son did it, but did not say which son; which was the reason we took them both up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the woman afterwards?</p>
               <p>Gamble. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the boy at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Gamble. He told me he was ten years of age the first of this instant July.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say was the reason of his throwing the knife?</p>
               <p>Gamble. He said the man had been beating his mamma; and that he threaten'd to destroy her and him too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mother give you any reason why he threw it?</p>
               <p>Gamble. No, she gave me no reason at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the boy when he said this?</p>
               <p>Gamble. He was in the watch-house then, and very much.</p>
               <p>Q. from a Juryman. Was you refused admittance when you was at her room door?</p>
               <p>Gamble. I was not. There was a multitude of people at the house door, and I had much add to get through them to the door.</p>

            . I live in Golden-Lane, just by where this misfortune happened. On Sunday was se'n-night, about five in the evening, the two prisoners and the deceased came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Coombs. I keep a publick house. There was a young man along with them; dressed in black, who was reprimanding the deceased for his ill using the woman. and said if, any body was to use his mother in the manner he used far he'd crawl on his hands and knees to be down him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they quarrel then?</p>
               <p>Coombs. No, there was no quarrel in particular then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any blows?</p>
               <p>Coombs. No? the boy and woman went away about eight o'clock, and lost the deceased and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140017"/> man; they went away about nine, and in about half an hour after that I heard the deceased was murdered. I went to their room up stairs, and saw the deceased lying on the bed; his wound seem'd to have been dressed by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alive or dead when you went into the room?</p>
               <p>Coombs. I can't say which.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body there that could give any particular account how the man came by his death ?</p>
               <p>Coombs. No, only they said they had heard the Little boy had stabbed him.</p>
               <p>Q Did you not make enquiry of the woman or boy?</p>
               <p>Coombs. I never saw either of them afterwards till now.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other person's name that was with them at your house?</p>
               <p>Coombs. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know him if you saw him ?</p>

               <p>Q. Did the woman endeavour to avoid quarrelling?</p>
               <p>Coombs. I was not particular in my observations about that; they used my house, and have had words sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe in particular who used to be the aggressor ?</p>
               <p>Coombs. No.</p>

               <p>Pool. He said the boy's mother told him so. I went to Swan Alley in pursuit of him, but when we came there we found we were mistaken in the Swan Alley, for there we were told it was Swan Alley in Goswel Street. I went to the watch-house again, and about a quarter after one o'clock the beadle and watchmen brought the boy and his brother George to me. They told me they heard it was the son that did it, but which they did not know. I asked the eldest, named George, what he knew of the matter; and he declared he did not know any thing about it, but said his brother had told him he had murdered

Soon after they were in the room, his mother and Hughes had some words together, and that he was very much frightned because Hughes beat his mother, on which he took up a knife which cost two pence halfpenny. I asked him how he came to know the price so readily; he said, because he bought it. I asked him if he knew the knife again, I having one put into my hand; he said, that is it, and there was the name of How upon it, and it was the same which he threw at

               <p>Q. Where did he say it hit him?</p>
               <p>Pool. He said it stuck in his breast. I asked him where abouts; he said in or near his breast. I said, did you run away? he said he saw the blood come and then he ran away. I asked him if Hughes had a coat on, or was naked; he said he was button'd over the breast. I asked him where he ran to, he said to his brother, at the Three Jolly Butchers in Goswell-Street, where they took him and his brother out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what he had to say against George?</p>
               <p>Pool. I did; he said nothing at all. I took him to New-Prison, and sent George to Bridewell, and the next morning I took them before my Lord mayor. I was speaking to the constable about knife, and he told me there was another knife was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140018"/> likely to do the murder. He produceth another knife.

               <p>Pool. The other that I did not shew to the boy seem'd to be the knife. Note, it was a little rusty. (The jury looks at it.)</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this ?</p>

               <p>Purdon. No, he did not. He upstairs and as soon as he entered the room he cry'd out terribly, and made a mournful sort of a none, calling out, come mother, come away; and then ran down again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she come down?</p>
               <p>Purdon. No. The neighbours began to flock about the door, and four or five of them went up. I was one of the first, it was in a two pair of stairs room. The man lay on his back with his head in her lap, and her hand under his head. There was a great deal of blood on the floor. I ask'd what was the matter. She said he threaten'd to cut her throat, and her child had stab'd him. Then I went down to keep the mob out, I don't know how they proceeded farther.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy say he threaten'd to kill him and the mother, or only the mother?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the deceased a quarrelsome sort of a man?</p>
               <p>Purdon. I had not a great deal of acquaintance with him. They were but lately come to the house, and I thought to get rid of them as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a man in black in company with them?</p>
               <p>Purdon. I know nothing of any other man.</p>
               <p>William Sands. I was constable of the night, and hearing an out cry of murder I went to the deceased's room. Upon seeing him lie on the bed I took the woman into custody, and ask'd her if she was accessary to the murder. She said no. I ask'd her who did it. She said, her son Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you how he came to do it?</p>
               <p>Sands. No, she did not. We took her away, and as we were going through Cripplegate the people ask'd her what she was going to gaol for. She immediately reply'd, only for killing her husband. Her apron was bloody, and I ask'd her how she came by it. She said she received a blow at a house in Golden Lane. Then I proposed to take the apron from her, left she should wash it, and say she had no blood about her. After this I went to the house she told me of in Golden Lane; the landlord's name is Crowson. I ask'd him if there were any difference between the deceased and the prisoner there. He said, they had not words to occasioned. After that I went into the room again, to see if I could find the instrument that occasioned the man's death, where I found a knife which had a trifle of blood and some sat on the other side of it. (he lives in the two produced, and takes out that was not produced to Lewis) This is it.</p>

            . I was at my own door, a little way from where the deceased lived. I saw him go pass me between eight and nine that night, and in about five or six minutes the boy now at the bar came down stairs, and made a great uproar in the court; which the man belonging to the house chid him for, and bid him go up again. He went within the passage, whether he went up again or not, I can't tell; but in a little time he came out again, and cry'd out, mother come down, let's go to my brother, for I have done his job.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did she make?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. That I can't say. He ran down the court directly, and in about four minutes after I heard three or four heavy groans of a man.</p>
               <p>Q. from a juryman. How far was you from the house the deceased lived in?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. About five or six yards. [He describes it by the distance he stood, and a certain place in the court.] After that I went up, and saw the deceased lying in his blood on the ground. The woman at the bar had his head on her lap. I desired to see the wound. She pull'd his shirt away on his left breast, and shew'd me the wound; she then pull'd the shirt over it again, and I came down stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ask her who did it?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how he came by his death?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. No, she did not.</p>

            . I heard the woman at the bar say, the day before the murder, that Joseph Hughes went out with some work and brought the money home to her, and gave her two shillings and some halfpence (what I can't say) and kept half a crown in his pocket, and that he would spend it. Then the little boy went down to fetch a dram.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this ?</p>
               <p>E. Gwyn. It might be about five o'clock. When the boy was gone she said, if he did not give her that half crown she would see his liver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you heard this?</p>
               <p>E. Gwyn. It was in her own room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that?</p>
               <p>E. Gwyn. He made use of a very bad oath, and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an oath was it?</p>
               <p>E. Gwyn. It was blasting himself. She said, it he went into the skittle-ground she would go after him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. (He takes the two knives in his hand) I am very well assured this is the knife that made the wound. [N. B. That was the last knife produced by the officer, not that which was shewn the boy.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare the knife to the wound?</p>
               <p>Godman. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the knife penetrate ?</p>
               <p>Godman. The wound is betwixt the 4th and 5th rib, about half an inch in breadth, on the left side; it penetrated the thorax, and went obliquely towards the sternum, so deep as to penetrate the globe of the lungs, which must occasion present death, by the great effusion of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you conceive the boy at the bar at the distance of three or four yards could do this?</p>
               <p>Godman. It does not tally with my reason at all. I think it must be done by somebody's hand; it penetrated quite into the substance of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the man had stood up, whether a boy of that age could throw a knife so as to penetrate in that manner the wound was given?</p>
               <p>Godman. From the best idea I can form of it, I think the man was stooping, and I believe the whole blade of the knife was buried in his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the knife appear to have gone through a coat and waistcoat ?</p>
               <p>Godman. He was naked when I opened him. I observed the knife was covered with fat, and there is a part of fat in a man's body in that place where he received the wound.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what age is the boy at the bar ?</p>

               <p>The deceased went out that morning, and return'd between three and four o'clock; he then asked me to go with him a little way; I said I had no money, and he desired me to go and borrow some for him of the landlord. I sent the child to him, and he sent me a shilling. I gave it him, and we went to the Three Jolly Butchers. We had some words before we came home, and he said he had a good mind to stick me. We went to Mr. Crowson's, he began to quarrel with me there, and kick'd me over the legs several times. I made an excuse to go to the necessary house, and there staid and drop'd him. Then I desired the woman to tell my son. Lewis I was gone to the King's Head near Cripplegate. I went there, the deceased came to me, and gave me a punch on the head, and made my nose bleed; when we came home he pull'd me about the room by the hair of my head, and said he would kill us both. How the knife came to be thrown I know no more than the child unborn, I never saw it till he fell.</p>

            . I went to the Black Raven in Golden Lane with the deceased and the woman at the bar; they had some words, and he gave her a kick or two there. She said to me, Tom, will you give me part of a pint? I told her I would. She said she'd go to the King's Head, near Cripplegate; she went out with an excuse to go to the necessary house. She went there, I went to her, and the deceased came in and gave her a punch on the nose, which made the blood come, and some of it fell upon her apron. I got up, paid for the pint of beer, and we all three went out. He said as he went up Redcross-Street that he'd lick her; I endeavoured to persuade him not, and they seemed very sociable when I left them.</p>

            . The prisoner came to sell my husband, the deceased, some birds, on the 16th of August last, about six or seven o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. I live <placeName id="t17560714-26-crimeloc138">next door to the Bishop of Ely's Head , in a cellar in Holbourn</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was your husband's business?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. He <rs id="t17560714-26-viclabel139" type="occupation">dealt in birds, being a cripple</rs>

I said, sure you would not, take your answer and go about your business, we do not want any birds. He directly put a crab tree stick down into the window, and broke a cage that hung there. I went to push him away from doing farther damage. My husband came up stairs, and the prisoner made no more to do but put the crab-tree stick over my shoulder, and push'd his eye out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do to him?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. I only push'd him away from the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the stick?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. I believe it might be about two yards and a half long.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was your husband to you?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. He was pretty near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which eye did it go into?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. His left eye. My husband said, Stop the rogue, my eye is out. I directly turn'd my head, and saw the blood and jelly of his eye running down his cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shove did you give him?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. Only with very good manners, and desired him to walk away. After this I followed him, and with assistance took him, and carried him before justice Fielding, who committed him to New-prison. But about ten at night he had the impudence to come and call down the cellar, saying, So, my lord, I am got clear. At that time nobody expected my husband's life a minute together.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means did he get out of prison?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. I don't know that. I dressed my husband's eye with white of eggs and rose-water, for having a great family, and great rent to pay, I could not afford to go to a surgeon. From that time he never was well, nor ever held up his head; be was always complaining of his eye, and a shooting in his head.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. He died the last day of March last. A few hours before he died he said to me, My dear, hang that rogue, for he is the death of me; he never could do any thing after, but I maintained him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by that rogue?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. That was

               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. I think the blow on his eye was. He never had a convulsion fit till the time of the hurt of his eye, and after that he had such strong convulsion fits that several people were obliged to hold him.</p>
               <p>Q. What state of health was he in before?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. He was in a very good one before that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The deceased ran up stairs, and struck me two or three times</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband strike the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. He never struck him, nor gave him a word in anger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband punch him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140023"/>S. Roberts. No, nor touch him neither.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He follow'd me 9 or 10 yards.</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. My husband was not two yards from the door, when it was done.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a strong, or what sort of a stick was it?</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. It was a stick hard enough to run thro' a man's head instead of his eye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said if he would have no birds he might let it alone; then he ran up stairs with a stick and struck me. I said, what did he do that for. He said, if I did not like it, he'd give me another.</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. As I hope to be saved my husband did neither strike nor push him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She also shoved me from the stall.</p>
               <p>S. Roberts. I had then two children in my arms, I could not shove him with violence.</p>

             was a tenant of mine, he had a room under my shop. I stood in my own shop and heard some words between the prisoner and evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. What words?</p>
               <p>Powel. I can't tell what words.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they angry words?</p>
               <p>Powel. They were. She endeavour'd to keep the prisoner from her birds as well as she could, and he was for knocking the cages about. She had two children in her arms, and could not possibly keep him away. Then the poor fellow he deceased came up; he was a poor object, a lame discrepid poor creature as one shall look at. There were some words passed between them, and in a very little time I saw a great slick push'd with the prisoner's right hand, darted as it were thro' his left hand thumb and fore finger. He made a motion the first time, and the second it went into the deceased's eye. The deceased's back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it seem to be level'd at his eye ?</p>
               <p>Powel. It did. the deceased directly drop'd down, as he was endeavouring to get up to the prisoner, seemingly to lay hold on him. He cry'd out in a terrible agony after his eye was out. He was carried down into his cellar, and put upon his bed. I went down, and we got a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his wife ?</p>
               <p>Powel. She was then gone before the justice with the prisoner. The surgeon wiped the congealed blood and stuff away, and said we had better take him to the hospital, saying, there was something broke and the sight of the eye gone, and that it would be of bad consequence</p>
               <p>Q. What was the surgeon name?</p>
               <p>Powel. His name is Blackwell.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it appear to you?</p>
               <p>Powel. It was very bloody, and the sight appeared to be out. He had such strong convulsions with the agony, that several people could hardly hold him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased offer to strike or push the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Powel. No, I did not; he did not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Powel. He lived I believe five or six months afterwards, and then died.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a stick was it done with?</p>
               <p>Powel. It was a long crab stick, five foot high, with knots upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you was out at the door when you saw the stick push'd in his eye?</p>
               <p>Powel. I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see it there?</p>
               <p>Powel. I could very easily. The prisoner stood on one side the channel, and the deceased on the other, about three or four yards from the door.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Powel's shop, and saw the deceased come out of the cellar. They had words about something before, but I do not know what. I saw the prisoner thrust his slick in the deceased's eye; they had a little scuffle together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who began the scuffle ?</p>
               <p>Scott. The prisoner offered to strike at the deceased's bird-cages, and the deceased endeavoured to prevent it: The prisoner went towards him, and put the stick in his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the deceased endeavour to prevent him?</p>

               <p>Scott. He closed with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by closing?</p>
               <p>Scott. To hinder him from hurting the birds.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Scott. He laid hold on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blows struck?</p>
               <p>Scot. I saw the prisoner strike at the deceased but once.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of that?</p>
               <p>Scott. I did not go out of Mr. Powel's shop; what passed in the street I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the deceased lay hold on the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Scott. He did not endeavour to strike him, but to prevent him from destroying his birds.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I came out of the cellar, or was only standing at the door?</p>
               <p>Scott. He came out of the cellar.</p>

             to the question. He was only on the cellar stairs.</p>
               <p>John Brown. The deceased was always in pain and misery thro' this misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the time it was done?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his eye?</p>
               <p>Brown. It was exceeding large, and ready to come out of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it bruised or bloody?</p>
               <p>Brown. It was red all round it; he cry'd out often with the pain and anguish of it, and at last said that was the death of him, which were the last words I heard him speak.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the death of him?</p>
               <p>Brown. That blow on his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention who gave him the blow?</p>
               <p>Brown. He mentioned the name of John - I can't remember the other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I do not</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after he said these words?</p>
               <p>Brown. He died in a few hours after, I believe in about four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether the deceased did not go a catching of birds last Michaelmas, after the time he had the hurt, and about his other business?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him catch birds in that time?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I did not see him, but I know he was out.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Had he no other distemper about a fortnight before he died?</p>
               <p>Brown. No. none.</p>

             During the deceased's illness he always complained of his head, and about his eye; he said he thought that was the occasion of his death, and that rogue had killed him.</p>

               <p>My partner went down into the cellar to him, with intent to sell him some birds. I stood by the stall, and his wife was by me. My partner came up and said he will not have any. I said, then he may jet it alone; on which his wife shoved me from the stall. I asked her what she meant by that, and shoved her against a table; he then came running up with a stick and struck me. I said, what is that for; he said if you don't like that I'll give you another. Then I took the stick out of his hands, but in twisting to get it from him, as it turn'd betwixt us, it struck him some how on one side of his eye. I was tried at Hicks's-Hall for the same offence, and ordered to be confined a year in Newgate, out of which I have been there ten months.</p>
               <p>N. B. That indictment was laid only as a misdemeanor.</p>

            . I keep a stall at the corner of Hatton-Garden, and live at Mrs. Carpenter's, a butcher, in Chick-Lane. I was coming by the deceased's house and heard a noise; I saw Mrs. Roberts (I never saw the prisoner, or the deceased before) she said to the prisoner, you dog, you kick my bird cages about! you shall not. She had two children, one under each arm; there was a woman had a board with old books on it, and she put the children on that; she immediately collar'd the man, and he to get clear of her pushed her against an old table, which fell down; he got from her, and went as far as the Bishop of Ely's Head, when Roberts came out of the cellar, and ran after him; I met him, turn'd back, and saw them both have hold of a stick, struggling, and twisting it backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Roberts a stick in his hand as he ran?</p>
               <p>M. Whitehouse. He had not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>M. Whitehouse. No, not till the woman cried out, and said her husband's eye was injured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she cry out before they had both hold of the stick, or after?</p>
               <p>M. Whitehouse. It was when they had hold of the stick.</p>

               <p>M. Whitehouse. I did, and he then spit in my face, because I appeared against him at Hicks's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>M. Whitehouse. I sell fruit and oisters, and in prejudice to me they have hindered me of my bread as much as they could.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember their being married?</p>
               <p>Shields. I do. It was in the precinct of the Savoy, I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were married there ?</p>
               <p>Shields. Because the young man, who was a fellow servant of mine, came to me in the morning, said they were going to be married, and ask'd me to give the young woman away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her away ?</p>
               <p>Shields. I stood father, and saw the ceremony performed as in the church of England.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Shields. It was in the morning about 9 o'clock, on the 25th of November, 1754.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else by at the time?</p>

            , who went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement with the minister previous to the marriage ?</p>
               <p>Shields. I went to Mr. Wilkinson who now stands at the bar, to agree for them to be married.</p>
               <p>Q. What agreement did you and he make?</p>
               <p>Shields. We agreed for a guinea; Mr. Wilkinson said he generally had a guinea and a half: I said they were poor people's children, and could not afford any more than a guinea; and for that it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. And were they married?</p>
               <p>Shields. They were really married, to my thinking as lawfully as ever I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they were married, what did he say to the young people?</p>
               <p>Shields. He asked them where they lived; they told him at the Old-Bargehouse in Surrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140027"/>Q. Did he ask them their ages?</p>
               <p>Shields. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer was made to that ?</p>
               <p>Shields. The young man was of age, and the young woman not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of their parents there?</p>
               <p>Shields. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who married them?</p>
               <p>Shields. They were instantly married by Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you see a licence?</p>
               <p>Shields. I did not see it sign'd, but I saw what they call'd a licence fill'd up after the marriage.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they neighbours children?</p>
               <p>Shields. They were, but I live at Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had the consent of their parents?</p>
               <p>Shields. I know they had; I have often been in company with her father, and have heard him give his consent.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went to be married, whether the reverend gentleman asked her age?</p>
               <p>Shields. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon her telling him her age, whether he did not say he could not marry her without the consent of her parents?</p>
               <p>Shields. He did so.</p>

               <p>Council for the prisoner. (He takes it in his hand) Here is wrote upon is a memorandum, that shews there was that consent signified; did you look upon it to be a lawful marriage, when you went about it?</p>
               <p>Shields. Indeed I did</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Did you think Mr. Wilkinson had a right to marry by licence?</p>
               <p>Shields. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. So much the greater crime in the man that deceived them.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Did you imagine this to be a place to marry lawfully at?</p>

               <p>Shields. No.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Did he not seem to act with the greatest caution?</p>
               <p>Shields. He did.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Do you think he married them with that caution, and his behaviour was so decent, that he would not have committed such an act if he had thought it illegal.</p>
               <p>Shields. Indeed I don't think he would have married them, if he had thought it illegal.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Before the marriage, what writing did you see sign'd?</p>
               <p>Shields. There was a writing with Mr. Wilkinson's name on it fill'd up after the marriage.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. By whom was it filled up?</p>

               <p>M. Weeks. They had, by Mr. Wilkinson. There was something wrote in it, but I can't remember what I went along with them the Sunday before to Mr. Shields's house, to enquire whether such was a lawful marriage; he said, he had heard say it was as lawful a marriage as any in England; and Mr. Shields mentioning it to Mr. Wilkinson that they were afraid the marriage was not lawful, the Doctor said it was as lawful as any marriage in England.</p>

               <p>Council for the crown. There was a thing produced, whether there was any thing wrote on it before or after the marriage?</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. I want to know by whose authority you sent to demand the register of me.</p>
               <p>Latter. In the year 1755 Mr. Wilkinson ordered a new register book; as it was not paid for, the person that sold it came to me, I being chapel warden. I told him I was not certain whether I had a right to pay for it, as it was in the Doctor's hands, but said I would enquire about it. I called a vestry to have the consent of the inhabitants, and the people ordered the vestry clerk to write, to know if Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140029"/> Wilkinson would deliver up this register or not. If he did I was to pay for it, and it not he was to pay for it himself. I was told he would not give up any book belonging to the chapel. This was on the 10th of October, and on the 15th I received this note from the doctor's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. By whose authority did you act?</p>
               <p>Latter. By Mr. Gibson's insisting upon my paying for the book, so I sent for it.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Before the late act of parliament who used to keep the register?</p>
               <p>Latter. I really can't tell. The old register used to be in the old clerk's hands, but after he died the chapel warden used to keep them.</p>
               <p>Q. Till what time?</p>
               <p>Latter. I believe till about four years ago, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you ever know one chapel warden to make an entry of one marriage, burying, or christening, or whether it is not customary for the minister to keep the register?</p>
               <p>Latter. I should think the officers should have it in their power, as well as the minister, to keep the register.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you served any office in the Precinct?</p>

               <p>Q. What was the repute of granting licences, whether they were granted by the minister of the place, or by licences granted by the bishop?</p>

I remember the king's letter being ordered to be read in the chapel (I believe about ten years ago) and a collection to be made there, and also from house to house; I was in office then, and we paid it into the chamber of London: when the king's bounty was distributed, there was nothing allow'd to the Savoy, therefore I desired Dr. Wilkinson would be so good as to write to the bishop of London, which he did, and the bishop sent a letter, specifying that it was out of his jurisdiction, and he could do nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Was there at that time a collection in all parishes?</p>
               <p>Chease. There was in all parishes, and it was to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140031"/> be distributed to every parish; we paid in our collection, and expected the same as another place.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Then it was your opinion by common repute before?</p>
               <p>Chease. It was, but I was more so confirm'd by the bishop's letter.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. How long have you known Dr. Wilkinson ?</p>
               <p>Chease. I have known him twenty-seven or twenty-eight years.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. What is your opinion of him, has he behaved as a minister of the church of England?</p>
               <p>Chease. I never knew him behave otherwise; he always continued doing his duty, and is as capable of it as any man at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Chease. I never heard any ill of him.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Did you ever know any probates of wills there?</p>
               <p>Chease. No.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Nor administrations?</p>
               <p>Chease. No.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Before the late act of parliament, did you ever hear of a marriage there by licence?</p>
               <p>Chease. I can't say I ever saw a marriage there before or since.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Are you the man that made the affidavit concerning Mr. Wilkinson?</p>
               <p>Chease. I am, but not with regard to his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. What! not that he was a drunken man?</p>
               <p>Chease. No, it was quite a different thing.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Was it nothing about the bell?</p>
               <p>Chease. There was a change of one bell for another.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Did not you complain about his taking the bell from the chappel?</p>
               <p>Chease. I did not complain of him in that affidavit.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it wrote before they were married?</p>
               <p>Philips. It was, and read to them; and they consented to it: and it was required of them that they should make affidavit.</p>
               <p>Q. Affidavit to what?</p>
               <p>Philips. With regard to their parents.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the memorandem on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Philips. (He looks at it.) This was wrote at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it wrote by?</p>
               <p>Philips. It was wrote by me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the purport of the memorandum?</p>
               <p>Philips. It is purporting the consent of the parents.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that wrote?</p>
               <p>Philips. About an hour after the marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the marriage ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any caution used by Mr. Wilkinson to know whether they had the consent of the parents, she being under age?</p>
               <p>Philips. Mr. Shields and a woman were present, and they declared the parents consented, upon Mr. Wilkinson's asking that question.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Philips. I am the chapel clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been clerk?</p>
               <p>Philips. About six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you came there?</p>
               <p>Philips. I lived in several places before I came there. I had lived in Surry Street about seven years before I went to be clerk.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard any account of what was the nature of the Savoy Precinct?</p>
               <p>Philips. I always heard it was a royal jurisdiction, exempt from the bishop of London, before I went there; and when I went there I became better acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any licences granted before the late act of parliament?</p>
               <p>Philips. I do, of a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of inspecting the old register?</p>
               <p>Philips. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the time you came there, did there or did there not appear to be several marriages, and the licences granted by Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think he had a power to do it?</p>
               <p>Philips. Because they were done in a publick manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the couple's friends use to come along with them?</p>
               <p>Philips. Sometimes they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Mr. Wilkinson was threatened by she diocesan court or commons for granting licences.</p>
               <p>Philips. Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140032"/>Q. Do you believe that any of the surrogates were acquainted with this act of notoriety of marrying with licences?</p>
               <p>Philips. I never heard they were.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. As you observed this licence was wrote before the marriage, were they always wrote before the marriage?</p>
               <p>Philips. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the manner of those licences that were given when marriages were performed by somebody else?</p>
               <p>Philips. They were left with me, or the minise; they were always wrote and sign'd by him before the marriage was solemnized.</p>
               <p>Q. What those whom other ministers married, was not there a blank left for the names?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after the marriage did or did you not fill up the blank?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes, always before the marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they always filled up before the marriage when celebrated by other people?</p>
               <p>Philips. They were always filled up before the marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not they filled up in the vestry afterward?</p>
               <p>Philips. How could that be?</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you prove that on which Grierson was convicted was filled up an hour afterwards in the vestry?</p>
               <p>Philips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, was this blank filled up before the ceremony or after?</p>
               <p>Philips. Before, I remember this very thing very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure?</p>
               <p>Philips. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Who read it over to them?</p>
               <p>Philips. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are clerk, have you attended those marriages which were solemnized by Mr. Grierson the little time he was there?</p>
               <p>Philips. I did, all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many marriages were solemnized at the Savoy, between the passing of the late act of parliament, and the indictments against the prisoner being found?</p>
               <p>Philips. About 1400. There were a great many married for nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them might be inhabitants within the precinct of the Savoy?</p>
               <p>Philips. I can't tell, a great many qualified themselves by living there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were out of the precinct?</p>
               <p>Philips. I concluded that about 900 of them came from out of the country big with child.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the precinct of the Savoy a large place?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, it is not a large place.</p>
               <p>Q. How many families are there in it?</p>
               <p>Philips. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there more than forty?</p>
               <p>Philips. There may be forty or fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know a probate of a will granted there in your time?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, never.</p>
               <p>Council. Nor a letter of administration?</p>
               <p>Philips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any marriage in your time by licence from the bishop of London, or some prerogative?</p>
               <p>Philips. There have been some few.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pitch upon a particular fact of one licence, before the making of the late act of parliament, granted by him?</p>
               <p>Philips. There are a couple.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you them here?</p>
               <p>Philips. I have not them about me. I believe there are two here, but I do not know who has them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your register book?</p>
               <p>Philips. It is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these by licence from the bishop of London?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes, and Mr. Wilkinson married them.</p>

               <p>M. Williams. I have seen numbers married by him by his own licence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the constant repute he had for having power of granting licences himself?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. I can't tell what to say to that, he married most by his own licences. People have come with licences from the commons, and he has not refused to marry them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he married with his own licences?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. I have seen him marry numbers with them.</p>

               <p>M. Williams. They were parchment, and I have seen my father write on them and fill them up.</p>

               <p>M. Williams. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear he met with any animadversion from the bishop or surrogates ?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. No, I never did indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you upon your oath say your father married many people at different times by licences granted by himself?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. Upon my oath he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years may that be ago?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. He has been dead about thirty years, Mr. Wilkinson buried him; he was reader to one Mr. Parry, who committing a great many misdemeanors was taken out of the Savoy, and my father succeeded him.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father minister of the Savoy immediately before Mr. Wilkinson?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. He was, and was minister sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he was minister appointed by the treasury?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. You are certainly mistaken; Dr. Pratt was first, Dr. Parry succeeded him, and Dr. Wilkinson succeeded Parry.</p>
               <p>M. Williams. My father call'd himself the minister; he acted in Dr. Parry's time. As he died in low circumstances my mother went to have her paper sign'd for her pension, and Parry said her husband was not the minister.</p>
               <p>Q. Who succeeded Dr. Parry?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. Dr. Wilkinson.</p>

            . I am captain in the third regiment of guards, and have known Mr. Wilkinson about sixteen years. His general character is that of a gentleman, and an excellent preacher in his profession. I have known, when there has been any soldier who has not been able to pay for burying or christening their children, that he has chearfully done it, and attended them in their and their wives sickness.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a salary for that?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you ever hear I was a disaffected person?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, never.</p>
               <p>Capt. Haywood. I have known him between eleven and twelve years, he is my next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his conduct and behaviour, in regard to his function as minister of the Savoy, and all other respects, during the time you have known him?</p>
               <p>Haywood. He always behaved in a good manner. I loved to go to hear him. He behaved very well to me; as to other affairs I have nothing to say to them, I never had any dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a good or a bad character?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I never heard any body say amiss of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Delaporte. Mr. Wilkinson told me, that Mr. Brooks, his former attorney, had used him very ill. I have received three-score guineas in order to defend him; upon which an action was brought against Mr. Brooks. There was a motion made in the court of commons pleas, which application took up two terms; there was a rule made, and my lord chief justice order'd Mr. Brooks to return forty guineas and pay the cost, upon seeing the extravagancy of the bill. Mr. Wilkinson always declared himself ready to surrender, as soon as ever he got his papers out of Mr. Brooks's hands. (He takes a paper in his hand.) I received this order the 24th of February, and made enquiry about the out-lawry. This is the substance of what I took from the sheriff's books for the county of Middlesex. I found the out-lawry would not be compleated till September, so I advised him not to surrender till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have been prepared with his defence before now?</p>
               <p>Delaporte. Yes, I believe he could last sessions; that he did not surrender, was by my advice. Mr. Sergeant

             having been retained for him, and not being able to attend this court, was the reason he did not take his trial then.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been concern'd for him?</p>
               <p>Delaporte. But a little before I gave notice to Mr. Sharp, which was in August 1755.</p>
               <p>Q. What papers have this day been used that were in the hands of Mr. Brooks ?</p>
               <p>Delaporte. Not one. I thought there were some material ones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A brief could not have been formed, had I not been served with every paper which I can now produce. My whole brief is an extract from papers. When I came from abroad I expected my brief was prepared, and was for giving notice of trial. I did not see my attorney for six weeks after, and he secreted my papers. I was told by gentlemen that I should not have a brief prepared in twelve months, so I went to this gentleman. Synge was minister of the Savoy, but Dr. Pratt was not. Where the new church stands now, there it was the inhabitants met. Dr. Pratt was lecturer, and preached always in the afternoon, and the lords of the treasury never once appointed him minister. I have now eight years in arrear, and am 500 l. out of pocket. The Lutheran minister (I speak feelingly) shall receive 40 l. a year, the quakers meeting shall be chearfully repaired, but the church of England chapel is scarce fit for a stable. I know, my lord, what is the foundation, and the bitterness of this prosecution; why - because I know too much of the tricks of some people. I know how this arises; there are estates appropriated for this use, but they are sunk, and become the subjects of rapine and plunder. I married this way occasionally for 28 years, that woman's father was minister, and I lived in the house with him. As to 1400 couple, I don't know how the clerk came to make that blunder. I have not married 1400 in thirty, years. This woman was confounded, and she could not distinguish minister from lecturer. I acquainted. Mr. Sharp, that if he would pay me the 1300 l. due<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140035"/> to me, I would quit the place. This prosecution has been carried on with the utmost unrelenting malice. I acquainted the archbishop of Canterbury I was willing to give up all, on having my arrears paid. Murder has been bail'd, treason has been bail'd, but I could not be bail'd.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. You never surrender'd</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I knew the consequence of that too well.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. They have brought it down only to the year 1724, of a marriage by a licence from the bishop of London. I directed search to be made in the offices for granting licences, and there are a vast number of licences for marriages in the Savoy by the bishop of London and the bishop of Canterbury. I shall only read one or two of them.</p>

               <p>Council for the prisoner. Whether you don't know there is a sacred place that is called by the name of St. Mary le Savoy, distinct from the chapel of St. John Baptist?</p>

Whilst they were fighting the two seconds quarrel'd. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140036"/> prisoner challenged the other with foul play, and they went to fighting.

            . I saw Ingram and Whiticker quarrelling about a wager. The deceased was second to Whiticker, and the prisoner to Ingram. In the battle I perceived the prisoner to strike the deceased, on which the deceased went and strip'd, but I was looking at the other two, and did not see the prisoner and deceased begin. I saw the deceased after he was down, and I believe I had seen them fight ten minutes. A surgeon was fetch'd, and he prick'd the deceased, but he bled but little, and never spoke more.</p>

               <p>I went in to see for my mate. I am a sawyer. I saw Ingram and Whiticker strike one another with their cloaths on, and then they both strip'd. I went and laid hold of Ingram, and insisted they should not fight; we work together. Then the deceased came and called me many bitter names, and said there was no reason for my preventing them if they had a mind to fight, and pull'd my arm away. They went to fighting. They had not been fighting two minutes before the deceased came and struck me, and said I used foul play. He went and strip'd, and came to me again; I was not for fighting at first, but then I pull'd off my shirt. He knock'd me down several times, and we fought many minutes before this thing happened; how I gave it him, whether by a blow or a fall, I can't say. I did not endeavour to injure him any more than a person does in common fighting. When I found he was dead, I went and a quainted my officer with it, as I am a soldier, and afterwards came and surrendered to take my trial.</p>

            . I was there near the beginning; it was concerning a trifling bet at nine pins, whether a person bowl'd even or odd, betwixt Ingram and Whiticker. I saw them scuffling on the ground for the money; they push'd one another, and agreed to go to fighting. The prisoner went up to Ingram, and desired him not to fight. The deceased insisted upon it that they should fight, and said to the prisoner, you are a cowardly fellow; if you will not fight, you ought to let them that will. Then the prisoner said to Ingram, Dick, if you have a mind to fight him you shall, and if you have a mind not, you shall not; notwithstanding that, to fighting they went. After a little time a dispute arose between the deceased and the prisoner concerning foul play. In the interim Whiticker was beat by Ingram. Then the deceased said to Whiticker, if you'll but fight and beat him. I will lick the soldier, (meaning the prisoner.) After that they went to fighting again, and in a few minutes Ingram gave out. A little after that I turned about, and saw the prisoner and the deceased in a sort of a scuffle, I believe there were two or three blows struck; which struck first I don't know. They parted immediately, and the deceased went down to the end of the yard to a water-tub, wash'd his face, and drank some of the water. He then pull'd off his shirt, delivered it to a woman, and went up to the ground, saying these words, if you are a man turn out and fight me, it you don't I'll lick you. The prisoner was seemingly unwilling to fight. At last he pull'd off his cloaths, upon the other's urging him. When they had been fighting five or six minutes the man that was to have been the prisoner's second was pull'd away by the populace; after that he was seconded by two or three, whoever could lay on him when he was down first. At the end of I believe eighteen or twenty minutes of very severe fighting the deceased was very weak, and the prisoner struck him a blow with his right hand on the left side his head (I can't say whether it was above or below his ear) when he made a kind of a small stagger about six foot in length, clap'd his hand to a small tree and eased himself to the ground. The prisoner walked then to the bottom of the yard to the water tub, and wash'd himself. A surgeon was sent for to bleed the deceased. He was prick'd, and bled but little. I believe at that time he was very near dead,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140037"/> he never spoke afterwards. The landlord was very desirous to have them parted when they were fighting, but the friends of each were for their having it out. I have known the prisoner between four and five years, he is a very good natur'd honest man; I never heard a miss word from him, nor saw him apt to quarrel, nor heard of his fighting before this.</p>

            . I went to speak to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who not being at home I went into that ground to wait. Hearing a noise, I went towards them, and saw one man strip'd and the other pulling his shirt off. While they were fighting, I saw the deceased strike the prisoner, and call'd him blackguard or scoundrel. and said he did not shew fair play. After that they parted, the deceased went about twenty yards from the prisoner, came up to him again, and they had a fair let to as they call it. After some time the deceased received a violent blow. I was obliged to keep at a distance, having received a hurt on my foot by a piece of timber. The landlord did all in his power to prevent their fighting, but there were ill natur'd people enough to set them on. I saw the deceased fall, and thought he was beat; it was an indifferent thing to me which was beat, being strangers to me, so were the whole company. In a little time after I heard the man was dying; then a surgeon was sent for, who prick'd him, and there came about half a teaspoon full of blood out; he never spake after.</p>

On the 9th of June we had some goods for Bristol, and some in a chest that came from Mr. Amian, on Lawrence-Poultney Hill On the 19th of June the barge lay at my wharf; I was call'd up on Sunday morning the 20th of June; my servant told me I had been rob'd. I went and found the chest broke open, and saw some of the bargemen I ask'd them who had been their watchmen to night. They said we. I sent my boy away to Mrs. Mahone, and my clerk to Mr. Amian, Mr. Shailer who I master of the barge came. I got a search warrant to search the barge that lay off my wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Downs. Out of 150 pieces of cloth in the chest, I missed four pieces. On searching the barge, the bargemen came on board. We found nothing in the barge. The same day about twelve o'clock Sunderland went from on board his barge with one of the bargemen in it, in a sculler, to Pepper Alley. When I came to take in the goods out of the barge, Shailer call'd out to the men, hire you Pepper Alley man, which gave me suspicion; so I went to Pepper-Alley, and ask'd at the sanding place if they saw any of the men (meaning the prisoners at the bar) land there. A man said, he remember'd seeing such men land there; and described Pitman as well as any painter could paint him, and said they had some bundles of cloth under their arms. Then I got a warrant, and took the prisoners up</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the goods again?</p>
               <p>Downs. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you fix a charge upon these persons ?</p>
               <p>Downs. Because the barge lay at my wharf, and they being watchmen, had any body else came they must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the goods your property?</p>
               <p>Downs. I have got a bill and receipt that I paid for them; as they lay on my wharf I was to make them good.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this chest fastened ?</p>
               <p>Downs. It was a Hamburgh chest, nailed very strong, and corded.</p>

            . I am servant at the Bear at the Bridge-foot. I was weeping my master's yard between seven and eight o'clock on a Sunday morning, when blackman and Pitman came thro' the yard, and I swept it into one of their shoes; he turn'd about and damn'd me, and as he turn'd about I saw three pieces of linen under his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was that?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140038"/>Dupree. That was Blackman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow them ?</p>
               <p>Dupree. No, I did not. The prosecutor came and enquired if I saw such people, and I described them. When they were taken up Blackman desired having any piece of cloth at all, or being out of his master's barge at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What said Pitman ?</p>
               <p>Dupree. He said he was asleep under the tilt; after he said he was walking about, and that he never went through our yard that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was this linen ?</p>
               <p>Dupree. I did not see the length of it, I took it to be two feet wide.</p>
               <p>Q. to Downs. What is the width of the linen you missed ?</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Downs. On the 20th of last month our maid came to our window, and said we had been robbed. I went down on the wharf, and found the chest broke open. I asked one of the bargemen who were watchmen that night; he said, what is that to me. Then I went and inform'd my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the wharf did their barge lie?</p>
               <p>Wallis. It lay so near that they could get out of their barge upon our wharf. I should think they must know something about it, because nobody could come over the barge without their knowledge. I remember I heard the barge-master call out to these men, and say, hollow, you Pepper-Alley man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these men alone at the time?</p>
               <p>Wallis. No, there were several barge men on board the barge then.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Pepper Alley?</p>
               <p>Wallis. It is a place where they buy second hand cloaths and things.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the chest broke?</p>
               <p>Wallis. It was open'd with something like a crow. and the cord was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mark of a crow?</p>

               <p>Q. What happened at his going out ?</p>
               <p>E. Craggs. He brought with him a steak, which I dressed for his breakfast. He eat it, and went out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you hear Sunderland say any thing before the alderman ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Sunderland said there he had nothing to do with it; that he went out of the house where he lodged on the Sunday morning between eight and nine: and Mrs. Craggs said he went out very early, returned again, and had a beef sleak for his breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Craggs. Did he go out twice that morning?</p>
               <p>E. Craggs. He went out in the morning, and brought a steak in his hand, and I dressed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out first?</p>
               <p>E. Craggs. I can't tell what time he went out; when I was in bed I heard him, but cannot tell the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Mention what he said before the alderman ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he went from home between eight and nine o'clock to Mrs. Mahone's, and went on board a barge, and was not at home till betwixt ten and eleven at night, when he went immediately to bed.</p>

               <p>Shailer. Their general character is very honest: I never knew them accused of any thing before a justice in my life before. Pitman lived with me before he was able to work.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom do you imagine the chest was broke open, considering the situation of your barge ?</p>
               <p>Shailer. Some body got at it, but which way God knows, for I know not. They might have went over the lighters that lay near the wharf: They lay nearer the wharf than my barge.</p>
