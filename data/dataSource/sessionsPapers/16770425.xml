Also a horrid murder was in Easter week committed in the Hay-market by Charing-cross, where a Hackney-Coachman falling out with his Wife about their Horses going to work, in his devilish fury got up a Fire fork, and therewith stabb'd her into the head and several parts of the body, of which wounds, after neer a weeks languishing, she died, and by the Coroners Inquest on the 26th instant it was found wilful Murther; but the Husband immediately after the blows given, made his escape, and is not since heard of.</p>
