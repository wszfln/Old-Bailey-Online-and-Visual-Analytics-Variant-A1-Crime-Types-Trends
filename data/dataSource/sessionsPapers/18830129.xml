                  </hi>. I did live at 6, Paris Street, Lambeth, I now live at 7, Argyle Villas, Reading—I am a clerk—I saw this adver<lb/>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "Clerk, collector, and canvasser wanted at once in a limited company to canvass and receive subscriptions and shares, salary 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, with commission. A security of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash required. Apply personally to Baker and Gordon, 25, Garrick Street, London, W. C."—in consequence of seeing that I applied at 25, Garrick Street. Covent Garden—I there saw the two defendants—I said I had come in answer to an advertisement I had seen in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> adver<lb/>tising for a clerk and collector to a limited company—Gordon said it was the London General Cab Company, and told me all particulars, and said it would be necessary to deposit a sum of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as security for my honesty, and at the end of the employment the money was to be returned—I told</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This expressed the writers willingness to enter the company's service and stated that he would bring up the deposit receipt on Monday.</hi>)—I received this reply dated 18th November, 1882, enclosing this prospectus—I subsequently ascertained that the letter was in Gordon's handwriting—I have seen him write—on 20th November I called at Garrick Street and there saw both the defendants—I said I had come to commence business, and that I had brought my deposit receipt as security. (<hi rend="italic">The receipt was dated October</hi> 30, 1882, <hi rend="italic">from the Reading branch of the London and County Bank for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—Gordon took it up in the presence of Baker—he gave me this receipt for it: "Received, 20th November, 1882, of Mr. Gladden, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be held as security on behalf of the London General Cab Company whilst Mr. Gladden is in our employ"—Gordon wrote that in Baker's presence and read it aloud—he then explained to me my duties, which would be to collect money for this company and canvass for shares—he then produced this agreement and asked me to sign it—I did so and handed him the deposit receipt—he told me to call next morning to commence business—I went there at 10 next morning—I found the prisoners there—Gordon then said, "I find this deposit receipt will be of no use to the company unless it is signed, and a notice of withdrawal"—I said I should not think of doing anything of the kind, that the receipt was virtually cash, and "if I sign this you can draw my money"—he said "Oh, that is perfectly absurd, I should not think of drawing your money"—I said "I shan't sign it"—he said "Oh, but you must sign it"—he then called in a man named Bill, whose name he subsequently said was Leroche—I think he was an odd man in the office—he placed the paper before me, and after some hesitation I signed it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a notice of withdrawal.</hi>) Baker was present at the time; Gordon took the paper—I then entered on the can<lb/>vassing business and continued for about a fortnight—nobody ever took any shares—I tried a little to get them to, believing it was a genuine concern for a couple of days—on 27th November I gave the week's notice to leave in consequence of what I heard, and left at the end of the week—Gordon paid me my wages for one week, and Baker for another—on 4th December, in the presence of both, I asked for my security back—Gordon said he should have to write to the directors, who lived in the country—I asked if he could give me the addresses of the directors and why they were not published on the prospectus—he said the directors were gentlemen and they objected to have their addresses published—I said it was usual in all prospectuses for the addresses to be published and it would inspire more confidence—he said "Some would not object but others would, and it would not do to put some in without all of them"—I again said "I want my deposit note; I have been to the London and County Bank and I find you have presented the note and the money is transferred to the Oxford Street Branch"—he said "I suppose the company has done that"—I said "You as secretary would transact such business as that and not the company"—he made no reply to that—I continued almost daily to make application for my money—they put me off with different excuses, saying they had the keys of the safe and they</p>

               <p>had not seen the directors, and then said I had not given them a proper notice to leave—I said I had, and I then gave a written notice dated 9th December—I did not do any work for the company after the 4th—I asked Gordon several times for the addresses of the directors, but never got them—I never saw any director except Bill—I told Gordon on the 4th December that I had been to Somerset House and I found the company was not registered—he said "Oh, yes it is"—I said "No it is not, I have been there on two occasions and made a thorough search. There is the 'London General Cab Company' that has been established six years, and the secretary's name is different"—he said "Oh, this is <hi rend="italic">The</hi> London General Cab Company"—I said the <hi rend="italic">The</hi> would not make any difference in the constitution of a company—Baker said "Oh, yes it would"—I said I knew it would not, I had inquired of one of the officials at Somerset House—I have never got my deposit note or any part of my money back.</p>

On 21st December I went to 25, Garrick Street in company with Inspector O'Callaghan and the prosecutor—I went to the second floor, and saw Baker on the landing—I told him I was a police officer, and that I had a warrant for his arrest for stealing a deposit note for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me to read the warrant to him—I went into a room and read it to him—he said it was all false, they had not converted the deposit note to their own uses—I then went into an adjoining room and saw Gordon and another man, who was pointed out to me as "Bill"—I told him I was a police officer, and had a warrant to arrest them both—Gordon wished the warrant read, and I read it to him—he said "It is all false," at the same time he turned to Gladden and said "I suppose you want your money; that is all you want?"—he said if I would go out with him he would get the money—Gordon told Bill to say nothing—Bill was afterwards discharged by the Magistrate, it being represented he was only a servant—I took the defendants to the station, they were both charged, and both refused to give any address.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 6, Pratt's Road. Clapton Park—the prisoner has lodged there three months—he was taken into custody on Wednesday, 10th January—between 4 and 5 o'clock that morning I was in bed—I awoke at 4.35—I looked at the clock, as I mostly do when I awake—it is right opposite my bed, and a lamp stands on the mantelshelf, right opposite the clock—I keep it burning all night—I saw the time when I awoke—I did not go to sleep again—I did not hear anybody come in after that time—the prisoner slept in a room at the top of the stairs—my room is the back parlour—I got up at 6.45—I heard the prisoner cough as I was lighting the fire—he came down at 8.45—he asked me the time, and I told him 8.50, when he went out.</p>

I keep the Coopers' Arms, Flood Street, Chelsea—on Saturday, 28th October, about 11 p.m., the prisoner came in and caused a disturbance by using very foul language to me and my son—he said if we touched him he would be the death of us, and he would put a black flag over me in a week—I have known him ever since I have been in the house, but have refused to serve him for the last six months—I told him if he did not leave off I should have to put him out—he was sober—he said he would be the death of me—I went round the counter and was putting him out—he was resisting me as much as he could when Steele, the policeman, came in and got him out—he was very violent—I went in again and fetched out another man who was with him, and then saw the prisoner and Steele fighting—the prisoner was trying to force his way in again; he picked up a quart can and threw it at Steele's head with great violence—Steele ducked his head and the can went through a pane of plate-glass, 7 feet by 6 feet, and he followed it up with a blow with his fist on Steele's forehead, which knocked him against the shutters and window sill—the prisoner ran away to the corner of Halford Place and fell over the kerb, and a policeman and I followed him—he got up and began fighting with the policeman, who got him against the wall, and I got hold of him—we got assistance and he was taken to the station—I had sent for Steele several weeks before to put the prisoner out, and he said he would knock Steele's head off if he touched him—he was sober then—I have had to send for policemen six or seven times to put him out.</p>

               <p>parlour, and heard some one making a disturbance in the bar—I came out and saw the prisoner quarrelling with somebody about a pair of pincers, which had been stolen out of his pocket, and using very filthy language—my father said that if he did not quit he should put him out—he did not resist very much because he saw a policeman at the door—he was put out and tried to get back, but found he could not, and began hustling Steele, who pushed him away—he had a can in his hand and overbalanced himself through the kerb, and fell in the road—he then threw the can at Steele's head, and it went through a window and broke the plate glass—he then gave Steele a violent blow on his nose with his fist, which made him stagger—the prisoner ran down Alfred Place eight or ten yards, looked round to see if Steele was following, slipped off the kerb, and the policeman caught him—he was sober I believe—on the previous Monday I had to call four policemen to him, as he threatened to be the death of him; and he was put out that same evening, the 28th, and returned.</p>

I am a costermonger, of 11, Rickett's Road, Chiswick—on 6th January, about 9 p.m., I met the prisoner at Manor Terrace, Chiswick—he said "Where's them flowers?"—I told him I had no flowers belonging to him—he said "Yes, you have"—he put his face against mine and hit me in the chest—I struck him back—we had one round, and he ran round the corner and started aiming stones at me—I went back to my barrow and pushed it, but the pin was taken out and the wheel came off—the prisoner followed me while I was taking sacks into Miss Oxley's and into Hogarth Place—he said "What is it going to be?"—I saw the blade of a knife shining in his hand, it went through my hat into the back of my neck—I felt the knife go in two or three times, and he rushed away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner.</hi> I only struck him once, it is quite an accident. I asked him for some flowers he had of mine, he said he knowed nothing about any bleeding flowers, and was not going to part with them. I said "You will have to part with them." He was nearly intoxicated. I was cutting the thorns off a stick. I said "Ain't you going to part?" He said "No." I got 30 yards round the corner, he kicked at me three or four times. I had a knife in my hand when I was struck back again. He held my wrist. I put the knife and hit him at the back of the neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Walter Street, Stepney, and am an engineer—on the night of 9th January, about 9 o'clock, I saw Mrs. Barrow running across the road—I afterwards went inside the house with the constable—I went into the back room; I saw a fire there burning—the front room door was open—the firemen came soon after—I threw buckets of water over, and helped to put out the fire.</p>

I am a silk merchant at 20, Jewin Crescent—on 22nd January King called at my warehouse about 4 p.m.—he said he had been to my branch warehouse in the Bethnal Green Road the previous day—he brought in his hand this sample of silk—he said it was about 1cwt., but it turned out to be more—he wanted to sell it—I said I could buy it at a price, and being a different kind of man from those I usually buy from I said "Is it all right?" he said "Yes"—I said "What are you?" he said "A general dealer"—he did not seem to know much about silk—he asked what would I give for it—I said I would buy it at half a crown a pound—I said "I shall require an expla<lb/>nation as to how you came by it and an invoice of it"—I said again "Is it all right? If not, for your own sake and mine, do not bring it here"—he said "It is all right, I am a general dealer; when shall I bring it?" I said "Either before 6 this evening or half-past 9 in the morning"—he hesitated a moment about accepting the price—I said "You will have to decide whether you accept the price now, as I never alter my offers, and you must leave me the sample"—he accepted the price, and left this sample—the proper value was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—in consequence of his accepting a price so much below its value I commu<lb/>nicated with Sergeant Mitchell at No. 2, Old Jewry—Mitchell secreted himself in the warehouse, and remained till King came about 6 p.m.—I went forward and received it, and sent my young man, Shearer, to the door—Mitchell came up and questioned King about it—there were 12 parcels like the one produced—after the conversation King was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by King.</hi> I said at the police-court, and it has been left out of the depositions, that it was an unusual class of silk and inferior, and a stranger would not know the value of it.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Maygrove at 29, Jewin Crescent—en 22nd December, about 6 p.m., a cart came to the ware-house—by Mr. Maygrove's directions I went to the cart—Hadlow was in the cart handing down a bundle to King, who was out of the cart—I then went indoors—I saw the parcels brought into the warehouse—I received them from King—by Mitchell's direction I went for a constable, and went into the warehouse with him—Hadlow was outside at the horse's head—in two or three minutes we came out—Hadlow was not there—the horse and cart were still there—we were not able to find him that day—he could see the constable go in distinctly—on 3rd January I was taken to the police-office at Old Jewry and picked out Hadlow from a number of persons as the man who was there with the cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>) On 22nd December I was fetched from the Old Jewry by Mr. Maygrove—I went to the warehouse and concealed myself—about 6 p.m. the prisoner King came in—after the silk had been brought in as Mr. Maygrove has described I said to King "I am a police-officer; I want to know where you got this silk from?" he said "On Wednesday, 14th December, I bought it of a man, George Jarvis, a general dealer, who lives at 24, Pear Street, New Cut, Lambeth"—I said "What did you pay for it?" he said "4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "Have you any invoice or paper to show that you paid that amount for it?" he said "Yes, it is at my home"—I said "What is your name?" he said "Lewis King, I live at 5, Staple Street, Long Lane, Bermondsey, in the top room"—I said "Your account is not a satisfactory one, and I shall charge you with the unlawful possession of this silk"—I took him to Moor Lane Police-station—I said at the station "You brought this silk with a cart and horse to Jewin Crescent, you were accompanied by another man;" he said "Yes, I decline to say who he is or where he lives, but the cart belongs to Mr. Shaw, of Staple Street, Bermondsey"—he was then charged, and gave the address, 20, Mason Street, Long Lane, Bermondsey, which is the address of his father, but he does not reside there himself—I inquired, but found no Pear Street; there is a Pear Tree Street, but no such a person is known there—the address of 5, Staple Street is a wrong one; he is not known there—I went there—the cart was sent back to Mr. Shaw, but he had lent it to Mr. Robinson—each parcel contains a small ticket like this one, which we found in the centre of this one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate. Murrell said</hi>: "I was coming down Lady Lake's Grove. Two girls stopped me, and asked me if I had any money. I said 'No.' They said 'Oh, yes, you have. You have a feel to see if you have any money.' I went to walk away, when one of them up with her fist and hit me. As soon as I turned round again the other one made a strike against me. I ran away, and went after these two constables. I told them that I was knocked down. All my hand was bleeding. They asked me what I did down that way. I said 'To see my mate a little way home.' They said Could not you go some other turning without going down there at this time of the morning?' I said 'I went round here for the nearest way to get home quick.' 282 said 'Your excuse is very good. Could not you go round the Whitechapel Road?' They have made a mistake in taking me. It was me that first went after the policeman. That good lady, Mrs.</p>

               <p>Lowman, came up afterward? and said 'Oh, my God, there is a man being killed.' With that both ran down, and I followed behind. As soon as I got down this constable, Kingsley, says 'Here's one of them.' I said 'Oh, you have made a mistake.' He said 'No, I ain't; come on.' He then took me down to the station. He hit me three or four times in the mouth. The other policeman put his foot behind me, and I stumbled. I did not fall. He says 'We will take you to a place where they will question you?" <hi rend="italic">Shannon said:</hi> "I went up the back of the grove to see a young woman that had some things belonging to me, and she was not in, and as I was coming back I met two young women. These two young women told me she had gone to Whitechapel; they asked me to have a drink. I said I would not, as I wanted to get home. I said 'Oh, Mrs. Lowmans, I sup<lb/>pose you saw the two women beating the man.' I had a drop of drink. I ran across to see what it was. I was not in the row at all. I know I lost my shawl, two women ran away with it. I did not know the two women at all. I did not have the power to beat anybody; the man took me for the victim; after he was beat, he took me."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">In defence Murrell repeated his statement, and added that he went to see his mate home, he told the constable that he was knocked about, and they said "Your tale is very good; you are joking."

               <p>with a view to a settlement, though negotiations with that view went on—I wish to correct that, I find on reference to the proceedings that I made application for a private sitting on 25th March, 1881, having received information from Tilney, so that I immediately took action—I had received from him the letters produced—I have been in constant communication with Tilney—he has been in my office two, three, and four times a week sometimes, but not at my request or desire—he once assaulted me in the office—I believe the initials on this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be mine—Tilney has been in my employ in these matters since March, 1881, but only to give information—he said that he had documents which would be of great use, and which would produce an estate, and declined to give them up without payment of 20 per cent.—I could get no information from him, nor could the committee, and I put it before the Committee of Inspection, and they, having failed to prick this bladder, as I may term it, instructed me to make an arrangement to pay him—they are here, and will corroborate me—there were several informal meetings—I have had considerable experience as a trustee, and know that I am bound to make a minute of every meeting of the committee, but this was not recorded—it took place at the time of the date of that letter—the memorandum is "Remuneration 20 per cent. on the amount recovered, such remuneration not to be less than 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I should say that that was in March, 1880, because Tilney would give me no informa<lb/>tion till I had entered into that agreement—I have paid him money out of my own pocket since that, I have given him a half-sovereign or a half-crown, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether; in fact, I could not get him out of my office without—I have not put it down; I took it as a gift; he said that he was starving, and I gave it to him from time to time and made no record—I believe I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the last occasion, but I do not think I have given him anything since I obtained the order to prosecute—he told me that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. alleged to have been advanced to Elkington by him was advanced, but that the money was returned the same day in a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I cannot say whether that is the item which appears under date of 12th Oct., 1878, in the account T 1—this matter has been worked entirely by my managing clerk; he can answer the question, I cannot—Tilney told me some things, some of which are very unreliable, and I have proved them so—I consider that these are the whole of the minutes of the Commit<lb/>tee of Inspection down to May, 1881—there are no other minutes—this book has been in my custody—there may have been meetings of the com<lb/>mittee which are not recorded here, but I have no others—when the dust cart was mentioned I wrote to Elkington and asked if he knew any<lb/>thing about it; he said it had been sent to Rendalls in May preceding, but whether it had been removed or remained there he did not know—I wrote this letter of 4th November, in which I say "I understand the dust cart was removed"—I think I had the information from one of the Committee of Inspection, and wrote to three or four people, and among them to Rendall—the charge was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for repairs, and it was sold to Tuckett for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he never saw it—he is here, and I think will swear it—I complained, as Tilney informed me that the Holloway houses had never been sold to Elkington, and he had only a charge on them; I had no information from Elkington till 1880—he sent me an account in October, 1879, but made no claim in respect of those houses—I complain that the Holloway houses were not included</p>

               <p>—I have debited Elkington in respect of them, I don't know to what amount; I would rather you would ask Mr. Kings; he had all the matters under his control—this is the account supplied by Elkington, showing that the estimated value of Wellesley House in May, 1879, was 2,770<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the amount at which it was knocked down, and the sale was not completed in consequence of my refusal to concur—I have had the house examined, but do not know what it lets at—the estimated value of the four cottages at Beckenham is 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but Tilney estimates them at 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his account—I have had no independent valuation—I don't know what the rents are—I did not investigate those matters myself—Elkington agreed that the bill of sale should be sold, and that they should be allowed to dispose of the whole property, and that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less the costs of the sale, should be placed to account in his name and mine, and it still remains in my hands—that arrangement was made preceding the sale by Mr. Lewis, and the sale was soon after my appointment—I received the money, but I did not pay it into a joint account—I was always waiting for Elkington to do so—I did not do it as he did not ask me, and the committee always thought that they had rather the money should remain in my hands—I have received a letter from Mr. Jennings of 24th January, 1881—the account there referred to is the one in which I took Mr. Tilney's estimate—I have not seen the agreement, but I believe it was produced to Mr. Kings—I am aware that the auctioneer's charges on the attempted sale were 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't know that Elkington has paid them—I believe Mr. Jennings once produced the deeds in my office—I did not go to him, but he said "Here are the deeds"—I did not ask for an appointment, but Mr. Kings was there—Mr. Leapingwell is the manager of a bank who put in proof of some hundreds of pounds and never substantiated it, but left the country—he claimed against Tilney, and it was not allowed—I believe Tilney complained to me that Elkington had got property which he had said was forfeited to the ground landlord—I do not know who the lessor was—I don't know Mr. Spalding—I did not inquire or cause inquiries to be made of Cooper and Golding, the lessor's agents—in my account against Elkington the costs and charges in bankruptcy are estimated at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was thought by the Committee of Inspection that if Elkington made any restitution the costs of the bank<lb/>ruptcy should be included in it—the negotiations which had been going on represented a body of creditors; it was an endeavour to arrange the thing on a civil basis—I signed this agreement of 28th October, 1882, between Elkington and myself—the application to the Court was made but was not granted.</p>

I am a surveyor, at Beckenham—I was intro<lb/>duced to Tilney at the end of 1877, and he introduced me to Elkington in August, 1878—this is my diary, which I enter up every evening—here is an entry in it on June 19, 1878, "Met Mr. Tilney, and went with him to Mr. Green, his solicitor"—I sold Tilney the carcases of four houses in Arthur Road, Beckenham—the floor joists were in, and he had expended at that time about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the four houses—I don't know what has become of the contract between me and him, it is so many years back—there was a contract for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he paid me part of it, not all in cash; there was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as far as I can remember—those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts he gave me between 6th July and 31st August. (<hi rend="italic">These amounted to</hi> 178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I don't think that was all cash—he supplied me with slates, timber, and flooring, which I think was put down as cash—if it is put down "By materials 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I never had materials to that amount—I never saw the account of the materials—I believe some came after I gave the receipt—he sent flooring, which he should not have sent till the roof was covered—there might be 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of flooring—I have an entry on 4th September, 1878: "Tilney.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I was finishing four adjoining houses for him, for which he supplied ironmongery—I had a contract—Mr. Cole advanced me a mortgage, and I believe Elkington bought them from Cole—I was not communicating with Cole while I was finishing them—the building agreement was from me to Tilney—I got the lease from Mr. Harker—I never built for the leaseholder—I took a lease of the land on which 48 houses might be put from the same freeholder—there was not a separate lease for each piece of land—some persons bought for four houses, some for six, and some for two—I built 48 all in a row, but they number up to 52, as there is a piece of land between them which is let to another person—I built 49, 50, 51, and 52 for Mr. Cole, and the next four for Tilney—down to 2nd December, 1878, Elkington had something to do with the other four houses which Cole was connected with, because on that day his man went into Cole's houses and took away my bedstead—I should think Elkington had paid me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on those four houses down to December 2nd, 1878, but I have no entry of it—previous to September 2nd he gave me cheques on his banker, in Smith<lb/>field, and I used to go and get the money there—I never was a builder—I never took a contract—I always built for myself, but I got into mire and mud with Tilney and others, and have had to get out as best I could—I built five houses at Colney Hatch and eight or ten at Hounslow—I was a rate collector at Hounslow thirty years ago, and left seventeen years ago under satisfactory circumstances—there was no difficulty about the rates—complaints were made and I resigned—I call that quite satisfactory—I have been seventeen years building houses at Beckenham, and I have been surveying besides—I am not an agent for Stubbs—I am agent for a fire office—I never was agent for a trade society—I acted last week as surveyor for Mrs. Purver, at Hounslow; and for Mr. Parkes, at Backen<lb/>ham—I have never been in liquidation—Mr. Cole undertook to lend me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and handed it to his brother-in-law, Mr. Bassil—I had 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it and never saw the rest—Mr. Bassil is well known to Tilney and Elkington; in fact, Tilney's 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I never had; Bassil had it—I heard when he became bankrupt that Tilney gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my houses—George Elliott was a carpenter in my employ at Beckenham, and nowhere else—until I saw him here this morning I had not seen him for a week—I never received 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of Elkington's timber to be used on those four houses to my knowledge but I have from Tilney—I never heard till to-day of timber of Tilney's being put into those houses and taken out again and taken elsewhere, and I don't believe it now—new timber was being used jointly between the two houses, but work was never taken out—it is likely a man might run from one house to another and take a bit of stuff—I have never ordered the men to come out and go into Elkington's houses when I knew he was coming to look after them—I have had a great many Clarks in my employ; I think I know who you allude to, a man whose name I never knew, but it might be Clark, he was Elkington's foreman—he broke into Mr. Cole's houses and took away the timber and cleared the benches, and I got a policeman and took him in custody—I broke open the door of one of the shops, when the carpenter collared me going into the premises, and two or three of them tried to prevent me—I know Green very well, but don't know his Christian name—no man named Joseph Green was sent by Elkington in 1878 to look after me at work in those houses—I never had an over</p>

               <p>looker since I was born to my knowledge—there were eight or ten men of Elkington's when two could have done the work—my men were doing it down to December 2nd—I may have had five or six men, perhaps only one, when Elkington took to the job, as there was so little to do—I don't say his eight or ten men were at work, they were playing at mouse-trap all over the place—they were there a fortnight after December 2nd—I saw a great many more men playing a month after, or if I said three or four months I should not perhaps tell a story.</p>

I have been clerk to Mr. Elkington 10 or 11 years at his Golden Lane office—his business was very large at one time—on 6th October, 1879, I went to see Mr. King, Mr. Pannell's chief assistant, and took this book with me; it is my writing, and the account with respect to Wellesley House is kept separate—I made it up—I went through it with Mr. King—it is within my knowledge that the sums charged were actually expended—it gives the time and the charges, but not the descrip<lb/>tion of the work—although it does not mention Colliver's contract I produced to him those receipts—I am quite positive I never stated that Colliver was a workman employed by Mr. Elkington—I called on Mr. King three or four times after 6th October—I went through the account with him—I produced the cheques and vouchers to Mr. Pannell, and a gentleman was sitting there, and I went through the book with him—I don't know his name—Mr. Pannell read the cash statement on 6th October the first time I called, and compared the cheques with the dates—he made no observation on the cash account—I got there about 11 o'clock, and remained till 2 o'clock—the principal part of the time was occupied in going through the books with Mr. King and showing him the vouchers—the Beckenham account is also in my writing—I showed him the vouchers, and he had abundant opportunity of examining them—as he marked them off I put the documents aside—I remember giving him Mr. Ready's receipts—I did not say that Ready was a workman of Mr. Elkington's—these are the same receipts; they were all shown to Mr. King, and I went on another occasion, and went through them with him—that was a shorter interview—I went again one Monday morning and showed him all the vouchers—we were altogether five or six hours going through the vouchers, but I did not book the time—I did not then know of the purchase of the Holloway houses—I was present at Golden Lane when Elkington handed some money to Tilney, but I don't know the amount—it was a long time before I went to Mr. Pannell—Mr. Elkington told me what the payments had been for, before I went to Mr. Pannell.</p>

                  </hi>. I was articled clerk to Mr. Large, a solicitor, of Gray's Inn, in 1878 and 1879—I am now a solicitor—Mr. Large was then Mr. Elkington's solicitor—Mr. Elkington carried on a large business as a builder, and had a great many transactions, leases, mortgages, and work of that sort—I kept entries of my attendances, or if I did not keep them myself I gave them in shorthand and they were taken down—here is an entry on 6th January, 1879: "Attending you in a long conference, when you stated that Mr. Tilney wanted to borrow 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., &amp;c."—I do not know whether that is my entry; there is nothing to identify my attend<lb/>ance when the entry is taken in shorthand by the clerk, as we only keep one book—here is another entry on the same date, "Attending Counsel," &amp;c.—it is marked "6th January, continued"—Mr. Large's bill of costs was made out from this diary—I did not make it out—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is "March 5. Attending you when you stated that Mr. Tilney had a bill of sale from you"—then there are instructions for bill of sale and folios, and attending him and making fair copy—I find no entry of March 6th or 9th—here are entries on 13th, 16th, 17th, 19th, and 28th September, 1878. (<hi rend="italic">These related to writing to and attending Mr. Hill, and attending Mr. Leaping well; also to business connected with the Holloway property.</hi>) Mr. Hill had an equitable charge on the property, which Elkington paid off; I think it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn, and I went to the bank and paid Mr. Neal 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—Mr. Hill gave me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188301290055"/>
               <p>this receipt for 937<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the amount of the principal and other charges—it was really the money owing from Mr. Glegg to Mr. Hill—he borrowed it, and it was completed the same day—it was paid by Mr. Elkington—here is the original cheque given to Mr. Neal and endorsed by him—Mr. Large signed it, and I cashed it—it is dated 8th October, 1878—I don't think it was cashed till the 15th—the actual com<lb/>pletion of the matter with Glegg was on the 15th—I have the entry, "Attending you," Mr. Elkington, "and handing you balance of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he had been spending money on the property in building—he had received notice not to do it, and we gave him some small consideration; I think it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 24th March I attended with Mr. Elkington at the London and Westminster Bank in Southwark. (<hi rend="italic">Reading the entry.</hi>) I was present and saw 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Elkington—Messrs. Battenshaw, the mortgagee, borrowed 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after deducting 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they handed over the balance—something like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for overdraft—I know every<lb/>thing was paid up, and we got the deeds—a client of Messrs. Battenshaw's advanced the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think I prepared the document of September 17th, 1878, "I hereby assign my interest in the houses at Yearborough Road, Holloway," and I don't think I ever saw it—if it was drawn up in Mr. Large's office, I fancy Mr. Neal drew it up—he is not here; he is in a bad state of health—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not in the writing of any one in the office, nor do I know anything of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mentioned in it—I don't think I was present at the completion of the assignment of the Holloway property—I did not see the money paid by Elkington—I think I attested one of the deeds; Mr. Large paid the money by his cheque—that was not the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent to Elkington on mortgage; it was the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which paid Hill off, and we gave Elkington the balance, about 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Hill was paid off by mortgage raised by Elkington—our client was the mortgagee—I prepared the bill of sale and had the agreement before me, but I did not recite it, because Counsel advised me not; he thought there might be a point under the new Bill of Sale Act—I knew nothing of the consideration for the bill of sale, but I understood that Tilney had given a promissory note, and had promised to give a bill of sale—I knew nothing of the letter Elkington had written to Tilney till a week or two ago—I did not draw up this document of 6th January; I have no doubt Mr. Neale did—Mr. Large attended the conference of Counsel on the 6th, and I attended on the 9th—my duties commenced on 9th April—I drew up the mortgage of 5th November, 1878, in reference to Beckenham and to Wellesley House, and carried out the mortgage to Messrs. Hughes and Co.'s client entirely—I approved of the draft, with a few slight alterations, which are, I think, in my writing—the moneys I paid to the bank were the proceeds of the money paid by the mortgagee, and the balance was paid to Mr. Elkington.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This agreement of January 6th is Mr. Neale's writing—he is an invalid, suffering from heart disease—this is Mr. Roffet's signa<lb/>ture, and the books show that a conference took place with Counsel at the time—in fulfilment of that agreement I had to prepare a bill of sale in April, which I did, and had a conference with Mr. Duncan, and its effect was fully discussed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of 79, Mark Lane, and fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects—on 4th February, 1879, I surveyed Wellesley House, and reported that it would take 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to fit it for habitation—I surveyed it again in June, 1880, with Mr. Gordon—it was then virtually completed, but it had gone into dis<lb/>repair—I was shown Mr. Elkington's report in the book marked "Hamp<lb/>stead"—I again surveyed the premises, and made this report (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 22nd September—in December last year I had before me Mr. Elking<lb/>ton's statement of the money expended on the house, and went over the house to see how far my judgment coincided with his—I dissected his account—my first estimate of 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was based on the fulfilment by Colliver of this agreement to complete the premises for habitation, and the amount I arrived at was 671<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to which must be added 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for work done there, or money expended, which had been omitted, and which I found there—that gives a total of 709<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have 19 pages of foolscap making up the details.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Elkington since 1867 more or less—I am one of his bail, but that was matter of accident—Mr. Large is his bail—he had been committed for trial when I went down to make this survey—by my report of February 4th, 1879, I show that 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid by Elkington to Colliver, 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods supplied, and that it would take 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to complete the building according to Colliver's contract—there was a balance left of 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to complete the contract, but it does not say that Colliver owed it to Elkington; it was for work which had been done—that was got out, I think, for the purpose of Elking<lb/>ton defending himself against Colliver in February, 1879—I heard Mr. Tupman's evidence to-day—he surveyed the premises on 28th February, 1879, 24 days after I did, and I still say that on February 24th, when Elkington took possession, all that work was required to be done—that amount does not satisfy me now at all—a good deal more has been done—the account furnished me by Elkington, from which I worked, was a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi> of the entry in the book—Mr. Jennings gave it to me—I had no exact means of separating the work done while Colliver was working there from the work done after he left, but there were items of wages which I knew had been paid to Colliver—I also took the 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he should have expended as I understood it had been expended—I also took the items paid the solicitor for charges, and included them—the charges were for costs of mortgage and keeping a man in possession—I endeavoured to eliminate from Elkington's account the items which did not occur in mine—I extracted from his account the items which did</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was instructed by Mr. Jennings—I was aware that the question was how much he was out of pocket in respect of Wellesley House—I was shown the receipts for the solicitors' charges and other items, which I could not test, and which together came to 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 189<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I arrived at on my first survey, was for the value of the work included in Collivor's contract, which had not been done—his contract was a very loose one—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the copy which was given to me; I marked it in red ink, and as far as I can judge of the materials and labour, I can account for the whole whole within 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in detail too—I do not give the general items—I am ready to give the details if they are challenged—Mr. Large being in Devonshire, I had not the least hesitation in becoming Elkington's bail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am in service at Peckham—I had a child named Albert Blackman, born on 28th June last—I gave it in charge of the prisoner, I cannot say at what date—she had had it about six weeks before it died—I was to pay her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, I paid her by the month—during the early part of the time it was with her I saw it twice—the first time was about three weeks after she had it; it then appeared all right, in a healthy state, and well cared for and nourished—I next saw it about three weeks after; I then paid her a sovereign—that was all I paid her; that was about a week before the death, I think—the prisoner lived at 36, Deliford Road; that was where I saw the child—it was then in a cot; it seemed all right and looked well—it was the Thursday week before it died—it had a bottle of milk by its side; the milk seemed all right at that time—I did not examine it, but it looked all right; he was able to suck—I next went to see it the day after Christmas Day, the 26th—I knocked at the door, but could not get in, and I went away—on Friday, 29th, I saw the child again—it was alive, but in a very dirty state, and appeared ill—there was some milk by its side; it was sour—the child was not able to suck then—the prisoner was then lying on the bed—she is married and lives with her husband—she has no children of her own, or any others to nurse besides mine—I did not say anything to the prisoner when I saw it in this state; I sent for Dr. Dotterel—Mrs. Saunders and Mrs. Grissell went for him—I was not there when he came; I found him there on my return—the child was still alive—I remained there till after 10 o'clock at night, and then left—the child was still alive—that was the last time I saw it alive—it died at 6 o'clock on Saturday morning—I believe up to the Thursday week before the Friday it was a healthy child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 780, Old Kent Road—about 10 on the night of 29th December I was sent for to 36, Deliford Road—I found the child lying in a cot apparently dying—the prisoner was sitting on the bed—she was sober; she had her clothes on—she said she wanted to do away with herself, and she tried to get out of bed; I pre<lb/>vented her—after some time she got out and sat on the side of the bed—I then saw that she was dressed—the child's cot was in a very filthy con<lb/>dition and the clothes also—there was a smell of decomposition from the clothes, a very strong smell indeed—the child had its clothes on—I took it out of the cot, and commenced to cut the clothes off—I then advised them to send for the police—the mother came in—I cut the clothes off with a pair of scissors because the child was in such a filthy condition I could not take them off in the ordinary way—I thought that the easiest possible manner of taking them off—the filth I speak of was excrement and urine—seeing the state it was in I advised the mother to send for a policeman—that was in the prisoner's presence—she was still sitting on the bed; she appeared to be greatly excited—I gave the child some brandy and water; it took it apparently eagerly—on the policeman's arrival I examined the child—I observed a black mark on the side of the face, which appeared like a bruise, and there was a small commencing gangrenous patch on the back—that would be caused by its lying in an irritating fluid or something, what is commonly known as bed-sore—the action of the heart was very irregular, and it was almost pulseless—I sent for more policemen, and had the child removed to the nearest infir<lb/>mary in the ambulance—while I was there I continued giving it brandy and water about every 10 minutes—the child's body was thin, I could see the ribs—the cot itself was in a very filthy condition—there was some milk in a bottle; it appeared to be sour, not in a fit state for a sick child to take—I was present at the post-mortem examination by Dr. Shepherd some days afterwards—death was due to a clot on the right side of the heart—in my opinion that was produced by the child being in a very weak condition, and lying for some time in an irritating fluid, and having this bed-sore—there was an abnormality in the state of the blood; brought about by lying in an irritating fluid in conjunction with the child being debilitated and in a weak condition—the bed-sore was about the size of a florin—there was considerable extravasation—I found a bruise on the right side of the face also, one I think on the arm and another on the leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruises were slight—the cot which the child was lying in was a wicker-work one—the bruises might be produced by the rocking of the cradle—I don't think they were of any importance—I did not associate the death in any way with the bruises.—I found two bottles of milk in the room and a tin of condensed milk—there was a feeder to one of them—I did not test the bottles, it was only by obser<lb/>vation I say the milk was sour; it was curdled—I understood it was a preparation of water and condensed milk—milk will curdle in two or three hours—there was no fire in the room—sometimes a bed-sore will occur with the most careful nursing, but that is generally in cases of very long illness—the kidneys were diseased, I should not think that disease was born with it—it was a disease of some standing—that might cause an alteration in the blood—a bed-sore might arise from that, but I hardly think so—I do not think there was sufficient disease of the</p>

Michael Keefe and his friend came to me at 7.15; I said "Have you got into any row about that?" He said "No, they won't know it is me," I said "I thought they might, as you made them." He after<lb/>wards said "You might come and stop to-night." I said "No, my mother kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> and my eldest brother also for stopping out on Sunday night." On Monday morning he said "Don't go to work this morning," and I did not go to work; I stopped and saw the governor on Wednesday, and got discharged. This other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> put on the waistcoat, and said to me "You might as well pawn it for us," and I did it, and he told a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> to wait outside the public-house, and left him there till 7.30, but he did not get the coat and shawl. On Wednesday I came back, and this <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> gave me my money, and told me I need not come any more. He had pawned a shawl on the Wednesday, and they came down to Burton Street and called me. I went up to them, and they asked me to pawn a coat for them, and I did so. They came as far as Burton Street and got a <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> of beer, and said "You might as well have these; we can't wear them because that man would know them."</p>

               <p>prisoners assisted in doing so, and in putting out the fire—I smelt paraffin in the shop—I examined the shop carefully—there had been a fire under the show-board on the left-hand window—that had been burnt out, part of the structure was burnt—there were old baskets under the show-board, there was nothing in them; they were burnt out—they were baskets that had been used for vegetables and such like—the door under the shopboard was burnt away—I did not smell anything under there—under the other shopboard, where the gas meter was, there were some ashes of paper that had been burnt and a quantity of old baskets that were not burnt—I did not smell anything there—no part of the structure there was burnt—it was impossible that the fire could have been com<lb/>municated from one show-board to the other—on the shelf under the counter on the left-hand side of the shop were two boxes, one at each end; they had had straw and paper in, but it had been on fire, and had burnt—there had also been some paper burnt at the parlour end of the shelf at the back end of the counter, and there was a half-bushel basket with fancy paper on the shelf saturated with paraffin—under the shelf there was another half-bushel basket heaped up with straw, saturated with paraffin, also a small basket of shavings on the ground under the shelf; that did not smell of paraffin—they were not burnt at all—the fires at each end of the counter were not in connection with each other—the till, about a foot deep, parted the two boxes where the fires had been—there were three distinct fires under the counter—I also noticed on the right-hand side of the shop, close to where the original fire had been, the one I first described under the show-board, a cask that had been used for grapes—it was half filled with sawdust saturated with paraffin—the upper part of the cask had burst open, and the inside upper ends of the staves had been slightly burnt—it was about nine inches or a foot off the fire under the show-board on the right-hand side—there was some fancy Christmas paper on the shelves at the end of the counter at the back of the shop on the left-hand side, done up into loops and hanging-down from a basket on the shelf into an empty potato cask—I did not notice anything near that—I took possession of some of the things that were not burnt—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the upper part of the cask where the fire was, the inside of the staves are burnt; the sawdust in the cask smelt of paraffin—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the boxes that were under the counter and had burnt themselves out, and the basket of shavings—it does not smell—this is the straw, and the basket it was in; it smells very much of paraffin—in the shop was one sack of potatoes, a few oranges in baskets, greens, nuts, and onions—I went over the house to see how it was furnished, two rooms at the top, and the drawing-room (the front room over the shop) had no furniture whatever—the back room on the first floor at the back of the drawing-room only had a chair bedstead in it, and the other bedroom was very scantily furnished indeed—I did not notice any paraffin when I went over the house—I saw a small paraffin lamp being taken by the police to show us a light; we have it here—I saw an ordinary wine bottle on the shelf at the back of the counter in the shop—it was empty—it smelt of paraffin—I saw two other bottles in the top room, second floor; they had paraffin in them—after I discovered this I sent Murphy for Clark—I had said nothing to Murphy—Clark came to me—I was in the shop at the back of the counter, Murphy was there as well—I called Clark's attention to this straw, and paper, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—I went to this fire with Engineer Dane on the engine—after it was ex<lb/>tinguished I was left in charge—after about half an hour I thought of leav<lb/>ing and going home—to make myself sure that the house was safe I went to examine the back part of the counter, and there I found on the shelf underneath the counter one basket filled with paper saturated with paraffin; it was wet—on the same shelf I found a box partly burnt containing charred paper and straw, and farther along on the same shelf there were ashes of paper, and underneath the shelf, on the floor, I found a half-bushel basket filled with straw saturated with paraffin—adjoining the basket was another filled with shavings not saturated with paraffin—there had been three fires altogether under the counter—immediately under the gas-meter on the left-hand side as you enter the shop under the show-board there were two distinct fires; one was charred paper and straw, and the other of paper alone—both smelt strongly of paraffin—the other show-board was where the principal fire was; it was very nearly burnt all out—all these fires were distinct—I heard Murphy say that himself and his brother-in-law, Clark, went up to the City that afternoon, and when they came home they walked past the shop and went in at the side entrance, and went up<lb/>stairs—shortly after that he said that when they were passing the shop he observed that the shutter on the window where the principal fire was was not properly closed within about two feet, and that he and Clark went into the shop and closed the shutter, and that he was the last man to leave the shop—they were revolving shutters.</p>

I went to this fire, and assisted in putting it out—the prisoners also assisted in putting it out—after the fire was over I spoke to Clark in the presence of Dane in the back parlour—Dane asked him if he was insured—he said "Yes"—"And the office? what office?"—he said "The North British and Mercantile"—he was asked to produce the policy—he did so—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">This was an insurance policy, dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th December,</hi> 1882, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—nothing further passed at that time—I smelt the paraffin—I saw Clark again shortly after two in the morning; he was upstairs, I sent Murphy for him—I said to him in the shop "These things here look very suspicious; it may lead to your being charged, you had better be very careful in any observations which you make"—I took him round the back of the counter, and pointed out every fire to him in detail, six altogether—he replied "I know nothing of it, I cannot account for it"—that was all that he said—I told him then I should take him into custody—I did so—he was taken to the station, and</p>
