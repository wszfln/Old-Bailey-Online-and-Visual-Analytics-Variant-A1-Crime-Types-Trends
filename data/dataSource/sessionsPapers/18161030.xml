            . I was taken up upon a charge of having forged notes in my possession, on the 17th of August. After that, I was employed by Mr. Westwood, the clerk to the Solicitor of the Bank of England, to detect the prisoners in selling forged notes. By his desire, I introduced a person to the prisoners. Before I introduced that person, I had dealings with the prisoners respecting forged bank notes several times. I obtained some from them at the price ten shillings and sixpence of the prisoner, and the old sixpence was allowed to them. I paid them ten shillings and sixpence for a one-pound to ged Bank of England note; I understood that they had the sixpence for themselves for their trouble. Between the time that I was apprehended and the time. I introduced a person by Mr. Westwood's desire, I dealt with them five times and get from the nineteen notes. I introduced Giffiths to them on the 29th of August, at the <placeName id="t18161030-1-crimeloc3">Crown and Cushion in London Wall</placeName>

Yes; I met with Griffiths, and was searched in the investigator's office in the Bank of England, by Mr. Foy, and his brother, in the presence of Mr.Christmas and Mr. Griffiths, and I was supplied with money for the purpose of purchasing notes to the amount of three pounds three shillings in silver, and Griffiths was supplied with one pound one shilling. I had only a few halfpence about me beside this money. I went with Griffiths in the afternoon to the sign of the Fountain in the Minories; we went first to the sign of the Grave Maurice with Mr. Christmas and Mr.

Yes; Benjamin said to me and Griffiths, it is a pity you did not stop a little longer last night, as Tom ran home and came back with them. I considered Tom to be the man who served them with them. Then they both went out. Andrew Savage came back first. In a very short time, Benjamin came in. Then Benjamin gave me my six and be gave Griffiths his two.

I told Benjamin Savage if we wanted any more we would call; I did not expect we should, but if we did we should know where to find him. We then went to the first public-house, and there the five of us had something to drink, the two prisoners, Griffiths, I, and another person.

               <p>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. My Lord, we are now coming to the subject of the present indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you went to this meeting, were you again searched - A. I was; I can't tell by whom but Mr. Christmas was present. I was furnished with a one-pound Bank of England note, and one-pound two in silver; Griffiths was furnished with a one-pound Bank of England note, and one shilling, and then we went to the Fountain in the Minories, as we had appointed on the Saturday night; as we had not come on the Sunday to Coleman-street. Accordingly Griffiths, and I went to the Fountain, at twelve o'clock at noon; I believe Mr. Christmas followed us, and if I am not mistaken, one of the Mr. Foys, but I am not certain which, if either. We went there at twelve o'clock and stopped there until about three minutes after one; then we went away from there; neither of the prisoners were there when we went, nor did either of them come while we stopped. We then went to the Old Rum Puncheon, in the Minories, commonly called the Gully Hole, in Rose and Crown-court; it is generally called so, but I believe it was the Rum Puncheon. When we went there. neither of the prisoners were there; but we stopped a little while, and then they both came in. When they came in, we told them where we had been, and one of them, but I can't say which but both were present, said, there could be nothing, done until about eight o'clock at night.

             went close to the church at Aldgate, and we staid near the watchhouse, and the prisoner Andrew Savage asked me how many I wanted, and I told him four; and I gave him a genuine one pound Bank of England note and one pound two in silver, which was the money that I received. Then I saw Griffiths deliver him his one pound note and his shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. To which - A. To Andrew. When Andrew received the money of us both, he said to Benjamin, then take them somewhere where you know, and he took us to the Coach and Horses in Northumberland-alley, Fenchurch-street. I can't say rightly how long we staid there, but I think it was an hour before Andrew returned, and when he returned he said, my darling boys, you are enjoying yourselves. Then he gave me my four notes, and I put them into my right hand waistcoat pocket. I then saw him give Griffiths two, but they were not separated, and there might be only one; there were two I believe. Griffiths put them into his left hand pantaloon pocket I believe. We stood there a little while together, and then we all four came out and another man with us. As soon as I got to the door, I gave my four notes to

Then I saw Charles give him three pounds three shillings in silver; three shilling pieces and eighteen penny pieces. Benjamin Savage then took off his hat, and took out a white handkerchief which he had in his hat, and wrapped the money up in the handkerchief in separate parcels; then he went away. In about a quarter of an hour he returned, and said,</p>

I had three or four shillings besides the money I had received from Mr. Christmas, to pay expences. Charles had a three shilling piece to pay his expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you went there and saw Andrew Savage. Now what passed - A. A short time afterwards. Benjamin came in, and he said,</p>
               <p>"it was a pity we did not stop ten minutes longer, as Tom ran home last night, and came back with some." Benjamin then sat down by me; he asked me how many I wanted; I told him two; and then John Charles told me to give him my money; I gave him the one pound note and a shilling, which I had received from Mr. Christmas. I saw Charles give him his money; I believe three pounds. Then Benjamin went out, and he was gone about half an hour. and then came back. He sat down with me; he gave me two one pound forged bank notes, and I saw him give Charles his. He gave him six; I put the notes which I had got from him into my left hand pantaloon pocket; and I saw Charles put his into his right hand waistcoat pocket. In a few minutes we all came out together. Benjamin Savage told us, if we wanted any more on the Sunday, to meet him at the White Swan public-house, in Colman-street, at twelve o'clock. Then we drank together; we went into Aldgate together, and into a public-house opposite Aldgate Church; soon after we parted; we had half a pint of gin at that house, and then parted. Charles and I came away together. Charles gave me six forged one pound notes. He gave them to me about five minutes after we came out of the Fountain; he had not been out of my sight from the time he received them, until he gave them to me. He had not been out of my sight from the time he left the Bank of England, until those notes were first in his possession. He had been searched before he went away; he was searched by Mr. Foy, in my presence. The six notes I received from Charles, I put into my right hand pantaloon pocket, and went then to the Grave Maurice, and met Mr. Foy and Mr. Christmas there, and gave the six notes I received from Charles, and my own two, to Mr.

             I am Investigator of bank notes. I have seen Griffiths and Charles in company. Charles and Griffiths came to our office, Charles was searched there, and was Griffiths so as to ascertain that he had no bank notes about him. He was supplied with money there to the amount of three pounds three shillings; I gave that money to Foy, who had previously marked it; he gave Charles three pounds three shillings, and Griffiths one pound one shilling I am not confounding two different periods. After they had got this, they went to the Fountain in the Minories followed by me and Thomas Foy. We kept at a distance to avoid being observe to be of the party. They both went in we remained in the street some time, we were there for about an hour or more, and they did not come. We returned to the office but did not see any thing of them; about ten o'clock I saw Griffiths; he delivered to me the notes which he had purchased; he marked them before I took them they are all foegeries. On the 2nd I was to watch were Charles and Griffiths went to. On the 31st, I followed them to the Fountain in the Minories at some distance behind; this was about half past seven in the evening; I waited there for about ten minutes; Andrew Savage then came out from the Fountain. He went across the Minories, and went to the Coach and Horses public house, in Northumberland-alley; I followed him; I waited under the archway for about ten minutes whilst he was in the public house; he came out accompanied by a man, a stranger to me; he came out, and went into Jury-street, and under the East India company wall, they were met by Benjamin Savage; they all three stopped together a few minutes, and then they went to the Bunch of Grapes.</p>

             and Mr. Cox followed me. Both went into the house after I got into the house; I found the prisoner there sitting with two women, one of whom I believe to be his wife. We asked each other how we did first, then the box where we sat was full of company pretty well, for Mr. Cox sat in the same box, and I believe there were two other persons. The first question he asked me, after we had asked each other how we did was whether my friend was handy, that is near at hand, I said yes, he was at no great distance; because he said I have brought you forty; I had had a conversation with him before about a friend. After he had said this, I said I was not prepared for forty then, as I thought proper not to bring my friend with me; I said I would take twenty to night and twenty in the morning; and I asked him if that would do, and he said it would. Now you give me thing meaning the money; I gave him two pound in silver, and eight one pound notes. He said I should have one out of every score; he said it collectively but I perfectly understood that he meant one forged note in every twenty. Then we all came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300007"/>out of the house together; I mean the prisoner and I and the two women.</p>

               <p>Q. did you see anything as you come out of the house - A. yes; I saw him stop to speak to his wife at the door, and said to me go a little higher up to the Church, and wait for me half a minute.

Then we went to a cookshop window to look at the impression, to see if it was not a very good one; then he gave me an eighteenpenny piece, and I looked at that also. I gingled them as we were going along, and it rolled upon the pavement; then we went on into Union-street, and there we were taking together, and then Mr. Christmas came up to me and took hold of me, and Mr. Foy and Mr. Jefferson took hold of the prisoner. They took us to a wine vaults in Shoreditch, and Mr. Foy searched the prisoner.</p>

             was close by. We were there about half an hour when the prisoner came out; two women were also with him. At the door he stopped, and gave something to a woman, who I understood was his wife; he then went on; Charles was just before, and he joined him; Charles came out with him; but had gone on a few paces. The prisoner joined company with Charles by the wall of Whitechapel Church; I did not see what became of the woman; Jefferey's was following the prisoner, and Charles and John Foy, and myself were close behind. They crossed over into Brick-lane together, talking all the time. They stopped at the window of a cookshop in Brick-lane, and I saw the prisoner give Charles something at the window. They then went on, and as they crossed to the wall of Spital Fields Church, they both stooped down and sounded something. I heard that; they then proceeded down Church-street, towards Bishopsgate; they stopped at nearly the end of-street, to speak together. Foy and myself crossed immediately; the prisoner was taken into custody by Foy and Jeffrey's, and I took Charles. We then went to a house in Bishopsgate-street, near Norton Falgate. They were taken in, and the prisoner was searched. He was first asked by Foy, who, and what he was, and what he was doing with Charles; he denied all knowledge of him, and said he never saw him before. There were found on his person, a small pocket book, twelve shillings and sixpence in silver, and a small key. In fact, there were three keys; one was of a street door; Foy then searched Charles, and on searching him, he found this roll of paper in his pocket, and I saw it found on him. Charles was asked where he got them from; and he said from the prisoner. He was asked for what purpose, and he said he had bought them. Foy again asked the prisoner two or three several times, where he lived; who he was; what he was; and what he had been doing with Charles. He refused to give any account of himself whatever, and still persisted in denying all knowledge of Charles. Upon Charles saying that the prisoner gave them to him, I saw the notes taken from Charles; I marked them; they are all forgeries, and I have the same observations to make with respect to them, that I made with respect to the others.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Charles; I searched him in such a manner as to be certain that he had no roll of paper about him; I heard the account of these witnesses, and that is correct as far as came within my observation. During all the time I was following Charles; there was not a possibility of receiving from any person this roll of paper. I produce a pocket book. On Charles I found a paper, which on opening, contained twenty forged notes; they were on a small roll, and tied up in the paper. I asked him where he got it, and he said, "from that man," pointing to the prisoner. I asked him for what purpose, and he said he bought them. The prisoner did not then say any thing to it; but I asked him where he got them from; and he said he knew nothing about them; I asked him what he knew of this man, meaning Charles; and he said he never saw him before. I said, you must know him; and he said, "no, he did not, for he had never spoken to him in his life. I said, that can't be, for you were speaking to him when I took you into custody, this moment. He said," he was not." I said, what is your name, and where do you live. He said, "he should not give an account of himself." I said, you must; that my name was Foy, and that I was a police officer, and he was suspected to be a seller of forged notes, and if he did not say who he was, I should state that in my evidence against him.</p>

            . I was taken up on suspicion of having forged bank notes in my possession. I was taken up twice, The last time on the 23rd of September. I believe I was discharged. After that, I was employed under the solicitor for the Bank of England, to detect the prisoner at the bar. I was employed by Mr. Westwood to detect as many as I knew. I met the prisoner at the bar, in company<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300008"/>with other persons, on the 15th of September. I met her at the sign of the George public house, near Whitechapel church.</p>
               <p>Q. do you happen to know whether that person had been taken up - A. I certainly knew that he had been taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. had you any conversation with her on that day about forged notes - A. I believe I had.</p>
               <p>Q. what was it - A. I am not certain; it was not particular. I did not make any appointment with her she made an appointment with me; she told me if she heard any news she would call on me on the Thursday; if not, on the Friday morning. She did not come. I did not see her afterwards until a person with whom I then lived gave me some information; and in consequence of a message that was left for me, I met her again on the twenty second of September, that was on a Sunday; I believe, at the Pewter Platter in White Lion street, Nortonfalgate, that was on Sunday the twenty second.</p>
               <p>Q. was any appointment then made to meet on the following day - A. yes; I was to meet her at nine o'clock the next evening the twenty third; she told me that we were to meet at the Three Tunns; I told her I did not know the Three Tuns she described the way to me; she said if you come up to the top of the street by the Jews chappel, and turn to your right hand, the first public house you come to is the Three Tunns she described to me the place where we were to meet; that was the place I was to meet her at</p>
               <p>Q. what were you to meet for - A. I had told her on the twenty second, that I wanted twenty; she answerd that I was to tell her exactly how many I wanted, and she would not bring any more with her than I could take. I told her that I could not be-sure I could take more or not; but I would engage to take twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. When you talked of taking twenty, what were you speaking of - A. I was meaning forged notes; we were two well acpuainted with that commodity to mistake each other; we generally talked of them as the thing, or screens, or queer thing. The Three Tunns was the place that I went to, but I found that the house that was the first was on my right, and I went on to White Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate the appointment you had made to any one - A. Yes, to Mr. Christmas, and the peace officers. In consequence of that, I was searched on the Monday, the 23rd, by Mr. John Foy, first, and I believe Mr.

            , afterwards; I had nothing more about me than a few halfpence; two shillings were given me by Mr. Christmas to spend and seven genuine one pound Bank of England notes and three pound in silver, making to the amount of ten pound together; the price I was to give was ten pound for them, that money would purchase twenty. Then I went to the Seven stars in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the person who had attended the search go with you - A. Yes; Jefferies went part of the way in company with me; when we got near the place, he drew a little behind, and let me go in first the other followed me I believe at a distance. When I went into the house, I called for a pint of beer; the prisoner came in afterwards; it might be within half an hour, or a little more; she asked me how I did; I said the same to her. Then she made an apology for making the mistake in saying it was the Three Tuns, as she afterwards found out it was the Seven Stars; after that, she asked me to walk a little way; I said most certainly, and we came out to the door; she stopped at the door half a minute, or near, I dare say; there was nothing passed there in particular. We walked from there up Brick-lane; there was no other in company with us two. We walked to the corner of Old Montague-street; in our walk there, we made an appointment to meet on Thursday; the 23rd was a Monday. When we got to the corner of Old Montague-street, we made a stop, but for what, I can't say, it was for nothing in particular. We then went down <placeName id="t18161030-3-crimeloc15">Old Montague-street</placeName>

When we stopped, she said, is the thing all ready; I said yes; I then gave her seven one-pound Bank of England notes; this was in the street near the Cock and Key. I gave her the notes, and three pounds in silver, the same which I received from Mr. Foy. When she received the money, she said, you devil, why did you not wrap the silver up in the notes; I believe the most part of the silver was in tokens; I then gave her the silver, and she said, she would not be a minute before she returned; she went away; she was not longer than five minutes away, before she returned. When she came back, she gave me the roll of paper, and said, on Thursday night remember. I then put the bundle, or roll, which I suspected to be forged notes into my pocket. She was then going to bid me good night, and I called her then by her name, Mrs. Lawrence; that was the name by which I knew her; I said, won't you go and have something to drink before we part. We went into a public-house, the sign of the Cock and Key; we staid there no longer than while the landlord served us two glasses of gin; I paid for them, and received the change out of a shilling. We did not go above a dozen steps, before we were apprehended; it was before we had got out of the court where the Cock and Key is situated. I made a sign to the officers, to shew them that the dealing had taken place; I dare say I gave them words. Then we were apprehended, both I and the prisoner; that was the third time I was apprehended; I was only apprehended once on a real charge against myself. The officers took me and the prisoner into a house; Christmas and Jefferies took the prisoners; Jefferies also put his arm into my arm, and I made no resistance. They then took us to a house; the prisoner called out murder and robbery, and for assistance when she was apprehended. We were then taken to No. 8, King's Arms Court, kept by a person named Wilson. When we got into the house, Mr. Christmas searched the prisoner. Jefferies also searched her; they did not find anything particular on her; they found some shillings I believe. Mr. Christmas and Jefferies were standing by when I was searched; a roll of paper was found on me, Mr. Christmas took charge of them; he took it out of my pocket, that was the same I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300009"/>received from the prisoner most certainly. Mr. Christmas asked me where I got them from? I said from the prisoner; that was in her presence; I don't know that she made any observation upon it. I belive she was asked what she was doing with me.</p>

             and Jefferies were present; Jefferies is also an officer; he was thoroughly searched; first by John Foy, and afterwards by Jefferies; he had then a few halfpence on him.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you was it possible that he could have about him any roll of forged bank notes - A. It was impossible for him to have any thing about him without its being known. I then gave him two shillings to spend;

             gave him seven one-pound notes and three pounds in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was that given him - A. To purchase twenty forged one-pound notes. We then proceeded to the house where the appointment had been made, the Seven Stars, in Brick-lane; the witness Charles and Jefferies went together; I followed, and the two Foys with me. Charles and Jefferies went in there; I waited close at the door, and the two Foys were near to the place where I was. I waited there for about a quarter of an hour, or rather more, when the prisoner came in company with two men to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. This was after nine o'clock at night. I looked into the public-house; but I could not observe the parties. The man who went in with the prisoner came out in a few minutes afterwards; he came out, and came down Brick-lane. About ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner and Charles came out together; they just stopped at the door, and then went in; Jefferies came out immediately after them. The prisoner and Charles passed me. I heard the prisoner say to Charles, no, my dear, indeed I have not heard of him. They crossed the road, and went on. I was on the opposite side to them all the way. That street won't admit of more than two carriages abreast. They went to Old Montague-street, and Jefferies was following me close behind. They stopped there about a minute, and then went along Old Montague-street; Jefferies and I followed them; we were within three or four yards of them all the way through that street. and they stopped nearly opposite to the Cock and Key public-house, just beyond. The prisoner then left Charles, and went into King's Arms-court, just opposite. I went up to Charles, and spoke to him. I went a short distance, and she came back after a minute or so. Then they crossed over, and went into the Cock and Key; I saw them talking together in the passage of that house. They then came out, and were about parting; I then went over to Charles, and asked him if he had made a purchase, and he said yes. Then the prisoner was endeavouring to get away, when I went up to her; she was going away; she did not apprehend anything at that time as I know of. I went up to her, and took her into custody; I laid hold of her hand; Jefferys at the same time laid hold of Charles. The prisoner called out thieves! and murder! I did not treat her with any violence, only by holding her hand; she called that out several times, and several persons in the court opened their doors; and the prisoner said these men want to rob and murder me. I made a request of one of the persons, and in short, we want into No. 8, Mr. Wilson's, and the prisoner was searched there, and on her were found, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, and a small key. I asked her her name, but she refused to give her name; Charles at the same time was present; Jefferies at the same time had hold of him; she refused giving any name or saying where she lived. I then searched Charles; I found in his left hand small clothes pocket twenty one-pound forged notes, they were rolled up in a roll; they were not tied, but were rolled tight up, and there was just a small bit of thread twisted round them I then asked the prisoner her name, a second time; she said her name was Woodman. I also asked her where she lived, and she said, she would not say, as it might disgrace her family. Upon finding these notes on Charles, I asked him where he got them; he said, from that person, pointing to the prisoner. I asked him for what purpose. She denied all knowledge of him; she said she never saw him before; she said she did not know who he was, nor what he was. I asked him for what purpose he had them from her; he said, he bought them from her, and gave her ten pounds for them; in fact, he said, I gave ten pounds for them to that person; she made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300010"/>Q. Now I would ask you from the time at which you saw Charles at his lodgings, was there a possibility of his receiving the notes from any other person than the prisoner - A. No, he was not out of my sight, only while he was in the Seven Stars.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of their coming out, until the woman was apprehended, was there any possibility of his receiving them from any one else - A. No. I marked those notes that I took from Charles; I marked them that evening. I look at them; they are all forged, in the paper, and in the hand-writing; and they are forged in every respect; they import to be the signatures of the different persons who are signing clerks; but they are not the hand-writing of those persons; they are all of one stamp.</p>

            . I attended the search of Charles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to receive any notes or money from any person between his own lodging and the Seven Stars - A. It was not. After he came out again, I followed him to the corner of Old Montague-street; during the time I watched them, he could not have had any communication with any other person except the prisoner. I was not present when they were apprehended; I lost them for a short time, but got to them again in Whitechapel-road, and the prisoner was then in custody. I searched the prisoner; I told the prisoner she was charged with having sold forged notes. I asked her her name; she said her name was Woodman. So I asked her who the man was she had been drinking with, and she said he was a man she had known about twelve months, and had occasionally called to see her. I asked her whether she met him by appointment or accident that evening, and she said by accident. I asked her how long it was since she had seen him before that evening; and she said some weeks, more than a month. I had seen them in company together on the 18th, in Moorfields. I asked her where she lived, and she would not tell. I had seen her on the 15th and 18th in company with Charles. I had furnished him with ten pounds, seven pounds in notes and three pounds in silver.</p>

I keep the Ship, in Charing Cross; I know the prisoner, and have seen him there several times, I remember giving him change of a five-pound note; that was on the 18th or 19th of September. I look at this note, there is 13th 9th upon it. I had no other five-pound note at that time. I am certain this is it.</p>
               <p>MR. PARSONS. I am clerk in the house of Pole and Co.; they are bankers. I remember Mr. Camerons receiving some money from me; one of the partners came to me with Mr. Cameron's check, and I paid it; it was for sixty pounds, and drawn by C. H. Cameron; I paid it in three tens, four fives, and ten ones; I took the numbers of the fives, and one of those numbers correspond with the number of the note produced, No. 12413, dated March 13th; I think there can be no doubt that this is one of the five-pound notes paid in payment of Mr. Cameron's check. I took nothing more than the number and date of the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite clear of what my master accuses me of. The time I was paid off, I had eleven pounds given me for wages, and I brought eight pounds to London; some was notes and some was silver.</p>

I was sitting at breakfast in such a position that I could see the shop door; it was shut, I am sure, and latched. I saw the prisoner enter, I saw him make a scramble at the boots and shoes in the window; he entered by the door. Those goods were bespoke made boots. My son was sitting in the same direction, and said something, and I immediately pursued. I followed him myself; I saw him, and my son said there is a man stealing boots. I saw him take the boots; he went out with them; I pursued him immediately after; I lost sight of him in the pursuit for about a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300011"/>quarter of a minute in my going out of the door; when I regained sight of him, the boots were dropt in the street; they might be not more than ten or a dozen yards from the shop. I looked at them; I picked up one immediately, and my son another; they were mine, and in my shop that day. I know them by the number and name that is within them; together they are worth considerably more than thirty shillings; I should have lost two pairs of boots in point of value; it would render both pairs useless. I now look at the prisoner, and I am sure he is the man.</p>

I saw him go out with two boots; I pursued him myself immediately; he dropped them in the street upon my calling stop thief; he was stopt, and I came up. He dropped the boots before that. I am certain I saw him take them, and drop them.</p>

            . On the night of the 23rd of October, I was standing in my shop, it was about a quarter before nine; I had a light in my shop. I was alarmed by a sudden breaking of my windows; two pairs were broken of my shop window. I went to the door; I saw the prisoner at the bar, I have not the least doubt of his being the man, running across the street; I pursued him; I did not observe him first; I secured him with the assistance of another person, who was in the neighbourhood. After securing him, I brought him back to the shop; while in the shop, a person brought a shoe in, which he picked up in the street; his name is Meridith, and he asked me if it was my property; I said it was. We then, it being near the hour of nine, detained him in the shop until the watch came; then I delivered him up to the watchman. I am sure the panes were not broken before. At the time I took the prisoner, his hands were bleeding very much I believe both of them, but one I am positive of. There was no mark of blood about the window; there is a mark of blood on the shoe.</p>

They fought an hour and twenty minutes; each had his seconds to see fair play. I saw the whole of the fight; it ended in Curtis's being quite exhausted. He lay on the ground; in the conclusion of the fight, he was thrown; in that throwing there was nothing that was unfair. Curtis would have continued fighting longer, had it not been for his seconds, who brought him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner take any unfair advantage - A. No; I observed very much like forbearance towards the latter end of the fight on his part. When Curtis was very much beaten, about ten minutes before the conclusion of the fight the prisoner for bore very much. While Curtis was lying on the ropes, the prisoner several times could have struck him violent blows, but he held up his hands, and left him as he was; he held up his hands to the public, to see that he would not take any advantage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in Turner's conduct, which marked a cruelty of temper - A. By no means, very much the reverse; I was present when Curtis was taken off the field; he was carried to the Red Lion, at Hampton. I was with him until he died. I knew the man by sight very well; I was not present when the doctor was there. I found him in bed when I went over. I omitted telling one thing; that in the third round, before the battle finished, having a knowledge of Curtis; I went to him, and begged of him to leave off fighting. He told me there was nothing the matter with him, and he could win the fight then. The men that were seconding him, took him in their arms and carried him between the ropes, and set him on his legs; he then ran into the ring again and began fighting. His seconds had meant that he should not fight any longer; but he got under the ropes again, and would fight again, and then it ended in three rounds afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. GRIFFIN. I am a surgeon, of Hampton. I was called into the Red Lion, at Hampton, to see this young man, between seven and eight in the evening, of the 22nd of October. I did see him; he was in bed when I came; I examined his body; his head was very much swollen, so that you could scarcely distinguish a feature; there were several bruizes on his body; but none that I should conceive would be mortal. I attended him for about twenty minutes. Upon my first seeing him, I apprehended serious danger; he was perfectly in a state of insensibility; he had not the power of speech, nor the act of swallowing. I learn that he died about four hours after I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300012"/>saw him; I was not present when he died. I recommended that he should have some leeches; but without much hope. I certainly thought he would die. I did not open his body; I was not surprised at his death; I conceived his death arose from the bruizes undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman of the jury, deeply impressed with the great peril to which I am exposed, under the present heavy charge against me, and with the great difficulty I necessarily experience in substantiating my innocence. Owing to the great danger to which the most computent witnesses of the transaction would be exposed, were they to be examined. I must request your most serious attention to such facts as I shall be enabled to lay before you, by which I trust not only my natural disposition will appear, but that, on this occasion of the present sad catastrophe imputed to me, I was goaded into a consent to fight the deceased,[ who was a prize fighter] and with the greatest reluctance I entered the ring, after having been assaulted and abused with the most unremitting virulence; and when I did so, as soon as I ascertained my superiority over my antagonist, I forbore on very many occasions to avail myself of such advantages as presented themselves, and with the greatest reluctance I continued the combat, until the unfortunate event which I must ever deplore and lament, and which has placed me in my awful situation; and I must beg to state that my pursuits in life are honest, and my aversion to prize fighting great, never having before fought a pitched battle, nor should I on this occasion, but from the great aggrivation, which it will be proved I received. I assure your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the jury, that I am wholly innocent of any intention to seriously injure the deceased, and that there never existed in my mind the smallest particle of malice towards him; I trust my character for humanity and forbearance on this accasion, will have its due weight.</p>

In getting up, I got it by the chain. One said to another,"b-gg-r your bl-dy eyes an't you got the thimble." I went to get hold of Career, and I still kept the watch in my possession. He got away, and then they all dismissed; they all ran away, I knew Carter before; I kept possession of the watch it was got, out of my fob, and I caught it as it was passing. I could not catch hold of him. I called the watch; I knew no others of the party; I never lost sight of Church hardly. I lost sight of him just for a moment, going round the corner; but that was all. I followed him up directly; it was just at the corner of Oxford-street where I lost sight of him; I kept running after him; I am sure he was the same I had seen before. I lost sight of him; but not for half a minute. He had run altogether about two hundred yards. He could not run above ten yards while out of my sight. He was running alone. They all separated themselves different ways. He was going alone. He stopped at a pump, and knocked the crown of his hat in, to drink, and then I and the watchman took him.

She then seized her shawl, and with the force of pulling it from her shoulder, she fell back herself. When she got up she went a little distance, and gave it to another person; I don't know who that person was; she was in my sight. I called the watch; the watchman was nearly at my elbow sooner than I expected, and when the prisoner came back, she used abusive language, and asked did I think she had got the property.

I know something of the prisoner. In consequence of missing this, I searched all day on Monday, to no effect. I heard of it the next morning; I was at Smithfield, and a man said, he had found one, and found the man that was along with it. This person told me where she was, at a butcher's shop, in Westminster, named Stent. I went there; there I found the hide of the heiffer I had lost; it was marked, and the same colour. The prisoner was not there. Upon this, I went to the office at Queen-square, and I made an affidavit that that was the hide of the heiffer I lost.</p>

On the 21st of September last, I met the prisoner; he asked me if I thought that my master would consent for him to kill some beasts at my master's slaughter-house; I told him I did not know, but he had better go and ask him; he said he would. I remember a beast being brought; the prisoner brought a heiffer; I observed the mark on it H B; I helped him to tie it up in the slaughter-house, and we locked the doors, and went away.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am charged with stealing a heiffer out of Smithfield-market, and I trust I shall be able to prove my innocence. I met a butcher that I knew perfectly well, and he asked me if I had any thing to do, and I was telling him that I had not, and he asked me if I could kill a heiffer for him, and I told him I could not give him a positive answer then, but I would go to Mr. Stent and ask him if he would let me kill it in his slaughter-house, and I met the young man, and asked him, and he told me that it was half-a-crown for killing it there; and I went to the butcher, and told him that I had seen Mr. Stent's young man, and he said it was half-a-crown for killing it there; he said very well, that would do, and he gave me a glass of liquor; he told me he had twenty-five altogether, and I should have the killing of them all. He then left me, and I went to Mr. Stent, and he told me I might go to his place, and kill it directly, then Mr. Stent's boy came, and helped me to drive her in, and tie her up in the slaughter-house, and then I came back and killed her, and when I came to take her to market, I was taken into custody.</p>

He slept in the attic story; I slept in the next room; I put my watch under my head when I went to bed. I rose the next morning, at half past seven o'clock; I looked at my watch to see what time it was, and I put it back under the bolster. The prisoner had no opportunity of seeing it there. The watch was concealed under the bolster, but the seal, key, and ribbon were not; any person coming into the room might see them; then I got up, I went down stairs, and I did not see the prisoner until a quarter past eight o'clock. when I was sweeping the drawing-room stairs. He said he thought it was very late; he went out of the house without his hat, and I went up stairs afterwards, is consequence of the manner in which he went out. I went up stairs in search of my watch, and it was gone. I am sure I had seen it at half past seven o'clock. The prisoner had not been in my room to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Dunbar, a pawnbroker, in Skinner-street, Sommer's Town. On the 19th of October, I received a silver watch in pledge from the prisoner, and a gold seal; they were pawned for one pound ten shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Mr. Balfour's on the day in the indictment, and I knocked at the gate, and I said I wished to see Richard, the black servant, and the other servant said he had gone out at the front door, and I asked him how he did; and he introduced me into the kitchen, and I asked him what o'clock it was, and he took out his watch and gave it me, and said "look, and you will see;" and he went and left me with the watch in my hand; and he came again in about half an hour; and in a short time this young woman came and sat down to supper, and they pressed me to stay and take a bed, and she said it must be aired, and we went up stairs, and she said about a quarter of an hour with me. In the morning I rose, and I thought it was between ten and eleven o'clock; it was so light, and I saw this watch, and I took it, and she told me to go down stairs and get my hat, and not finding it, I went through the kitchen, the way I came.</p>

About eight o'clock at night, on the 24th of September, I was at home. I went up stairs; I think it was rather past eight o'clock. There was a light in the shop; I had lit a large lamp for about three hours at that time, and I lighted it as soon as it was dark. It was quite dark at the time I am speaking of. Before I went up stairs, I had shut the shop door myself; I had shut it upon the latch; it leads into the street. Before I went up stairs, I left my watch in the little parlour; it had a gold chain; it was hanging on one side of the waistcoat. It hung in a corner where any one who came into the shop could see it. When I came down stairs, I wanted to look what it was o'clock, and I missed my watch; I am quite sure it had been hanging in the place where it had usually hung, when I went up stairs. I let nobody in the shop. There was nobody in the parlour but myself. I pereceived that my watch was gone. I looked at the door, but could see nobody. I found it standing half open. I was quite sure it was on the latch before I went up stairs. I thought the least of its being open. I remember perfectly well it was so. I did not miss my watch until after I had perceived the door was open. I am quite clear I had shut it myself. I sent to one of the Hatton Garden officers that evening. I did not see my watch until the morning following; I then saw the watch, chain, and seal, all together.</p>

            . Between three and four o'clock, on the morning of the 25th, before day-break, I went into a house in Newgate Market. I found the prisoner at the bar, and two others, in that house. They had been drinking, but were not drinking then. I knew them all three to be suspicious characters. I knew them all. I took hold of the prisoner, and asked him if he had any thing about him; he said, "no, he had nothing." I had not heard at that time of Mrs. Black having been robbed. Upon his saying he had nothing, I began to search him. I found nothing, either in his hat or pockets; but when I came to search him rather close, I found the watch, chain, and seal on him, in his breeches, close to his knee, in his pantaloons. He would neither give an account of it, nor the maker's name, nor the number of it. I asked him where he got it; he said, "he met a strange man in Long-lane, who gave it him, and he did not know the man, and should not know him again. I took him into custody, and the others also. They were discharged. I have had the watch ever since. I am perfectly clear that is the watch which was taken from the prisoner at the bar.</p>

When he could not do that very easily, I turned round and he seized my coat, still holding the umbrella; immediately then I was seized on the other side by some one else hold the other arm; then a third one came and took my watch out of my pocket, which third one is one of the prisoners at the bar I saw the man's hand and the face of that man.

I asked him if he would know the persons who robbed him if he saw them again; he said he would. I told him I would take him to different houses which character's of that sort used. I took him to two or three. He looked about the tap rooms of several of them, and did not see any one he knew; at last I took him to the Castle in Tothill street, little Gray's-inn-lane; I did not tell him what sort of a house it was before he went in; but pointing to Latham he said that is one that seized my umbrella. Then he looked over the settle to another part of the tap-room, and pointed out Seawood. I asked him if there was any one else he knew; and he said, no. I asked him if he was positive those were the people, and he said, yes. I took them into custody, and searched them, and there was nothing about them.

            . I am deputy publisher of the Observer Newspaper. The prisoner's office was to count out the papers. I myself take the blank paper to the <placeName id="t18161030-17-crimeloc95">Stamp Office</placeName>

I believe he brought me back the same numbers, but we don't count them. I then deliver them out to him in quantities to be wetted, and he finishes wetting on the Saturday morning. It is then put up in a cupboard in the press-room, and he locks that cupboard himself. Then when the pressmen begin to print, the two first come to me for the key. The printing goes on with great velocity. The first and last page are first printed at one press, then the third page is printed at another press, and the last page is kept open for the latest intelligence. The prisoner is then employed to count the paper out at the presses, and bring them down to me. Then it is delivered to the different Newsmen who come for it, and I count them out to see that the number agrees with the number that was brought from the Stamp Office. When the paper comes from the Stamp Office it would be smooth, it would not have the appearance of being folded up in a pocket. When it is so counted it is distributed among the Newsmen, The prisoner used sometimes to take out newspapers for Mr. Clements on account of the Office. He would get sixpence for them each when selling them for Mr. Clements, and they would be retailed afterwards at sevenpence, and the penny would be the profit of the retailer. It was not known that he sold papers on his own account; it was not his duty. He had to go a particular round, which was from the Observer Office, along the Strand to Charing Cross: Drury-lane was not in his ward. He lived in Drury-lane.</p>

            . I am one of the pressmen of the Observer newspaper. On the 22nd of September I observed that this sheet had a stamp inlaid. The regular course is for the stamp to be printed on the paper itself. That occasioned in me some suspicion that all was not right. The manner in which we conduct our business is, after the outside sheets are composed, the printers go to the closet where the paper is deposited, and take the stamped paper out as they want it. It is made up into parcels of 250, that is, a sheet is turned down after every 250, which projects. They are delivered to Meyrick, who takes them away when they are finished. He counts them into quires, and delivers them to the publisher. The customers take them away by quires. The pressman has no check against the person who wets. He might put two or three more into every 250. The printer goes printing on as he finds the paper, and does not count. The fly boys have also access to the place where the paper is deposited. I believe it has been the practice to repair sheets at our office when a sheet is spoiled, by taking the stamp from the spoiled sheet and putting it on another sheet.</p>

               <p>Q. But you could not pick up any stamp in the Observer printing room, except an Observer stamp. For instance, you could not pick up a Morning Chronicle stamp? - A. No, not unless it was brought in with some refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. The stamp on the paper you hold in your hand is not an Observer stamp? - A. No; it has been used before, and there is the tyye of another newspaper on it.</p>

            . I am in the office of the Solicitor for the Stamp Office. I saw the prisoner. We had before applied to Bow-street, and procured a warrant for his apprehension. He came to the Stamp Office and surrendered himself voluntarily. I then shewed him the newspapers with the stamps pasted on them. I asked him how he came to have done it? He told me that he certainly did do it, but not with any fraudulent intention. I asked him what he meant by fraudulent intention? for it appeared that one stamp had been torn from a Morning Chronicle, and another from some other paper; consequently the revenue must be defrauded of the duty in those two papers. He said he could explain it in no other way, than that he had received a certain number of stamped sheets from the deputy publisher to wet down for the printers, and after those sheets were printed he was responsible to the deputy publisher for a like number. That in the course of printing off the newspaper a number of copies would be spoilt, and in that case he was required to tear off the stamp, and paste it in an unstamped sheet: and knowing that he was responsible to the deputy publisher for the number of sheets he had before received from him, he would look on the floor of the printing office for stamps which had been torn off spoiled sheets by the pressmen, which he would pick up and paste on unstamped sheets, and the stamps in question must have been stamps which he had so found on the floor, but he could not tell how they came there.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAMBERT, printer of the Morning Chronicle, proved that the transposed stamps had been on a sheet on which the Morning Chronicle of the 21st of September was printed.</p>

I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner in the act of drawing my pocket handkerchief from my pocket. I said, "you rascal, you have attempted to pick my pocket." I did not apprehend him then; but I followed him down Little St. Thomas Apostle's. There I knew the residence of a constable. At that constable's door I apprehended him and gave him in charge. He had not thoroughly taken the handkerchief out.</p>

            . I know the person of the man at the bar. On the 10th of September last he came into Mr. Vernell's warehouse, and asked me if Mr. Vernell was at home. I told him he was not. There was a piece of Mazarene sarsnet and a piece of drab lustring on the counter. They were within his reach. He told me to look into the back warehouse, and look for the name of Brown. I went into the back warehouse, and just turned over a leaf or two of the weaver's book, and came back again. I am sure it was the name of Brown he made use of. I then returned to the front warehouse again. The prisoner was still there. I told him I could find no such name. He said yes, he was sure there was, and I must go and look again. I went again, for I thought it was of consequence. He appeared respectably dressed. I was not gone the second time more than ten minutes at farthest. I could see no such name. I then returned, and the prisoner was gone. The lustring was there still, but the sarsnet gone. There were sixty-seven yards of it. I ran out of doors directly, but could not see the prisoner. I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

The prisoner came into my master's warehouse, and enquired for a strange name, and asked me if we manufactured figured sarsnets. I told him, no, that we only manufactured plain goods. He then asked to see a piece. I put a piece on the counter before him, and he asked what was the net price of it, as he was going into the country, and he would pay money for it. I went to the desk to see what was the net price; that was about three yards from me; and he walked over to the press where the goods were kept. That was opposite the counter, and he remarked what long lengths they were; and he said he had got a friend waiting at the door, and he would go and ask him to come up. He then left the warehouse, but did not return. I was not alarmed. It was four or five minutes before I suspected any thing. We had only one piece of sarsnet in the house. I do not know when I had seen it before, but I know I did not sell it. I did not look for that, as there was only one piece, and I did not miss any of the others. I did not miss that plain piece until two or three days afterwards. I cannot swear it was taken that day. I have never seen it again.</p>

I had then lighted candles: it was dark. I fastened the shop by locking it once. After that I went into the kitchen at the back of the house. I had not been there above three or four minutes, before my attention was called to the shop again. A noise I heard in the passage drew my attention. When I went into the shop I perceived the door to be open. I am sure I had effectually locked it. I missed the articles in the indictment. Upon that I raised an alarm, and caused a pursuit to be made.</p>

I was informed of the robbery, and overtook the prisoner about two miles and a half from Colnbrook, in the road from Colnbrook to Hounslow towards London. He had the property in question embraced in his arms, uncovered. I asked him how he came by it, and told him I suspected he was the person who committed the depredation. He made no kind of reply. I brought him back to Longford; that is fifteen miles from London. Mr. Tatnell was present, and identified his property. The prisoner did not give any account how he came by the property then. Before the magistrate, he said he found it about a mile and a half from Colnbrook. There was a Mr. Edwards with the prisoner when I took him.</p>

I since know that it was about two hundred yards from Tatnell's house. It was between eight and nine o'clock: it was quite dark; the lamps were lighted on the coaches. He had a bundle with him. I asked him where he was going, and he said to London. He said he had been to Egham races, hawking clothes about. I could not particularly see what it was he had; and I did not know, till he himself told me, that it was clothes. While he was with me, he did not find nor pick up any property.</p>

            . I am Sexton of the parish church of Heston. Lord Jersey has a pew in that church. It was the custom of his family to leave their prayer-books in that church. There were two quarto ledger prayer-books and an octavo prayer-book in their pew. I saw the church safe on the 24th of September at a funeral. Every thing was then safe, as far as I could see. I had seen every thing safe on the Sunday. I took it for granted every thing was safe on the Tuesday. It was my custom to keep the parish pall in the church. After that I was not in the church from the Tuesday until the Friday. I went out a little way, and when I came home I found that there was a hue, and cry. I went to it on the 25th, Friday, about four o'clock in the afternoon. I found it locked as I had left it. When I got inside, I missed the three prayer-books from the Earl of Jersey's pew. I searched the church carefully over, and I found two books belonging to the communion table were moved out of a cupboard into which I always put them. I have seen the pall since, and have got it now. Whoever it was that stole these things got in by breaking a window, which made space enough for a person to get in. It was about seven feet from the ground, but there was a tomb close, on which he must have got. I saw the pall afterwards on Saturday afternoon. My little girl brought it. Heston is about fourteen miles from here, and twelve from Golden Square.</p>

               <p>- On the 25th of September the prisoner came and offered a quarto prayer-book to pledge. He asked five shillings for it: that was not near its value. I should suppose it was worth from 25s. to 30s. I asked him where he got it from? He said it was his own. I asked him where he bought it? He said he did not buy it, but he had it given him by a gentleman for cleaning his boots and shoes, instead of wages. I told him I thought that was not a very probable thing; so I went and acquainted Mr. Harrison. The prisoner was still in the shop. I went and informed Mr. Harrison, my master. Having conferred with him, he came and questioned the prisoner himself. I heard what passed between them. He asked him where he lodged, or where the gentleman lived that had given him the book? He could not tell us He said he could not tell; he was out of town, and he did not know him. Mr. Harrison then asked him where the gentleman lodged? He told us he did not know, that he believed somewhere in Whitechapel; to which Mr. Harrison said, that would not do; he must take him before a magistrate, and he must give an account where he got the book from. Mr. Harrison said he would take him, and therefore it was needless to make any resistance. He went along with Mr. Harrison. They had not got a long way, before I had occasion to go up stairs, and I was under the necessary of going through the passage where the prisoner had stood, and I stumbled over something. I took it up, and found it to be a bag, and it contained two other prayer-books; one exactly like the one he had offered to pledge. a quarto, and the other a large sized octavo. I immediately took the books I found in the bag to Maryborough-street to Mr. Harrison. The books were examined, and the prisoner was remanded for a further examination. The books have continued in my possession ever since.</p>

When I got into the court this man, seizing me by the collar, took the watch out of my pocket. The other man tried to pacify me, and put his hand on my shoulder; but I pursued this man, and cried stop thief, and halloed murder, and ran after the prisoner, and never lost sight of him. He was taken before a quarter of an hour had elapsed. I am sure I never lost sight of him, and I have not the least doubt but the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. This was about nine o'clock. I saw this man and another looking at a play-bill at a small butter shop, the other side Bedford-street. They might be able to see the seal and key hanging below my waistcoat. This was a very little way from Castle-street. The prisoner went up the court before me, and waited to see if I came up the court. As I passed him I thought his attention was fixed on me. I thought he was eying me, and I tucked my ribbon up. No one spoke to me when he robbed me. I turned the corner of the court nearly at the same time that he did, and did not lose sight of him. He dodged about the coaches in Bedford-street. I had sight of him all the time, and he ran into St. Paul's churchyard, where he was secured.</p>
               <p>- On the night in question I heard the cry, and I pursued round and saw the prisoner running up Bedford-street. He was going along Chandos-street, and I immediately stood before him, and then he turned back and went up Bedford-street, and I followed him. He dodged about among the coaches, and he knocked me down. I got up again and pursued him, and he ran into the church-yard. There I followed him. There he struck me and knocked me down again, but I secured him.</p>

After he went out I missed the cloth, and I went after him, I went as far as Charles-street, Drury-lane, and could see nothing of him. In about a quarter of an hour after that I thought I would not give it up, but I went again, and I saw

I pursued them as close as I could, and Richard Kelley appeared to have something under his coat, and was running very fast down Short's Gardens. I pursued him, crying stop thief, and he was stopped. In Short's Gardens I afterwards found the bundle which contained the cloth in question. Daniel Kelley, who had been in the shop, got clear off. Prescott was afterwards apprehended. I did not see the two prisoners about the door.</p>

            ; she was the cook; I had no other servant; the 28th of July, was a Sunday. I went to bed before eleven o'clock on the night of that day. Before I went to bed, I had an opportunity of being positively certain that the windows of the parlour and the street door were fastened; but I am not positive as to any other parts of the house. I got up the next morning before six; I first went to my dressing room, and thence to the drawing room; I remained in the drawing room about ten minutes and thence went into the dressing room again. Then the cook Holloway came to me, at about ten minutes before seven. In consequence of something that passed between us, I went down to the kitchen; I found one of the kitchen windows open; we found some papers strewed about the kitchen; my writing-desk that had been in the parlour the day before, was on the ground, and broken open; the papers out of the desk were scattered about. I saw that the street door was open; the bolt was drawn, so as to prevent the door from shutting to. I saw a wine bottle behind the door, and an empty tumbler; there was a little wine in the bottle; but nothing else that I discovered. There was another bottle behind the parlour door, with a candle in it; that candle had certainly been burnt; I could ascertain that it was one that had been in one of my candlesticks; it was not a common kitchen candle, but had been in one of the candlesticks that were stolen. I discovered the sidebord locks broken, and the papers and things that were in the sid board were scattered about. I kept some plate in that sideboard; I had kept it locked when I went to bed. There was a silver bread basket there; the greater part of the plate in the indictment was there. The value altogether was about four hundred pounds; it cost a great deal more. It was on the Saturday before that the prisoner Fricker applied to me to clean the plate; she came to me for a silver waiter; it was a very large one. She asked for that particularly; it had never been cleaned by her before; it was in my bed-room. She had been in my service nearly three months. I had never asked her to clean it, not intimated to her that I wished it to be cleaned. She asked me for it three times, and at lenght I was induced to give it to her. I don't recollect that I expected company, or that there was any reason for her getting it. She also asked for two gilt silver spoons which belonged in the egg stand, and that would make the egg stand comple. They were kept in the drawer with the other plate in the parlour. The waiter might be worth twenty pounds, I believe it cost thirty. When I went up stairs to bed on the Sunday night, the prisoner Fricker came into my room; I used a gilt silver candlestick to go to bed with. She came and took that candlestick up; I asked her what she wanted that candlestick for, and she put it down again, and went out of the room, She brought me a letter, and a few minutes after, she wanted to go out, and I told her I could not spare her, and she said she must go out, and she would, for it was of consequence, she did go out. Her clothes were in the kitchen at that time packed up; it was afterwards discovered to be so. I have a neighbour named King. In consequence of some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300022"/>thing which he said to me, I looked for my green pelisse, and it was not in the place where it was left.</p>

             was a servant to her. Fricker was not at home all Sunday. the 28th of July; she went out at half past seven in the evening; she said she wanted to go, but I did not observe the moment that she went; until she returned about ten; when she came back, I was in the parlour. In about five minutes my mistress called her up into the parlour; my mistress gave her a pelisse; she was to have taken it up stairs to my mistress's bed room. She returned into the kitchen. I asked her to go to bed; she looked at the clock, and said, it was very soon. I left her; I did not go into my room; I went into the parlour. At this time, Mrs. Ashworth had just gone up. There was no work left behind to be done. I heard a noise like raking out cinders; but I had raked out the fire before. I went down, and asked her what she was doing it for, she said she had no particular reason for doing it. I asked her to come to bed, but she did not; she sat down. I said she had better not, sit down, but come to bed; which she did not do. I went up stairs, and left her below. I went into my mistress's bed room. I was attending my mistress there when the prisoner came up; she had a candle in a flat candlestick; but went down for a save-all; she spoke to my mistress and me as she was going down; she said, she had forgotten it. My mistress and I went down stairs into the parlour. Pricker went down stairs for it, and returned with it is a moment; she said, she had got it; when she returned, I was in the passage, on the ground floor, with my mistress. At the time I am now speaking of, the street door was fast. I had fastened it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you before this seen that the windows and doors were fast - A. One window I am positive of, the one that was close against the kitchen door; but I am not certain of the window that was found open. The door behind opens into a little yard at the back of the house; that was never fastened; but I am sure it was shut; there are railings at the back of it. Nobody could get in at that back door, without tearing up the railings, and the railings were quite safe. I am positive that the windows were shut; but I am not positive that they were fastened. I did not leave any candle in the kitchen table when I went up stairs. The candles that Mrs. Ashworth used in her sitting room, were snuffed out, and left on the parlour table; I am quite sure they were both mould candles, and they were in silver candlesticks. After I had met Fricker on the stair-case, my mistress went up stairs; I followed her, and Fricker followed last, all going up to bed. Fricker slept in the same room with me, but not the same bed. When I got into the bed room, Fricker went into my mistress's hed room; she joined me in a minute or two; she was not with me long before she left me saying she had left her book below; I told her she had not, for that she had left it in her mistress's dressing room; she said she was positive she had, left it on the kitchen table. I had not seen the book in my mistress's dressing room, but I had seen it in Fricker's hand as she was coming up stairs and went into my mistress's dressing room, therefore I told her so. She did not remain below above four or five minutes, not longer than was necessary in fetch the book as I thought at the moment; when she returned with the book, she looked the door, and came in and undressed herself, and got into bed, and read a little of the book, and then asked me to put the candle out; I did so. She had never before taken up a book to read. I did not wake, myself, in the morning, but she waked me; that was unusual; I got up, and looked at the clock, I discovered it was a little after six; she said to me when she called me that it was time to get up. I told her I was rather surprised at her calling me, for it was not usual for her to get up until nine o'clock; I don't remember that she made any answer. she got up at the same time; but I went down first. My usual hour of getting up was seven. She got up once, when I first came to live there early to work; but on this morning. I know of no work she had to do. When I went down stairs, there was light enough to see without a candle, it was very light; I perceived a little light through the street door. I saw a empty bottle and runner in the passage. I did not look at the street door to see whether it was a-jar or not. I went straight into the kitchen; I saw the cupboard door open; that had been locked when I went to bed, I am positive. I saw my mistress's writing desk and tea caddy in the kitchen, and I saw at the papers were scattered about on the ground. I perceived that the kitchen front door was a little on the jar, unfastened and open; it could not be opened by any other way than from within by the appearance. One window was fast as I had left it, and the other window shutter was open; but the window itself was down; at that window there were usually flower pots standing; they appeared to be in the same stare that I left them in the day before, apparently nobody had distubred them. Any one to get in at the window from the out side, must have moved the flower pots, for the window is very high. I did not stay for any time in the kitchen, but returned to my mistress's bed room; at that time I did not know what to think. Fricker I had left in the bed-room; but going up, I met her coming down, looking very pale, my mistress went down before me, for I was very much alarmed. Afterwards I came down stairs. My mistress called me into the parlour, and shewed me how the things were broken. I found the sideboard broken open, and the house robbed, as my mistress has told you. I never knew of a candle being used in the neck of a bottle in my mistress's house. The prisoner Fricker went out on the Tuesday following; I had been out myself to the butcher's at about ten minutes before four; the butcher lived a little way down Oxford-street; my mistress's house is above Castle-street, near the Middlesex Hospital; therefore I would pass the corner of Castle-street in going to Oxford-street. When I returned, there was a tall man standing at the door, speaking to

I did not know the man before. When Fricker went away, she did not say any thing to me, nor did I to her. She was gone near open an hour; when she returned. I asked her where she had been, as she knew that I wanted to get my mistress's dinner, and that my mistress wanted to go out. She said she had been out to vent her mind to that person who had called upon her. That was all she said. There had not been any quarrell between her and her mistress, or me, to give her occasion to vent her mind on any subject. I had no reason to expect that she was going to leave Mrs. Ashworth.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of July, I went to the house of the prosecutrix, in Berner's-street. I immediately inspected the house, to see in what manner it had been entered. I found the street - door had no key-hole on the outside; therefore the lock could not have been picked. There was no appearance of violence on the outside, nor in any other part. I observed the window next to the fire place, and observed one leaf of the shutter was a little open. My attention was called to that by the prisoner Fricker. On my going down she told me that that was the way they got in. I went with her to the outside of that window in the area; there were six flower pots standing on the window sill; they were all of different sizes, and they had all plants in them, reaching a good way up the window. Those plants reached above the window, nearly as far as the front part, and some days previous to this, there had been rain, and a crust was formed round the bottom of each pot, that enabled me to observe whether they had been removed. I am positive they had not been removed lately, and no person could have got in there; it would have taken a great deal of care to have replaced them exactly in the same situation, if they had been removed. I did this in the presence of Fricker, and acquainted her with my observation. She strongly insisted that they had got in at that window; she did not say any thing else at that time. I examined the front area over, and other parts, to examine where they had been forced; there are no steps in the area; if there he a step, it can not exceed a couple or three inches in height, as it is only the sill of the door. I found no force had been used at the area door. That door was lined with iron. and the shutters was lined with iron; there was no appearance of force at all; they could not have got in at the back area door, for there were iron rails over it. The hall door had been shut before I came. Afterwards I found a bottle and candle, and and so forth. I afterwards searched her box; she was present. At that time I did not look for plate. Subsequently I found a piece of flannel which I have here. After I had taken her into custody, I had some conversation with her. At the first time I stated my suspicion; but left her in the house. I took her into custody before I found the flannel on the Tuesday. After I had taken her into custody on the Tuesday afternoon. I asked her who the man was that she had been speaking to cued the corner. half or three quarters of an hour before. She searched very reluctant to tell me; I proceed her to tell me and said, surely she could have no objection to tell me who he was. She then said, "he was a tally man." She explained that to be a hawking linen draper, who takes part payment for goods at a time. She said, "she had owed him eight shillings up wards of twelve months, and he had found her out at her place by accident, and she went out to pay him." She said "his name was Finch, and she became acquainted with him when she was at Miss Clarkson's. at Kentish Town, a lady who kept a boarding school."She said,"she had not seen him for upwards of twelve months." There was nothing farther passed that I recollect. She said, "she was a widow, and that she had been so for seven or eight years." The name of Kelley was not spoken of at all. When Kelley was before the magistrate, and the box was opened there, he claimed some leather which was in it.</p>

As they they came in I started up from the table, and asked them whom they wanted, and they said, "they belonged to Mr. Kelley; Old Kelley followed last. In about two minutes old Kelley and Hitchen came down. Old Kelley told me that one was his son, and had just come out of the country. Young Kelley remained up stairs for about a quarter of an hour, and then went out in shoes. Young Kelley called again on Tuesday, at about half past six o'clock with Hitchen. He went away and came again, and asked if the old man was returned. They came again and supped with old Kelley and a friend. Young Kelley stopped and slept with his father. Hitchen went away about half past ten. Old Kelley went to see his friend home, and then returned. It was the lady who was to be his wife; a person of the name of Hansell. On Wednesday morning William Kelley got up at about ten o'clock, and washed himself and went away. He came again on the Thursday, at about half past six o'clock, as near as I can tell, and asked if the old gentleman was at home; I told him no, and he asked me to send for him, and I did so. Soon after he came down and asked me for a light, and I gave him one, and it appeared to me that he had been using sealing wax, and he had a cord to cord a box, and I went up and saw that box; It was a red box; I had painted it red for old Kelley in the latter end of May, I asked the younger Keley if his father was going to lend him that box, and he said, "yes," and said, "he must have it back again next week."

I remember his coming to our house; but I don't know whether it was in the month of August, or not; it was in the summer, some weeks before he was taken up. He called just at dusk, he called to ask whether he might leave a box there; and I said yes. He put the box into the shop; my husband is a carpenter. Old Kelley called in two or three days afterwards, and he said he moved the box because he was moving to Mrs. Stansell's by degrees. He was there several times afterwards, but did not say any more about the box. It might remain a week or a fortnight. I don't remember his coming with a basket. He fetched the box away on an evening, but I don't know how he took it away.</p>

            . I am the husband of last witness. I know old Kelley. I have done work for him now and then. I understood he came to leave a box while I was not at home; he came afterwards, and told me he had left a box, and hoped it would not be in my way. We moved it out of the back parlour where we were working, up into the two pair of stairs front room; he was going to move it by himself, and I said Mr. Kelly, I will lend you a hand; it was a box similar to the one new produced. He and I moved it up together; it might be half or three quarters of a hundred weight. I remember his coming there with a basket in his hand, and said he wanted some tools out of the box; by which I understood that there were tools in the box.</p>

            . In the month of August last, I saw old Kelley in the street with a large box similar to the one produced, within three or four doors of Underwood's house. I was at work at Mr. Underwood's one evening when he came in and asked me if Mr. Underwood was within. At another time I saw him come down stairs with a rush basket, and I understood he had been up to get tools out of the box; it was when he came down that he had the basket.</p>

             came to my house on the 29th of August; he came with a wheelbarrow, with his trunk in it. He stopped at the door, and, "how do you do, Mrs. Compton; will you be so good as to let me leave this trunk at your house." I said, I have not room for it, unless you put it into the potatoe binn. He said, "that would do. It belongs to a young man who has left his situation, and it has got his clothes in it. He said it might be a day or two first, but when he got a situation he would move it again. That trunk remained there nine days, I think until the 12th of September; on that day a woman came who made an application for the trunk. In consequence of suspicion, I went to Malborough street office, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300025"/>magistrates sent an officer to my house, he took the trunk to the office, and I saw it broken open at the office; it was then in the same state as it was when it was first left. I did not put any thing into it. When it was opened, there was a good deal of plate and other things in it. I did not see any clothes in it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. In consequence of the last witness having made an application at our office, I went and got a trunk; this is it, and I have had it in my custody ever since. We broke it open at our office, and on opening it, we found four silver desert spoons, ten table spoons, four tea-spoons, one butter-knife, one marrow spoon, one pair of steel snuffers, a silver salt seller, a cut glass mustard pot, three damask tablecloths, six yards of new towelling, a metal brass mounted travelling ink-stand, a piece of green baize, a table cover with a yellow border; these are all worth considerably more than twenty pounds.</p>

            . The younger Kelley lodged with me; I let him one room; he came on the 29th of January, and remained until the 24th of July. The woman at the bar, Fricker, came to lodge with him as his wife; they lived there together as man and wife, for about a couple of months; then she got a place in Berner's-street. While she was in place there, she came twice to see him. I heard of the robbery in Berner's-street about a week after West-end Fair. I remember the prisoner Fricker was taken up and was in prison. I remember the prisoner Kelley coming for me; he called on me once, and as I was at home, I received him. The second time I was out. The third time a lad called for me, and when I saw him on these several occasions, he made inquiries how I did, and whether any one had been for him. I remember asking him why he did not come to my house; he said he had reasons for it; he sent for me, and I went to him several times; once Mr. Hitchen came for me. I went to the place where Kelley was five or six times when be sent messages to me. On one of these occasions, he desired me to go to Marlborough-street; he said he expected Fricker to be brought up to the office, and I was to observe whether she came for examination from the House of Correction. During the latter part of the time that he lodged with me with Fricker, they appeared very miserably poor, with scarcely any thing to cover their nakedness. When I saw him in August and September, before he was taken up, he appeared comfortable, with a newish kind of a hat, a goodish coat and breeches, with new stockings, and he had a watch. I remember seeing him ahd Hitchin together when he desired me to go for an attorney for him in Hatton Garden; I refused.</p>

            . I live in Berner's-street, exactly opposite to Mrs. Ashworth's house. I remember the circumstance of her house being robbed. On the Tuesday, I was in my shop, and saw a person standing at the corner of Castle-street and Berner-street, apparently looking up to the second floor of Mrs. Ashworth's house in Berner-street; I should suppose it was then about four o'clock in the afternoon. He watched her house I should suppose for the space of one or two minutes. I saw Mrs. Athworth's servant maid almost immediately come out of the house, and come to the corner to him; it was the prisoner Fricker. It appeared when they met together, by the motion of her right hand to his left, that something passed from one to the other; I did not see the colour of that something; they went a little way down Castle-street, and immediately returned, crossed over the way towards No. 10, and went down Bernersstreet. Knowing the robbery had been committed, I beckoned to Mrs. Ashworth, who was immediately opposite with the window open, and pointed to the prisoners. In consequence of what I observed, I desired my son to watch the man; I believe I did as far as Oxford-street; I observed him; he was a tall man with long dark whiskers, a dark black beard, apparently of two days standing. I thought I had seen that man before, frequently taking up a position, and always such that his eyes was ben on Mrs. Ashwoith's house. I have seen him in that position from perhaps an how to an hour and a half, or two hours. I look at the hat; the younger Kelley resembles that man, but I could not swear to him.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 30th of July, my father called my attention to a man in the street; but not until I had seen that man there before; I had seen that man there before; I had seen him about half past one or two o'clock that day standing there. I first saw him about ten, and his eyes were fixed on Mrs. Ashworth's house. About ten minutes before my father called my attention to him. I saw him Fricker came out, and gave him something like green silk, which she had concealed under her apron, and when Kelley took it, he put it under his coat; I saw them go down to the corner of Newman-mews, in conversation, and in a few minutes they parted. Young Kelley I speak positively to.</p>

            's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I feel much concerned to see that so much of the valuable time of the Court has been taken up on this occasion; but if the Court had allowed me before my trial, I could have saved your Lordship all that trouble; but I could not suffer any one to be hurt, if I could say or do any thing of importance. I have therefore submited myself to take my trial, to do the other prisoners that justice which they have a right to require at my hands. I shall therefore coniess to your Lorship that I am the only guilty person; and whatever the other prisoners have done, they have been induced so to do from my mis-representation of the case. Consider what must my feelings be in bringing the grey hairs of my aged father, who spared no parts or expence to render me a respectable member of society, to this ignominious and disgraceful situation. With respect to Hitchin, the consequence of his conviction would be still more unfortunate than to me; for an aged father and an invalided sister who look up to him for support,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300026"/>would he deprived of that support.

            , I can't conceive that any proof has been adduced to affect her. I am undoubtedly bound to confess the innocence of them all; and if it would be any satisfaction to the Court, I would confess the manner in which the robbery was committed. With respect to my own innocence, I would not have broken and entered the house; but I am an accessary certainly, and have led all the other prisoners to what they have done; and all of them are innocent, so help me God.

            . I live with Mr. Morgan, No. 30, Percy-street. On the morning of the 26th of September, I saw that the kitchen roof of the house in question was stript of the lead. We got into the house, and in the passage found the very piece of lead which was cut from the roof, and which fitted to it, which we marked; the last witness, the constable, and I were altogether. The copper and fixtures were all gone. We watched, expecting the person who cut the lead would call for it; and on the 28th, in the morning, about six o'clock, we saw the prisoner at the bar on the roof of the kitchen, and we took him into custody with the lead in question; then we took him to the watchhouse.</p>

I took it to Mr. Bateman's, at No. 108, Bunhill Row. Mr. Bateman wished it to be taken back to my master's house, as there were two gentlemen with an order for it.

It was at last taken away from me by another man. The prisoner threw me down and then walked away. I raised an alarm; I could not tell in what direction the other man went.

            . On the 8th of October last, in consequence of suspicion, I watched the prisoner who was also in his service. I went to the pepper tub and laid the pepper bowl, and put a small piece of stick over it, which if moved I should know. I then went to an apartment, from which I could see the prisoner. I saw him take a bag and go to the pepper tub, and fill it with pepper. I then came from the place where, I was, and called him from the warehouse. After that, I charged him with it, and he strongly denied it. Mr.

I I put my hand to my pocket, and turned on my heel, but my handkerchief was disposed of. The prisoner was within a foot of me. I could have no doubt, but that he was the person, as there was no one near. I accused him, and he instantly

             the handkerchief from his side pocket, and begged that I would not prosecute him, as he was a poor man. I however resisted his entreaties, and he then abused me, and declared that I was one of Vaughan's gang. To avoid his escape, I threw up his heels, and held him on the pavement, and kept him until an officer came.</p>

On the 19th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300029"/>of October, I received information about eight o'clock in the morning, that a gold watch had been stolen; and about two hours afterwards, the prisoner Henrickson offered a gold watch to me to pawn for three pounds. I asked her whose it was? and she said, her sister's. I secured her immediately, and took her towards the Thames Police office. Going down Old Gravel-lane, she turned up a court, expressing a wish to change her shoes before she went to the office. I kept the watch by me all the time. She went into a house, and I followed her. She went into a room on the ground floor, and I staid outside the door. Through the crevice between the door and the door post, I saw her take something from her pocket, and hide it under the bed clothes. She then came out, and said as she could not find the shoes, she must go as she was. When I got to the office, I informed the officers of what I had seen, and I accompanied them back, and shewed them the house.</p>

While they were searching the place below, I went up into the attick, and there I found the prisoner Ashton, concealed in a closet. I took him into custody, and round his neck I found this silk handkerchief, which is claimed by the prosecutor. I immediately asked him if he had sent the watch to pledge by a women? and he said, he had. I then took him to the office. Henrickson was there before us, and I asked Ashton whether that was the woman he had sent to pledge the watch? and he said, it was. I asked him where he got it? and he said, he found it on the Dock-hill, wrapt up in some paper. I afterwards apprehended the prisoner Dickson in the same room that I had apprehended Ashton in.</p>

On the Sunday morning, I was there when he came home; I was down in the cellar. When he came in, his wife and the prisoner were at home at the place. On Sunday night, the 14th of September, he went to an Irishman's wake; he was an Irishman. He staid there until about three or four o'clock in the morning; he was in liquor when he returned. I did not go home with him. He went out the next morning at about seven or eight o'clock; I was there. Then he went out with a man who invited him to drink. He came back about eleven o'clock in liquor; his wife was selling a pair of shoes at the door; the man said one was larger than the other; her son, the prisoner, was then down in the cellar. Upon these words, the deceased man was coming into the kitchen, and he said, he knew very well what business was going on. He and his wife had some words about the money; it is supposed that it was the prisoner's wages he wanted. I supposed they were speaking to the money that was due to the prisoner. The prisoner's mother told the deceased, that he always wanted the handling of her sons wages. Then they had some words about it, and she went up stairs, and the deceased man followed her up stairs, as if in anger; he had nothing in his hand. I went after him, and brought him back again. The deceased man then said that he had a great mind to give it to the prisoner. The young man tried to defend myself, and then they both grappled together, and I could not tell which caught hold first. A little time after, in the bustle, the young man fell down against the wall. Then the deceased man went up stairs again to his wife. Then the young man came up. I should have said that the knife dropped from the prisoner's hand; he picked it up, and followed him. The knife had fallen on to the working board. He followed him up stairs, and said, he would stick him through if he touched his mother. The deceased had not said any thing about that before he went up. I remained in the cellar. A little time after that. I heard the deceased man cry out for to take the knife. This was a very short time after the prisoner left the cellar. Then he came down in a very short time with his hand covered with blood. I asked him if he had stuck Manaix he made a kind of a groan, and his mother came down. Then the prisoner's mother bid me go for a doctor; and I went to the top of the cellar stairs, and saw the deceased man carrying down towards St. Giles's. I went in the next morning to the Hospital to see him.</p>

            . On the Sunday morning, at about eleven o'clock, I heard a bustle, and I opened the middle door from the shop. When I went up stairs, I found the deceased's wife standing there. I asked her what was the matter, and she said, she ran there for fear of her husband's beating her. The moment I spoke to her, up came Mannix; he spoke to her very pleasently, and I advised her to come down. At that moment that I was speaking, the prisoner came up with a knife in his hand; he made a rush at the deceased, and presently there was a cry, and the blood begun to run about, and the cries alarmed the people. At any time I did not see any blows pass from any one. I must have seen it if such a thing took place. There was no blows whilst I was on the stair case. I tried to get the knife from the prisoner, and I could not, but at last by persuasion he threw it over the balusters.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and attend the Middlesex Hospital. I remember a person of the name of Manaix being brought there on Sunday, the 15th of September. There were two wounds on the fore part of the arm. I did what was necessary for his safety; one wound was about two inches; it had wounded the main artery of the arm. There were two wounds. The other was comparatively slight; he lived exactly a month. The larger wound was certainly the primary cause of his death; mortification ensued; but the man was labouring under a constitutional disease of the lungs at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ascribe his death to the wound or to the disease - A. That is rather a difficult question to answer. He had that disease previous to the wound, and there was a great deal of inflamation on the lungs after the death. If the wound had not been given, I should have ascribed his death to the lungs; but the wound having mortified, he had two causes of death. There was a bleeding at the arm at the time he died, which most probably proceeded from the aggravation of his coughing. I think his death was hastened by the inflamation of the lungs; probably that occasioned the mortification.</p>

When he came down, he stood talking at my side with another boy. The prisoner told him to go on his own side, and mind his business; the boy made answer that he should not. The man gave the boy a shove, and the boy said if he did that again, he would kick his shins. The man told the boy if he would not hold his tongue, he would bring a chissel rod, and give him a good hiding. The boy repeated again that he would kick his shine. The prisoner had a spring-mander, which he threw at him in the heat of passion; it struck him on the forehead, and the prisoner went and pulled it out of his head; he exclaimed Oh God! what have I done; and he tore the hair of his head in handfuls, and the blood and froth came out at his mouth. He immediately took the boy in his arms, and took him to a coach.</p>
               <p>MR. MANN. I was in 1809 house surgeon to St. George's Hospital. The boy was brought to the Hospital, and I saw a small wound on his forehead; but from the account which I received, fatal consequences were to be expected; it had perporated the scull, gone a considerable way into the brain.</p>

            . About nine o'clock on the night of the 12th of October, I went to get a pot of beer; my husband went with me. When I came into the passage, I saw a strange woman come out at the door with my candle in her hand; she said I have got your candle. I said who are you, and what do you do with my candle, what have you been in my room for; she said she wanted me, and was sent by a person who lived opposite. I asked her who, and she said she did not know the name; but she said if I would let her go down stairs, she would fetch the woman, but I said no, I fear you have robbed me. I called to the lodgers to open the door on the same floor; I asked them if they knew the prisoner, and they said no. I called out stop her, she has robbed me. Then she said, no I have nothing; see, I have nothing in my hands. With that they looked about her clothes, and found under her apron an apron of mine, wet, which I had just washed; it had hung on the back of a chair, presently we found the remainder of the things thrown carelessly down, but within the door.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. On the 25th of September, Bring and another person applied at Guildball for a search warrant to search Lyons's place. I found some difficulty in procuring a warrant. and so I went with them, and I sent Briggs in to bargain with Lyons about the glasses. I went in in a moment or two, and found him shewing the two large trifle dishes to Biggs. I then told Lyons I would take him into custody, unless he gave some satisfactory account of them. He then shewed me all the rest, and said he got them from Barnett Barnett.</p>

            . On the 10th of October, I left my cart at the end of Salbot-court, in Gracechurch-street; it was at about seven o'clock in the evening. I went to the White-lion booking office to see if there were any parcels for Blackwall, where we look every day, and there were two boxes; one containing the articles in question. I bought it out first, and when I was coming with the other, I saw the prisoner take this one from the cart. I immediately ran after him, and collared him; he threw the box of his shoulders, and struggled with me, and knocked me down. I ran after him again, as far as East-cheap, and then I saw another man run and pick the box up, and I took it to the cart again. I did not pursue the prisoner myself after that.</p>

               <p>- MORGAN. I pursued the prisoner crying stop thief, and he was stopt, and I secured him.</p>

            . On the 18th of September, the prisoner came in, and he asked me to look at some pocket hankerchiefs. I asked him silk or cotten, and he said silk, I took a bundle out of the window, and put them before him. He then asked me if I had any with a white spot. I turned round to look in the window, and a piece out of that description. A gentleman came in to buy some articles, and he made a full stop, and accused the prisoner of taking a piece of handkerchief. The prisoner seemed very much confused, and denied it, and tried to be seated, and turned his pockets out. I also contradicted the gentleman; however we unbuttoned the flap of the prisoner's small clothes, and pulled the said handkerchiefs out. He begged very hard to be let go, but I told him I could do nothing of the kind. I was persuaded that he was an odd hand by the way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300033"/>he did it. In the mean time, the gentleman who detected him, prevailed on Mrs. Wilson to let him go.</p>

            , he presented a petition to the Board of Excise; he presented two, one offering fifty pounds to stay the proceedings and costs. The Board accepted the proposal. Afterwards he presented another petition, requesting the Board to remit the whole. Upon that, I submitted to the Board that Mr. Fitchew should report relative to the statement of facts made in the petition. Finally the Board remitted the proceedings against Cooper altogether.(The petitions were here read.) I do not know the defendant; he had no situation under the Excise. He was never authorized to apply to Cooper for any money to make any compromise.</p>

            . In consequence of directions I received, I called on Cooper to levy fifty pounds, and forty three pounds cost; that was in the beginning of November, 1815; his family was in a most distressed state, and his children very ill; they were in such a state, that I did nothing then but reported. I recommended him to petition. I know that he afterwards did petition. I was not made acquainted with the stay of proceedings. I saw Riptin the defendant some time after that; he asked me at several times whether Cooper's money was not paid; I did not give him any direct answers for once or twice; at last I told him it never would be paid, and I told him that I had a petition to report on, and I believed that the Board from distress, would remit it altogether. The defendant said that he believed that Cooper could pay as well as any of the rest if he was pressed for the money. He seemed distressed that the money was not recovered. I afterwards saw him in the course of June, 1816. The first time I saw the defendant was in the House of Correction in Cold Bath Fields. He gave the information against Cooper.</p>

            . In consequence of having some Exchequer Proceedings against me, I presented the first petition. Mr. Fitchew waited on me, demanded a sum of fifty pound and cost, which together would make a sum of ninety four pounds; I was unable to pay, and in consequence of Mr. Fitchew's advice, I presented a second petition. As far as I knew, I never received any answer from the Board. Riptin called several times after the second petition, I have known him five or six years. When he called on me, he said he came from the officers of the Excise, I understand, said he, that you have petitioned the Board, and you have sent a certificate, but I can assure you that it is going on against you, and it will make it still greater expence; now I have it in my power to settle it for you, for about twenty five pounds. I told him he might as well ask me for twenty five drops of blood from my heart. I told him I had not got the money. In consequence of his calling several times, he was paid, twelve pounds by my wife for setting the business. He said that there was not a shilling of it for him, and he said, I ought to make some compliment for himself. I agreed that he should have a little gin, rum, and brandy, as a compliment for his trouble, and I asked him for a receipt for the money; but he said that the Excise never gave receipts; but he told me I might rest assured that it was all perfectly right, and that I would never be called on for a shilling. After that he sent a person for the spirits, and got them.</p>

            . On the night in question, I saw the prisoner on Mrs. Burt's garden wall, and another man preceded him with a bundle under his arm, they got off that wall, which was about four feet from the ground, and they went along a piece of ground belonging to the East India Dock Company, to some paling, about eight feet high. I never lost sight of them until they got to the paling; then the prisoner struggled up the pales; then I approached the prisoner, and stopped him, and said hallo, what have you got here; then the other man came up, and as he opened his coat, I saw the but end of a pistol, and I said you villian. if you draw another inch, I will cut you down with my cutlass. I immediately called out for assistance, but could get none. The other man made a run, and I took the prisoner to our night officer. When I examined the house, the brick work was cut away from the front door; there was a glass door inside, and there were two squares of glass cut away from the wood work, and the locks were wrenched back.</p>

            . I am an officer of the East India Docks. When I came from the docks between four and five in the evening of the 23rd of October, I heard that the door of Mrs. Burt's house was broken open. I got into the house, and I found three or four bricks cut out of the wall, by which means a crow had been put in, and the door forced open; on a round table there were four glasses, each full of wine, with a newspaper to each glass. There were two large trunks which had been gutted, and were cut all down to the bottom. In fact the place was intirely plundered.</p>

            . On the day in the indictment, the prisoner came to my shop, about half past nine in the morning, and offered a pair of stockings for sale; I would not buy them. In about twenty minutes, or half an hour afterwards, I was attending to my books, and hearing a noise on the threshold of the door, and looking round, I saw the prisoner reach in and snatch away the hat in question. I immediately pursued him, and he threw himself down in the middle of the road, and would not come back. I got an officer and took him into custody.</p>

I left my home in the care of my children I returned about a quarter before six o'clock, to see that the children were put to bed. My door was locked and I could not get in.

            . I am a constable. On the 2nd of October, I saw one of these prisoners beckon to the other, who was with a donkey in the road; he went up to him, and received something from him, and then went back to the donkey, and drove it away. In consequence of this, I watched them, and saw them go up to Mr. Jones's house; Ram opened the iron gate, and then stepped back, and got the lock so that it might not make any noise he went to the right hand window, and raised the sash he then went to the left hand window, said do you want any apples, I believe there was some one there, and he immediately went gently back to the right hand window. He broke three of the laths out of the blind, and opened the blinds. He then looked in all about that parlour, and then but his body across the cill of the window, and reached the coat out. I immediately pursued them, and when he saw me running, he returned back, and threw the coat upon the iron railings. I caught Nettleford, but the other prisoner got away then; but I took him on the 26th of October.</p>

They shut the windows and the shutters again as they had found it, and then they unlocked the door, and came in. The bundle of clothes was wrapped up ready for ironing; all the things except the gown and waistcoat, which were hanging up. The other things were wetted down ready for ironing, and wrapped up in a tablecloth. Hearing a neighbour answer, I thought it was not my husband; I then got out of bed, and come on to the stairs, and saw a man go out of doors; I saw his back; he had a bundle, with a tea caddy under his arm.

He pointed out to me where they were gone; they were gone up the alley; I went up the alley; but could see no one at all. I came down again, and stopped at the end; I had not stopped there above two minutes before Jones, the shorter of the prisoners, came down, and asked me what was the matter; he went away out of the court entirely; I let him pass. I am certain he is the man. I did not know him before. I took such notice of him as to be able to swear to him.</p>

               <p>- HART, I am a constable. I went into this court, in George-street, and seeing a man named Solomons at the door of one of the houses, I took him into custody.

The property seemed laid out, as if for shew. Then Mr. Bar went up stairs and brought the prisoner Cabellow down, and he said, the property and Solomon was taken to the watchhouse together.</p>

When I came there, Jones was not there, but Cabellow was there. Then he asked me to buy some linen and things that were on the table. I attend sales, as well as buy clothes, and I told him I would not buy any thing of the kind, and I went out. Then I was taken into custody by Mr. Hart, the constable.

            . The prisoner came in the morning about half past eight, and gently rang at the bell. He told me he was employed to measure the drain. I lit him down stairs. He pulled a rule out of his pocket and measured the area. He likewise measured a part of the kitchen. He told me he should come on the morrow to repair it. He asked me if there were any water closets up stairs. I told him we had a drain in the back area, and I shewed it to him. He asked me if I would take a pail of water into the back area, and throw it down the sink. He told me he thought I was called up stairs. I replied I should not go up until the bell was rung. In about a minute the bell did ring, and I went up stairs with my master's coffee. I left the prisoner in the kitchen. When I came down again, he was gone. I never mistrusted the man in the least, until a neighbour came and said, "have you not had a man been to measure the drain," and I said yes. Then she asked me, "was he sent for," and I said, I suppose he was, and she said, "had you not better enquire, for he has been to my house also; and our's was in full repair, and I knew he was wrong," and said she, "I don't like the person of the man, and I sent the servant to see where he went, and the servant saw him in your area, measuring your area." I then went up to my mistress and told her what this lady said. I went down again, and missed the tea pot which had been in the kitchen whilst the prisoner had been in the kitchen. No other person had been in, and we never found the tea pot, and I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . On the 15th of June, Saturday morning, I heard a pull at the bell twice; went up to the door; I opened it, and two men stood there, and said they had come to measure the water pipes. I let them in, and they went down into the kitchen, and I let them into the scullery, and looked at the pipes round about, and in the lodger's servants' room, and in the back area. Then they went into the lodger's servants' room, and looked about there, and then they came into the kitchen and asked if we had got a back kitchen. I told them we had no back kitchen; but we had places which were locked up. So I told them I could not get at them until my master was up; I told them we had a parlour backwards up stairs, and one man took the rule out of the other's hand and went up stairs with me into the parlour, and measured the parlour twice across, and once along. Then the other went down stairs, and down to the kitchen. Then he came back again. I was in the parlour, and he came up to me again, and told me he would come back again in an hour's time, when my master was up. The first thing I missed when they went away, was one tea spoon that had been on the lodger's servants' dresser. I gave the alarm directly, and then on searching, we missed the other things. I am possitive the prisoner was one of the men.</p>

I only staid with her in the passage for a minute, and I pulled out my watch to see what o'clock it was, and she snatched it from my hands. I gave her nine shillings to give it me back again, and she did. I had scarcely placed it in my fob again, before the other prisoner came through the passage and snatched it out. I immediately pursued him, and he ran into a house of ill fame; afterwards he was taken by the watchman, but no watch found upon him.</p>

I said pretty well, and I were about leaving her, when twelve or fourteen young men came down Russel-place and surrounded us. The prisoners and two others attacked me, and immediately my watch was snatched from my fob; but I caught it in my right hand; and collared the third man. They bit me a violent blow on the face, and after that, they dispersed. The two prisoners were afterwards apprehended according to the description I gave. I could swear to their persons. I took Taylor myself, and delivered him to the hands of the watchman. I saw the other secured about ten minutes afterwards. The watchman took him.</p>

               <p>CHARLOTTE -. I am servant to the prosecutor. The prisoner came into his house on the morning of the day in the indictment, for the purpose of sweeping the chimnies. These spoons were on the stairs. After the prisoner had gone away, we missed one of the spoons. We went in quest of a person named Sherbut, where we were informed that the prisoner had lived; but he was not home. As we were returning from his house, I met a little <rs id="t18161030-103-deflabel512" type="occupation">chimney sweep</rs>

            . On the 23rd of October, upon opening my book case, I found that it had been broken open, and that the note in question had been taken out of a tea-caddy, which was inside the book case. I went to the Bank of England, and stopped payment of the note. In consequence of something my wife said, a suspicion arose with respect to the prisoner. In consequence of which, I sent for an officer, and took the prisoner into custody. The prisoner then acknowledged he had taken the note, and said the old boy had persuaded him to do it. He said he would take us to where he had changed it, and he did so, and the man immediately said that he changed it.</p>

He said,"you cannot get in; the door is locked; here is the note." putting a piece of soft paper into my hand. I then gave him the change, and he then ran away as fast as possible. He did not take the candles. When I saw him run away, I opened the paper, and found it was not a note. I immediately hallooed out stop thief, and ran after him, a gentleman caught him.</p>

               <p>MRS. CHASEN. On the 24th of October last, at about a quarter past ten at night, I sent my servant girl into my bed room; as soon as she unlocked my bed room door, she saw two drawers open, and likewise one of the front windows open, and the shutters, which at nine o'clock had been shut; I had seen them shut at nine o'clock. She immediately came down, and told me that my drawers were open. I was still in the bar, and I heard some one jump from the bed room window into the street; I should think that is a height of nineteen feet. I ran up stairs, and saw the drawers as the girl told me, and likewise the window. The property in the indictment was missing. The drawers had been opened apparently by a chissel. I had seen all the articles that very afternoon about four o'clock.</p>

The prisoner several times attempted to put his hand to his pocket where the pistol was. I afterwards saw the pistol, and it had two balls in it, and was loaded to within half an inch of the muzzle; the hammer however was down, so that the powder had fallen out of the pan.</p>

On the 23rd of April last, between seven and eight in the evening, several people were in the house drinking; my wife was in the house; the prisoner Bailey was in the parlour drinking with several others. I was in the skittle ground at the back part of the house. I had occasion to come through the house, through the room where they were sitting. Bailey was not there then. I heard one of them, whose name is Morgan, say, we are in a bloody mess now; three or four of the others immediately rose up, and said, let us stall him off as he comes down stairs. Then there was something the matter on my stairs. I opened the stair foot door, and three or four steps up, was the prisoner Bailey coming down; I immediately seized him, and called to my wife to bring a light; I then perceived that he had a silk handkerchief of mine in his hand, which he threw over his shoulder behind him. I then brought him down stairs, and wanted to see if he had any other property about him; but his companions that were in the parlour came about me, and I was afraid they wanted to rescue him. I then took him into the bar; his companions went round to the front of the bar, and one named Thatcher said to me Hales, let the man go, for he is drunk. I said I would not let him go, for I found him with my property about him. He then turned round to the others, and said damn my eyes, if you are all of one mind be shall not be taken. Then they came round to the other door, and Thatcher dragged my wife away from me. She was at that time asking me to let the prisoner go. for fear of our lives. I immediately bolted the door upon them. It is a double door; the top part bolts, and the bottom part has a lock to it. They then took the shutters which they found outside, and battered the door all to pieces, and beat me away from the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300047"/>till they got hold of the prisoner by the collar, and they dragged him over the door which runs into a passage that goes down by the side of the house. I never saw him again until about a month ago. I am sure he is the man. We found part of the goods named in the indictment missing, and other things proved.</p>

            . On the 23d of April, two strange men came into the house. They went into the perlour, and called for some liquor; I took them in some ale and some gin which they had ordered. When I went into the room, the prisoner Bailey was sitting on the child's small chair. I requested him to get up, and he abused me very much. They paid me for the liquor, and I went into the bar. There were in company with the prisoner, five men, whom we have had tried here. I went into the bar again and shut the door. Bailey came into the tap room and was very abusive there. Some wished me to go and speak to him, as he wanted to fight several in the tap room. I tried to persuade him to leave the place, and spoke to one of his companions to take him away. They did not regard what I said, and immediately left me and went to the parlour. I went into the bar, and served some gin to a woman at the bar, and the prisoner came into the bar and asked me if he should draw the liquor for me, and pretended to be in liquor himself. He came up very close to me, and I told him I was capable of drawing my own liquor. He grasped up some halfpence at the time he was talking to me. I gave him a push away, and he let drop some of the halfpence, but kept some in his hand, and said, thank God he had some halfpence to pay for some pipes of tobacco, I told him he was for no good. Several of them then came bustling round, all calling for liquor at the same time, and whether the prisoner went up stairs then or not, I can't say, but soon after I saw him on the stairs with my husband. He held a silk handkerchief in his hand, which I said, I could swear to was mine. He threw it over his shoulder, upon the second stair above him. I said, how he got it I could not tell, for I had the keys of my bed room where it had been in my pocket. The padlock key, and an inside key; my husband desired me to go up stairs to see if all was safe. I went and found the bed room door open. The child's silver coral laid at the door, and had been broken to pieces. The bed clothes were tied up, and the window was open, and I ran down stairs and exclaimed I was ruined. When I got down stairs, my husband had got the prisoner at the bar. I desired him to let him go, for I thought we should be murdered, for they beset us. Thatcher immediately dragged me away from him, and said I could swear to my property, and they would do for me. I resisted very much, and they beat me until my senses left me, and when I came too, I found myself in the parlour. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of September last, I was going through the Strand and saw the prisoner. I had seen the advertisement for his apprehension, and I asked him what the piece of work was about in Bridgewater Gardens. He said, he hoped that I would not trouble him for it. I told him I should do my duty, and take him into custody, I did so, and going to the office, he begged very much for me to let him go, saying he would go on board of ship directly, and leave the country. I proceeded with him to Bow-street office.</p>

            . I was housemaid to Mrs. Williams, but I did not live there at the time the prisoner went away; I came after she had quitted the service. In the course of Friday, the 4th of October, I had seen the different articles of plate mentioned in the indictment safe in the house. I had them under my care, there was a silver tea-urn, nine silver spoons, five silver knives and forks, one silver sauce ladle, one pair of silver candlesticks, a pair of sheets, a large India shawl, and an old silk shawl. I had seen these things after three o'clock, and at my mistress's dinner hour; she generally dined about five o'clock, but dined later that day. I think I saw them between six and seven o'clock; they were in a closet in my mistress's bed room on the second floor. I missed them from that closet, but not before the watchman came in, which was near eight o'clock, Before the watchman came in, I gave an alarm; I went up stairs for some china, and as I opened my mistress bed room door, I heard the back bed room which had been locked, open unlatch. I went into the bed room as far as the door that parts the two rooms, and saw a large black leather trunk removed. I came down stairs, and asked my fellow servant if she had moved it; she told me she had not. Then we went up stairs to look again, and I went close up to the door, and saw it a bit opened. Upon going down stairs again, I told my mistress I was certain there was somebody in the house, and I told her she had better have a watchman in, and accordingly we had, and he went up stairs to the garrets, and we could not see that there was any one in those two that were occupied. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300048"/>we came down stairs, and went to the door where the prisoner had come out of, which was the back two pair bed room; the two Miss Hughes's, two young ladies who were on a visit at my mistress' slept there; we did not see any one there, and I looked into my mistress's bed room, and nobody was there, and I looked into the closet, and the first thing I missed was the tea-urn. I sent my fellow servant down, and on going into the room again, I missed the other things. Upon this, more watchmen were brought in, and every part of the house was searched, except one garret, which was not occupied; then a Marlborough-street officer and a Bow-street officer came; they searched all over the house, except my mistress's room, and my mistress objected to her room being searched again. On the Saturday I suspected all day that there was some person in the house, for on Saturday night when I went to bed, I heard a snoring over my head, and on the Sunday morning I and my fellow servant came down stairs, and opened the house, and

            , and her brother-in-law, and sister were waiting to come in. I told them we had been robbed, and at that time the prisoner came down stairs, and was going out at the door, when

             seeing her come out at the door, he was on the advance to speak to her, when she turned back again into the house; she went up stairs. I saw her when she was taken into the back garret; Mr. Stone, the constable took her. The property was all tied up in a bundle with her.</p>
               <p>-STONE. On the 6th of October, I was sent for at about one o'clock. I went up and apprehended the prisoner. I found her in the cupboard. I have heard the account given by the last witness. As far as I am concerned, her account is true.</p>
               <p>DEBORAH - I saw the other prisoner on the day the robbery was commited opposite Mrs. Williams's. I saw both prisoners speak together, at about eleven o'clock in the morning. Sarah Carter went to the area gate, and was let in by one of the servants. The other prisoner went up Bullstrode-street.</p>

            . I was once in the service of Mrs. Williams, The prisoner Carter, was a fellow servant of mine. About May last I attended Mrs. Williams, to a party, and on my coming home, the prisoner Woolams and two other young men were sitting very comfortable on the sofa, and the prisoner asked why we did not knock the old lady on the head, and another said no, we had better choak her, and take her property from her. The other two young men went away, and Woolams stopped in the house. When we went for Mistress, to bring her home she lant her carriage to bring another family home, and she came home with another family. As soon as we went down into the kitchen, Woolams's hat was on the table, and the prisoner Carter took it up. and took it into the pantry.</p>
               <p>Woolams's Defence. She got up, and left me on the Friday morning, and I saw nothing of her until I saw her in custody. I went to the office and gave myself up.</p>
               <p>- Stone. He did give himself up voluntarily.</p>
