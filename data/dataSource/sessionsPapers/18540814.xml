On 22nd May he sent me with a letter and a parcel—I did not know what the parcel contained—he told me to go to No. 15, New Boswell-court, Strand—I went to Old Boswell-court—I did not know that it was Old Boswell-court—I have since discovered that it is—I cannot read—I am nineteen years old—when I got to Old Boswell-court I showed the letter to a man; he directed me to a side door—I went there, and a woman who was standing by the door said, "I will show you the door"—I went up to the second floor of that house, and knocked at the door—the prisoner opened it—I said I had brought a letter from Mr. Taylor, of the Elephant and Castle—I gave her the letter—she looked at it, and said it was all right; and I afterwards gave her the parcel—I asked her whether there was any answer—she said no, there was no answer required—I did not see her open the letter—the parcel was a brown paper parcel, tied up—I then went home—next morning my master asked me who I had left the parcel and the letter with—the letter had a direction upon it—I saw the prisoner look at it before she said it was quite right—the parcel had no writing upon it—in consequence of what my master said, I went next morning to the house where I had seen the prisoner—I did not find her there—I have never seen her since, until she was apprehended.</p>

On the morning of 19th July I was on duty near Compton-street, in Great Crown-court, about half-past 2 o'clock—I heard a scuffle and a very weak cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running very fast through Little Crown-court, towards Great Crown-court—I seized him, and took him back to the prosecutor in Wardour-street, at the corner of Little Pulteney-street—I asked the prosecutor if that was the man; he said that was the man—I took him to the police station—he deli<lb/>vered up the watch and said he was guilty—he repeated that a second time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). I am a very poor man, and get my living by hawking things about the street; it was a great temptation for a poor fellow like me to find such a prize; when I picked the watch up I was walking away, when I met the policeman, who asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to the police station, that I had found a watch and chain and was going to take it to the station; when he heard the cry of stop thief he asked me to stay; the cry was not after me, but after some man who ran in a contrary direction; when the prosecutor was asked if I was the man, he said no, it was a man dressed in woman's clothes; the policeman said, "You had better give this man in charge, as he states he picked your watch up;" the prosecutor then said, "It must be him;" he was so drunk they did not ask him any question, but detained him until the morning, and then told him I was the man; he had no recollection of what he said or did when he came to the station.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me look at it"—I gave it him back, and I said, "You will oblige me by paying for the pint of beer," and he gave me a good shilling—I then said, "Just let me look at that again," and he gave me the bad one back again, and I laid it on the shelf—he said, "Give it me back," but before doing so, I felt the first shilling, and found it was bad, and I said, "They are both bad; I shall give you in charge"—I gave him and the shillings to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living at No. 3, Avery-row, Bond-street. On Tuesday evening, 20th June, about 7 o'clock, I was in Hanover-square; the prisoner came up to me and asked me whether I could take a note for him to Mr. James, of No. 10, Wardour-street—I said, "Yes;" he gave me the note, either in the square, or in George-street, which is close to it—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after giving me the note, he walked down with me to No. 16, in George street, and told me I was to bring an answer back to No. 16, George-street—he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble—I left him at No. 16, George-street, and went with the note—I went to Mr. James; it is an oilman's shop in Wardour-street—I handed the note to a shopman; he took it to Mr. James; I did not see him open it, but he came to me with the note in his hand open—he had some con<lb/>versation with me, and I then went back to George-street—I did not find the prisoner there—on the following Saturday, I accompanied a policeman to Leicester-street, near Leicester-square; that was about 3 o'clock—while I was there with the policeman, I saw the prisoner; he was walking in the street—I did not see where he went to—I afterwards went into a coffee shop, in Leicester-street—there were two men in the room; the prisoner was one of them—I then came out of the coffee shop, and went back to the policeman—I did not return with him into the coffee shop.</p>

I am solicitor for the prosecution—I was in attend<lb/>ance at the Marlborough-street Police-court when this matter was inquired into—Mr. Hardwick was the Magistrate—I was present when the last witness was examined—the prisoner was standing in the dock, which is towards one end of the Court, and immediately at the back of which the spectators stand—I think there were from twenty-five to thirty persons standing there—a rail separates the dock from the public part of the Court—there is a bar in front as well as a bar at the back—it is a simple wooden rail, and the spectators stand immediately at the back of the rail, not in the same space as the dock—the prisoners stand between two rails, and the spectators at the back and at the side—I remember Mr. Hardwick directing the persons to put on their hats; from twenty-five to thirty persons put on their hats—there was no other person in the dock.</p>

Q.</hi> Do I understand you that he did not point out the prisoner until his hat was put on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—he saw him, but not above three or four minutes before his hat was put on, just while I was examining him—I was sitting to the left of the witness box—the person who stands in the witness box is not elevated, I think the box is level with the floor—I was never in it, and do not know—the dock is barred off from the spectators, but not from everybody—a prisoner generally has several police, officers standing by his side.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Lisle-street, Leicester-square, and let lodgings.

Coutts' bank for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it would be cashed on 12th June, and then he would pay me, or before then if he could get it cashed—it was an engraved form of cheque, like these produced—I did not notice the name of the person drawing the cheque—I think it was payable to William Coyle or bearer—in consequence of that I waited until 13th June—I then went up to his room again on the subject;—he rang his bell for me—he showed me the same cheque again—he gave it into my hand, and said, "You see it is written on 'Cannot be paid until the 22nd'"—I saw those words written on the right hand side of the cheque, at the bottom—I said I did not understand cheques or bills; I would take it down to my brother, and show him—I was about to leave the room with it for that purpose—I had got as far as the door, and had got the door open, and called to my brother, when Mr. Coyle took the cheque from me, and both he and his wife said, "No"—they would not allow their cheque to be taken down stairs—I said I would bring it back immediately—he took the cheque from me, and ran and put it into the fire—I called my sister, who came into the room immediately—I said, "He has burnt the cheque; take it out of the fire"—it was not all burnt at the time—she was going to the fire, and he caught her by the neck of her dress, and held her fast, and his wife took the poker, and poked the cheque into the fire, so as entirely to destroy it—they left the lodging next day, the 14th—they left an empty trunk behind them, and a few articles in a hat box, which the police took possession of.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 33, Euston-square. I am foreman to Mr. Holland, a builder—on the morning of 18th July, about twenty minutes past 3 o'clock, I was awoke—I was sleeping in the back parlour, on the ground floor—I heard footsteps softly on the carpet in the front parlour—I awoke up, apparently without any noise, but there must have been considerable noise from the force that was used to the conservatory door, as well as to the kitchen door—I suppose it was the noise that awoke me—I raised my head from my pillow to ascertain whether it was a sound or not, and while it was so raised, I distinctly heard the shutter bar move, that is, the shutter to the conservatory window which opens into the garden, the door of which had been forced before—I jumped out of bed, opened the folding doors, and saw two men at the window, attempting to open the shutter bar of the window leading to the conservatory—there was no window open at that time—as soon as the men saw me, I inquired of them their business there—they made no reply, but rushed to the front window, threw the sash up, and leaped on to the kerb of the area, and over the iron railings—I ran to the window, and shouted "Police"—there were persons coming down the New-road who saw them leap over the wall, and in a few moments I saw the officer running down the New-road after them—they had got in at the front parlour window—it was not fastened that night—it was shut down at the time they came in—it had been left open in the early part of the night, and an officer rang the street door bell at 1 o'clock, and told me it was open; I then shut it down—I had left it open because it was a very hot night, and I did not deem it necessary in such an exposed place to shut up the house—I did not think thieves would attempt to enter the house—I closed the window down when the policeman told me at 1 o'clock, and it was down when I was awoke at twenty minutes past 3 o'clock—it is very easy to lift the sash up—they could not have got in in any other way—I saw the men, but in the momentary excitement, and being so early, I could not swear to them—it was light—I have no moral doubt that the prisoners are the men, still I would not swear to them—I believe they are the men from what I saw of them—Mr. Abrahams, the surveyor, is the owner of the house, but I am the landlord of it, and live in it—it is in the parish of St. Pancras—it is at the corner of the New-road and Euston-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Tunbridge-terrace, St. Andrew's-road, New Kent-road. I was in the New-road on the morning when this hap<lb/>pened, and saw the boy, Trussell, riding on one horse and leading two—he spoke to me—I was coming from King's-cross—I saw him on the opposite side to Seymour-street, in the New-road—I was on the left hand side, very near St. Pancras Church—in consequence of what the boy said to me, I looked at two persons—the prisoners are those persons—they were both together at the time the boy spoke to me, and turning from the corner on the left nearest to Paddington—they were speaking together, not far from a lamp post—I saw Smith throw something over the railings into the enclo<lb/>sure; what it was I do not know—I spoke to a policeman—they separated; Smith went across on the left hand side, and the other on the right—I saw them taken into custody—the persons I saw taken into custody were the same two persons that the boy had pointed out to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter for the public press. I was at the Thames Police-court when the charge was entered into against Mr. Massey—I took a note of the evidence given by the prisoner—I took a note of the proceedings; I can pledge myself to its accuracy—<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "July 27, 1854. James Smith. I am a seaman, in the naval service of Her Majesty, and belong to the ship <hi rend="italic">The Duke of Wellington</hi>, in the Baltic—I entered the Royal Navy in Bristol, about eleven months ago—I brought home a prize brig from the Baltic; I and another seaman brought her home—we brought her to the East India Docks—I was to go on board the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi>, off the Tower, to be victualled—I had no orders to go there—I arrived at the East India Docks at half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—it was four weeks ago last Sunday—next day I and the other seaman, the same who came home with the prize from the Baltic, came on shore, and we were passing Mas<lb/>sey's house, in Upper East Smithfield, when a man called me to go into the shop—I saw the defendant, who said, 'Where the h—have you been to all this time?"—I said, 'In Her Majesty's navy'—he said, 'Do you want the sight of an American ship?'—I made no reply—he said, 'I will ship you into the <hi rend="italic">Victoria'</hi>—I made no objection, and I was sent to the American consul and shipped as James Ryan.—Mr. Swainson. How came you to alter your name?—Smith. Mr. Massey told me to alter my name; he also told me to go into the parlour and change my man-of-war clothes—he gave me other clothes—I went to the American consul, and signed the ship's articles of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140048"/>
               <p>and when I returned he gave me half-a-crown—we were to go away at 4 o'clock in the morning—I went on board with Kelly, Massey's servant, but I did not join the ship when she was going away the next morning—I went afterwards to Massey's shop, and Kelly said, 'You have done a fine b—y job; you have missed the ship'—I was afterwards shipped on board another American ship, the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>, and Massey gave me an advance note, and he said I was to take half out in clothes and half in money—I went down to Gravesend in the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>—before that I had a conversation with Kelly, and I asked him for my man-of-war clothes, and he said they were on board the ship—when I reached Gravesend I wanted to leave the ship, and the chief mate said, 'If you offer to leave the ship I'll kick your G—d—d head off'—at Cardiff I left the ship and was stopped by a police constable, and I said, 'I wish to give myself up as a deserter'—the quarter-master came and took me out of the ship.—Mr. Swainson. Are you quite sure you told Mr. Massey you belonged to Her Majesty's service?—Smith. I told Mr. Massey I belonged to Her Majesty's service and to the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi>, in the Baltic—he said I was not to tell any one, as he was fined 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a fortnight before for doing so.—Mr. Yardley. For doing what?—Smith. For shipping a man from Her Majesty's service, I suppose.—Mr. Yardley. How much wages per month were you to receive in the American ship?—Smith. Why, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per month.—Cross-examined by Mr. Bal<lb/>lantine. I know that if I go back to Her Majesty's service I shall be tried by a court martial—I do not know what sentence will be passed—they may inflict a flogging; I cannot answer for that—I do not think it will be so in my case—I really do not expect to get a flogging—I was drunk, Sir, when I had the conversation with Kelly; I was drunk nearly all that week—I got sober when I got into the other ship—I am not a deserter until I am twenty-one days away from Her Majesty's service—I wanted to give myself up before the ship left the docks—I was born in Dublin, and bred in England—Mr. Ballantine, Then you are an Irishman?—Smith. I was brought up in London; I am not an Irishman, I am half-and-half—I have sailed in American ships—I took the name of Ryal when I entered the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>—Massey persuaded me to call myself Ryan or Ryal, I do not know which it was—it was on a Monday, I think, when I went into Massey's shop first—I came into the East India Dock at half-past 3 o'clock—I left her at 11 o'clock at night of the 26th, I believe—I have shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Typhoon</hi>, an American ship before—I was in the <hi rend="italic">Great Western</hi> and other American going ships—Mr. Massey once shipped me in the <hi rend="italic">Typhoon.</hi>—By Mr. Yardley. I was drunk when I changed my clothes at Massey's—I was drunk at the time—I was not sober when he told me not to say anything of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi>, as he was fined 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—I signed articles the second time—I had been to Masuey's between the first and the second time of signing articles—Kelly was in the shop too—it was Kelly who called me into the shop the first time—three other seamen went into Massey's shop with me one day—I was not sober then—I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I left my brig in the East India Docks—when I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi> in the dock, Mr. Massey came on board in a barge, and settled with the men—my name and number on the ship's books of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Welling<lb/>ton</hi> is 125—"James Smith" was on my man-of-war clothes—I wore a serge shirt and blue trowsers—I left a pair of new blue trowsers at Massey's—I lost my hut on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi> one night, reefing topsails—a man named Spiers, a shipmate, was with me when I went into Massey's shop the first time—Massey said he would not ship him because he was a</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any notion where you were when he was either called in or went into your shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what time he came to my shop—I had servants—about half-past 9 o'clock, on Monday morning, 26th June, I went up to Mr. Gumm's—he is a shipbroker, and lives opposite the Royal Exchange, in Cornhill—I myself do not attend to the sailors—if I were to ship a sailor on board an English bottom, without a license, I believe I should be liable to a penalty—I have been a shipping agent seven years—I know what would be the consequence of persuading a seaman to quit the Queen's service and go in another service, either foreign or English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was Kelly convicted of persuading a man to quit the Queen's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on 9th Dec.—he was fined 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid it—there is not a parlour at the back of my shop, there is a small office—the parlour is up stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, or have you reason to believe, that on the day when the prisoner was induced to come, or did come to your shop, his clothes were changed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard Kelly give evidence that they were changed in the office at the back of the shop—I was not present at any time when the prisoner asked for his clothes—whether he were drunk or sober I never saw him that day—I have three persons who attend my shop—I have no other witness but my three servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This originated in the charge made by the Admiralty against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by the Admiralty, that I know of—Mr. Swainson made the charge—I confine myself entirely to American vessels; I always have done so—I was not present before the Magistrate on the occasion when Kelly was called up—Kelly has been in my service about a year—I have never kept any</p>

               <p>familiar company with the prisoner, certainly not—whatever I may have seen of him was in ship transactions—there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month wages for the American vessel—half of that I took for clothes; the other part I paid in money—I paid it to the person that he said he owed the money to—I have brought my book to show—I never at any time, in the course of dealing with this man, heard that ho had come home as a prizeman—where I saw him was when I was going out of St. Katharine's Docks—he was then on board the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>, as he called it—it is very common indeed for a sailor to get drunk when he comes on shore—I never saw one remain drunk for a week or a fortnight together—we fit them out in that state—if a ship were going away to-day I could not fit them out to-morrow—I believe the prisoner knew one of my men, Hayes, well—I do not think he knew the other—I became acquainted with the prisoner by his coming to my place for ships—all the time I have been in business I have known his face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am vestry clerk of the parish of St. Bride's, in the City of London—I know the defendant; he is a housekeeper in that parish—I have known him living there twenty years or more—I have a copy of the appointment of this gentleman to serve the office of overseer—this is a copy of the appointment by Sir James Duke (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"I, Sir James Duke, being one of the Aldermen of the City of London, do hereby nominate and appoint John Brown, Thomas Glanville, and George Frederick Cruch<lb/>ley, to be overseers of the parish of St. Bride's")—our parish is in the ward of Farringdon, of which Sir James Duke is Alderman—there is a book kept of the name of every man as he enters the parish—it has come in the order of rotation, to the turn of this gentleman, to serve that office—he has never served that office—after this appointment was made, the other two overseers and myself waited on Mr. Cruchley—I took with me the banker's book, belonging to this parish, and the check book, and the notice of the parliamentary election, which it was necessary for the overseer to sign—Mr. Cruchley said he could not attend to the duties, that he had a great deal to do, and that public business excited him—the other two gentlemen said that if he would take the office on himself with them, they would take all the laborious duties of it, and that he hardly need to come out of his counting house, if he would merely take the office on himself for the sake of public example—he absolutely refused to take it—he said he could not do it, and he did not do it, and the notice was published with only two overseers' names—I had made the report of this to the vestry in April; the appointment was at Easter—the notice was a public printed notice—the vestry directed this course to be adopted; they determined that the defendant should be compelled to do it—after this bill was preferred, I came to some understanding with him—Mr. Cruchley came to my office at half past 10 o'clock one morning—I was engaged with two gentlemen; I left them, and went and spoke to him—he said he wished to settle—I told him I was engaged, and to come at 11 o'clock—he came at 11 o'clock, and we came to an arrangement—he was to pay the usual fine to the parish of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the costs, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left my office at half past 11 o'clock, and came again at 1 o'clock, and laid on the table four small parcels in paper—he said, "You will find 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—I opened three of them,</p>

You are requested to attend on Monday morning; the 10th, to take the office." The other two came, and they went with me to Mr. Cruchley's, and said, "Will you take on yourself the office?"—he said, "What will be the consequence if I do not?"—I said, "You will be liable to a fine"—I repeatedly gave him notice of my intention to indict him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give him any formal notice of your intention to indict him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not summon him to attend before a Magistrate to answer the charge for refusing to serve the office—I did not go to the London Sessions, because I inquired at the office of the Clerk of the Peace, and was told it was customary to come here—I went to inquire, and was told it was the same thing whether it was here or at the London Sessions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Portugal Hotel, in Flee-street, and was so at the latter end of Feb last. On the night of 27th or morning of 28th Feb. about half past 12 o'clock, I was alarmed by a noise—I went out, and found a crowd collected at the door of No. 158, next door to our premises, and adjoining them—I went to the leads at the back of our house, and got on to the leads of No. 158, so as to be able to look into the house—the leads are nearly on the same level as the floor—there were neither shutters nor blinds to the back window—I looked into the room that was used as a kitchen, and saw a fire burning on the landing—there is only one landing between the room used as a kitchen and the room which looks into Fleet-street—the staircase goes up the centre of the house—it appeared to me to be a well staircase, but I never was higher than the first floor—I saw no fire higher than that—I went into the street again, and saw that firemen were there, and people got into the house—the house had not been open since Saturday night—it was a house for chops, steaks, and refreshments—I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday after the fire, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon; he came into the Portugal Hotel, to receive some money which was due to him for beer—the conversation was not addressed to me, but to the barmaid; it turned upon the fire, and the prisoner said to the barmaid, "It is a bad job for me, but I ought to be thankful that my little children were not there"—I do not know whether they are his children or his sister's, but I have seen children there, and he had his sister living with him as housekeeper—he said that he had locked up the house on Saturday night, and was not there on the Monday, but was staying at his lodging, at Islington, as he was very unwell on Monday, and took some medicine, which kept him at home all day; that the first he heard of the fire was on Tuesday evening, when he was coming down from his lodging at Islington, to keep an appointment with a man at the corner of Chancery-lane, who had taken the business of him, and some one met him and told him that his house was burned down—the barmaid said, "What a strange place to make an appoint<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140063"/>
               <p>to meet a man on business of that kind!"—Mr. Hall made no reply to that, but took the money that was owing to him and walked out—the shop was open on Saturday, but not afterwards—I had had conversation with him before that, on the state of his business—I used to go in and out sometimes two or three times a day, and used to say, "How are you getting on?" and one morning I said, "Mr. Hall, I do not think you will make a fortune here;" he nodded his head, and said, "Oh, never mind, I will make some<lb/>body pay for it some day"—I should think that was about a month before the fire—he was not there above four or five months, certainly not six months.</p>

On Monday night, 27th Feb., I got to fleet-street at about half past 12 o'clock, and with others broke open the door and got in—there was no fire on the ground floor, the great bulk of the fire was on the first floor landing—I was able to get about three parts of the way up the first flight of stairs—we were about two hours before we succeeded in subduing the fire—the staircase was in the middle of the house—there was a wooden partition on the first floor to divide the front room from the staircase—the back room was enclosed by brickwork, a portion of which was standing after the fire—I saw the fire going up the staircase into the first floor rooms, front and back, but the bulk of the fire was on the landing, burning up the staircase very fiercely—I saw no shavings on the premises at that time, but about a fortnight afterwards I saw some in the first floor front room, and the back room, the same on the second floor, and the same on the upper floor—at the time I saw them there had been some carpenters at work on the first floor; the shavings on the second floor had been on the beds—in the front room second floor, and in the back room, I observed shavings which bore traces of fire, and the same on the upper floor, the third floor, in both attics—they were lying about the beds partially burned, and the floors were very much burned; we were not able to stand without planks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the Saturday night before this fire took place I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner there—I went home with him to his house, No. 158—it was then about 2 o'clock in the morning, and I stopped till about half past 3—there was no one in the house but us two—I went into the kitchen, and into the second floor front room—there was no bedding on the bed, only a blanket—he said that business was very bad, and that his sister had that day taken his children away, and they would be taken care of—I had seen him once or twice before—I remember the night the fire broke out—I was in Fleet-street at the time it broke out, and not far from the house—I was between the house and Farringdon-street—about an hour or an hour and a half before the fire I saw Mr. Hall, I thought it was, going from his own place towards Farringdon-street, on the same side of the way—he may have been six or seven doors from the house—I did not speak to him, nor did he to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant, and live at No. 2, Gray's Inn-lane. I have got a situation in Bedford-row three weeks ago, but they do not wish me to go there till this trial is over—I was in the prisoners service for a month; I left about eleven days before the fire, I think—I slept in the house, at the top, the back room—while I was there I saw beds, sofas, chairs, tables, glass, carpets, a bedstead, a hearthrug, and several other things being removed from the place, by Mr. Hall and the lad; they used to bring them down stairs between them—I did not see anything outside to carry them in; I did not go out—this was at all hours of the day—the prisoner's sister was there as housekeeper—I remember being on the kitchen stairs and hearing the prisoner say something to his sister, it was on Wednesday evening, and on Thursday morning I gave him warning—the kitchen stairs go from the bar; the same staircase continues to the kitchen—I was coming, downstairs, and Mr. Hall was inside the counter in the bar; they could not see where I was, but I heard Mr. Hall speak to his sister; he called her Louisa, and said he would set fire to the house as soon as the goods were out—his sister never answered a word—I said nothing till the next morning, when I gave warning that I should leave that day week; they looked at one another, but did not say anything—I gave no reason for going, but I would not trust myself there—I never told Mr. Hall what my reason was, or said a word about it to anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he tell you he could smell the tobacco? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could say anything—he asked me if I did smoke, and I said, "No"—he told me that if I did I should not do it—I do not know how many times he did that—he complained of my drinking as well—the drink was not for chilblains, but he gave no one a chance to drink but himself; his cellar was always locked—I did not try it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he complain of your drinking his ale, over and over again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I came here to tell the truth, and I have told it, and I will not tell you any more—he did not give me a chance to rob him of his beer—he did complain of my robbing him, but it was no good, for he had charge of his own cellars.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he complain of your going to the tap and letting his beer run away, besides drinking it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is no use to talk about that; it was not my business to go to Mr. Hall's cellar—he did not give me enough to eat, much more to throw away—I did not throw the bread away; I had not sufficient to eat, I am sorry to say, and I would not make myself so mean as to <hi rend="italic">axe</hi> him for more, although I am a servant—he charged me with throwing his bread out at the window—I did not throw a lump of bread, and break one of the neighbour's windows; I should think not—there is no mistake about that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he complain of your throwing bread out, and breaking a pane of glass belonging to his neighbour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have made you an answer, and that is quite <hi rend="italic">satisfied;</hi> I am not going to satisfy you any more—I did not break a pane of glass by throwing bread out of the window—I do not know whether the neighbours came and complained or not; it was not my place to listen to every person that came in; he did not hire me to stand at the street door, and see who came in—I heard somebody complain, but who it was I do not know—he did not say who broke it, because he could not see—Mr. Hall will say anything—he does as he pleases, and other persons put up with the consequences—I never lived or lodged at No. 19, Plumtre-court</p>

               <p>—I do not know a woman named Catherine Bryant, and I never went into Plumtree-court in my life, though I have lived seven years in Holborn—I do not know a single creature there, male or female—I cannot say whether Plumtree-court is a bad place; you had better go and try; you can make it your business to inquire; perhaps you know better than I do—I do not know a woman named Catherine Bryant in or out of Plumtree-court; I do not know a creature in the world—I have never gone by any other name than Welch—I have never gone by the name of Bryant; I have only gone by one name, and I can always go where that name is called—I heard this conversation, "Louisa, I am going to set the house on fire as soon as all the furniture is out"—it was said loud enough for me to hear, and that is sufficient—I was very near the bar.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Tappenden, who lives in Fleet-street—I had some intention of taking the house, No. 158, Fleet-street, from the prisoner, soon after Christmas—I saw the prisoner upon it—in the first instance he asked me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the concern, furniture, fixtures, and all; that was some time in Jan.—he afterwards offered it to me as low as 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, I should not mind giving 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my agent proposed that we should divide the difference, but that I declined—I had made no agreement with the prisoner at the time the fire happened—on the Friday or Saturday immediately before the fire, I went to the place—there were two gentlemen in the first room as I entered, and the prisoner said, those two gentlemen were about taking the house, and I had better fix upon it at once—I said, "I should consider more about it, but I had not made up my mind at present"—he did not say any more; his sister asked me up stairs to rest, as I was ill at the time.</p>

               <p>out to me—I had not much knowledge of the business; it was my husband who wished to enter into it—he pointed out a new water closet that he had built—he mentioned two or three different sums as what he had paid when he went in—at first he said 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had laid out—I should have given 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not in any way diminish the value of the business in speaking to me—I have never sold a business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In going over the premises, did you see anything answering to the description of "a handsome Spanish mahogany desk washstand, with nest of drawers, supply cistern inside, and fittings all complete, 20 guineas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw nothing which would amount to anything like that value—I saw a mahogany wash hand stand—I saw nothing which I should reckon above the value of from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw a sort of mahogany square enclosed wash hand stand; I did not look into the interior of it—I know what they are generally; if there had been an article answering that description, I could not have failed to notice it—I did not tell the prisoner that I came there on the part of Mrs. Tappenden—he told me that he had been offered 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mrs. Tappenden, which I knew to be false—he did not know that I was acting for Mrs. Tappenden—I went down into the cellar; there was a very small stock indeed; what I saw there I should think would not amount to above 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, Great Portland-street, at present. I am a traveller in drapery—I travel for houses in the drapery line—during the time the prisoner kept the house in Fleet-street, I used to dine there occasionally—in that way I became acquainted with him—I have been out with him several times into the City, to several places—I have been with him to the Bay Tree, in St. Swithin's-lane: that was about the latter end of Jan.—I went there with him and two other persons; we were there about an hour and a half, or two hours—we drank together there; we had nothing to eat—we left between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening—the other persons came away with us, but we parted outside—the prisoner and I walked home towards Fleet-street together—on our return home, we went into the Daniel Lambert public house, on Ludgate-hill—we only stood in front of the bar, and had a glass of ale; we then proceeded towards his house—as we went, he said, "Well, I am going to be a partner of your <hi rend="italic">governor;</hi> "that was Halsey—I had been in Halsey's employment previously, and I was then in his employment—he lives at No. 67, Chancery-lane—I had been about six weeks in his employment—he said, "If I can place con<lb/>fidence in you, I can put money in your pocket"—I said, "How?"—this was near his own house, and he said, "I will tell you another time"—we then parted; he went in doors, and I went on to the west end of the town—I saw him again the next day—I dined with him; at least, I dined at his house, and in the evening we went out again together; I and the prisoner, Halsey, and a man of the name of Gleed—they were the two that had been with us at the Bay Tree—Gleed lodged at the prisoner's house—we all four went to the Bay Tree again, because it was near the omnibus where Halsey got in; he generally took the omnibus near King William-street—we drank together there, and stayed I think till near 10 o'clock—the prisoner and I parted with the others outside the door, and we walked home as before—in the course of our walk, I said to him, "Well, Hall, how are you going to put money in my pocket?"—he said, "To tell you the truth, I am going to have a blaze"—"Indeed," I said—he said, "Yes, I intend to fire the premises, for I am insured pretty stiff;" or, "rather stiff;" "pretty</p>

               <p>stiff," I think it was—I said, "Then I shall not have anything at all to do with you;" that was all that passed—we parted, and he went inside his house—the following day I was at Halsey's, when he came there—they had a little private conversation, which I did not hear, and a few minutes after<lb/>wards some furniture was brought in in a truck—it was put in the back room—there are only two rooms, the office and the room; the furniture was put in the room—it is not a large auction room, merely offices—it was put in the back office—some more was brought afterwards—altogether, there were eight mahogany chairs, an easy chair, a large looking glass, window curtains, brass rods, a sofa, and a quantity of other things—the prisoner said that they were brought there as he was going to be a partner of Halsey's—he is an auctioneer—I was in Halsey's employment from the latter end of Dec. to the 14th Feb.—the furniture was brought the last week in Jan.—I do not know at what time the prisoner went into the house in Fleet-street—during the time I was with Mr. Halsey I did not know or hear of any furniture being lent by him to the prisoner, or deposited in his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you give me the date of this conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the last week in Jan.—it passed in Fleet-street, between Farring<lb/>don-street and his house; I should think between 10 and 11 o'clock; I was then living with Mr. Halsey, at No. 67, Chancery-lane, not sleeping there; I slept at No. 32, Great Portland-street at that time, and for some time previously, and do now—I have lived there for twelve months up to this time, I am known there by the name of Errick—if anybody inquired for me there, they would find that I lived there—I was not aware that an inquest was held about this fire, until I returned to London from Man<lb/>chester—that was I think in the middle of March—I think about the 8th or 10th—I then heard that an inquest had been held, I did not hear that it was over—I read of the fire in the newspaper, when I was at Manchester—I heard of the inquest when I returned to town, that was after the inquest had been held—I do not know about the date, I suppose it was about the 8th or 10th March—I heard then that the inquest had been held—I know the time that I came up from Manchester perfectly well, I should not think there could be any mistake about it—it was either the 8th or 10th March that I returned from Manchester, I am positive—I do not know positively, but I believe it was about that time; I heard from a man in Holborn that the inquest had been held—he did not tell me that the inquest was over—he told me the inquest had been held respecting the fire in Fleet-street, and the officer was inquiring for me—that was when I returned from Manchester, I think about 8th or 10th March, I did not go to the Westminster Fire Office in consequence—the officer came to a house that I went to in Holborn—I did not go there purposely to meet him, I had been in the habit of using that house sometimes—he was not aware that I was going there—he did not meet me by accident, nor by appointment—the man told me the officer wanted to see me, and then I went to see the officer—that was a few days after I came to town—I was not aware that the inquest was being held while I was in town, I am certain of that—I left London for Manchester between 15th and 20th Feb., from Manchester I went to Preston, and then returned to town on 8th or 10th March—when I saw the officer, I did not hear what the verdict at the inquest had been—the officer's name is Gaylor—I was first examined in this case at the police court, I think that was in April—I did not lay the information, I wont to the police court and was examined—I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140077"/>
               <p>there with the officer—I think it was about a month after I returned to town—I never laid any information—it was on my information that a warrant was issued—I am not the person that originated this prosecution—I do not know whether it was upon my evidence only, that the warrant was issued—I gave my evidence at Guildhall—I do not think anybody else gave evidence that day—I was not in town whilst the inquest was held—I never laid any other information against any one, for anything—I have never informed against any one—I did inform against a person for selling goods without a hawker's licence—that was a short time ago—that was connected with my own business; there was nothing criminal in that I apprehend—I never informed against any one—I told the police of it, I do not call that informing—I told the police that they were trading without a licence—I went before a Magistrate, and was sworn about it—the parties were not fined—I have not done that more than once, that was only a fortnight ago—I was never a witness before a Magistrate before; the infor<lb/>mation was against a Mr. Way—I did not go to the parties against whom I complained, before I informed—I will swear that—I had not made any demand of money upon them—I am certain of that, not a farthing—I did not give the information from a sense of public justice—I heard that I should not receive my money, and then I gave information to the police; it was money that was due to me, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one of the parties had refused to pay me, and I told the police—it is necessary that these fellows should be brought to justice—I do not know whether I should have informed if the fellows had paid me my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. perhaps I should, I do not know that it would have been ungrateful, that would depend upon circumstances—I have been connected with them for years—I have not been connected with men who sell goods without a licence, I always have a licence—I was connected with those fellows that I informed about, for about ten years—I did not say that they would not pay me my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but they put me off from day to day—I did not think I should get the money by informing against them—I dare say I shall get it, I have not tried to get it—I intend to summons them in the County Court—I state distinctly that I live at No. 32, Great Portland-street—I think it is the second floor that I occupy, I know it is—I have occupied it twelve months—I pay rent for it myself, in my own name—the landlord is Mr. Matthew Slingsby—I have paid him rent for the second floor for twelve months, within a week or two—I have lodged there, and paid rent for that twelve months—I pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for one room, a bed room—I have not been in town during the whole of that twelve months—I have stated that I was travelling about for drapery houses—that is true, this last week I have not travelled for any one—I was engaged in London for this house in Bristol, for the man of the name of Way—that is the man you say I informed against, I was travelling for him—I do not think he has any place of business—I was engaged for three weeks till last week, I did not travel before that—I was in a situation, at Mr. Hurst's, No. 108, Oxford-street, a shawl house—I was with him from May last to the latter end of July, and then for three weeks with Mr. Way—I have stated that I was travelling in the drapery trade—I did not say for any house, because the persons I have been travelling for, travel from town to town—they do not sell by auction—they travel from town to town with goods, and sell them in the various towns—they send hand bills round—I have been with them for ten years—I think the police have interfered with us once—that was in Leadenhall-street, this time twelve months—the police were placed at the door, for the purpose of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140078"/>
               <p>warning persons from going in—that was not on the ground that we were a set of swindlers, because our business was carried on quite as respectably as the drapers' generally are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a set of men called "The Towsery gang?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is in the country called "The Towsery gang;" we had a man with us of the name of Towsery, who was well known in the country; he was not known in London—we aroused the jealousy of the drapers and they denominated us "The Towsery gang"—we are quite as respectable as the gentlemen in Ludgate-hill—we were never charged with selling sham goods—we were charged with charging exorbitant prices, perhaps, but not with selling sham goods—we were never charged with selling articles worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used you to represent that these sales were the wrecks of fires, and so on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When a fire took place we bought goods there; and then, of course, we represented them as goods from the fire—in Leadenhall-street we were known by the name of "Brown Brothers"—that was the place where the police were placed at the door—they were only there for two or three hours, not longer; I do not mean for two or three hours a day, but for two or three hours in one day—we did not leave after that, we stayed two months there, from April to June—I do not know whether "Brown Brothers" were ever summoned before the Magistrate, not criminally they were not—I think one of them was summoned, that was Brown—I think it was to Marlborough-street, I am not certain—we were then trading as "Brown Brothers"—the place of business was then in Pall Mall; he was only sum<lb/>moned once to my knowledge—I was at Pall Mall with him—I have not been with Brown Brothers pretty well all over the country—I do not know what names we went by—various names—I was not the proprietor—I have been with them about ten years—I think we went by different names in different towns—we had a licence to travel, and the licence was always in Brown's name—we did not always trade in Brown's name, not when any large firm had failed, or anything of that sort, we very likely then traded in the name of that firm—we never traded in the name of Howard and Co.—I know a Mr. Lloyd—he was not one of them, he was in business for himself in Maddox-street—he had sale rooms—he was there two years—I was with him part of the time—Mr. Brown was not with him—that was not Brown's concern, it was separate—I suppose I was with him for about two months, I changed about from one time to the other—I remember the fire at Messrs. Pawson's, in St. Paul's-churchyard—it was never com<lb/>plained that Brown Brothers had fraudulently represented that they had purchased a large quantity of their stock—it was said so by a draper in the neighbourhood—we did buy goods of them—I was never charged with assaulting ladies who came to our establishment and compelling them to buy, nor were any of us to my knowledge—I think I did hear that Lloyd was, but I was not present—I do not know a person of the name of Hor<lb/>wood—I know the name of Allgood—I gave him a character as a respect<lb/>able man—I was never charged with giving him a false character—not the slightest complaint was ever made of it—I will swear that—he lived with me between three and four months—I never gave him a nine months' cha<lb/>racter, nor was it false, nor was the slightest complaint made of it—that I swear—he lived with me at Chertsey or Egham—I was travelling about then—he was one of the men that lived with me while I was travelling about—I gave him a character on that account; not from Mr. Towsery, or Brown Brothers, but from myself—he was my servant, and I paid him</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller. I live at the Hand and Shears, No. 1, Middle-street, Cloth Fair—on the afternoon of 25th July I did not hear him say something abusive to my daughter, but my daughter came down stairs, and the prisoner came down not more than a minute and a quarter after—he stood at the parlour door and said, "I will kick your—y guts out, and cut open your b—y head with a poker"—I had remon<lb/>strated with him with respect to his conduct to my wife and daughter—he did as he said, he came and kicked me with his full force in the groin—he had his boots on—I was held fast by the women—my own daughter was one; she held me away from him, and there was the prisoner's mother behind—she had hold of me by the collar—I extricated myself by using my arms, and she had a long brush immediately and beat me on the back of my head—after the prisoner struck me with the kick, he returned to the tap room, brought the poker, and struck me on the temple with it—the effect of that blow was that I was stunned and my head cut open—I was taken to the doctor at St. Bartholomew's hospital, and he strapped it up—I have been suffering ever since—it was a very heavy blow, half of my head was completely numbed.</p>

I was at the Hand and Shears on the day this happened; I saw the prisoner run into the tap room and fetch the poker out, and strike Mr. Barry on the head—some women had hold of Mr. Barry, and the prisoner struck him, and he held the poker out, and said, "If the b—r comes near me again, I will give him another one"—he ran, and I ran after him, and caught him, and gave him to the officer—I did not see Mr. Barry strike anybody—he had no chance, there was a woman holding him, and the prisoner struck him with the poker.</p>

I saw the poker in the prisoner's hand, but I did not see him strike—that t was after the cry of "Murder!"—Sarah Ann Doherty is my daughter—she had my baby in her arms, and I told her to keep out of the way—there was a large cupboard, which prevented her seeing Mr. Barry.</p>

On Thursday night, 28th July, the prisoners came to our house between 11 and 12 o'clock; after they had been there a little time, Tracey asked me if I would buy a handkerchief—he pulled one out of his breast—I said, "No," it was of no use to me—he came again, and asked me to buy it; he said that I should have it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he would give me the same for it another time—I bought that one, and then he produced five more—the other prisoners each had a bundle, and they took some out of their bundles—I saw the bundles, there were three bundles—I asked them where they got it from, and if it was theirs—they said, "Yes," they had taken it up from the purser, they had taken twelve yards each from him—I bought six altogether, and gave Tracey the money—one of them, I think it was Shandley, then pulled some out of another bundle, and threw it on the sofa, and said it was no consequence, if I had not got money to pay him to day, he would send Mrs. James to me for the money next day—I said, "Very well," and they all three went away—I had not arranged to purchase more than the six—I do not know what he meant by saying he would send Mrs. James for the money—he wanted me at first to buy twelve yards—I said it was no use to me, and declined to purchase it—I kept the handkerchiefs and thought it strange that they did not call or send next day for the money, and I sent over to Mrs. James, but she was out—I after<lb/>wards gave the handkerchiefs up to the policeman—these (<hi rend="italic">produced by the policeman</hi>) are them.</p>

On Saturday, 5th August, I was watching the premises of Mr. Munyard, a baker, in London-street, Green<lb/>wich, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner Miller come out of Mr. Munyard's shop door at a little before 6 o'clock, and walk down London-street towards the old Church—he returned in two or three minutes, went into the shop, and just pulled the door to—in five or ten minutes he came to the door again, and beckoned, and I saw Cleveland come up directly—Miller let him into the shop, and in about half a minute Miller opened the door, and let Cleveland out again with a sack on his back containing a bushel of something—I followed him about sixty yards, to the shop of Thatcher, who is a pastrycook, in the same street—the shutters were up, but the door was left ajar, and he pushed it open with his hand, and put the sack down in the passage—I followed him—on seeing me, Thatcher said to him, "What have you got there?"—he made no reply, and I said, "Some flour, which he has brought from Mr. Munyard's"—Thatcher said that he would sooner have given a sovereign than this should have happened, and he asked me several times if I could take a sovereign to look over it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sack—the flour was given up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Westminster-road. On 7th July, the prisoners came in about a quarter past 10 o'clock at night; Gilchrist asked for two cubas—the girl was about to serve them, and I went forward and served them myself—the cubas were given them—they bit the ends off, and Gilchrist tendered a counterfeit 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said it was bad, and each of them offered to pay in good money—I asked Gilchrist it he had any more of them, and he made no answer—a friend of mine was there, I called him, and sent for an officer; and while I was waiting for him, I found the prisoners were fumbling in their pockets—they were standing on some straw in the shop, which had not been there ten minutes—the floor had been washed, and no one had been there from the time the straw was put down till the prisoners came—when the officer came, I examined the straw where Gilchrist had been standing, and found one sixpence, which I gave the officer—I saw Mr. Rigg find two more sixpences—the prisoners said they knew nothing about them—I marked the sixpence that was offered to me and gave it to the officer.</p>
