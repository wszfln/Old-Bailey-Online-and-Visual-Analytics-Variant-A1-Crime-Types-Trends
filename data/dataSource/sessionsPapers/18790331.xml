                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). About 6 o'clock on the evening of 1st Feb. I saw Alvey in Aldersgate Street, close to the door of Messrs. Atkinson's warehouse—I knew him to be one of their servants—I saw something pro<lb/>jecting from underneath his short canvas jacket—I followed him to the corner of Carthusian Street—I saw Tyler standing on the kerb; he went up and spoke to her, and they both went into the Red Lion public-house—I suspected there was something wrong, I pushed the door partly open; I saw Tyler sit down and open this little bag; Alvey pulled this bottle from underneath his jacket and put it into the bag; I saw the quicksilver—I went few paces from the house to get assistance, I turned round and saw them both come out of the public-house—they parted, one came towards Aldersgate Street and the other towards Charterhouse Square—I followed Tyler, stopped her, and asked her what she had in the bag—she said "What belongs to my husband"—I said "I mean that bottle which the man in the public-house put into your bag just now"—she said "He put nothing in the bag"—I said "I saw him put a bottle in," and I put my hand in and pulled out this bottle of quicksilver—I then told her that I should take her into. custody—I took her to the prosecutor's warehouse, took Alvey also into custody and took them both to the station—she said that her husband had given ber this to take to be burnt—I told Alvey I should charge him with stealing this bottle of quicksilver and giving it to the female in the public-house—he said he had not given anything to her, she had merely come to deliver a message to him from her husband—Mr. Best, one of the pro<lb/>secutor's clerks, afterwards came to the Guildhall Police-court and spoke to Alvey about the state of his machines; he wanted to know how they stood, because of putting the different ingredients into the mills—the prisoner said No. 3 was 44, and he told him of the other machines, and that they Would</p>

               <p>want certain ingredients in at certain times—I went with Mr. Best to the prosecutor's premises and inspected the machine where the prisoner had been at work, and behind a box underneath the mill I found a jar containing 5lb. of quicksilver, and in the corner I found two bottles covered over with some old cocoanut matting containing this sugar and powdered Fuller's earth—I afterwards went to the house where Tyler was lodging and searched two rooms, one downstairs and one up; I found there a large quantity of tube* used for barometers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutor—it was part of my duty to weigh out to Alvey at stated periods the quick-silver that he required for his machines, and as a rule I weighed it out in his presence and handed it to him and entered it in a book—I have been there 17 years, but not always in that capacity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the prosecutor—Alvey has been in the employ about 30 years—it was his duty to look after the machines for making ointment and pills, one of the chief ingredients being quicksilver—since this matter has been brought to my notice I have made an inspection of the books in which the quicksilver delivered to him appears—I have also made an inspection of the quantity of ointment that was turned out by him from the machines, and found a deficiency—about February, 1878, after taking stock, I had reason to tell Alvey that his stock was deficient, that he was continually having silver out, and I was dissatisfied with the result—he said he had worked up all the raw material and we had had the result, and as he had been in the employ such a number of years I was reluctant to be suspicious or to be harsh with him, and I passed it over at the time—about the early part of February this year I saw the female prisoner meet Alvey in Barbican; she opened a bag and he placed something in it—I did not we what it was—the mercury produced is similar to what was given out to Alvey—we use a bottle like this, this other is a spirit bottle—others besides the prisoner used mercury, each workman has it weighed out to him in his J presence, and they have to account for it—the manufactured article and the mercury account is balanced every month—it is in the manufactured article that we are deficient.</p>

I am one of the managing chemists at the prosecutor's—I saw Alvey at the Guildhall Police-court and asked him how the machines stood—he said as to Ko. 3 that he had put 40lb. of quicksilver into that machine and 4lb. of other ingredients—I went back with Potts and looked at the machine and found there was only 30lb. of quicksilver—also found the sugar and Fuller's earth underneath in a box—it had no business there.</p>

               <p>party of friends in Fleet Street—you said you were going to play at billiards—I have heard you speak about going to Fleet Street, but not what to do, or about a tavern there—I did not call you at 1 o'clock, but I called you afterwards—my mistress employs a brougham to drive about—I remember it being smashed, but not that same night—it gave rise to some talk in the kitchen—Mrs. Pastow stayed that night talking in the kitchen—that pre<lb/>vented me from calling you at 1—I am certain it was not another night—it was 2 o'clock when you went out—next morning I heard the bell ring, and sent down my son to let you in—the other lodger did not go out that morning—he is in the habit of going out at 6 o'clock—you said you had been waiting about the house till he came down, as you could not open the door—you said nothing about waiting from half-past 4—the door was fastened—the front bell rings on the steps, I believe—the bell, is not outside my bedroom door—the only bells I have noticed are inside the kitchen—I heard the bell; it woke me—there are two bedrooms below and one next to me—I am sure it was a cheque which you told me you expected—I do not remember your getting a paper from Scotland concerning money—I remember your having to sign a paper to send back to get some money on the Wednesday—that was a few days before this occurrence—you told me a week before to tell my mistress you expected some money and would pay her—it was between 10 and 11 by our clock when you returned—r was in the kitchen and went upstairs, and when I came down you told me you would pay me—you passed me in the kitchen—you passed me on the stairs afterwards at the breakfast-room door—I cannot tell whether our clock is fast; it was near 11—the clock varies.</p>

I am the wife of James Lewis Rudd, of 39, Harmood Street—I am the landlady—the prisoner and his mother had been lodging there about four months; they occupied the first-floor back—the prisoner is a stonemason by trade; he was not in work at the time this occurred—I do not think he had been in work for 9 or 10 weeks—Mrs. Perryman was nearly 70 years of age, she told me she was just on 70—she did nothing for her living—they both used the same room—I believe there were some articles in the other room, but not a bed in it, there was one bed in the room which they both used—the prisoner told me that he himself slept in a corner of the room on the floor—on Wednesday, 5th February, I saw Mrs. Perryman between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, I was in the back parlour and saw her go out with a pail and return with it—she appeared in her usual health at that time; she was dressed in her ordinary day clothing; she did not speak to me; I saw her out of the parlour window; that was the last time I saw her, I heard her afterwards—I generally saw her every day, sometimes she was rather bad and unable to go out, but latterly, for the last few weeks, she was in her usual health as far as I know—I don't remember hearing her after about 2 o'clock that day, she was then going through the passage from the street to go upstairs—I had not seen the prisoner that afternoon—I heard him go out about 1 o'clock—besides Mrs. Strevens there was a man and his wife lodging in an ante-room, a back room on the stairs, they were both out that day—about 5 o'clock that afternoon I saw Mrs. Strevens come in and the prisoner came in about live minutes after Mrs. Strevens went upstairs—I did not see the prisoner come in, I heard him—I thought it was him by the walk, he went upstairs—about eight or ten minutes afterwards Mrs. Strevens came down and made a statement to me and while she was speaking to me I heard the prisoner come down and go out, and I saw him through the parlour window—I saw him run out from the street door and out of the gate and up the street, he appeared madly excited, he ran and threw up his arms and legs, he seemed to fly almost, he did not pass by the window, he went the other way—he returned in what appeared to be not more than a minute or a minute and a half—I caught sight of him as he returned but</p>

               <p>not distinctly, it was getting dusk—my husband saw him—he went upstairs leaving the street door wide open, it opens with a latch key, he usually had one—Mrs. Strevens was still with me in the front parlour, she went upstairs, my husband came home at the time—Mrs. Strevens had been gone only a minute or so before she ran down again and made a statement to me—I heard the prisoner come downstairs again and go out and shut the door—I did not see him at all on that occasion, I only heard him—I ran upstairs immedi<lb/>ately and went to the door of the back room first floor—I knocked loudly and called Mrs. Perryman three times by name—I got no answer or any sound of any kind—my husband came up immediately after—he knocked three times and called; he then opened the door, we got a light, and went in—the door was locked and the key left on the outside—there was no light or fire in the room; when we went in we saw Mrs. Perryman lying on the bed: there was no sign of life at all in her—she was lying partially on the left side, with the knees drawn up; her head was towards the foot of the bed; lying on pillows and bolster; they were placed underneath her head, about a foot from the foot of the bedstead—the bedclothes were partially covered over her up round the ears, and part of an old black shawl was wrapped round the neck—there were not many bedclothes—she was wear<lb/>ing boots and stockings and her legs were drawn up and exposed to the knees—she was fully dressed—I got a looking-glass and placed it to her mouth, but I saw no sign of breath—I did not move the clothes in the least—I noticed no marks about her at that time—we did not know that any<lb/>thing had happened to her then—my husband felt the pulse of her left hand, which was outside the coverlid, and I felt her forehead—my husband ran for a doctor, there were two or three tables in the room, but it was all in a state of confusion—there was nothing overturned—I believe it always had been in that state, I have heard so but I have not been inside the room—there were no signs of disturbance, nothing to attract my attention—there were two or three chairs in the room—I remained in the room while my husband had gone for the doctor—I dare say we were there for an hour or more; he was not able to get a doctor for some considerable time—I re<lb/>mained there till Mr. Shoppee came—my husband fetched a policeman when he could not get a doctor—he did not disturb the body or the clothes, he came and looked but did not touch, he fetched another constable—when Mr. Shoppee came he looked at the deceased and thought that her death might have arisen from a blow—there was a large lump on her forehead, but that was a tumour—the doctor did nob disturb the clothes at all—nothing was done with the room after the doctor left, it was locked up and the body was left in the room that night, the door was locked and I had the key—about 9 o'clock or a little before, that same night, the prisoner came to the house, he went straight upstairs—I had the key of the room at that time—he came down immediately and asked for the key—I said the police had got it—my husband came in at the front door and confronted the prisoner at the foot of the stairs; he said, "Are you aware what has occurred upstairs?" the prisoner said, "Unfortunately I am"—he said, "I ran for brandy and I ran all the way to Holloway;" he muttered something else not quite distinct, about having friends, and walked out of the house—he was not sober then, he came back again but I did not admit him, I kept the chain on the door, he was not allowed to come into the house that night—about 12 or between 12 and 1 that same night, Inspector Dodd came with another</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310024"/>
               <p>Inspector—I gave him the key of the room and went up with him—in con-sequence of what my husband had told him, he uncovered the deceased's throat, and I saw a mark round the throat quite distinctly—I had seen that before, I went up with my husband previous to that, I think about 11 o'clock, he uncovered the throat, then I saw the mark, and I noticed that her dress was unfastened from the stays down to the waist—the stays were un<lb/>fastened and the dress also and the chemise, literally quite bare to the waist—I think my husband covered the clothes over again, and I locked the room up again—after the Inspector had left the room we locked it up again until Inspector Dodd with Sergeant Lucas came next morning; about half past 9, I gave him the key and went into the room with him—I saw them examine the body—I don't remember noticing this red handkerchief until after the death, I saw it round the deceased's neck when the Inspector and Sergeant Lucas were there—I saw Sergeant Lucas take it from the neck, it was hanging quite loose—the body was taken away about 7 o'clock that even<lb/>ing to the mortuary—that would be Thursday evening; she was removed in the same state, with the clothes on—after the police had made a further examination of the place, the key of the room was given to me—I did not know much about Mrs. Perryman's means—I don't know anything about this black handkerchief—I remember a foreign letter coming for her about Christmas time—the deceased told me that it came from Australia, 18,000 miles off—I believe I should know the envelope again, it was a square en<lb/>velope—a young lady brought it to the door and I called Mrs. Perryman downstairs to receive it from her—I should say this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the envelope, but I could not be quite positive; it had either three or four stamps on it, I think this was about three weeks before Christmas, but that I am not quite sure of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner returned to the house several times after 9 o'clock, and I refused to let him in or his brother—the brother came several times also—there was no sign of any struggle when I went first into the room—the bed was greatly in confusion—there was no sign of any struggle on the bed—when we first went to the door the key was on the outside of the door and locked—I do not know anything about the furniture that was in the room—I had never been inside the room, only to the door—when my husband said to the prisoner, "Are you aware what has happened?" I believe his reply was, "Unfortunately I do"—I think he said, "I know she has gone, poor old soul; you don't know our circumstances"—I could not say whether he appeared to be sober when I saw him run out in the afternoon—I said before the Coroner, "He walked as if sober that afternoon, but in the evening when he returned he was the worse for drink"—that is correct—that was after I had refused him admittance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—on 5th February I came home about 5.15—as I approached the house I saw the prisoner coming down the street towards the house—he turned into the small garden in front of the house in front of me, went in, and left the door wide open and went upstairs—I went into my own room—while I was there with my wife Mrs. Strevens came downstairs—while she was speaking to in I heard, as I supposed, the prisoner come downstairs and go out; that was not more than 3 minutes after he had gone up—after he had gone out my wife and Mrs. Strevens went upstairs; they called me and I followed them up; I knocked at the door three or four times, and called "Mrs.</p>

               <p>Perryman" each time—the door was locked and the key was on the outside; getting no answer I asked Mrs. Strevens for a light, and I went into the room, and behind the door, lying on the bed, I saw the body of Mrs. Perry<lb/>man she was lying partially on her left side; her head was towards the foot of the bed; the door opens close to the bed; her head was about half a yard from the foot of the bed—I felt her pulse directly I went in; she was quite warm—I could not see any part of her neck—I went out to try and find a doctor—I first removed the clothes about 10 o'clock, after I had been and heard a remark from the prisoner's brother; they were torn completely open in front—I met the prisoner on the stain about 9 o'clock—at that time the room had been locked up—he was under the influence of liquor—I asked him if he knew what had occurred upstairs—he said, "Unfortunately I do, but you don't know our circumstances; I have been for brandy, and I ran all the way to Hollo way"—that was all that was said; he then went out of the house—he was in a very excitable state; he burst out crying whilst he was speaking to me—I next saw him about 10 o'clock at the Prince of Wales public-house at the corner of the street, about 80 yards from the house; I was in the private bar then, he was in the public bar opposite—I could see him quite distinctly; he was speaking to a person whom I have since found out was his brother, William Henry Perryman—they were quarrelling together; the brother was trying to stand up from a fall, and the prisoner was trying to push him down—I heard the brother say, "You told me you hung your mother," or words to that effect; that was when the prisoner was trying to push his brother down into the seat; he pushed him down, and said, "You shut up"—I did not hear anything else said—they were both drunk—in consequence of what I heard there I went back to my house and told my wife, and then it was that I went upstairs and saw the marks; I removed a portion of the garments round the throat and chin, and by the light of the lamp I saw the red mark round the throat; that was, I believe, the first time that the clothing had been touched—in consequence of what I saw I consulted a friend and then went to the police-station; Inspector Dodd followed me back—the door of the room remained locked during the night—the prisoner came there several times and the brother also, they came separately—I don't know when the brother came first; it was after I had seen him at the public-house—I did not admit either of them—the brother came again about 7 in the morning—I got up and went out to look for a policeman, and the brother followed me while I was looking for the police<lb/>man as far as the Shipton public-house—he went in there and brought the prisoner out, and that was the last I saw of the prisoner until he was in custody.</p>

               <p>told him at a coffee-house—he made no reply—I followed him to a coffee-house close by, 44, Ferdinand Street, and engaged him a bed, and he went in there—I directed an officer to watch the house—I then went to 39 Harmood Street, to the first-floor back room; Mrs. Rudd opened the door and I saw the woman lying on the bed; I then saw the mark on the neck; I did not make any full examination then; I merely looked at the mark, and cleared the room of the people that were in, locked the door, and gave the key to Mrs. Rudd with directions that no one should enter till I returned in the morning—next morning I went there at 9.30 with Sergeant Lucas—I then examined the woman; I moved a black shawl that was round the neck, which I had covered up on the previous night; it had been put there and removed by the witness Rudd, and I covered up the neck again with it in the same state in which it was—I removed it and the bedclothing to the waist—I saw this red handkerchief lying loosely round the neck on to the breast, in this position (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I directed Lucas to remove it, which he did, and I took possession of it; it was precisely in the same condition when he removed it as it is now, with this knot in it, and it was torn exactly as it is now—I noticed that the clothing she was wearing had been undone to the waist, the dress, stays, and chemise; it was a very old chemise, and it was low down towards the waist; it was unfastened, or looked as if it had been torn; it looked as if they had all come away at once—I noticed a mark round the neck—she was fully dressed; she was lying partially on her left side, her knees drawn up, and the head was very much elevated on pillows—the room was in a very dirty state—I did not see any appearance of any struggle having taken place—I noticed a cupboard with a door to it; it had on it an ordinary iron hat-peg; that was unbroken; there was nothing attached to it—I found this piece of cord in the room, which was used as a. clothes-line; it was suspended across the room fastened to two nails, one on each side of the room—the hat-peg was six feet from the ground—there was nothing underneath it—I examined the floor; the size of the room was 12 feet by 11—the room door opened against the bedstead, on the right as you go in—the Chief Inspector arranged for the body to be removed—Sergeant Lucas searched the room in my presence to see if he could find any money—no money was found—I did not smell or see any spirits in the room—the body was removed about half-past 6 on the Thursday evening—I saw the prisoner during that day; I first saw him about 11 at the Prince of Wales public-house; he was not sober; I did not speak to him—I saw next about half-past 1 in the day; he was not sober then; that was at the Kentish Town Police-station—he was brought there in custody on a charge of drunkenness—he was searched in my presence, and this small black handkerchief was taken from his breast coat-pocket; there was nothing in it; the money was in his waistcoat pocket; 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was taken from him, and five pawnbrokers'duplicates, one for two neckties on 11th January, 1879, for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the name of Williams; on 18th January, 1879, a hammer for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the name of Johnson; on 27th January five tools for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the same name; on 28th January 23 tools and a bag for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the same name; and on 29th January six silver tea-spoons and sugar-tongs for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the name of Thomas Payne, pledged at Mr. Alworthy's, 5, Lismore Circus, Haverstock Hill; the others were pledged at another pawnbroker's named Thompson close by—I also found on him this latch-key—as he was going to the cells he said "Give me that money; what are you going to do with it?</p>

               <p>it was my mother's, poor old girl; she has been dead these two months, and buried in Finchley Cemetery"—he was drunk—I next spoke to him at 1.30 p. m. at the Marylebone Police-court—he was then sober—I said "You will be charged on suspicion of having caused the death of your mother, Frances Perryman, at 39, Harmood Street, on the 5th instant"—he said "Very well"—he made a long pause, and then said "Me kill the poor old girl 1"—I cautioned him; I told him that anything he said might be used in evidence; I said that before he said anything—I then held up this black handkerchief, and said "How do you account for the possession of this hand<lb/>kerchief?"—he said "I suppose that is what the money was wrapped in"—I said "How do you account for the possession of the money?"—he said "That is change for a sovereign I found about the poor old girl"—he after<lb/>wards corrected himself, and said "No, it must have been in the handker<lb/>chief on the mantelshelf"—that was all that passed—the charge was then entered, and he was taken before the Magistrate the same day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not take any note of the articles of furniture that were in the room—I noticed, but did not take any note—there were chairs, only one bed—I saw a tub, it was like a tub cut in two—it is here—the iron peg behind the door was an ordinary one for hanging dresses on, screwed into the door—it was about 6 feet from the ground—I measured it at 9.30 on the Thursday morning—I went there first, about 1 o'clock on the Thurs<lb/>day morning, or a little after—it was on my second visit at 9.30 that I measured it—I should say the tub stood about 2 feet high from the floor—this red handkerchief is torn, and broken short off at the knot—that is precisely as I found it—it was severed, and lying loosely on the neck. Re-examined. The parts where it is severed were lying close together—I could see the two ends—I could see that it was severed when Lucas took it up—the tub was empty—I should think it had been used for washing purposes—it is about 20 inches in diameter—it was behind a chest of drawers, which as I entered the room faced the door—then there was a distance between the back of the chest of drawers to the cupboard door of about 5 feet, and the end of the tub was up against the drawers, or nearly so—the tub was standing on its side against the wall—the open part was lying out into the room—(<hi rend="italic">The witness drew a sketch of the room</hi>)—the tub stood be<lb/>tween the drawers and the cupboard—the cupboard door is here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the peg is now broken—at the time I examined the room the peg was screwed on all right—the witness is here who broke it—the tub was standing about 8 inches from the cupboard door—I believe the object of the drawers standing out from the wall was that the prisoner should have a bed there where he could lie, but there was nothing of the kind there.</p>

               <p>6.10—I went up into the back room first-floor, and saw the woman lying dead on the bed—her head was towards the door as you entered the room, propped up by several pillows, and a bolster folded underneath her shoulders—there was an interval between the pillows and the iron work of the bed—the upper portion of the body was covered up with old bedclothing right up to the face; the lower portion was uncovered, to the extent of a couple of feet perhaps, up to the knees—I saw that she had her clothing on—she was quite dead—the body was cooling, but still warm—I thought she had been dead about an hour—I did not notice any smell of spirits in the room—my attention was called to a swelling on the deceased's right temple—I asked if it was recent, and I was told yes—I was of opinion at that time that it was possibly a mark of violence—I afterwards ascertained that it was an old wen from a tumour—I did not make any examination of the state of the body at that time, except to ascertain the fact of life or death—I did not uncover the neck; I only felt the condition of the hand to see if there was any pulsation—having satisfied myself that she was dead, I made no further examination—I did not see the handkerchief at that time—I reported the matter to the Coroner's officer—I was afterwards directed to make a post-<hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> examination—I made it on Friday the 7th at the mortuary, St. Pancras—the divisional surgeon of the police, Mr. Downes, was present—I have my original notes made at the time in the mortuary—externally I found the body was fairly nourished—she appeared to be a little over 70—there was a cluster of blood spots at the top of the left thigh; that is usually found in cases of suffocation, arising from various causes—there was not very much <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> staining—the lividity of the body was not very great—I found a mark on the neck which began three fingers' breadth below the right ear, and passed backwards round the back of the neck, and under the chin, terminating with a deep dent on the margin of the lower jaw-bone—it ex<lb/>tended round the neck, across the left side to about an inch in front of the angle of the jaw, fading off into a pink line on the right cheek—the mark varied in width from a quarter to half an inch, broader behind, but mow deeply indented in front, particularly so at its termination—the colour of the mark was a light mahogany brown, and the skin was parchment-like to the touch—I believe it was a mark made during life—there was no blood or froth from the mouth or nose; the eyes were not congested; the clothing and the buttocks of the deceased were soiled by a motion—the palms of the hands were not marked by the print of finger nails, but both palms and nails were livid—on turning back the skin corresponding to the mark, the super<lb/>ficial muscles were found somewhat blanched internally—the liver and kidneys were healthy, the stomach was half-full of partially digested food, composed of meat and vegetable matter—there was no smell of alcohol—the stomach itself was healthy, the heart was healthy, containing an ounce or more of dark fluid blood in the right ventricle, the left side empty; the aorta, the principal bloodvessel, was healthy; there was some evidence of old disease at the top of the right lung—on section the lobes appeared deeply congested, mostly so at the base, with frothy mucus of a dark bloody colour—the right bronchial tube was intensely congested, and its divisions filled up with frothy bloody mucus; on the left side similar appearances—the trachea was much congested, diminishing towards the upper end—the trachea or larynx was uninjured, the tongue pale and not bitten, the superficial vessels of the brain were slightly congested, the brain</p>

               <p>healthy—the upper portion of the spinal cord healthy, the vertebrae un<lb/>injured—that was all—the marks I saw on the neck might have been caused by this handkerchief—in my judgment the cause of death was strangulation—I should think in this case constriction of the neck would not have to be kept up more than a minute and a half before death would be caused—I think that would be quite sufficient time to cause death—I saw no other cause of death but the strangulation; I should think it was accelerated by fear—in my judgment she could not herself have inflicted the marks I saw on the neck by strangulation—in my judgment she could not have used this handkerchief in a way to strangle herself, from the marks I saw; she had not power enough to produce such deep indentations—in my judgment the marks on the neck might have been caused by hanging herself, if a specially arranged loop had been made.</p>

I mean, if a running knot had been made, but then we should not have had the absence of the 2 1/2 inches mark on the neck; if these two ends had been tied together and hung on a nail such as that, and her head thrust through it, she might have been suspended, and that might have made the appearances I saw, but not with a running noose; if it had been tied at the ends and hung on a nail and the woman was suspended in it, it might have caused such marks; that is, if a person in order to hang themselves had first of all tied a tight knot and placed the two ends together and then put the loop over the peg, and then put the head into the loop, in that way it might be done, but the chances on the contrary are that the body might fall out before death had taken place—there was no connecting mark on the throat or neck; if done in the way suggested it would account for the marks on the back part of the neck as well—it depends upon whether the woman hung herself sideways or with her face to the door—there must have been a great deal of pressure on the back of the neck—if a person wanted to commit suicide in that way, one would presume they could not do otherwise than fix the loop under the chin; if that were done one would expect to find a deep mark there—I wanted to put it in every possible light, and it occurred to me that supposing by accidental circumstances the woman, instead of putting it in that way, put her face sideways instead of having her back to the door, and getting the pressure under the chin, she had gone in a side way direction facing the bed or window, then you might get the interval of 2 1/2 inches; then the pressure would come under the angle of the jaw on one side—if done in that way I should expect to find a point where there was no pressure behind—if a person was lying on a bed and you put a loop round the neck and exerted, great pressure, that pressure would show at every point except where the cords did not cross; if on the other hand a person exerts the pressure by their own weight, then the indentation must prevail about the point where the weight of the body acts; the pressure could not come, and the marks could not be made on that part of the body where the weight did not act—if a person hung herself with such a loop as I have described the body would probably swing about in one way or other, but the point where the cords would not cross must almost of necessity he at the back of the neck—I put forward the fact of a person hanging herself in the way described as a remote possibility.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then just see if this expresses your view quite accurately: "I think that if a person did hang herself in a loop, it would be possible, but highly improbable, that such an indentation as I saw in this case should appear on</p>

               <p>the back of the neck, as the chin must be put through the loop, and the weight of the body, in the absence of a running noose, would be thrown on the fore part and sides of the neck." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite. so; I assent to that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. Assuming that the woman was on the bed and that some person had used this handkerchief for the purpose of strangling her the marks I saw were consistent with that; if the handerchief had been worn round the neck as it ordinarily is, by just catching hold of the two ends and pulling backwards and upwards, if the woman was lying on the bed, that would be sufficient—the pink mark on the cheek showed that there was an upward direction used—the distortion is generally greater in strangulation than in hanging, because, as a rule, more violence is used—in this case there was not what I should term great distortion—I have said that the death might have been caused by strangulation, accelerated by fear, because terror has been known to do so; I do not say so from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearance—the motion would come from her just at the time of death—she was rather peculiarity dressed, she wore men's trousers—I could not form any opinion as to what position she was in when the motion came from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion death from strangulation inflicted by her<lb/>self was impossible—suffocation by suspension by herself is very remotely possible; there is a remote possibility—in death by strangulation I should expect to find considerable distortion, as a rule—there was a decided absence of distortion in this case—the mark on the neck was over the whole circum<lb/>ference of the neck except about 2 1/2 inches—if the head was in an ordinary position the mark would be slightly oblique; it depends on the way in which you have the head—obliquity is more common in death by suspension, and the mark is generally high up; in strangulation it is more circular—there must have been a good deal of violence to produce such a mark as I saw—I should not have expected to find the remains of a considerable struggle on the bed—if it had been done in the room, and the body subsequently placed on the bed, I should have expected to find signs of a considerable struggle, if strangulation had been inflicted with considerable violence—I have not seen any death caused by hanging—I cannot tell how many I have seen from strangulation; I have seen bodies after death, but I have not taken part in the examination of any from strangulation—I have not made any examina<lb/>tion in either case; I have made plenty of <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations in other cases—I have said that the muscles were blanched—I should not expect to find the muscles dark in colour under the mark—I do not think in hanging by a loose noose that the weight of the body would necessarily cause it to swing, unless it was suspended from a tree; it depends from what point you suspend it, if you suspended it from that gas branch it might; if suspended from that hook it would be quite unlikely to twist right round—supposing a person had a low stool or something underneath to raise themselves from the ground, and kicked it away, if the noose was loose, it would be quite unlikely that the body, if against a door, would swing round.</p>

The distortion of the features depends a good deal on the amount of time during which the constriction is kept up; if quickly removed, in cases of hanging, even in judicial executions, there would be very little distortion—I have said that in this case it would not take more than a minute and a half to effect strangulation; if after that time the ligature was removed</p>

               <p>I should expect to find very little distortion—the degree of distortion would depend partly on the violence used and partly on the time during which the process lasted—it would require extraordinary resolution for a person to keep up the pressure for a minute and a half on their own person, they would become insensible; if they became insensible and the hands relaxed, the cords would at once become loose, therefore it would be morally impossible that any person could strangle themselves and produce the mark on them<lb/>selves otherwise than by hanging.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.RC.S. of Dublin, and surgeon to the police at Kentish Town—I was present with Mr. Shoppee at the time the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made on the body of the deceased—I have heard the account that he has given as the result of that examination, and agree with him in what he has said as to the appearance of the body—I took part with him in the examination—I think the cause of death was strangula<lb/>tion; it would have, required great violence to produce the marks I saw—I think it is possible that a person could have produced such a mark upon themselves by strangulation—I have seen it in the living—it would require considerable strength to do it, long-continued constriction—a person would he likely to lose consciousness in the attempt—I do not think that a woman of 70 could have used such violence as this without losing consciousness—I have a case in my mind where a drunken woman in a cell got her bonnet strings round her neck, and I was called in to cut her down, there was a very strong mark there, the strings were tied tightly, and she could not undo them; in that case the strangulation would go on after the loss of con<lb/>sciousness—if the strings were not tied constriction would cease—the mark I saw could be produced by suspension—I do not moan by hanging in the ordinary way, except by a regulated noose, not by the handkerchief I have seen—I agree with what Mr. Shoppee has said with regard to a running noose—it would have to be done in the way he described, in a noose, a loop would not do it; it would not make that mark en the neck—a prepared noose would be continuous—I do not think it possible that the mark could he produced by a prepared loop, because the mark did not unite, there was an interval of 2 1/2 inches—I am of opinion that it was produced by the hand<lb/>kerchief put round the neck, and caught by the hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. A person might make a mark round their neck by hang<lb/>ing themselves, but if hung in a running noose it would make a mark right round the neck—this mark must have been made by a loop, not by a noose—the hanging by the loop would not produce a similar mark, the mark would not go all round the neck, and it would be differently placed—in my judgment this mark was caused by strangulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> The frayed part of this handkerchief is about three quarters of an inch from the knot, a woman's head could go into that space if the two ends were put together; if she stood sideways to the hook on the door, and kicked something away on which she was standing that might account for the want of continuity round the neck, but it would be differently placed, it would be placed posteriorly—if the noose was placed on the hook, and then she put her head into it, and then kicked away the object on which she stood, I don't think that would account for the want of continuity of the mark round the neck; I feel sure of that; the continuity would be greater, there would be a larger space between the ends; they would not meet where they did—there would be a want of continuity, but it would be a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310032"/>
               <p>very large amount of it—the face was placid and pale in colour when I saw it—that was on the Friday at 2.30 in the afternoon—there was a certain amount of lividity of the palms of the hands, and they were clenched, but not closed—there was not so much lividity as you would find in extreme violence, that is from hanging—you may have them violently clenched some<lb/>times, they vary very much—I could not form any definite opinion from the state of the hands as I found them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I agree with Mr. Shoppee that the amount of distortion would depend upon whether the constriction was quickly removed or not—if quickly removed there would be very little distortion—it would depend upon the amount of the violence and the time at which the constriction was kept up—death would be caused by the constriction very rapidly.</p>

I live at 26, Quadrant Grove, Kentish Town—a day or two after the death of Mrs. Perryman I went to the house, 39, Harmood Street—I saw an iron peg on the cupboard door in the first floor back room—I took hold of it and put the pressure of about 6lb. on it, and it snapped off close to the screws; it was so fearfully rotten it would not hold anything; a very slight effort did it.</p>

I am one of the house surgeons at the London Hospital—on Saturday evening, 8th March, Kay was brought there, and I found an incised wound at the back of his shoulder, clean cut, apparently done with a dagger-like instrument—it was deeper than it was broad, and such as this knife might have made—a fair amount of force must have been used—it might have been deeper—it was about 11/2 inches deep—it was not dangerous from its position—he was under my care as an in-patient a little more than a week—I have not seen him since—as an out-patient he went under another surgeon.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Stanlake, of 23, Park Street, Islington, a French-polisher—the prisoner has been living with my husband's mother between eleven and twelve years—as far as we knew they were man and wife, they always said so—on the night of 5th March I went to meet my husband in Goswell Road at his place of business—at that time and up to the present my husband's mother was living with us, and had been for about three months; she had ceased to cohabit with the prisoner because he ill-used her—he was not in the habit of coming to our house; he was forbidden, but he has watched my husband and me several times—this happened in High Street, Islington—my husband and I were coming home arm-in-arm together—we had passed about a dozen yards from Barnsbury Street when the prisoner rushed out of a dark corner, seised hold of my husband, and held him by one shoulder with one hand, and dug the knife into him with the other (this was between 10 and 11 at night)—he said "I will kill you"—I kept screaming "Murder 1"—my husband struggled with him; he never ceased digging the knife into him; they fell together; my husband fell on his face, and the prisoner fell on the top of him—he said "I will do for you," and dug the knife into the spine of his back, the lower part of his back—I ran towards the police-station; the prisoner ran after me with the knife—I called out "Murder!"—a constable came up to my assistance, and the prisoner turned on hie heel and went a different way in the dark towards Highbury; the constable</p>

I am a French-polisher at a pianoforte manufacturer's—I have known the prisoner these twelve years—he has been living with my mother over eleven years—I was under the impression for some time that they were married; he told me so—I discovered that they were not married about eight years ago—my mother ceased to live with him because he broke up all the things and got a month's imprisonment—that was about four months ago—after that my mother came to live with us—I don't think the prisoner knew where we lived; he never came to the house—on the evening of 5th March my wife came into the city to meet me, and we were returning home together; we were going along Upper Street, Islington, and had got about three doors past Barnsbury Street, when all of a sudden I felt as if a load of bricks was falling on my head; it gradually knocked me down—I received a number of blows on my head—I turned and got up the best way I I could and faced the prisoner, and caught a large knife in my hand as it entered my throat—I struggled with him for two or three minutes, off the pavement into the road, on to the team lines—I fell on my face after all the blows—the blood was all over me, and it blinded me; I got exhausted, and he drew the knife from me and stuck it into my back, and said "You b—I have done for you now"—in pulling the knife out it pulled me up—I was taken to the station and then to the hospital, and was there three weeks—my hands were cut, and I have lost the use of a joint—as far I call tell this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife he had, or one exactly like it.</p>

On 20th January I received information of the burglary at Mr. Wood's, and at 8 o'clock that morning I went with Sergeant Rolfe to 29, Devonshire Street, St. George's, which is a brothel, end found Graham there in bed with a prostitute—two other officers were outside—I told Graham I should take him in custody for a burglary at 111, Devonshire Street, Mile End, on Sunday morning—he said "All right, I will go with you; I know nothing about it"—he dressed himself and put on this coat, (<hi rend="italic">One of those identified</hi>)—I handed him over to another officer—he is known among his companions as Knocker—I then went to 11, Roberta Place, about five minutes' walk off, where Neil occupied the front parlour—I told Neil I had got <hi rend="italic">Knocker</hi> in custody for housebreaking, and was going to search the place—he said "He don't live here; I don't know anything of him"—I do not know of my own knowledge whether Graham lived there—we searched the room, and I saw Rolfe find in a cupboard this large nail (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to Neil, "What is this for? is it a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>?"—he said "That is what we use to hang the meat on"—Rolfe asked him what the rag was tied round it for—Neil's wife said, "It is to prevent the children knocking their eyes against it under the mantelpiece"—there was a hole under the mantelpiece, and Neil said that the nail was put in there to roast the meat—I saw the children; they were not tall enough to be in danger from the nail—the nail would not go into the hole on account of it being turned up—we took possession of it, and as we were leaving Neil said "You had better go round to my landlord round the corner at the grocer's; he will give you my character; he will tell you we are respectable, hard-work<lb/>ing people"—he did not give the name—I went round to the shop he mentioned, and it was Tannebaum's, 7, Thomas Street, about fifty yards from Neil's—Tannebaum's same was up—it is a chandler's shop—I saw him, and said "I have got a young man in custody this morning for house-breaking; he lives at 11, Roberts Place; I have been there and searched the place, and they deny all knowledge of him, and say that they are hard-work<lb/>ing people, and refer me to you for a character"—he said "They have been my tenants for some years, and are respectable, hard-working people; in fact 1 cannot say too much in favour of them"—I left, obtained a search warrant, went back between 12 and 1, and said to Tannebaum, "You remember seeing me this morning; did you buy an umbrella on Sunday?"—he said "No"—I said, "Now be sure"—he still said that he did not—I said, "Then I have a warrant to search your house"—he said, "Let me see it"—I handed it to him—he went to the window, read it, handed it back to me, and said, "Yes, I think I did buy one"—I said, "Let me have it, then"—he went upstairs, and I followed him to the corner of a room where there were 10 or 12 umbrellas, handed one to me, and said, "Here it is"—I said, "This is not the one I want, I want one with a buckhorn handle"—he went to a wardrobe in the room, opened the door, and after two or three minutes produced this umbrella from behind a number of coats hanging up—I said,</p>

               <p>"Did you buy anything else with it, a plated mug and sugar basin?"—he said "No"—I told him I should take him in custody for receiving the umbrella, well knowing it to have been stolen—I took him in custody, and left two officers in charge of the house—I went back afterwards, made a further search, and found two mugs, a sugar basin, this fusee case, and the overcoat which Mr. Wood has on now, which was given up to him by the Magistrate's permission—the fusee case was locked up in a bureau—I saw Sergeant Rolfe find some gloves in the pocket of the coat Fox was wearing, which he took off and threw on the sofa—the coat Mr. Wood is wearing was hanging up with the umbrella—I found a great deal of property there, which we took away in a cart and two or three cabs; there was a couple of van loads altogether—there were more than 1,000 articles; I made a list of them—I compared this nail with Mr. Wood's window, and it tallied exactly, and also with some marks on the jamb of the drawing-room door at Mrs. Cordingley's, 6, Addington Road, Bow—on the Sunday week, 9th February, I went to Neil's house and took him in custody for being concerned with Knocker in breaking into 117, Devonshire Street, and several other places—he said "All right"—I told him some of the property had been found at his place—he said, "I have got the bills relating to them"—Sergeant Rolfe took possession of some duplicates—I said, "It is nothing to do with the tickets, it is the gloves"—he said, "We have had them a long time;" I think he said about 12 months; "my wife bought them in the Lane"—the gloves had not been produced then—these are the three pairs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the way to the station I said, "The <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> corresponds with the marks at 111, Devonshire Street, and also on the door at No. 6, Addington Road"—he said, "I told you before it is what we use to hang the meat, on in front of the fire"—he made no answer to the charge at the station nor yet before the Magistrate—I got this card, "Lewis Tannebaum," at Tannebaum's house—this wedge was found in the pocket of the coat Graham was wearing when he was searched at the station.</p>

Police-Sergeant Jenman, and was present when he spoke to the prisoner—Jenman asked him if he had received such a cheque—he said "Yes"—Jenman said "Don't part with it until you hear from me"—I do not recollect the prisoner's reply—I have had several cheques cashed at the Birdcage—it is not above three minutes' walk from my house.</p>

There they stood me beside four mem I was the only man who had a hard felt hat on and a long coat, so the policeman had nothing to do but say 'That's him.' As for the woman saying I gave her the boots to pawn, I was sitting in the kitchen on Tuesday when a man came in and wanted to sell these boots. 1 asked him what he wanted; he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, living at Xeres in Spain—I have carried on business there for many years dealing in the wines of Spain—at the end of October last year I consigned four hogsheads and eight quarter casks of sherry to Marshall and Co., of 10 and 11, Mincing Lane—the average value would be from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a hogshead, and the quarter cask about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10a, exclusive of duty, freight, and dock charges—after that parcel was sent off I came to England, and saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner at his place of business, 10 and 11, Mincing Line—he had two rooms there—I saw a man named Houghton on that occasion—he was the first I saw—I negotiated with both of them, and it resulted in this agree<lb/>ment—I saw them both sign it, and I signed a duplicate, and left it with them. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 8th November</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and was an agreement between the witness, Houghton, and the prisoner, the witness to send wine from Spain to the vulue of at least</hi> 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Marshall and Co. to provide</hi> 2,0002. <hi rend="italic">for carrying on the business in England.</hi>) That agreement was signed at Mr. Foster's office, solicitor, Gracechurch Street—before it was signed I had visited the prisoner at his then residence, 23, Royal Crescent, Notting Hill; it was a good house well furnished—he was living there with his wife—I was his guest there for a few days—he gave me to understand that he was a merchant, in the wine business—I don't recollect exactly the words he made use of—a verbal arrangement was made as to the way in which the capital was to be supplied by him—I was to draw upon him from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months date; that was the first instalment he wanted to make of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did draw three bills, the first for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated November 26th, and the others for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated December 4th, all at three months, and the firm Marshall and Co. accepted them—I don't know who wrote the acceptances. I was not over here; they were payable at the South Western Bank—the first one would be due on March 1st—I was then in Xeres—it came back protested—I have never received a shilling of it, or a shilling in respect of the capital—after making this partnership agreement I returned to Xeres—I think I left here on November 19th, and got there five days after—the small parcel I had sent in October was included in the general arrangement; it was to be sold on the joint account—I afterwards sent over eight hogsheads and 24 quarter casks of sherry in one shipment to the value of about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the total number I sent was 16 hogsheads and 40 quarter casks, the cost price being about 420<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently came over to England again, and went to the bonded warehouses belonging to Mr. Alderman Breffit—I there saw all the casks and counted them—I recognised every one; they were all marked with my own brand—on February 10th, while I was in Spain, I received this letter from my partner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated February</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1879, <hi rend="italic">from the Prisoner, stating that Houghton had gone to the Cape, leaving things in confusion, and being indebted to the Prisoner; that he did not see his way to meeting the drafts at maturity, and asking the Prosecutor if he could renew for two months.</hi>) I had not had any previous notification of Houghton's departure for the Cape—I left Spain on 6th March and arrived in London on, Sunday the 16th, and on the Monday I went to Mincing Lane—the prisoner was not there—after waiting upwards of two hours I left a card stating that I was going to his private residence—I went there—he was not there—I did not go in—there was a gentleman there taking an inventory of the furniture—I then returned to Mincing Line and found the prisoner at his office—I asked him if the two bills that were still running, the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., had been paid—he said they had not—they had been returned to Spain—I told him I had received the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I had already written to him—I asked him then if the wines were free, meaning if they were unencumbered—to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion he said they were free—he said he thought he could get over his diffi<lb/>culties and I promised to see him next day—I did see him next day at the same place—I then asked him if he could make up my private account, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310074"/>
               <p>said "I wish to give you a cheque for the amount"—he said, "Houghton has left the accounts in such a confused state I am unable to make it out"—I asked if he did not keep a cash book—he said "No"—I saw him again next afternoon, Wednesday, at the same place, and I again asked him for the account—he did not give me any—what I meant by my private account was this, when I was over here I took 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on going back to Spain for my personal expenses, and he had paid two or three small accounts for me—the maximum amount was about 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was perfectly apart from the business; it was for my own private purpose—it was on the Friday that I discovered that the wines were at Mr. Alderman Breffit's when I asked the prisoner for a sample order; he gave me the order, but then stated that the wines were under advance to the extent of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I expressed my surprise—he then told me the wines were at Dowgate Bonded Warehouse; that is Mr. Alderman Breffi t's place, and I went there and saw the Alderman—I don't think I saw the prisoner again—I went to a solicitor that same day, and the prisoner was given into custody on the Monday afterwards; I charged him with embezzling the partnership property—I did not see him before that—when I went to his office on the Friday he was tearing up papers—since he was in custody my clerks at Xeres sent me this letter—I received it the day before yesterday; it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 12, 1879. My dear Crusoe,—Just a line, for poet time is nearly up. I have a party with large means who will take the management here in place of self or Houghton with your consent, &amp;c. He has 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and will open a banking account for this purpose with 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so.—Yours very truly, A. Marshall.") Moneys received were to be paid to the joint account between myself and A. Marshall and Co.—there was no banking account—the prisoner never sent me any accounts—he never informed me of any pledging with Alderman Breffit—I have never seen any books of account—I accompanied each of my consignments with invoices—there was an invoice of the shipping price of the wine, and in the body of the letter the joint account was debited with the actual cost—I never had any negotiation as to any one else coming into the concern, nor did I ever hear the name of any party.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first parcel of goods I transmitted to the firm I transmitted to them as commission agents; that amounted to about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was another small parcel after that, before the partnership, of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those were subsequently brought into the general agreement—the last clause in the agreement was added after it was drawn, because I objected to the word "agent;" this is the clause: "This agreement shall be held to constitute a partnership between the said parties so far as regards the business and agency hereby established, and the term agent and agency shall not be held to contravene this clause, but shall have the same construction as if the word 'partnership' should be used in lieu thereof"—I was to put 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business, in wines, casks, and plant, not in money—I was to send the wines and be at the expense of shipping them, and the expenses here were to be paid by Marshall and Co.—they were to provide 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash by instalments at certain times, as it might be agreed upon—they authorised me to draw on them to the amount of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of their capital—when I first saw Marshall my inquiry was about the bills, because I had to make arrangements for them—I did not ask him to guarantee the two unpaid bills, I swear that—I stated before the—Magistrate, "I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310075"/>
               <p>not aware that I asked him to guarantee the two unpaid bills"—I was sure of it, and I am certain now—I have not been accustomed to be in a Court of Justice before—I have no recollection of adding, "I won't swear I did not"—I might have been a little confused that day, but I am almost certain I did not ask him; I am certain I did not—I charged the wine to them at cost price—the office rent was to be paid by them, and the incidental expenses—the prisoner's first proposition was to work as an agent—in one or two letters he complained of the bad state of business—there was a person present at the office on the Friday, I don't know who he was—the prisoner made a proposition to me, which I rejected; he wrote it down on a piece of paper, and wanted me to sign it—he produced it to the Magistrate—I don't recollect what I said when I went into the office on the Friday; it was with regard to the accounts, if he had anything to show me, any statement of accounts, and he gave the same answer, that he had not been able to make up any accounts—then, I believe, he showed me the paper he had drawn up, and asked if I would agree to that—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 21, 1879. Dear Sir,—In consideration of your delivering to me the wines at present in Dowgate Dock shipped by me to you, I agree to discharge you from all liability between us under our deed of partnership, and to discharge and indemnify you for all acceptances you have given me, amounting to 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and further, that this delivery and arrangement shall be considered a settle<lb/>ment of all claims between us and put an end to the partnership; and I further agree to discharge on my own account the advances you have received from Messrs. Breffit and Co., and release you from all liability in reference thereto.") That was his proposition, to which I objected—he said something about a fresh partner with capital to come into the business; I think he said he had a person who would come in with capital and take Houghton's place, but I never saw that person, nor did he introduce him to me—I don't recollect that ho mentioned the name of Collins to me—he said he had claims against me for expenses over here; he did not say what those claims were—I think this conversation was on the Wednesday or Friday as he was given into custody on the Monday.</p>

A. Marshall and Co., and is endorsed "A. Marshall and Co." and "A. Marshall"—I have no doubt I saw the prisoner in reference to the advance; I saw him before I signed the cheque, at some part of the negotiation with regard to the removal of the wine—it was cleared by a clerk in the wharf office—the matter came to me for my consent and approval—I made some inquiry of the prisoner as to his power to obtain an advance on this wine, and he offered to produce the deed of partnership; he brought it to the office; at all events he made me acquainted with the contents—he said he wished the wine transferred from the London Docks to our warehouse, but I told him it was a foolish expense to move it from one place to another—on 6th</p>

I have been acting as solicitor for the defen<lb/>dant, and am acting for his defence—this is my bill of costs—it was taxed—the entry 23rd April, 1878, I find from my diary should be the 25th—I defended him in two or three actions, which commenced in March or April—I prepared the petition which was signed the following day—it is also wrong that on the 23rd he was to bring the list of creditors when he came next time; it ought to be the 25th—when he came with the list of creditors he gave instructions about the petition—my clerk attended prior to the petition; "Drawing and engrossing of petition, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 25th," that is right—when I had the instructions on that day, I should prepare it ready for the next—I should put the stamp on after it is signed; "Drawing affidavit, filing petition, and attending defendant to be sworn, paid oath 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and stamp 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," all that occurred on the 26th—Mr. Quick had sued him—I had instructions to defend the action—I think the writ was not sufficiently en<lb/>dorsed, and I took out a summons for further, and better particulars—I do not know that the date 23rd is correct, it is copied by a clerk—I have the copy writ here—it is dated 12th April, served 20th; amount 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for goods sold and delivered—I entered appearance, possibly to save judgment.</p>

I am a plumber, of 8, Perry Street, Millwall—on 28th February, about 10.30 p.m., I was in High Street, Poplar, and accidentally knocked up against the prisoners—I may have asked them to have a glass of ale, but I do not recollect it—I went with them to the Greenwich Pensioners public-house, and treated them to liquor—they both asked me to go in there—we stayed about an hour, and I had two or three glasses of whisky—I had a watch and chain and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loose in my trousers pocket in gold and silver—I took out my gold watch and chain while I was there, and placed them in my trousers pocket because I did not wish to lose them—only we three were in that compartment—we came out and went down a court, and when I got to the bottom of it I was knocked on the head and knocked down senseless from the front—it was perfectly dark; you could not see your hand before you—there was no gas—the prisoners were with me, and I saw nobody else—when I recovered consciousness I found myself lying on my face on the ground in the court—I got up on my knees, felt in my trousers pocket, and found my watch and everything was gone, and</p>

               <p>my hat as well; the women were gone also—this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was seriously hurt; I was in bed three days; my left eye was completely stopped up; I could not open it for three days, and I could hardly see out of the other—a doctor attended me for three or four days.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Driscoll.</hi> Pitt would not swear to the amount he lost, and therefore the charge was not entered—the inspector did not say that Pitt could only charge you with the watch—he did not say "You cannot charge her again for the money she has already been discharged for. Re-examined. It is a blind alley; you cannot get through to any place to my knowledge—the door at the end is for any vehicle to go in—when the door is shut the alley is blocked up, and if the door is open you cannot get beyond the courtyard—Driscoll was present when I found the watch, and made no remark whatever—I got information from Pitt's father—I was in the station when he came and complained on Wednesday morning about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate.</hi> Driscoll says: "When he was paying for the brandy he pulled the watch out with the coppers. He left the watch there and I picked it up. He was blind-drunk; he could not remember what he was doing."Santry says: "I know nothing about the watch, Me and my sister went down High Street, Poplar. He knocked against my sister. He took us in to have a drink. When we were coming out he paid for half a pint of brandy; she brought it down to my place, and I did not see her till next morning."</p>

As I came out I saw it lying on the seat, and picked it up and put it in my pocket We came out and drank a little of the brandy outside. He said he could not drink any more. We bade him good night, and left him in Cotton Street I would have given the watch up next</p>

If he speaks the truth he knows we never struck him, we never had a word of anger, and he had not a blemish on him when when we left him. If he had kept his watch in his pocket I should not have been a prisoner to-day.</p>

I am a packer in the employ of Lynch and Co.—I was the last person to leave the warehouse that Saturday—I left at 2.50 p.m.—the doors and windows were all locked—there are two cellar-flaps in front of the warehouse; I locked one inside and one outside—the keys of the com<lb/>municating doors of the warehouse hung up in the warehouse—I went there on Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, in consequence of a communication made to me, and found one of the cellar-flaps open and a desk in the strong-room broken open, the strong-room door broken open, and the safe tampered with. Cross-examined. I do not know that you did anything wrong while you worked there—I saw you outside on this Saturday, and asked you what you were doing—10 minutes after I locked up, and I think you said that you were at work for your brother-in-law.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Arnati and Harrison, of 11 and 12, Great Tower Street, City—we are agents of the Belgian Steamer the Baron Osy—I produce a bill of lading dated 23rd August, 1878, referring to 100 bags of wheat meal—it is consigned to M. Jackson and Co., and endorsed first by M. Jackson and Co., then delivered to M. B. Tate, undersigned B. D. Buhler, 64, Hop Exchange, signed M. B. Tate—it then holds our stamped release to the ship to deliver the goods—if the goods are not claimed we have a lighter in attendance on the ship, and all goods not claimed wo put into it on what is understood at the Custom House as a captain's entry; they were not claimed, and consequently were put into a Custom House lighter—they were landed there—we do not warehouse them, we merely land them on the quay—the bill of lading was left with us against an order on Custom House Quay for the goods—I gave this order in exchange for the bill of lading and payment of freight charges—the order authorises the wharfinger to deliver the goods to the holder of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health of the City of London—I received a sample order marked "G" from Mr. Alexander on 30th or 31st December last for the purpose of analysis—I went with Inspector Payne to the Custom House and got the sample myself from Bull Quay—I got it from the bags marked "HG"—I analysed that sample—it consisted almost entirely of sulphate of lime, plaster-of Paris—I ascertained by direct chemical microscopical examination that there was no organic substance of</p>

               <p>any kind, no farina—I also compared it microscopically with the appearance of the common plaster-of-Paris, which I got at a neighbouring builder's, and the result was as I have stated, that it consisted of sulphate of lime—I then obtained the ash by incineration, and found it was 78.6 per cent of the whole substance, the normal weight of the ash of flour being about 7-10ths or 8-10ths of 1 per cent.—it was entirely conclusive that it was not meal—I also checked that experiment by what is termed "Barker's test" a chloroform test—by that test, if there is any organic matter it floats at the top, if mineral it sinks to the bottom, leaving the supernatant fluid perfectly pure and clear and pellucid—in this case nothing floated, it sank to the bottom as if metallic—in addition to sulphate of lime there was a white earth, commonly called white clay—I had a small portion of stuff submitted to me by Mr. Alexander, which had been tried to be converted into bread, and it was nothing more than lumps of plastor-of-Paris—subsequently to that I obtained from the inspector two loaves made by a French baker, Mr. Gandais, of Dean Street, Soho—I also tested the plastic nature of the material by making with it an animal's head—there was flour or meal in the loaves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have not got the samples that I analysed here—on touching flour with your linger it is perfectly smooth; this was practically gritty, not quite gritty—I should not say that any one taking a portion of the bulk would directly find that it was not flour; I have said that the feel of it by the finger would almost determine that it was a mineral and not an organic matter; I will not unsay that, I wish to qualify it—Mr. Otto Hainer did not act with me in making the analysis; no one assisted with me; there was no check on my analysis that I know of—I checked every process by a subsequent test—Mr. Hainer is undoubtedly a perfectly scientific gentleman—I have not the pleasure of knowing Dr. Hassall—my attention has never been called to the sise used to stiffen paper—I know nothing of the export value of flour—I have not certified that a Mr. Chit<lb/>tenden sold 1 ton of this very mixture to paper-makers at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton; I know it now for the first time—I have not seen Mr. Buhler's books.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> An inexperienced person not in the habit of analysing or testing matter would not be able to say whether it was flour or not simply by the touch—two samples of a mixture like this from the same bulk would not differ very much as to the quantity of the component parts—they would to a certain extent—I made two previous analyses of this for Mr. Alexander, and the results were singularly conclusive, the difference being only one figure in the second place of decimals in the three analyses—I do not consider it quite pure plaster-of-Paris—if what was mixed with it was white clay, as I presume it was, it would be of less value than the plaster-of-Paris, and it would be worth less as a mixture.</p>

Arnati and Harrison and I obtained a release from them from Custom House Quay—I deposited that order at Custom House Quay, and paid all charges due on it up to that time—I submitted the sample of real flour which Buhler gave me to my buyers, and sold on that sample—as soon as the vessel arrived I passed my order to the buyers—they went down and examined it, and finding what it was they rejected it—they brought me up a sample, a bagful; I examined it, and quite agreed with them—I then wrote to Buhler, and afterwards went and saw him—I told him that the 100 bags of flour, or representing flour, wag nothing but a lot of ground chalk or plaster-of-Paris, that the sale had been repudiated in consequence, and I wished to have nothing more to do with it, and demanded back my charges—I took the sample that had been brought back by my customers and showed it to him, and left a part of it with him; that was on 26th August, the same day my buyer had refused it, within half an hour afterwards—he said that he himself had been deceived, that he knew nothing of it, that he had advanced, I think he said about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and that he should take proceedings against the party who had misrepresented the matter to him—he paid me my charges immediately—he did not at all dispute the fact of its being plaster-of-Paris or chalk; he did not seem to know anything more about it, he accepted my statement—I handed him this retransfer order (H) transferring the 100 sacks from myself to him—I saw him again I think about three week afterwards, at the Hop Exchange, I was in com<lb/>pany with Mr. Cohnhoff—I asked him how it was that he had made use of my order after I had told him what the stuff was in the sacks, in order to get an advance from Messrs. Barker and Co.; I expressed myself annoyed at his having done so—he replied "I have not done anything of the sort, if it has been done, it has been done by some one without my consent"—I then explained to him that I had seen Messrs. Barker and Co., at the invitation of Mr. Cohnhoff, their agent, and they had told me that an order had been presented to them with my name on it, asking for an advance on 100 bags of flour; that I asked who by, and they told me the order had been presented to them by a Mr. Natzler—Buhler then said "If Natzler has shown them a sample of pure flour, he has done it on his own responsibility"—I think the matter then virtually ended—he did not explain how the transfer order which I had given him got into Natzler's hands.</p>

Steitz and Co., I can highly recommend to you. He has some business to propose to you which may suit your bank. Yours faithfully, B. D. Buhler." I knew Buhler slightly previous to that—Steitz told me that he had been to his banker's, the Imperial Bank, with a view of getting an advance upon a quantity of flour, meal—he said "meal," and he showed me a delivery order that he had written in favour of the manager of the Imperial Bank, hat he was told that they did not advance on that class of securities, and he came to me with that letter of introduction to see if he could get the advance from my bank—I told him that the Anglo-Belgian Bank was not doing any business—it was just before the liquidation—he then told me that he was in some difficulty, having a bill to meet that day, that he had been disap<lb/>pointed in getting money in, and that the refusal of the Imperial Bank to make the advance had put him in some perplexity—after some little con<lb/>versation, as I felt rather sorry for him, I asked him what was the least amount he could do with to tide him over the difficulty—he first asked 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Steitz, Steitz and Co."—I must have mentioned Mr. Dale's name before this—I happened to have a circular of his on my desk which I had received some days before, and that suggested his name—Steitz asked me how long the examination would take—I said "I cannot tell, it will depend on Mr. Dale's engagements, but to expedite matters, as you seem to be in a hurry, you may take my letter authoris<lb/>ing Mr. Dale to make the examination, to Mr. Dale yourself"—he did not produce this transfer order (H)—I never saw it till I saw it at the Mansion House—I don't know that he produced any transfer order to me—he must have given Mr. Dale a sampling order—he did not give me a document that day describing the stuff as meal—he came next day, Mr. Fowler was present during part of the interview—I can't tell whether he saw the word "meal" here—during the conversation Mr. Fowler said "Why is this described as meal?"—that was on the first day—Steitz said, "Those people on the other side are probably un<lb/>acquainted with English, and they use the word meal because the German word stands for meal, or flour"—I asked him on the first occasion what bis business was—he said he was a wholesale toy merchant—I asked how he became possessed of this meal—he said it had been deposited with him by a person who was a debtor to him, and he had the depositor's authority to raise money on it—I said "Why does not the debtor sell this and pay you?"—he shrugged his shoulders, and made a gesture—I did not ask him who the depositor was—he did not say whether it was Buhler or no—he came twice next day—I saw Mr. Dale before he came the second time—the first time he asked if I had received Mr. Dale's report—I said I had not, and he went away—when he came again I agreed to advance him the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he signed this agreement, and gave me this delivery order (H), and I gave him a cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which he gave me a promissory note—the condition of the agreement was that the money was to be repaid on 28th December, and in default of payment I should be at liberty to sell the security—Mr. Dale's report was verbal—subsequently Steitz came and gave me permission to sell at once—I gave Mr. Blaisher, a commission agent, an order to take out a sack in the name of Mr. Gandais, and he afterwards brought me some specimens of bread that had been made—I don't remember the date—I then called on Steitz and asked him for an explanation—I cannot fix the date of that; I should say it was about eighteen or twenty days after I had made the advance—I called several times with<lb/>out being able to see him—when I did see him I was very angry, and 1 used some very strong language—I produced the samples to him and said, "It is an atrocious swindle; who is behind you in this matter?"—he</p>

               <p>declined to say; he quibbled a little and said that he would see his friend George Lewis before he gave up the name of the parties from whom he got the flour—I said, "Is Mr. Buhler in this matter?"—he fenced with the * question; he did not answer it—he said that he had not long been in England, and he would see his friend George Lewis and be guided by his advice—I said, "Do so, by all means"—he afterwards came to me at Putney, 1 was confined at home by indisposition—he said he had seen Mr. Lewis, who had told him to give up the name of the gentleman from whom he had this stuff, and that it was Mr. Buhler—he came to me again with a solicitor's clerk and offered me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount of the advance, which I declined to take—on January 2nd I saw Buhler at his office,; before that I had reported the matter to Dr. Saunders—I went to him with a specimen—I had had his report when Steitz came and offered me the money, and before I saw Buhler—I wrote to Buhler before Christmas, and he replied that he was going out of town, and would not be back till the beginning of January—when I saw him I said that I had waited till then because I wanted to hear hit ex<lb/>planation, as I conceived the matter was a swindle or worse—at first he said he knew nothing about it, and then he said that he had never authorised Steitz to come and offer the stuff to me—I believe he said that he intended Steitz to produce some bills to the bank for discount; that Steitz had applied to him for a loan which he was not in a position to make, but having this stuff there he had given it him with liberty to raise money on it, instead of advancing cask, but the object of his introduction to me was with a view of the bank discounting some bills—I did not ask him how the meal got into his hands; he showed me a bill of Jackson's; he said that he had himself been deceived, and he showed me a day-book referring to some sales, and so forth—he also showed me this agreement, signed on 11th December, between Steitz and himself for the division of the proceeds of the sale of this stuff; I am not sure whether the asterisk and the foot-note were there at the time. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Mr. B. D. Buhler. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your order on Custom House Quay for 80 bags, supposed to be meal (<hi rend="italic">a mixture</hi>), which I received in trust for sale for you, and shall render you cash account directly after the sale.") Buhler said "As I could not sell it myself I thought somebody else might"—he was very indignant with Steitz, and said he was disposed to take proceedings against him for abusing his name and his introduction—he said, "I am not going to pay this money"—, I stopped him and said, "Don't talk to me about paying; because I have not spoken about it, and I am not going to allow you to talk to me on the subject, inas much as I have taken steps to bring the parties to justice, and I only wanted to see you to give you a chance of giving an explanation"—I then turned my back on him and walked out—I think I know Buhler's writing; I believe this to be hist (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "August 26, 1878. From Buhler to Messrs. M. Jackson and Co. I have inspected the flour for which I advanced you 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and find the sample you submitted to me is entirely different from the bulk; indeed, the latter is no flour at all, but plaster-of-Paris.

I am keeper to Mr. Robert William Webb, Lord of the Manor of Witley, in the county of Surrey—on 9th March I saw some fires burning on the common—I went to find a friend, Mr. Budd—I went in front of the Red Lion public-house, about 10 o'clock; I saw Alan Mitchell there, and heard him use the expression that he would burn the b——common out—I then went and concealed myself a little distance from the Hammer Ponds, about half a mile from the public-house—I saw the fires burning from the direction of the public-house all along the road—I saw the prisoner and two other men, Keen and Elwyn, coming along the road towards the Hammer Ponds; they came close to where I was watching—I heard Keen say, "Don't do it, Alan, you are a fool if you do, there is some one watching?"—the prisoner then stepped back in the road for a few seconds, he then came towards the bushes, a little above where he was the first time, and I moved from the place where I was watching close where he came across, and I distinctly saw him take the matches from his clothes, light them, and put them into the bushes, and light the bushes in several different places—I was a little over two yards from him at the time, not three yards—the common was burning in six or seven different places at that time—I said to him," Alan, what are you doing this for? are you not right now?"—he did not make any reply—I told him he would hear of it—Keen came up at the time and said, "If we put it out, I suppose that will do?"</p>

               <p>a fire burning before ten against the Red Lion—I saw several men outside the Bed Lion at the time I saw the prisoner; it was about closing time—they close at ten, that made me think it was about ten, as the land<lb/>lord was closing his house—several of the men who came out of the Red Lion came down the road, but they were not down where I saw the fire; there was Keen and Elwyn and the prisoner, them three—I saw Keen a little distance from the Red Lion—I saw several men down the road, I don't know whether they had been in the Red Lion or not—it was about 11 o'clock when I saw the prisoner light the furze—the night was very moonlight, and the fires round were nearly as bright as day; there were over 7 or 8 fires burning between 10 and 11 o'clock—at the time I saw him there there were 6 or 7 fires buring in different places, most of them alight at the side of the road—Budd was with me during the time I saw the prisoner, but he was not so close as I was quite when I saw him—I was a little more than two yards from him when I saw him set it on fire—I cannot say exactly how far Budd was from me; several yards, four or five, or five or six when we were concealed in the furze—I was concealed close to the road, close to the bank at the side of the road, when the prisoner came first I was not a yard from him—I know one bush that he set on fire, and was scorched and put out—it was about 8 feet from the road where he set it on fire; not so far where it was put out—a man walking along the high road would be about 8 feet from where he set it on fire—where the fire burnt to was not so far as where he set it on fire, because it burnt down the bank towards the road, where they put it out—I have resided at Thursley all my life—I only know two men there called Alan—I have hoard of a madman who is called Alan, but he was not there at the time—it is not a very common name in that part of the county.</p>

                  </hi>. 1 am a labourer living at Thursley—on Sunday evening, 9th March, I was at the lied Lion—at closing time a number of men went out; there might have been dozens or. fifty down the road looking at the fire—when we came out I saw some fires on the common—I went down the road; there were six or seven of us—there waft me and Keen, the prisoner, Robert Walker, Bill Carter, and Hughy Mitchell, a nephew of the prisoner—we went down the road nearly as far as the Hammer Ponds—when we got there we turned round to come back again, only we waited for the prisoner, me and Keen did; we did not get quite so far as the Ponds—the others turned round before us three—Keen and the prisoner and I were together, all close—the prisoner was close to us when we waited for him, three or four yards off; it might be more; not behind us—we went three or four yards farther than him; we were below him, lower down the hill; we waited for him because he was making water—he did not go into the furze; he never went out of the road; he was standing in the road when he did it—I never saw him light a match—I was in his company all the evening—I could not say whether he was smoking or not—the others had gone back—we saw one come out into the road and go back into the bushes again, and we said most likely he set it alight—we then turned round; we did not want to go any lower; we went up the road again in the direction of the Red Lion—I live about a stone's throw from the prisoner—we went home—I can't say that I saw Lillywhite; I heard him; I could swear to him by his voice—I heard him say, "All right, Alan, that is good enough; that will do"—when he said that he came out into the turnpike road talking to the prisoner, but he never saw his face at all when he was out in the road; his back was to him—there is a cross road just where this happened, and he seemingly came out of that road; it comes up close to the Pond, and he went back that way too—you could cut off the corner there by going through the furze—I did not hear Keen say to the prisoner, "Alan, don't do it; you are a tool if you do; there is somebody watching"—I must have heard him if he said so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and Keen and I walked down the road to<lb/>gether from the Red Lion—we were close to the prisoner when he was making water, we never left him, we were three or four yards in front of him; I turned round and saw him—I can swear we were not so yards ahead of him—I was not called before the Magistrates at Guildford, this is the first time I have been examined in this matter—it was not in our direc<lb/>tion home to go down to the Hammer Ponds, we walked down to see the fire—I did not light any of the fires, most decidedly not; I can answer for myself and I did not see tho rest.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I attended Mr. Ernest Day on 4th March—the upper portion of the left ear was cut right across to the extent in depth of about half or three-quarters of an inch, and was smashed entirely off; it could not be found; we searched for it; the head was cut into down to the skull-bone to the extent of about three inches—this brick was shown to me at the time; it had blood on it; it was a very hard brick, and the cut was exactly the kind of cut as would have arisen from a blow with such a weapon—it must have been a very violent blow, but from the ear inter<lb/>posing the force of the blow, if that had not acted as a buffer in stopping the force of the blow, he would have been either paralysed or killed—he still suffers pain—he is permanently disfigured—he had to keep in one position for some days—when he attempted to lie down for two or three weeks he had such intense pain in the head I was afraid he would have abscesses there—it was a very serious injury; he was in danger of his life for a consider<lb/>able time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the Monday night I was very grossly insulted in the governor's place. I had been at work going on four years there, and never had any quarrels. I have been a quiet, hard-working man. It was Mr. Ernest's fault that this row was caused between us; if he had not insulted me on the Monday night this would not have happened. I did not intend to inflict such punishment on him as I have done.</p>

I was with Inspector Fox and Sergeant Walsh in the Old Kent Road on February 18th, about 6.30 p.m., and I saw the prisoner hail a cab On the rank—he got into it and drove off—in consequence of what Inspector Walsh said to me I followed the cab about half a mile to a railway arch in Old Kent Road, where it pulled up in front of a public-house—I kept watch, and when the prisoner left the cab I followed him—Fox and Walsh then came up, and we walked down the road until we lost sight of the prisoner—I went about a mile farther on, and saw him outside the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, at New Cross—I continued to follow him—he then went back up the Old Kent Road as far as the first railway arch and turned down a turning, where I lost sight of him—I went back to Walsh—I saw him next about 9.30, standing at the corner of Shanton Street—Inspector Fox was behind me coming up—the prisoner then turned up Shanton Street—Walsh went after him and I followed Walsh—when I got up Walsh and Fox had him in custody, and I assisted in taking him to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). I was with Fox and Harvey on Feb. 18th, and saw the prisoner in a cab about 6.30 p.m.—I knew him by sight, and continued following him till 9.30, when I saw him at the corner of Shenton Street, where he stood and looked at me, and then ran up the street—I was the first to follow him up, and saw him run to a van about 30 yards up the street and throw something into it—he then turned back, and I caught him about 6 or 7 yards from the van—Inspector Fox came up at the moment—I fetched a lamp and searched as I thought I heard something fall—after searching the road I went to the van and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, then wrapped up in a piece of paper—I was at the station when he was searched, and saw the paper compared with this other piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the police-court—the other two officers heard me give my evidence—Mr. Bonman defended the prisoner, and asked that the witnesses should leave the Court, and the Magistrate said, "No, I order the witnesses to stay in Court"—I do not think I said before the Magistrate that I saw the prisoner look towards me and run up the street—I cannot remember—there is a corn chandler's shop at the corner of Shenton Street, which is a blind street, and the van was about 30 yards from the corner—I did not inquire who the van belonged to—I found this in the van—it is a hammer and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I recovered about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property at Colchester by a similar thing—it could be used for ordinary purposes—there were no horses to the van—I was opposite him about 15 yards away at the corner opposite the shop when he went to the van—I crossed the street and ran after him—he put something in the van—I might be 10 yards or more from him then—he was coming back again when I caught him about 6 or 7 yards from the van—it was an ordinary night—I could see by the gas lamp at the corner near the shop—the gas is 30 yards away and would not enable me to see to the van—I put him against the wall and held him—Sergeant Harvey came up, and I handed the prisoner over to him—we got a lamp from the cornchandler's shop, and Inspector Fox and I went to the van, and I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> rolled up in a bit of paper about three or four feet in the van from behind—the tail of the van was down—I could not swear which part of the paper was on the jemmy—before searching the van I searched near the shop and along the gutter—the prisoner wanted us to take him away to the station at once—while searching the road I said, "I thought I heard some keys thrown away"—I went to look for them first—I did not search the van first; it did not strike me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have had much experience in these cages, and have seen many burglarious instruments, and have known premises broken into by similar instruments to this—I stopped him, and Fox came up and we searched—the whole thing took two or three minutes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector M</hi>). On the night of 18th February I was with Harvey and Fox* at the south end of Old Kent Road—in consequence of information I gave directions to Harvey—I have known the prisoner some time—about 9.30 p.m. I saw the prisoner at the corner, of Shenton Street—he stood for a second and then darted quickly round</p>

               <p>up the street—I ran to the corner of the street and met him coming back, walking quickly down Shenton Street to the Old Kent Road—I got there at the same moment as Walsh—Walsh caught him by the shoulder at the same moment as I did—I said "Harry, what do you do here at this time?"—he said "What is that to do with you?"—I began to feel his clothing—he said "If you want to search me take me to the station"—he said repeatedly "Take me to the station"—Walsh got a lantern and searched—Harvey was there—I saw Walsh take this instrument out from the van rolled up in paper, he handed it to me and we went to the station and the prisoner was searched there—he took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and spread it on the floor, and amongst the things taken from his pocket was this part of a <hi rend="italic">Western Morning News</hi>—I compared it with the piece wrapped round the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and it fits word for word and letter for letter—I asked his name—he said "William Wilson, I am a sailor, but I refuse to give you any address"—there was also found upon him four keys, a watch, and a ring—this instrument can be bought in the shops, but it is used by burglars—in the last case I was engaged in a similar instrument was used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The instrument was wrapped in the centre, but hardly covered—I caught him about 10 yards from the shop—Walsh got a lantern and searched in the road—I first heard him say at the police station that he saw something put into the van—Walsh looked in the van and said, "Here it is"—the van belonged to a timber yard adjoining—I did not think it necessary to see the owner of the van—if I found it belonged to him I should not have considered it an instrument of burglary, but if I found a man loitering about I should—I was present when the paper was taken out of the prisoner's pocket—he took it out himself—he spread this hand<lb/>kerchief on the floor and threw everything into it—these are the latch<lb/>keys—they are not burglarious instruments—they might be used as such.</p>
