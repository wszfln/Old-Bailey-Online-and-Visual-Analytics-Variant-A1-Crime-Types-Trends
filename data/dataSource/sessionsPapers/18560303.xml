                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Ellwood, as wine merchants—we have carried on business in Gresham-street about fourteen years—in May, 1850, the prisoner came into our employment, as town traveller—it was his duty to pay money to Mr. Ellwood, or myself on the day he received it, or on the following morning—he travelled for us exclusively, among publicans and licensed victuallers—his salary at first was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and his expenses—if he went into a public house he would have to spend money, it is customary to take a bottle of wine afterwards with the landlord when he received an account—the expenses were paid by us; sometimes I paid him, but, generally speaking, Mr. Ellwood—I have seen Mr. Ellwood pay it—he, from time to time, demanded his expenses, and received them—there were separate books kept of the trade he did, they are here—there is a journal and ledger—he had collecting books of this kind (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for each customer, and when he received money it was his duty to enter it here, and pay it to the firm—on 2nd April last he did not pay me 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., received of James Abbott, or at any other time; nor did he pay me, on 3rd July, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Alfred Grace, or at any subsequent time; nor 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Henry Flint, on 28th Aug.—he remained in our service during 1853, and down to Aug., 1855, when he left without giving us any notice—in the middle of 1853, or thereabouts, a discovery was made of defalcations of the prisoner to the amount of 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I found that many accounts of highly respectable persons were very much over due, and asked the prisoner several times to account for their not being paid—whenever I applied to him for money, he invariably absented himself—I said to him, "You must have taken some of these moneys; but if you will go through the ledger with me, and not keep one item back, I will forgive you"—he did so, and the result was 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd de<lb/>ficient—that sum was treated by us as a debt owing by him—he gave us no notice when he left—we did not dismiss him—after he left, we made inquiries and discovered these three sums—in 1863 we made a fresh arrangement with the prisoner as to his salary, and paid him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month, including his expenses—I do not remember the month, but it was directly after this transaction of the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he agreed to serve us on those terms, and to pay his own expenses.</p>

               <p>expenses book, which is here; that was also kept by the prisoner, and pur<lb/>ported to represent the expenses he had been put to—there was also a book kept by my partner, which the prisoner knew nothing of, nor did I know that it was in existence myself till some time ago; it was merely the profit of each transaction, not the profit and loss—there is also the order book—I am not aware of any other book applicable to this branch of our business—Mr. Ellwood kept the journal and ledger—the ledger is made up from the journal, there is no separate cash book, the cash account would appear in the book of our general business—in making the fresh arrangement with the prisoner that he was to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month and his expenses, we considered that the expenses depended on the amount of business done, they would have relation to the work he would have to do—his carriage and all out of door expenses were paid by us—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his expenses book—after the disclosure of the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the new arrangement took place; Mr. Ellwood can tell you about that—the prisoner was to have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the beginning, and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the month—the books will show how far back that has been paid—he continued on those terms till Aug., when he left without leave—I wrote to him to come back to business, because I ascertained that there were further defalcations; he did not come on the day I appointed, but came I cannot recollect whether it was the day after, it was a subse<lb/>quent day—I was then acquainted with the defalcations—that was in Aug or the beginning of Sept.—I did not desire him to come back and go on with his work, he requested me to take him back, but I said that after a second time I could not think of it—my son had not joined us in the mean<lb/>while, he joined us about two years since, not as partner, but as our clerk—he had been on one or two occasions with the prisoner to assist him, and had introduced him to the customers, twelve months ago—I afterwards sent my son round to the customers to ascertain matters—he would have to take orders—after Aug. the prisoner sent twice to us to demand an account—I cannot tell you when that was, it was not in Sept.—to the best of my belief it was three months afterwards—he sent for a debtor and creditor account, and I told the party that there was no account, as it all lay on one side—it was a cousin of his—I said, "We have no secrete to keep from you, we are very busy, but if you will come in some other day, Mr. Ellwood will make out the account; it is not usual for a person to come in and get an account of a year's standing, in a minute"—he afterwards called again—I not know whether he called twice or three times—Mr. Rumble was the person who called—my partner at last copied down on a piece of paper the amount which we had made, it was not an account—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the account which was furnished by my partner; I cannot tell you when it was given, I cannot charge my memory, there is no entry made in any book, or anything of that sort—Mr. Ellwood gave that account with my full sanction, we had no reason for keeping it back—it was given to Josiah Rumble, he called certainly on two occasions—I do not recollect his saying anything about a letter, he said that he came from Mr. Keymer, and did not intend to justify him in anything he had done, but wanted to know how we stood—I did not tell him that we had been advised by our solicitor not to render an account; I did not mention our solicitor at all—I did not say, "You do not want to prove a partnership?"—I swear I never men<lb/>tioned the word "partnership" to Mr. Rumble—this is a copy of the account, the heading of this document is "profits," and then the years follow—the aggregate is 3,407<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the six years, 1850-1-2-3-4 and 5—there is an item of bad debts 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that reduces it to 3,036<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it</p>

               <p>the concern—the amount received was 2,523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to have been 162<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deducted from the 2,523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was an error, it ought to have been added to it—it was discovered at the moment—we saw it the moment that Rumble had left—it speaks for itself—we should not deduct expenses, it ought to have been added—it had nothing to do with the money which the prisoner was out of pocket—he had always had his expenses deducted—if he had not bad it, he would have to deduct it—somehow or other, I deducted the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of adding it—we did not immediately send after Mr. Bumble, and explain it—we did not know where to send to him—we did not think this piece of paper of any moment at all, it was merely to satisfy his mind that nothing was coming to him—I swear that this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. meant the house expenses—this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added since—this "expenses at home, not entered" is not my writing—it was not entered upon this piece of paper when Rumble took it from our house—I did not say just now that I noticed it in the original document the moment Rumble had gone away—I do not believe the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was entered at the time—it was not entered on my own account—I wrote down at the time, "expenses at home not entered," and that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added since—it is not my writing—I cannot tell that it has been put down since—I firmly believe it was not down when Rumble took it away—I will not swear it—I am perfectly satisfied that this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added since—it was not upon our original document at the time it was given to Rumble—to the best of my belief, that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not entered down until after Rumble left, but Mr. Ellwood will tell you more particularly if you will rot the question to him—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not either added or deducted on this piece of paper—I stated just now that after Rumble was gone, I told Mr. Ellwood it ought to have been added instead of subtracted—I told you on the first onset that I was not quite clear about it—it must have been entered—it appears that it was put down while Rumble was there—I swore just now that it was done after he was gone, because I believed it at the moment—it appears that I was in error, but not intentionally so—having subtracted the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the result was 2,023<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not 2,023<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against the prisoner, and 1,518<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—the halving was done at the impulse of the moment, suiting the action to the word—in consequence of Rumble asking me if there was not a commission due to Keymer upon the transactions dome, I said, "No, no commission was agreed to be allowed him, and even if I gave him half (now this was suiting the action to the word) it would run away with all the profits made"—that was merely to show him that nothing was coming to him—I said, "Supposing I were to give him half, there would be 1,518<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., don't you see that?"—I meant that he had already had a great deal more than he ought, that we had claims against him more than that amount, even if I allowed him half—I put that down before Rumble, in pencil—I am sure this is mine, the rest is in Mr. Ellwood's writing—we were both in the room together—the half is mine—that would make him debtor to us 505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Rumble did not suggest that something should be put down for expenses, except his own expenses that we had already paid him—he asked if there was not something coming to him in the shape of expenses—I said he had already had it—the expenses are all included in the money that he had drawn—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was expenses at home in our cellar—we reckoned those expenses by ascertaining it at so much a week, according to the business done—that was a rough guess, and I think it is under the mark—you frequently open six or seven bottles of wine to one party—I did not mean to charge him with that, bat we took it into</p>

               <p>account in ascertaining whether his business answered our purpose—that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was subtracted by accident instead of being added—there are no home expenses charged anywhere else in the account, which proves that it had been deducted in error—on my own memorandum it was put down "expenses not entered"—the expenses must have been put down instantly afterwards—perhaps Mr. Ellwood may be able to enlighten you whether anything was said, and we put it down, but I could not have made that memorandum there at the time unless it was so at the moment—it might have been added two or three minutes afterwards perhaps—1,563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is put down here as cash paid, not drawn—I mean it was cash paid in reality—it is the same thing—it is written down on this paper "cash drawn"—I do not know who has altered it—it has not been in my possession—I do not know whether it has been in our solicitor's possession or in Mr. Ellwood's—it has not been in the prisoner's hands, or altered by him—I cannot tell who altered it—it is not my writing—I do not know whose it is—I do not think it is Mr. Ellwood's—will you allow me to show it to my solicitor, and ask him if it is his writing—it is neither Mr. Ell wood's or mine—I do not see whose else's it can be but my own solicitor's—it is not my son's—you must ask Mr. Ellwood if it is his—I believe it is not his—it does not look like it, but I am not positive—I have not had any conversation about the alteration—it is cash paid in reality—I do not know whether I have any entries in our books which bring the cash drawn to more than 922<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I do not know that account so well as Mr. Ellwood—I have not looked through the books for that very purpose—I do not know that I can explain it—I have not examined the books to explain it—Mr. Ellwood kept them—I have not examined them since then, with Mr. Ellwood—I have not had a talk with Mr. Ellwood about it—I have not had any talk with Mr. Ellwood on the subject—Keymer did not come to Mr. Fesenmeyer's office, and go through the books with me—I am not aware that he went through the books with Mr. Fesenmeyer in my presence—I do not know the amount of cash drawn, therefore I cannot swear anything about it—I know neither one way or the other—I cannot say whether the interview with Mr. Bumble was on 11th Dec.—the prisoner did not threaten to bring an action against me before I took any step against him or applied for a summons—he did threaten to bring an action—we had a letter from his attorney—it was after we had made a charge against him—I mean to swear that it was after—I applied for a summons before I received the attorney's letter, and before I knew it had been sent—I applied for a detective officer—I gave him into custody for embezzlement—I cannot remember on what day—I did not make a memorandum of it—it was before I had received the attorney's letter—I swear that—I am speaking of when I gave instructions to take him into custody—I applied for a detective officer before, and I went that very evening to try to take him into custody—we could not meet with him—I received the letter on the 18th, and gave him into custody on the night of the 20th—I have no doubt that the reason of the sending of that letter was because I was prosecuting him.</p>

Q.</hi> You made out that account, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Part of it is my writing, the top part—the figures 1518, the half of the 3000 is not my writing—I do not know when that was written—I did not see it written—I think it is Mr. Chambers's writing—I do not know when it was written, but I expect at the time I gave the paper to Mr. Rumble—the three or four lines at the bottom are not in my writing; the 2,223<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is not mine, nor the 1855, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor the 2,523<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor "the expenses per an<lb/>num, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I made out that account by the desire of Mr. Chambers, a minute or two before it was delivered to Rumble; it was a hurried thing, while he was waiting there; I made it out from sundry books that I had—I believe those books are in Court, and one was a small memorandum book that I kept on my own account in my own desk—the prisoner did not know that I kept that—this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the bottom was not included in the profits in any way—I believe that meant the debts that the prisoner had received which we had not quite put together—it was not put down exactly in the game position as the 472<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we considered that done with and forgiven—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. meant accounts received and not accounted for between 1853 and 1855; it turns out to be 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something of that sort—I cannot say when this "expenses per annum, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." was put down—I first saw it on this paper in the Court—I did not see this paper again until you had it before the Magistrate—I believe Mr. Chambers spot it down, saying, that the expenses incurred by the customers coming into the cellar and tasting, might amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard him say that, or something to that effect—that was while Rumble was there—I do not remember that Mr. Chambers said anything about it after Rumble was gone—I thought nothing more of it after Rumble was gone—I am quite sure nothing was said about it after Rumble was gone—I kept the journal—the monies received would not be entered in the journal, but in the cash book—the prisoner could see that cash book, he never made any entries in it—it is the cash book applicable to the whole of the business—I entered it from what he said—if he had brought the money in and said, "There is Mr. Grace's 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I should have entered it down 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there would be no document to show—that was the way in which we allowed the business to be done—I should see whether the accounts balanced when I posted them into the ledger—I took what he said, and put it down on that—I relied on his memory and accuracy—he did not often give me the accounts of several days together at one time, very seldom; it might have occurred, perhaps, the second day—he was to be allowed certain expenses—there was no stated amount of expenses—I think the cash book will show (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>) the first entry is on 1st July, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came into onr service at some time in May, but not fully to com<lb/>mence business—his salary was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this amount in July, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for expenses—up to that time he would pay his expenses with his own money, and he would charge it at the end of the month—if he had none, and wanted some to pay his expenses, he would have asked for it and had it—he does not appear to have done so—the next payment is on 1st Aug. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is salary, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. expenses; the next is 31st Aug., 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary, expenses 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next is on 1st Oct., "Charges, Mr. Keymer, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that is in the cash book, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that is for expenses—it is not put down as part wages, and part expenses—these entries were made in the cash book at the time the money was paid him—I am sure</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030010"/>
               <p>about that—someof the entries are in my writing, and some in Mr. Cham<lb/>bers's—the expenses he had incurred were down in a book at that time—that book is here—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the expense book—it if in the pri<lb/>soners writing—the amount was taken from that—the last entry in this book is on May 29, 1851—the expenses are not entered separately in the cash book after that time—here is an entry, on 26th Dec., 1851, that indicates the expenses that were paid—I did not say that the expenses were entered from 1850 to 1853, I said not separately—the whole amount of his salary is entered together at the end of the year—the entry on 26th Dec., 1851, is 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is under the date of 26th Dec., 1851—his wages and expenses were included in that amount, I have not got the particulars of how they were paid, it was all put down in one lump at the end of the year—it stands in our books in this way, "Charges, to Henry Chambers," salary, so much—and underneath that is "Ditto, G. S. Keymer, to 31st Dec., 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that applies to the salary as well—Henry Chambers is a clerk, and is also the son of my partner—salaries are put under "Charges," because we post them to "Charges"—we have no account called "Salary," they are both posted to charges—this "190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is my writing, I do not know when those figures were put in—they are not written on an erasure, there is no erasure there—the folio referred to in the ledger is No. 154—this sum of 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid at various times between May and Dec.—I have no check now as to when it was paid, the amounts are on slips of paper, and when it is entered there we consider that they are done with, and the papers are destroyed; they are only little slips, and memorandums—I kept them till Dec., and then entered the total—none of those are left, but I have some since—they were memorandums of cash that he had asked for, and had—I cannot point out any single occasion when he had cash before that date, but he asked for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—I do not know that he saw me make this entry, I made it at the time—I mean to say that it was made at the same time that the name, "Keymer," was put down; on the same day that this "Henry Chambers" was put down, at least, I think so; but the "Henry Chambers" appears to be in different ink to the other—I do not know how near to that time they were entered—I swear they were entered long before a year afterwards, and long before six months afterwards—I swear, positively, that this entry was written within twelve months of the time it bears date, and, I have no doubt that it was entered near the time—I believe the other entries were made at the same time, at least four are all entered together in the same writing—the entries are all in my writing, except one or two at the top.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Point out to the Jury any other payment made to the prisoner after Dec., 1851? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 31st Dec., 1852, here is 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I have no vouchers for that—I have destroyed all the vouchers—this 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes the year's wages—salary is entered here as "Charges"—this is in rather different ink to the other, but it is in a different writing—the entries below are in Mr. Chambers' writing, and those below are mine—mine were all entered at the same time—I entered this, "W. M. Chambers, 374<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."; but this, "Ditto, ditto "is not my writing, I began at "G. S. Keymer"—I mean to swear that I entered this "Chambers" on the same day—I cannot give you a single voucher to show you that he has received a single farthing of this money, but I have got some later ones—at the beginning of 1853, the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month commenced; no, it was towards the end of 1853—the first entry, between Dec., 1852, and the period of the new arrangement which was to be made, is "31st Jan., charges, G. S. Keymer, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and it follows "Henry Cham<lb/>bers,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say in your account, "Cash drawn, 1,563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," can you show me any entries in that book to make the amount of cash paid to him, during the whole time he was in your employment a larger sum than 922<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I took it from the books at the time, it may not be exactly correct, but that is the figure—in 1850 to 1851 here is 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; April to Dec., 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Jan. to Dec., 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and then there are seven items, amounting, in the whole, to 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but I can give it better by this little red book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which I kept the entries—here is "Jan. 24th, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; then Feb. 23rd, March 22nd, April 16th, and May 10th to July 21st, 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Aug. 4th, cash 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 16th, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (the 16th is after the 17th); Sept 6th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—from Aug. to Nov. 3rd I make it 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and there is an entry of small sums, amounting to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., down to Dec.—I do not see any more money that year that I paid him to make it 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., instead of 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as you put it—I should think there was more, but it might be entered directly here without going into the red book—he might have had more—I do not mean that I deliberately left, anything out, if I have, it has not been done with any intention one way or the other—it is not an irregularity—though I kept this book to enter the amounts in, they might not appear—I have not taken the trouble to examine the books—the particulars were not all entered at one time, they were all copied out and made one entry, but they were entered at different dates, as he had the money—I swear that they were all entered on the same day as they were paid—they were not extracts from the little memo<lb/>randum book that I have spoken of, they were entered at the time—some<lb/>times he gave me memorandums, and sometimes I wrote the slips of paper myself—I made up the books from nothing, I entered the money at the time it was paid—he asked for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and entered it—some of the slips of paper were before, and some afterwards—there were none of this year at the time these were in existence—I told the Jury that some<lb/>times I wrote them, and sometimes he wrote them; that did not allude to these entries, but to previous ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be good enough to refer to the year 1854; my figures altogether, down to Aug., when the prisoner left, are 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; can you make it any more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, which I have inserted, or it would be 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the red book does not contain all the payments—there was a trifle over in 1854—this is for three months—I also paid him, on 17th April, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 6th May, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(that is not included in the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was afterwards—I am sure of that)—15th May, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12th June, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 31st Dec., 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that made the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for the remainder of the year—the 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was entered about that time, I swear that—it was entered from memorandums—I put it all in a mass, 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amounts were entered on a strip of paper, which is not now in existence—I mean to pledge my oath that Mr. Keymer received 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash from us at various times—he did not have it regularly, he had, perhaps, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 6., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not got my papers to show that—I mean to say that those small sums amounted exactly to 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I summed them up about that time, and destroyed the paper—I did not know that I should be asked for it—I have no memorandums in my red book to show those payments.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As regards the 1,563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., where did you get it from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I copied the amounts from the various entries in the book—that is the amount which Keymer had in cash; there may be a trifling error, for it was done in a hurry—I gave it to Rumble, because he came and asked Mr. Chambers—he said, "Mr. Keymer wants an account of what he has had"—Mr. Chambers said, "Can you give Mr. Rumble an account?"—I said, "I will do it"—Mr. Rumble called again in a week, and I had not got it done—I referred to my books in a hurry, and took that out, to show that during the five years Keymer was with us, we had had no profit—the me<lb/>morandum book was a private one which I kept for my own purposes—I did not enter into any agreement with the prisoner for him to have half the profits, and to pay us all the bad debts—I never heard such a thing before his apprehension—I had not gone carefully through the books at the time I made that item of 1,563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., up—I ran through them at the time while he was waiting—it was all done while Rumble was there—this sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the account for expenses, is what we considered to be the expense of wine drunk by customers tasting it in the cellars, and we put it down at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that sum is deducted on this paper, and it ought to have been added as expenses against the profit account—it is merely to show that during the five years we had never made a penny by him—the prisoner agreed to the alteration of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including his expenses—at the time he took the first 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he did not demand anything on account of arrears of salary—he has never made any claim for expenses incurred by him—this "1855, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is in Mr. Chambers writing, and the summing up also, and I think this "paid" is his, but it is not his usual style of writing—it was done in a hurry—when Rumble came, I was engaged on other busi<lb/>ness, and Mr. Chambers referred to me—I have seen Rumble here to-day—I have a few more months of these vouchers—I kept them in the cash book until it was made up—my book goes down to the close of 1854, where a sum of 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is mentioned—that is made up in sundry small sums from memorandums like these—the prisoner never claimed anything for</p>

               <p>arrears after the entry of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never heard of a claim for salary till to-day—Mr. Keymer has asked me sometimes, "How does my salary stand? and I have said, "You are paid up to the end of March or Feb.," whichever it may be, and he has said, "I do not know, because I trust you, your word is sufficient"—I have some more of the memorandums (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have from time to time paid the prisoner his alary in the regular way, and since he left I have never received from him any claim for salary.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 258, Blackfriars-road. On 5th May, 1855, John Sturt was introduced to me by a person named Allen, to borrow some money, and I advanced from 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the security proposed was an assignment of a bill of sale given to him by Miss Le Brice on the furniture in the house, No. 60, Upper Norton-street, Portland-road—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was offered to me by Sturt, who had it in his possession, and Charles Dowsett, who was always present—I then went with Sturt, Charles Dowsett, and Mr. Allen, who had intro<lb/>duced them, to No. 60, Upper Norton-street, to look at the furniture, and after seeing it and the bill of sale, I advanced the money—Sturt said at the same interview that he was the owner of No. 65 as well as No. 60, that he had bought the house, and held it at a ground rent—I lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that representation, temporarily, on No. 65, and on this bill of sale I made it up to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the assignment of this bill of sale—I advanced the money because I thought the furniture was well worth it—I should not have done so if I had believed that it belonged to some<lb/>body else—if he had not told me that he held No. 65 at a ground rent, and that it was his house, I would not have advanced it even then—he gave me a note of hand for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time, for security for the same advance—at the time I advanced the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believed that the furniture belonged to John Sturt—if I had not, I would not have advanced it—before I paid the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I saw Mrs. Sturt and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett, but I do not recollect seeing Hart—Mrs. Sturt said that the furniture was her husband's, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett said that it was Sturts—six or seven days elapsed between the time when I was first asked for the money and the time when I advanced the second 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and during that time I went once or twice to No. 60, Upper Norton-street, and I also went to No. 65—I found Miss Le Brice living at No. 60, and the defendants lived at No. 60, all except Hart—I did not advance other moneys on the property in No. 65—the advances were not upon the property, they were upon bills of exchange and I O U's—there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture of No. 60, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture at No. 65, and up to 28th July it got to over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the I O U's—on 28th July I received this bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), executed from John Sturt to myself—it covers 191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the security I received on it was still the furniture at No. 60, Upper Norton-street—before I received that bill of sale I had seen Hart with the other defendants—I used to go to No. 65 occasionally, and Hart was there—I do not think he had said anything about the furniture at No. 60 before I received this bill of sale—I do not think he said anything particular about it at any time, but he has been present when the others have spoken about it—he has assured me that I should get my money if I waited—he was more than once present with all of them when the ownership was talked of—the</p>

               <p>amount beyond the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced in various small sums—I saw all the defendants on many occasions while this money was being advanced—Charles Dowsett at one time told me that he lived with his mother, at No. 5, Macclesfield-street—Sturt was present, and must have known that—I can pledge my oath that he was present, by a bill of exchange which I have—I remember it by the circumstance of a bill of exchange which they came for me to cash—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I lent some money on it on that occasion—the execution of the bill of sale to me is dated 21st May, and the advance was on 22nd May, the day that Charles Dowsett said that he lived at Macclesfield-street—during all the time that the money was being advanced I did not hear Charles Dowsett say that he had any claim on the furniture at Upper Norton-street, or that it belonged to anybody but John Sturt—on 16th or 17th Aug. an execution was put into No. 60, Upper Norton-street, at the suit of Margetson and Hay wood, furniture dealers, of the Islington Bazaar—I received information that it was put in from Mrs. Sturt—I was then at No. 258, Blackfriars-road—she wished me to see to it for her, and I went to Margetson and Haywood, at the ware-house, and something took place—I afterwards saw Sturt, and he wanted me to get the execution out—I ultimately became the claimant in an inter<lb/>pleader issue, and a second execution was put in two or three days after<lb/>wards by Lawrence Levy—Margetson and Haywood were the defendants in the interpleader issue, in which I was the plaintiff—it went into Court, and resulted in a verdict for me—Sturt was subpœnaed on both sides, at least I understand he was subpœnaed on the other side—he was a witness for me, and was examined as a witness for me—he swore that the furniture in the house was his, and that he had assigned it to me for money advanced, and that this was the bill of sale which he gave to secure its repayment; it was produced and put into Sturt's hands at the time—he said that about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been advanced, and that the bill of sale had been given as security; that was the bill from Sturt to me—Miss Le Brice was examined, and Hart was there to be examined, but was not called—I am not aware whether he was in Court to hear what Sturt swore—I had seen him immediately before the trial, and had a conversation with him about what he was to prove at the trial—he said that he knew the money had been advanced, and I must succeed—after saying that, he was there ready to be examined—he said that it was a question of time with Sturt, but they would be sure to pay me—before this bill of sale was given, in July, I was repeatedly asking Sturt for money, and some of it was repaid; at other times I had a difficulty in getting it; and after the execution of Margetson's was put in, Mrs. Sturt said that it was very expensive, and asked if I would allow her brother to remain and hold a copy, that she had to keep him, and it would not matter—after I paid the money into Court, Mr. Sloman, the sheriff's officer, remained in possession for a fortnight for me—there was nobody else in possession for Margetson, he had withdrawn on the money being paid into Court—Mrs. Sturt said that it would be very inconvenient to keep paying 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and if I would allow <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett, whom they had to keep, to be in possession, it would save them that—I agreed to that, and gave him a copy of the bill of sale, and allowed him to take possession instead of Sloman's man—he remained in possession till 24th—I was there often, and asked him if the things were safe; he said, "Yes"—in consequence of something I heard, I went to the house, No. 65, and saw Sturt and his wife, and Charles and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett: I was very much</p>

               <p>out of temper, and said that I had heard that they, were changing the things at No. 60—Sturt said that it was not so—I said, "I will go in and see"—he said, "You can;" and Mr. and Mrs. Sturt, myself, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett went into No. 60—I do not think Charles Dowsett went—I said, "I think these tables have been changed, in fact, I am sure this is not the table and fender, and the stair carpeting is gone"—Start said, "Yes, I pledged that, but it shall be taken out and restored to you"—I said, "That aught not to be, I am sure they have been changed;" they assured me that they had not, or if they had that they should be restored, and I left—that was about a month before Christmas; it was after the trial, the trial was on the 8th or 9th Nov.—I went again when Sturt was there, as Mrs. Sturt came down in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and said, that Charles Dowsett had caused a Mr. Jul<lb/>lien to be detained at the station house for making away with a carriage which he had to repair or paint, and I had better come down and prove my title to it, as if he was ordered to restore it they should have so much less to pay me—I went with her in the cab to the station house first, with the bill of sale in my pocket, and at her request went up and asserted my claim—Sturt was present then, and I went to No. 68; the defendants were all pre<lb/>sent, the matter was talked over, and Dowsett said that he must be ordered to restore it, and that he had met him accidentally, and caused him to be detained—I produced my bill of sale then, and after that discussion I and Sturt went to the station house and I asserted my claim—after my claim was allowed in the action, I went on 24th Dec. to take possession of the pro<lb/>perty, in consequence of something which I heard—I said to Mrs. Sturt, "Sturt tells me he has paid the rent for Michaelmas quarter; now, Mrs. Sturt I want to see the receipt"—she said, "Yes, so he has paid it"—Darvillee a witness, who went with me, was present, none of the other defendants were there—I think first she said that she had it in her purse, and called Sturt's mother to produce it—she could not find it, and then they said that Sturt must have got it, and gone over to my house to show it to me—I said "Has the rent been paid?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "And with your own money?" she said, "It has, in two sums"—I said, "Because I have, been told that an arrangement has been made by which it is pretended that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett should pay the rent and claim these goods"—she said, "Cer<lb/>tainly not; you know he never had a shilling, it is not likely"—I said, "You may say what you like, but I will not leave the house without seeing the receipt; I will wait any time to see it, but if you do not show it to me I shall remove the goods"—Sturt's mother then went out, and in a few. minutes <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett appeared—I had three or four persons altogether there—I said, "We intend to move these goods;" Dowsett said, "I do not intend to let you, they are mine"—I laughed, for it surprised me, and then Charles Dowsett appeared, and Hart and they all said that they did not intend to let me move them—Hart had come in when they said that, and three or four men who had come with me began taking up the carpets to move them—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett went for one constable, and Darville fetched another—the men kept getting the things down stairs, and putting them on the staircase, and Tom Dowsett said, "Well, these things are mine"—I said, "Indeed! why, you have been in possession from Oct. for me; it is very singular that they should become yours all of a sudden; why did not you claim them before? why not claim them under the execution? why not tell me when I put you in possession? why remain quiescent, and then appear?"—he then produced an agreement, by which he said that he was the landlord, and that he took the house of one Frederick Cruse—I read it, and so did the</p>

               <p>constable—he said that he always had been the landlord, and that Sturt had nothing to do with it—I said, "Oh, that is impossible"—he said, "Well, it is so; if Sturt has been playing the rogue to you, I do not intend to have anything to do with it, and do not intend to let you have the goods;" and they have carried it out, for I never have—I said, "Do you claim them all?"—he said, "I do, from the top of the house to the bottom, and you do not move them"—he did not say who Frederick Cruse was, but I said, "The well known swindler"—he said, "That is my business; this is his agreement"—I believe there is a person named Cruse—I asked him if being the landlord of the house made the furniture his, but he would not explain that—I said, "You know you cannot be the landlord, for I have paid the rent myself to the Guarantee Society"—that was the Michaelmas quarter—the cheque was to Sturt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated Jan. 16, and bears the endorsement of the manager of the Kent Guarantee Society—the amount is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Sturt had paid the property tax, and I paid the difference, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Sturt went with me—I have the cheques here for all the advances which were made by cheque, and I believe they all bear Sturt's endorsement, but some were made in cash—we tried to remove the things, but were violently resisted—the defendants were all there except Sturt—when anything was wanted he was never visible, but when he wanted anything he was always present—that is the way they do their business—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett before that had taken part in the ownership—I saw him twenty times, and said, "You are taking care of the things"—he always said that they belonged to Sturt, until 24th Dec.—he never asserted that they belonged to him till the moment that I wanted to remove them—I do not know whether Charles Dowsett was present at the trial, or when it was discussed what was to be proved at the trial, but I have seen him often at the house—Mrs. Sturt was a Miss Dowsett, I have understood.</p>

               <p>annum—here is a bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable on demand—I should have got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of that for interest, but they never paid it, and I never got any—some of these are bills from other people—Start brought me all of these—I advanced the money upon each of these bills—I have not got a bill of Hale's—there was a bill of Male's given to me—that has been paid—it was for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was given to me after the issue; 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—I mean I advanced 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4 upon that bill—it was an understanding that, if I realized upon it, Sturt would have so much less to pay me—the bill was given to me in part payment—had it been paid I should have credited him with the whole amount—it was paid—that was after the issue—I have received in all about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and expended again 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—Sturt did not pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for the first two or three weeks, only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the book here which will show—(<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) this entry is in my writing—it is booked here 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might have been paid for two weeks—Sturt said that Miss Le Brice, who was to pay a certain amount per week for the house and furniture, had ceased to do so, and therefore he could not pay so fast, and he requested that I would allow him to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week instead of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not tell him I would agree to that for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—assented to reducing the payment to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week without any consideration, because when the first advance was made I calculated that if he paid it in a twelvemonth, it would do very well; whereas his proposal was in six months—it is never paid so fast as people say—there is 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the book as paid—he did not pay seven instalments of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—the whole of the money that has been paid has been credited here, with the exception of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I paid to the man who had been in posses<lb/>sion fourteen days—these bills have only been paid lately—the last 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not entered here, of which I expended again 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have only received 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I only got 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a person named Spence; it is here—that has not been paid, not one farthing of it by any one—it was in my possession shortly after the date of it, since May, 1855—I have tried to find out the address of Mr. Spence; I find he has gone from the Minories—they had got a great many bills from him—this bill was left with me, and I would not cash it—Mr. Sturt said that he always had something pressing, and if 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid he would credit me more—that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given to make up part of the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I have been speaking of—there was a bill of Sill's for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not one farthing of which has been paid—I have got it here—I sued Hale on the bill we have spoken of at Start's request—Mr. Simpson was the attorney—I know Mr. Howe, and know that he was imprisoned eighteen months for fraud; be was, I believe, Simpson's clerk—I have never been intimate with him—I have been with him lately several times—I have seen him outside the court, and have been in his company—I have drunk with him—he came out of prison two months ago, perhaps—I have consulted with him in this case; he said that he knew the lot, and could assist us—I am obliged to get information of such people in the circle in which they move—he has been to my office per<lb/>haps a dozen times—I saw yesterday, and he told me that he was assisting them—I said, "That coincides with your character, no doubt"—on my oath, I do not know whether my witnesses have been examined in the presence of Howe—Howe has been present when the witnesses were examined.</p>

               <p>three or four times when Howe was there, and the witnesses were examined, but the witnesses have never been examined in my presence—examining a witness is asking him a question; if you mean that, I say no—I have not heard the witnesses give their evidence to my clerk in Howe's presence—I have been present, but not when the examination was going on—Howe proffered advice, he said that he knew Cruse, and to complete his character he has turned round as he did yesterday—I should say that the witnesses have made a statement in Howe's presence—at the time I was associating with Howe and drinking with him, I knew that he had come out of prison within the last two months; but I was not associating with him—I did not know the charge against him, and did not inquire; it did not interest me—I mean to swear that—I heard that he was charged with fraud, and convicted—Mr. Simpson had been my attorney twelve months—there was a horse and a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that I had from Sturt, I sold it for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was not a whip that I took with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—there was a whip which I gave, I think, a guinea for, which I got from Sturt—I did not ay when I advanced the money, in the first instance, that I would not trouble him for it till it was convenient to pay it; after the trial, I said that I should not press him for the money—the trial was in Nov.—the execution was levied in Aug., but it was not tried till Nov.—I did state on the trial about having a bill of sale on No. 60, and all the bills of sale were produced—there was the bill of sale for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the assignment, Miss Le Brice's bill of sale upon it, and another, but not being stamped that could not be produced in evidence—I said that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid off—I swore that the bill of sale was given for monies I had advanced, and I stated the amount of interest which I had taken, in open Court, every item, and I stated it truly—I went on 24th Dec. simply to inquire whether the rent had been paid from Michael<lb/>mas, I merely wanted to see the receipt—I took four or five people with me; there was Henry Darville, John Hardy, myself, and a man that I had—I said that we might have to move some goods, and would he assist us—they did not all go in with me—had the receipt been fair I should not have attempted to move the things—I went to Mr. Bingham, but he did not hear the case—I went that night to the house, got in, and remained a quarter of an hour, or ten minutes—I took eight or ten persons, not friends of mine, but fellows that I hired for the purpose—there was no fighting, they were not fighting men—I hired them at Wilson's, in the Strand, the Spotted Dog; I said that we were going to move some furniture, and possibly there might be some little bother; that I wanted to get it if I could, and I made a particular request that not a blow should be struck—I thought blows might be struck, on account of the violence which we met with on the 24th—I did not think that the men I got at the Spotted Dog would be likely to strike—I paid them about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I was not in the house, because <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett charged me with felony—some one knocked at the door, and they rushed in; they stopped in till the following morning—there was no violence, but Hart stood at the door with a crowbar in his hand, and said, "If you come in, I will break your b—skull"—the other men had no<lb/>thing in their hands, to my knowledge, when they went to the house, and I should say that they would not, without my knowledge—before we went, we went to the station to get a constable to see that no breach of the peace was committed—I told the inspector what I meant to do—I did not say that I had ten men there—I said that we were going to move goods, and he said that we must speak to the sergeant on the beat—there was a distress put in by the landlord, believe—it was on 2nd Jan.—there was also a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030027"/>
               <p>distress put in in the middle of Nov.—(the landlord is the Rent Guarantee Society)—I do not know whether the distress put in in Nov. went out again—I went with Mrs. Sturt to the Guarantee Society to ask them to give time, for her husband could not pay it, and they declined; I went two or three times, and saw the secretary, Mr. Pearce, once or twice, and then half the money was offered—on my oath, that was not the reason given to me by them why they would not allow me to take the goods; the reason was that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dowsett said that they were always his, and never had been Start's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not Bowsett show you A receipt which had been paid for rent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He showed something—he showed me a paper, and told me that it was the receipt for the money which had been paid to the landlord—I said ten minutes ago that Mrs. Sturt said that she had paid it, and Sturt had got the receipt—they said at the time that the goods and some portion of the furniture had been condemned.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Hadwen, an attorney, I was engaged in the case of Spokes against Margetson—I prepared the whole of the proofs, and examined the witnesses before the trial—I saw Hart at Westminster Hall, and repeated his evidence to him, which I had written down—examined him in my capacity as attorney's clerk—I had been told that he could prove certain circumstances, and I drew according to that a proof—I was introduced to Mr. Hart at Westminster Hall, read over the proof to him, and asked him if he could swear to that effect, and he said, "Yes, most decidedly" I believe that proof is amongst the papers—on 24th Dec.

Sturt has got it; he has gone over to your house with it"—Mr. Spokes then said, "I don't believe it;" and he went out into the front room—after some few minutes he directed me to fetch a van to remove the furniture—pre<lb/>vious to that Mr. Spokes asked if Thomas Dowsett was in the house, and whether he had got the copy bill of sale he had given to him—Mrs. Sturt said, "No, he is not in, but whenever he goes out, he leaves the copy hill of sale with me," and she went to a drawer and produced it—I then, by the direction of Mr. Spokes, fetched a van to remove the goods, and directly I came back, I saw Thomas Dowsett there, who set up a claim to the whole of the goods, as landlord—he was there with his brother Charles, and Hart—Thomas Dowsett said he was the landlord of the house, and the whole of the goods were his, and he then produced a receipt which purported to be for a quarter's rent—he said he took the house from a person of the name of Cruse—Mr. Spokes said, "Do you claim the whole of them, or is it the portion that has been seized that you have purchased?—he said, "I claim the whole"—Mr. Spokes produced his bill of sale, and claimed the whole of the furniture, and said he should take them away, but Hart prevented him doing it—I remember Thomas Dowsett saying, I think, at another part of the evening, "If Sturt has been a b——rogue to you I cannot help it; he must suffer for it; the goods were always mine, and were never Start's"—Hart and Charles Dowsett were present when he said that—I do not remem<lb/>ber their saying anything at that time—in the course of the evening they said the property was Thomas Dowsets—they both said so at various times in the course of the evening—we were there till very near 11 o'clock—they said it was not Sturt's property, and that it was Thomas Dowsets—I remember distinctly Hart saying, in the presence of Charles and Thomas Dowsett, "We have done the b——old fool, Spokes, out of his money"—that was not in Spokes's presence—the Dowsett made a kind of chuckle;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030031"/>
               <p>or laugh, at the idea—Hart afterwards said to Mr. Spokes, "Whenever I begin a matter, you know, Spokes, I never leave it till I finish it"—we were prevented from taking away the furniture by all of them except Sturt, who was not present—I was hurt in the endeavour by Thomas Dowsett, and had my coat torn—on 1st Jan., I made another attempt to take away the furni<lb/>ture; I could not get into the house then—I saw the defendants outside the door—they again prevented me from taking away the furniture—and again, on 2nd Jan.—it continued all night—I did not see Start either time—I saw Mrs. Sturt—Hart said, "If you dare come here, I will break your b——head open"—that was on the night of 1st Jan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder in Millbank prison; I was so in Jan. last. The prisoner was a convict, confined there as a prisoner—he was one of the penal class, undergoing hard labour—on the morning of 12th Jan. it was my duty to escort him, with some other prisoners, to the treadwheel, at half past 9 o'clock—there were fifteen prisoners going at that time—they marched in single file—the prisoner was in the rear, about the last man—I and other warders walked by the side of the file, as an escort to accompany the men—I was in the rear of the whole file—Underwood, the principal warder, followed us, to close the gates between the different wards—after we had marched about half a dozen paces, the prisoner turned round, and struck me a violent blow on the back part of the head—I could not see the instrument that he made use of—I saw it afterwards—it was an iron ring, attached to some hammock nettles—it cut my head very much, and caused the blood to flow, and rendered me almost insensible, so that I scarcely knew what I was doing—I remained standing upright—as soon as I came to my recollection, I saw him in contact with warder Beer—they were struggling with each other—at the time he struck me he was the last man of the file—I will not be positive whether he had changed his place or not, but he was the last man when we marched off—he was secured in the pas<lb/>sage, with the assistance of some of the other prisoners—he was very violent—four other prisoners assisted in securing him—I had not spoken one word to him that morning, nor had he to me—in the previous week I had made two reports against him, once on the Monday, and once on the Thursday—on the Monday it was for making use of threatening language towards me, saying he would do something for me if I did not mind what I was doing—I was then in the act of searching him, which was my duty, as he was going to his cell—the second report, on the Thursday, was for making use of insubordinate language when working at the treadmill—he said he wished that he could break the treadmill, he would do the best he could towards it, and said that the governing directors were trying to punish the penal class prisoners as much as lay in their power, and that they might as well shut them up and <hi rend="italic">clam</hi> them to death, as keep them in the way they were doing—he has been in Millbank about three months.</p>

I accompanied the penal class, who were going to work at the treadmill—I was the third officer from the front, the prisoner was in the rear of me when he marched off—as we were going towards the treadmill, my attention was drawn to a noise in the rear—I turned round, and saw the prisoner striking violently at warder Mills with a hammock ring, at<lb/>tached to some hammock nettles—he held the rope part in his hand, and had a piece round his wrist—I did not see where he struck Mills, I saw him striking at him violently several times—I left the other fourteen pri<lb/>soners, and rushed to Mills's assistance, and the prisoner immediately com<lb/>menced an attack upon me—he struck at me several times, and once struck me on the left side of the head—I closed with him and threw him, and caught hold of the ring in my hand, and he held the rope—he kicked me several times across the thighs—I found that I could not succeed in taking the ring from him myself, and I called on the other prisoners to assist—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a hammock ring, there are two to each hammock, one at each end, by which the hammock is suspended—I afterwards went to the prisoner's cell, and found a ring and cord missing from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Miraye</hi>, on her voyage home from Shanghai—I shipped at Shanghai; Tonson was on board when I shipped—he was laid up sick when I first saw him—in the course of the voyage home I saw him in irons—I cannot tell the exact date of that, it was the latter part of Dec., or the fore part of Jan.—I think we were in about 27° or 28° N. at that time, as near as I can judge—I remem<lb/>ber seeing Tonson in the after cabin—he was then in double irons—he waa lying down—Mr. Travers took me into the state room where he lay—his hands were shackled behind him, and he had shackles on his feet—I think it was about five or six days before he died, as near as I can judge—I have got no memorandum—when Mr. Travers took me into the cabin, he told Tonson to get up—he made a faint move to get up, but he did not get up—it appeared to me that his hands being shackled behind him, he was too weak to rise in that state—upon that the prisoner kicked him twice with his foot, but not very heavily; he kicked him on the shoulders—I lifted Tonson up, and he was then brought on the quarter deck by Mr. Travers—the irons were first taken off his feet in the state room—I was left behind to bring him out—when he same on deck the irons were put on again—Mr. Travers put them on—while this was going on, Mr. Travers told him there would be no mercy shown him; and he told him if he wanted a stool, to do it in his pantaloons, a bucket of, water would wash it out in the morning—Tonson continued to be on the quarter deck till I went below, at 12 o'clock that night—it was a little past 8 o'clock in the evening when he was brought on deck—I came up again at 4 o'clock in the morning, and he was still lying on the quarter deck in irons—the weather was quite cold—the pri<lb/>soner was on deck when I came up at 4 o'clock—I did not hear him say anything to Tonson till a little past daylight; he then took the shackles off from his feet, and off from one wrist, and left them hanging on one wrist—there was then some talk between Mr. Travers and the deceased, I could not say what it was—Mr. Travers then picked a rope up from the port side, and commenced beating him over the shoulders and back—it was a main brace or a main sheet, I cannot swear which—those ropes are about three inches thick—the main sheet would be a little over three inches; I cannot tell the exact size, it was the tail of the rope—I stood about from twenty to thirty feet off—I heard the sound of the blows, and saw them—they were heavy blows—I cannot tell the number of blows he gave him at that time, several blows were struck—Tonson had no coat on, I think he had a thin striped light shirt on—after he had finished beating him at that time, Tonson tried to get up—he made a number of attempts to get up, and at last he straight<lb/>ened up, and staggered ten or twelve feet or so forward, and sat on the combings of the after hatch, that was close to the water tank, and he sat in the way of the pumping water, and Mr. Travers came and ordered him to get up and go away further off—the pump was wanted at that time—he did not get up—he did not appear to me to have his right senses about him, he took no notice at all—I should think this was not more than ten or fifteen minutes after he had been beaten first—when he did not get up Mr. Travers picked up a rope from the mainmast, and commenced beating him over the head and face—I cannot say what rope it was, I think it was the main try<lb/>sail brace, but I cannot say—I should think that is about a two inch rope—he beat him over the head and face with it—there was a little blood on one</p>

               <p>cheek—I cannot say how long he was beating him that time, I do not know how many blows were struck—Tonson made several attempts to get up, end he straightened partly up, and staggered ten or twelve feet further off and then fell again—his head did not fall against a boat then—I was passing a stunsail, and my eyes were off him for four or five minutes, and then I looked at him, and his face was covered with blood on one side, and there was blood on the deck round him—this was before 8 o'clock in the morning—he then tried to get up, and fell with his head and shoulders in a boat—I do not recollect seeing him again till a little past 12 o'clock the following night, when I saw him blundering out of the cabin, in the cuddy—he was holding on by a temporary stanchion in front of the cuddy, his hands were in irons in front of him, he had no irons on his feet—he appeared to be very weak, he was holding on to a stanchion—next day, or the next day but one, I cannot say which, the captain called me to go to Tonson—I did go to him—he lay in the same state room—I spoke to him, but he could not answer me—he was lying on the bare boards—he seemed to me to be dying—the steward gave me some port wine which I gave to him, he could not swallow it—he died, as near as I can judge, two days after—I never saw his body after—I saw his venereal parts when I was fetching him out of the state room, but I saw no other part of his body—he had been suffering from disease.</p>

Stubbs was in the corner—I saw that paper put up, and I saw it after it was up—I have known that shop from 1812, it had never been a linendraper's before.</p>

                  </hi>. In August I was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Berkshire</hi>, British mer<lb/>chant ship—her commander was Richard Orlando Legg—I remember the time <hi rend="italic">the Berkshire</hi> was lying in the Pondicherry Road—she had performed her outward-bound voyage—she had not received her homeward voyage cargo in full—on the night of 24th Aug. the ship's company consisted, amongst others, of the two prisoners at the bar—I turned in that night about 12 o'clock—it was the practice to watch by one or two men—all was right and safe when I turned in—there were three other men on board that night, I remember the name of Hiue, and Mann, were two of them—I do not remember the name of the other, Severin—the captain left the ship on 24th Aug., and went on shore, I think near 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning—he did not come on board that night—I was roused on the morning of the 25th, about 4 or 5 o'clock, I think—when I got up Severin, and Mann, and</p>

               <p>Hine, and Thompson, and Jones were not on board—it was part of their duty to take the watch from the time I turned in till morning—I thick they all had their watch in that interval—when I was called, I found the life boat gone, and the two buoys—the life boat had been secured on the deck—the captain came on board about 7 o'clock the next morning—I communicated to him the absconding of those five persons, and that the boat and life buoys were gone—when I had made these disclosures to him he went to his cabin—he unlocked the door with the key which he took out of his pocket—I went in the moment afterwards and saw the ship's papers, and other papers, lying about the floor—some were torn, and some not—the writing desk was broken open at the lock and hinges, the chests were broken open in different ways, and every thing in the cabin wag broken open; and the cabin window was open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Seeing that the captain unlocked the cabin with his own key, and the window was open, in what way did those who entered get in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the window from a boat—the captain complained that he had been robbed—he first said of all the money he had—he said he had lost money, sovereigns and half sovereigns, and a diamond ring—I went and examined his desk with him—I found a paper stating the money—I found another bag which had money in it, and a paper which describes the money in that bag—the captain went on shore immediately to Pondicherry—two or three days afterwards I was with him, when he made a complaint to the principals—I did not accompany the captain to Madras—I did not go on shore at Madras after I had been at Pondicherry—the Veasel proceeded on her Homeward-bound voyage in five or six days, or eight days—we came round the Cape—before we came round, when we were about eighteen miles from Madagascar, the captain died, and I assumed the command of the ship—I have continued it ever since—the names of the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Berkshire</hi> are Toulman, Livingstone, and Co.—there was an official log kept on board the <hi rend="italic">Berkshire</hi>, as well as the ordinary one—the official log was made up on the day of this loss of the captain—the captain made it—it bears his signature, mine, and the second mate's—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "25th August, master came on board 6 A.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been on board that ship as mate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A little over a month—I had come from Madras—those five men were shipped at Madras—I joined the ship at Madras—I did not go out with it—I think Madras is about seventy-five miles from Pondicherry—the captain did not go to Madras any time after this occurrence—I did not go—I received no message from any person to go there—the captain did not receive any to my knowledge—we had not lost any men by desertion during the month that I was on board—we left Madras, and came to Pondicherry.</p>

On the morning of 20th Feb., about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, I was on doty in Apperton-lane, Harrow, and noticed that a mark which I bad put on a gate had been removed—I had hung the chain so that if the gate was opened by anybody it would fall off—in conse<lb/>quence of that I went into the field, and when I had got about halfway across I saw two men running—I followed them as far as Stonebridge, and then lost sight of them—having seen one of them go through a hedge, I went there and found some footmarks made by boots very peculiarly nailed—I found there two bundles containing five coats, a large cape, two silk handkerchiefs, three pairs of gloves, and a small strap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to the gate, from which the mark had been removed, and found footmarks of the same person—on Saturday, 23rd Feb., I saw the prisoners in custody; I got their shoes and compared them with the footmarks, by making fresh im<lb/>pressions six inches off, and the impressions corresponded exactly—I did not put them into the footmarks—this is Pittum's right shoe, it has round headed nails across the front of the heel, and here are three nails in the toe—Prior's shoe is nailed on one foot outside the heel, but a portion of them are worn out, and I found the impression of the missing nails in the foot<lb/>marks—I was about twenty yards from Pittum when they crossed the Great Northern Railway, and I believe he is one of the men, by his size and dress—this gate is about five miles from Mr. Bunstall's—I traced the footmarks one mile nearer the gate towards Mr. Burstall's.</p>

On Friray, 22nd Feb., there was a bale of goods outside their pretnises, three or four yards from the door, consisting of ten pieces of calico—the carriers are in the habit of depositing their goods there, and they are signed for by one of our men inside—I saw the prisoner there in the morning, and again between 2 and 3 o'clock, loitering about, and leaning against the case—I missed the calico about a quarter past 4 o'clock.</p>

Copestick's, and saw the prisoner there—he said, "It will do you good if you will carry this," and than he said, "It is too heavy for you," and put it on his own shoulder—there was no one with him, it was on a case at the time—I had seen him before—next morning one of the men at Messrs.

I received twenty-one watches from Mr. Newton and took them to James Fisher, in Addle-street—I saw him on the first floor, and gave them to him—he said that the lady had been, and had gone—I went on the 21st, took them again, and gave them into Fisher's hands—he said that a lady was waiting—she was to select three or four—I left them in his custody, waited in his office, and, after some time, went into the adjoining room and found that he had gone, and all the watches also.</p>

I recollect Prike and Chalkley carting some gravel to my master's house—on 14th Feb. was the first time—I am sure they are the two men—the carts belonged to Mr. Hall—I am certain of that; I saw Mr. Hall's name painted on them—it was the kind of gravel produced—I saw my master pay Chalkley, but how much. I cannot say—I met Chalkley one morning at the Manor-road, and he told me that Mr. Chalkley had only given him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load—my master told me not to receive any more gravel.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 27th Feb., I met the prisoner at the Bell public house, with my sister, between 8 and 9 o'clock—my sister was lived with him for ten years—she had come to our house the night previous, and stopped all night—after leaving the Bell we went home—we live just through the Bell—the prisoner came to my mother's—my sister was down stairs when he came in—he first went up stairs into my mother's room, and he made use of very bad language towards me, and he then directly ran down stairs and fetched the knife, and cut me across the skull with it—he said, "You b——wretch," and said he would cut my b——throat; he had got his revenge then, and he thought he would do for me then if he possibly could—he had the knife at the time he said this—he ran down stairs to fetch the knife after he said this, and he beat me down stairs as well—he did not come back again after going down stairs—I took the knife out of his hand, and then he ran away—when be went down stairs to fetch the knife, he came back again with it—he beat me first upstairs in my mother's room, and then down stairs in the back parlour—he cut my head with the knife, and attempted to cut my throat, and had I not taken the knife out of his hand, he would have done so—he said, "I have got my revenge of you now, and I will cut your throat"—I said, "Oh! pray Dick, don't do that, for the sake of my poor old mother"—he beat me several times across the top of my head with the knife—it is a rusty knife, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he held it by the handle in this way, and chopped me several times on the top of the head—the blood is on it now—there was no handle</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he had lined with the prosecutrix's sister for ten years, and that when sober he had no fault to find with her, but that her sister was constantly tempting her to pledge her things and spend the money in drink; that she had done so on the occasion in question, and also pledged a coat with which he had been entrusted; that he went to try and per<lb/>suade her to return home with him, and found both herself and sister very tipsy and violent; that the prosecutrix took the knife to him, and on his wresting it from her, scratched his face, when he hit her on the head with the flat part of the knife.</hi>)</p>

I hare had a heavy burden with it"—about 11 or 12 o'clock in the morning, Mrs. White came in—she said to the prisoner, "Hannah, where is your baby, and what hare you done with it?"—she said, "It is at No. 23, Crawford-street, across the park"—I said, "Hannah, you have told me contrary to that," with that she burst into tears—she asked me for a new portmanteau, which she had, to fetch the child's clothes—I said if she would fetch the child for my satisfaction, I would nurse it for her—she said she would return with the clothes and the baby—she then left, and I never saw her again until she was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was third engineer on board the <hi rend="italic">Marley Hill</hi>, and came over in her from the Crimea—we arrived at Limehouse on 23rd Jan.—I went ashore at 5 o'clock—I believe Taylor was then on board, and the chief mate—I saw that everything was right in the engine room a few minutes before going ashore—the sea cock was shut—it is difficult to move, it requires the whole strength of my one arm to move it, either to open or shut it—it is used for different purposes, either to pump water in or out, or to pump water into the boiler, or on deck, to wash the decks—it could not be opened by a person merely walking casually past it—nobody could open it by knocking against it—I went into the engine room next morning about 6 o'clock, and found between six and eight feet of water in it—I did not see the cock at that time, it was covered with water—I have never known more than two feet of water in the engine room in the worst weather—I am certain that quantity of water could not have come in if the cock had not been opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Jonas Defries. In consequence of information, I went on Thursday night down Mile End-road—from inquiry I went to the Fountain; I saw the prisoner in the tap room, playing at cards—I first said to him, "Where is the horse?"—he said, "That is right enough; it is in the stable"—we told him to come outside—he came, and I then accused him of having stolen the horse—I cannot recollect whether he said anything—I got a policeman, and gave him in charge—the horse was taken, to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sudbury, in the parish of Harrow. On Tues<lb/>day, 22nd Jan., I left home about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—before I left I fastened up the house—I locked the front door and the back door, and went out at the kitchen door, and took that key with me—I went through the stable, which has a stock lock, and left the key of the stable with the prisoner, who was in my service—I took the key of the house with me—I have known the pri<lb/>soner seven or eight years—he took care of my horse when I had one, and attended to the garden—I had not a horse of my own that day—there is a pantry window in the back, over the wash house—that window had a per<lb/>forated zinc plate outside—when I left home it was safe—the zinc plate was fastened with one nail—it was merely to keep the flies out—if that were away any one could get into the house through that opening—when I went away I told the prisoner to tell no one that we were out, to come round at 10 o'clock at night to see that all was right, and to come to meet us at the 11 o'clock train the next morning—when we left home there was an iron chest in my bed room—it contained a dozen or fourteen knives and forks—some plated candlesticks, and branches, a carver and fork, a fish slice, a pocket book, and in it a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—some deeds and some papers—there was a good sharp dog in the stable—I kept him there for protection—I told the prisoner not to let that dog loose till I came back—the prisoner frequently assisted in the house when we had any friends there—I do not think he knew much about where the plated goods were kept, but he knew the chest was there—he had it when he wanted to clean the windows—I had some silver goods, but they were in another cupboard—on the following day the prisoner met me at the station—he said, "They have been at it again"—I said, "What do you mean"—he said, "They have been robbing old Sparrow "(he lives near me); "this is the third time"—I said I was very sorry for it, they had robbed the poor man two or three times—I said, "How is our house?"—he said, "I went round about 11 o'clock at night; I heard the dog barking, I ran across the fields and went round, and when I got there I saw a man (or a <hi rend="italic">cove</hi>) hanging over the gate"—I said, "What did you say to him?"—he said, "I said, 'Halloo, my friend, what do you do there?' and he said, 'I have got up out of the wind;' and he wanted to see a man of some name, I forget the name, who used to live there some years ago"—I asked him how the man was dressed—he said, "He had a smock frock on down to his knees"—he said, "I said to him, 'It is a good thing that my master has gone to bed, or very likely he would put a chance shot into you'"—he said, "I went through the stable and shut the door, and got be<lb/>hind the water butts, and I saw the man sneak down the road, towards Mr. Greenhill's farm"—I think he said, two or three times, that he had a smock frock on down to his knees—I asked him if all was right—he said all was right, the locks and doors were quite fast—all this took place between the station and my house—the prisoner went on with us till I stopped at the Swan and had a glass of beer, and he went on with Mrs. Chapman—after I left there, I met the prisoner coming back to meet me—he said, "Come along, somebody has broke into the house"—I went home, and Mr. Morris went with me, and the prisoner—when we got near the house Mr. Morris looked about for foot marks—he pointed to a foot mark over the flat, and the prisoner said, "That is my foot mark, I rolled the flat this morning"—that foot mark was nine or ten yards from the zinc plate—I went to the</p>

I received information of this on the 23rd—I searched the premises, and found what the other witness has stated—on the 28th I found this pocket book on the side wall in the coach house—it was wrapped in these two knee caps for a horse—the coach house adjoins the stable—this book was on the wall from which the roof springs—the top of the wall opens on to the slates—I opened the pocket book, and in it I found this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note wrapped in a piece of paper—I</p>

On Wednesday, the 23rd, the prisoner came to me, in the shop, between 11 and 12 o'clock—that was after his master had come home—he said his mistress had been robbed—I said, "You don't mean to say that, do you, <hi rend="italic">Jem?</hi>"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What have they taken?"—he said, "An iron chest, and some papers, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, some candlesticks, and knives and forks"—he stood there a minute, and I said, "Will you fetch us a pot of beer with a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece?"—he said, "I cannot stop this morning; I have got to go to the police station"—I did not see him any more that day—he came the next day, the 24th—he went to one of our men first—I heard him ask him if he had got a drag he could lend him—I went up to him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, have you heard of anything?"—he said, "No"—this was a little after 10 o'clock in the morning—I asked him what he was going to do with the drag—he said, "I am going to drag the pond, to see if I can find master's property—I said, "Do you think <hi rend="italic">them as</hi> have got your master's property will throw it into a pond?"—he said, "I don't know; I am going to drag for it to see if I can find it"—he said, "Do you think <hi rend="italic">them</hi> papers will come out of the iron chest?" and said, "Do you think they would swim on the water?"—I said, "Yes, I should think they would"—he said, "Do you think the writings would be off the paper?"—I said, "No, I should think not"—I said, "If you find any on the top of the water, drag them to the edge, and take care of them for your master"—in two or three minutes after, he said, "Cannon, if you had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, where would you change it?"—I laughed, and said, "If I had one of my own, I should change it in Harrow"—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Them</hi> as have got Master James's, I should think Brentford, or round there, would be the best place to change it"—I said to him, "Does your master know the number of the note?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Then it is no use for him to go to the Bank to stop it"—he did not say anything about it being a long while before the note could get to the Bank.</p>

On the morning of Christmas Day I saw a dog cart opposite Mr. Faulkner's house—it was drawn up close to the kerb stone—it was about half past 11 o'clock when I first saw it—there was one man sitting in it, holding the reins and whip—I cannot tell who it was, I did not see him face—I have no belief as to who it was—I saw Jones standing by the shaft of the cart, with his face towards the horse—I had an opportunity of seeing him for the half hour they were there—I saw one man in the garden just by the side of the gate—when I first saw him, he was going towards the kitchen window—I did not see anything particular after that till they opened the street door, and came out, bringing a chest—two men did that, one had got one handle, and the other the other—it appeared to be an iron chest—they placed it in the dog cart—one of them then returned up the steps, and pulled the door just to—they then all four stood by the cart, with their faces towards the cart—the man that had been in the cart had got out when they brought the chest outside the gate—they put the chest into the cart, and then put themselves to rights, and got into the cart—the man who had been in the cart, holding the reins and whip, got up behind, and to the best of my belief it was Jones drove the cart away towards the Holloway road—I have since seen a cart at Hoxton, and I should say that was decidedly the same cart that I saw on Christmas Day, and I have every reason to believe the horse I saw was the same, but he was in a different condition—he was very dark, I should say nearly black—I do not recognise either of the other prisoners, except that the back and shoulders of Wilson look like the man that sat in the cart—I said so at the police court.</p>

               <p>11 and 12 o'clock, I passed Mr. Faulkner's—I saw a dog cart standing at his door, and Wilson was in it—I noticed him, because he resembles a person I know very well, I at first thought it was him—I saw a stout man at the head of the horse—I could not swear to the face of that man, but I can to his figure—I had to wait at the corner of Cornwall-place for an omnibus—while I was standing there the dog cart passed me, and there were then four men in it—I have seen the same dog cart since, and the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at White Webbs Farm, Enfield. Brightman has been in my service twenty years on and off; he has sometimes been away and has come back again—he was quite a lad when he came to me—Houghton occupies a farm by me—I left it, and he entered on it at Michael<lb/>mas last; it is not 200 yards from my farm—I knew him before Michaelmas, but he had not been a farmer before that to my knowledge—in consequence of suspicions I entertained I went on 5th Feb., to a loft on my farm which Brightman had the care of—I missed from the stable a new truss of hay which I had tied up for a particular purpose—I went up into the loft, and found it there concealed—it was for cutting up for the sheep—Brightman was the last person there that afternoon, and I am positive that he con<lb/>cealed it—nobody else had any business in the loft, and no one went there besides him in the afternoon, to my knowledge—the loft was never locked—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of the dates—I told my brother the dates and he wrote them—I examined the racks in the stable, and there was no hay in them—on the 7th I missed another truss, and found it in the loft covered over with some oat straw, some before it, and some on the top of it—I also missed three trusses on the 8th, and saw them laid in the same place in the loft—they had come from the stack, and the prisoner ought to have put them into the rack—between 5th and 8th Feb., I went into the stable, and saw that the good hay had been taken out of the racks, and some which had been lying about in the stable for a month, and could not be eaten, was in the racks—I communicated with the police, and Goodall and Harriss came on the 11th, about 12 o'clock at night—I went into the loft with them, and saw two trusses of hay concealed in a corner, and some trusses of straw in front, and on the top of them—there was a truss of hay in the middle of the loft; that was exposed—those trusses were for the use of the horses, but instead of that they were concealed—Goodall and Harriss put brown paper into all of them, with my initials on, and some with Harriss's initials—I watched with them all night, but nobody came, and the policemen watched afterwards till half past 3 o'clock, when I desired them not to stop too long in case the men should see them in the yard—on 13th, about 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, I went to the loft and missed these three trusses—the police were not there then, but I sent to the station house, and afterwards went to Houghton's, with Goodall and Williams—we went to the granary—there were two men cutting chaff, and I examined two trusses of hay, which were mine—I saw the brown papers taken out of them which the police had put in—we found three more trusses in the stable, two of which I had marked—I identify three marked trusses, and two others—I identify those which are not marked by the character of the hay, and by the bands they were tied up with—the man who made them did not know how to make a band—some of them were straw bands—Houghton was there while the search was going on, but I did not speak to him—the police asked him how he came by them; he said that he did not know, and that he had no right to tell them—another truss was thrown out of the loft, Williams asked me if</p>

CODD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe your farm adjoins Houghton's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the landlord of my farm is General Meux, and of Houghton's, Mr. Bowles—there was a misunderstanding between me and Mr. Bowles on my leaving, but we settled it very amicably—Mr. Bowles did not prefer Hough<lb/>ton to me as a tenant; he wrote a note to me to say that he had let the farm to Houghton, and the reason he did not offer it to me was, that he had heard me say that I paid too much for it; but if he had offered it to me I would not have had it, in consequence of the ill treatment I met with from him—I have known Houghton 14 or 15 years, he was a hay dealer previous to and since taking this farm—Brightman lodged in part of Houghton's house with his wife and family—there is a short cut across the fields from Houghton's to my farm, but Brightman would not be allowed to go that way—he said he went that way to his dinner, but his daughter carried his dinner into the fields to him—Brightman lived in Houghton's house at the time I held the farm, but he was not my tenant, he was my workman and it was then my farm—I have six horses now, and had then—I employ two men thrashing, and a boy and my brother assist me—they could go up into this loft if they liked—I never saw them go there—this was rowan hay, the second cut—I do not recollect Houghton saying that he purchased the five trusses of Rutherford, but as to the last one that came out he did—that was as large again as mine—he said that he bought some of Rutherford—Mr. Rutherford is a farmer, and is here—the papers were all brown, and were four or five inches long—Goodall put them into two trusses, and Harriss into one—there is a footpath leading from White Webbs to Cheahunt, that passes Houghton's field, close to his yard—Brightman might go that way sometimes, and sometimes by the road, that is the shortest way, but I do not know that there is much difference—when we went to Houghton's pre<lb/>mises the granary was open, and Houghton was in the stable doing his horse up—the loft was too high for me to see the trusses in it—the bands of the trusses are made with oat straw, by which I also know them—that is a common sort of straw in my neighbourhood—there were about twenty loads of hay in the stack—I have not missed a truss from the stack, only out of the loft—Brightman was quite a lad, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, when he first came—he had lived at Houghton's house perhaps twelve months—I did not leave the farm at Michaelmas—I was not turned out by Bowles, my lease ex<lb/>pired—I was not anxious to keep it, and would not have it at any price through the treatment I received from Bowles, but we parted good friends, and shook hands.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, N</hi> 3). My duty is in Enfield—Mr. Harrison communicated with me about this hay, and on 11th Feb. I went to his farm—I went into the loft with him at 12 o'clock at night, and saw two trusses of hay covered over with straw, and one exposed—into each of the two trusses I put, I believe, four papers, marked "E. H.," Mr. Harrison's initials—I saw Mr. Harrison mark the other truss—I then left, and watched the premises till 3 o'clock—I watched again between the 11th and 13th, but did not see the trusses removed—on the afternoon of 13th, Mr. Harri<lb/>son came to the station, and I went to his house, but did not go into the loft—I took Brightman into custody in the yard, and asked him what had become of the two trusses of hay in the corner of the loft—he said, "One of them is there yet"—I said, "Where is the other?"—he said, "I have got it"—I took him into custody—I found another truss, a wet one, sub<lb/>tituded</p>

               <p>for one of the others in the loft—I afterwards went into Honge<lb/>ton's, went into the granary, and a man was cutting some hay up into chaff—I examined the truss, and took this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from it, it is one of the papers which I had put into the trusses in the prosecutor's loft—sergeant Williams handed down four or five trusses from the loft, among which I discovered another truss which I had marked, and took from it these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were no marks in any of the other—altogether, I found two marked trusses at Houghton's—I have not discovered the truss that Mr. Harrison marked—I saw Houghton first in the stable, nothing was said to him in my presence—Mr. Harrison identified five or six other trusses, and a number of hay and straw bands, which he said were his pro<lb/>perty—I found footmarks at the back of Houghton's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a plan of the premises—the footmarks extended across Houghton's field to the farm, and up to the fence, as it is dotted here—I found some hay stick<lb/>ing to the tarred fence by Harrison's—I took off Brightman's left boot, and examined it with the footmarks up to the first fence—they exactly corre<lb/>sponded—they were rather indistinct across the field, but there were two very deep impressions on the side of the fence near to Mr. Harrison's pre<lb/>mises—they were in the ditch where the hay was handed over into the field—a key was found on Brightman which opened Houghton's granary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Houghton's granary open when you went to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were at work—I compared the footmarks on the fol<lb/>lowing afternoon—it had rained a good deal in the interval, it was wet—I did not trace footmarks on the public footpath across the field, but there were some at the bottom of the field—I did not take the right shoe—the mark was where a person had stepped over—I observed other footmark made with a different shoe, but they were indistinct, and I did not compare them—I went into Houghton's stable, but did not see any trusses of hay in the loft as I went in—I did not look whether it was open when I went—it is open to the stable, but the stable door is locked—I put four papers marked "E. H." into two of the trusses, and saw Harrias put some into the other truss, but how many I do not know—I believe the mark on them was "Harris"—I saw none found with "Harrison" on them—I did not know the prisoners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk manufacturer, and reside at Grosvenor-house, Walthamstow. About 4 or 5 o'clock on the afternoon of 8th Feb. I was passing down Tyson-street, Bethnal-green—I crossed the road towards Virginia-row, just beyond King-street, when the prisoner Jones jumped at my right arm—he came from my side, jumped at my side, and turned my face to the wall, so that I could not see who was in the road—he made a violent snatch at my chain, and pulled me right round again, and I then saw four persons in the road besides Jones, who had then run—they were at equal distances of three or four feet from each other, so as to allow Jones to go up King-street—they were at the side of me, not surrounding me—I had scarcely got on the payement, I was on the kerb—Jones succeeded in stealing my seals, key, and locket, and ran away—I instantly pursued, and a thief who is not in custody made a blow at my head, intending to knock me down, but I <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi>, and knocked off my hat—after I escaped from that one, Martin fell on all fours—I instantly jumped over him, and I had not run twenty yards before I caught Jones—we had a desperate encounter—I swang him to the ground, and caught hold of the skirt of his coat, and he went round like a humming top, and kicked out in all directions at my shins, so that I was forced to let him go—I then gave him a good chase for at least three quarters of a mile, and after I had caught him a second time Martin came up to me, and took my attention off Jones, saying, "You have got the wrong man there"—I knew I had not, because I saw my property in his hands—he said, "There runs the man (pointing down Tyson-street) that has got your seals"—Jones then got his handkerchief loose, and got my finger into his mouth, and nearly bit it off—we had half an hour's struggle—Martin was present all that time—Martin then laid hold of Jones's right arm, and seeing that I was getting the better of Jones he made a violent kick—I can show you my trowsers where he kicked me—he kicked me on the legs—I was forced to leave go of Jones on that account, and then Martin, to prevent my following Jones, took'me right round my waist, lifted me off the ground, and said, "Sir, it is no use your following that youth; you will get murdered, man"—what took place then I cannot exactly say, for we were then opposite the Pitt's Head, and Martin says I offered him a glass of ale; very likely I did—I took hold of his arm—I could not hold him till any one came to my assistance, I was forced to get him into the Pitt's Head—I walked in with him, and called on the landlord for his assistance—Martin then attempted to get out—he butted at me, and tried to get out, but with the landlord's assistance he was prevented, and was given into custody.</p>

On the night of 7th Feb. I went to bed about half past 10 o'clock—I left my silver flute in a case in the dining room—it cost twenty-eight guineas—it was the first time for four years that I left it there—my house was secured in the ordinary way when I went to bed—about 2 or half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by a breaking noise, as if of some one on the stairs—I got up, and went down into the parlour—I found the place in confusion, and my flute case lying empty on the floor—I then heard a noise, as if of some one escaping from the back—I afterwards went to the police station, and gave information—I found a screwdriver lying on the parlour table—these are the pieces of my flute (<hi rend="italic">looking at some broken pieces</hi>)—these forks, spoons, and sugar tongs are also mine—they are marked with my initials—an attempt has been made to efface them; with some they have succeeded; in others they are quite visible—all these articles were in my house on the night in question when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>about 2 o'clock, by a noise like the opening of a window—I opened my door and went to the stair foot door; listened 5 or 10 minutes, and not hearing anything went to bed again—I was again awoke by a crashing noise, like breaking a door open—I called out, "Charles, is that you? who is there!" to my young man, and thought I heard somebody move on the stairs—I said, "Well, it is a good thing I have got my gun loaded"—there was a window before my bed room door, which had been opened to let the smoke out—I put it up, and heard a voice outside which I knew, singing "Hail smiling morn!"—that turned out to be Mahoney, who has been trans ported—(<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 185)—I thought the noise I had heard was outside, instead of in, and went to bed again—I was afterwards called up, and found the door open, and the bar door broken open, which was five or six feet from the door—I missed about 21 bs. weight of cigars, and found cigars lying about, two drawers in the bar parlour were broken open, and a shawl was gone from one, which I put there when I went to bed—the till was broken open, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone, which were safe over night—I went into the parlour, and missed an iron chest, containing leases, wills, and about 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of dock warrants and several valuable papers, and it weighed two cwt, but had two handles, and two men could carry it very well—a silver caddy spoon was also taken.</p>

I received information from a police sergeant, and went to No. 44, Baldwin's-gardens with Attwood and Briggs, but only found the female in bed whom he cohabits with, and whom I knew, having seen her with him—Smith's wife and child were also in bed together in the same room, at least he calls her his wife—they occupied the back rooms of the second and third floors—neither the prisoner or Smith were there—the prisoner was apprehended on 22nd Jan. in Holborn, brought to the station at Bow-street, and charged with this offenoe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policenwn, R</hi> 321). On 2nd Feb. I was at the station when Smith and Mrs. Curran were brought in—I accompanied Brown to the house in Red Lion-street, and in the water butt in the yard, which was quite dry, I found 55 Iba. of flour, covered over with a piece of apron or rag, and a mat on the top of that—while there the male prisoner came in, and I asked him if he was Mr. Curran—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you aware your wife is in custody t"—he hesitated for a second or so, and said, "Oh, in she?"—I said, "Yes, for feloniously receiving this flour," pointing to the floor which I found in the water butt," and some more in a sack that is at the station; did you know that it was in the house?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know how it came here?"—he said, "No, I know nothing about it; I always give my mistress money to lay out"—I took him into custody.</p>

I was servant to Mrs. Curran—I went to her on the Thursday before Christmas, and remained till she was taken up—I know David Smith, be lived next door, and I have seen him in the house several times—Curran has been there when he came sometimes, and sometimes Mrs. Curran—he sometimes brought a large quantity, and sometimes a small quantity of flour—the last time I recollect him coming with anything was on a Thursday, towards the end of Jan.—he laid it down in the front room, and it was put into a large bag, but I did not see who by.</p>

Don't he so silly"—he said, "For something you did to me It twelvemonth ago, and I don't forget it"—I said, "If you can tell me what I have' done, I will rectify it"—he said, "No, I shan't tell you; I know what it is, and I will have your blood to-night?"—he swore, and said, "So help me God, I will have your life to-night!"—I laughed it off—I afterwards went and fetched him to dress for his part, and he said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I am very much obliged to you," and away he went—some short time afterwards he wanted to fight me for five shillings, and he said he was going to take my life and be hung for it, as his cousin was at Horsemonger-lane, if it was Monday morn<lb/>ing he did not mind, he would have my heart's blood—he followed me about the dressing room, and certainly, when he lifted up his hand, I turned round, as I thought he was going to put his threats into execution, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away from me, but I paid no attention to it—after that I saw</p>

About ten minutes, or quarter to 6 o'clock on Friday morning, 8th Feb., I was on duty in Grove-lane, Camber<lb/>yell, about a mile and a half from Mr. Broad's, with Turner, another con<lb/>stable—I saw the prisoners coming in a direction from the prosecutor's house—I stopped Walker—Turner stopped Jackson, who was behind—I asked Walker what he had got in the bundle—he had a bundle in his hand—he said some beef and mutton—I asked where he got it from—he said he had been to see his brother, at Sydenham, and he had given it to him—seeing that he had something bulky in his pocket, I asked what he had got there—he said "Two bottles of wine"—I asked him where he got that from—he said his brother gave him that also—I told him I should take him to the station—I did so and there searched him—in the bundle I found a piece of beef, about 71 bs. of loin of mutton, a piece of boiled pork, and a Pair of goloshes; and on his person a bottle of port wine, a bottle of gin, a cruet stand, a bunch of keys, a latch key, two tope of pepper casters,</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Edward Harris Rabbitts, of No. 1, Crosby-road, Walworth-road, a boot and shoe maker—on a Monday morning in Feb., about 10 o'clock, the prisoners came—Forer asked for a pair of spring boots out of the window—he tried them on and they were rather tight—I got another pair and they were too large—I went into the ware-house for another pair, and when I came back Balcecarli got up and said, "Well, I must go, or I shall be all behind, you will overtake me in about half on hour"—Forer said, "Yes, I shall," and he left—Forer then said that he should like to have a pair made for him, he did not mind the price, he agreed to give 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave me a half crown deposit and left—in the course of an hour or so I saw the prisoners in custody—I afterwards searched and missed this pair of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my master's—I had put them on the back of a chair just before the prisoners came in—I had not sold them—I described them to the policeman and he took me to the pawnbrokers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jones.</hi> Sergeant Adams gave our pay sergeant three billets on 1st or 2nd Feb. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not unless it was done in the regular way of business—we never give billets except when they are applied for, and they are entered in a book—we do not infringe on die publicans—he bad no right to receive three, and I never gave him three—I pledge my oath to that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergecmt</hi>). In consequence of information, I went in plain clothes to Mr. Blanchett's house—I followed the prisoners in—Mr. Blanchett showed them this billet, and asked them where they got it from—Walsh said that he got it from the police office—I then said, "It is false, it is ft forgery, and you must both consider yourselves in my custody."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walsh. Q.</hi> Did I say that I got it from the police office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, those were your words—Mr. Blanchett did not give it to Jones to sign after that—he had signed it, and it was taken from his hand, and held to you—I saw him write this, "Thomas Clark."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walsh's Defence.</hi> I was in charge of the recruiting officer for a short time, and during sergeant Adams's absence, I saw this red book with the billets in it signed and dated; I took them out, and saw other billets of put dates, Sept. and Oct., and with different signatures; these two were the only ones for dates to come on; I took them out, and told Jones of it, and we went; I believe sergeant Adams has been carrying on this game some time; I am confident of it; the book has been taken to the police court and signed, and he has taken and done it himself; there is great animosity I between the sergeant and me, and my comrade; we have been courting his wife, in fact, and he has been trying to get us away, and has put this on us; they were laid in our way, and I took the billets, not thinking that it was any harm; I had a good character from my former employer, and was on the road to promotion; within another fortnight I should have been made a full corporal; I have not a scratch against me in the books.</p>
