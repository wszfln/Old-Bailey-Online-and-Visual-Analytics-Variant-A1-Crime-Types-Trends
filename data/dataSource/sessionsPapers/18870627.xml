                  </hi>. I live at 32, Eaton Place, and am a partner in the firm of Glyn, Mills, Currie, and Co., bankers, of Lombard Street—in June, 1884, the prisoner was introduced to us as a customer by the Union Bank of Manchester, and at his request we opened an account with him which continued till August, 1886—in August the account was overdrawn by 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he then applied to us for a loan of 1,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., offer<lb/>ing as security deeds of freehold property in Manchester and Vauxhall—we made inquiries through our solicitors about those deeds, and subse<lb/>quently gave him to fill up this form of deposit it is dated 6th September, 1886, and is signed "<hi rend="smallCaps">J. HARCOURT SMITH</hi>."(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the securities left relating to property at Vauxhall, at Ardwick, Manchester, together with a bill of sale for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">were to be held for the balance due</hi>.) The bill of sale was on some furniture—the prisoner signed that form, and handed me a parcel of deeds and a bill of sale—those deeds related to the supposed freehold land at Ardwick. (<hi rend="italic">One deed purported to be an indenture of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1884, <hi rend="italic">between Thomas Edward Cripps, of Whalley Range, and Charles Francis Haynes, of Ardwick Green, Manchester, conveying a plot of land at Ardwick Green in consideration of</hi> 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed by both parties in the presence of Joseph Harcourt Smith. There was also a receipt for</hi> 860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">witnessed by Smith. The second indenture was a mortgage of the land on the</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd Feb</hi>., 1884, <hi rend="italic">be<lb/>tween Haynes and George Newnes.</hi>) In addition to these there were deeds relating to the Vauxhall property and the bill of sale—on the faith of those deeds we advanced 1,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner—we placed that amount</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188706270002"/>
               <p>to his account—the greater part of it was afterwards drawn out by him—in December, 1886, he paid off 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and withdrew the Vauxhall deeds, leaving 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Ardwick property and the bill of sale; that was somebody else's bill of sale on some furniture—I agreed to allow the remaining 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to stand over till 6th January—in February, 1887, I applied to the prisoner for repayment of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was not paid, and I put the matter into the hands of Messrs. Murray and Co., our solicitors—on 1st March Mr. Newnes called and made a communication about the Ardwick deeds—I took him to our solicitors and left the matter with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The amount of our loss is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest, assuming that we realise nothing under the bill of sale—I can't say that the bill of sale was prepared by Messrs. Chester, Mayo, and Griffiths—I do not suggest that it is not a genuine bill of sale; we never attempted to realise it—our solicitors told us it was of no value as a security—the negotiation for the 1,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on 6th September, 1886—at that time the prisoner's account was overdrawn 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheque for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid through the clearing—we had not authorised its being placed to his credit; I don't remember giving such a permission; it is conceivable, but I do not think so—I should say his account was overpaid on the authority of one of our clerks; it is quite possible I may have authorised him if the case was referred to me—there was no overdraft before the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; there was apparently 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his favour—his turn over was something like 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I knew that he was clerk to the Loan and Trust Mortgage Company; I believe that to be a very respec<lb/>table Company—we were aware that he was in the employ of Mr. Newnes; that is, I was aware he had been on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Tit-Bits</hi> newspaper—his account was never opened with us; he was introduced to us by the Union Bank of Manchester when he came to London—we knew that he resigned the Secretaryship of the Loan and Trust Com<lb/>pany suddenly; I forget the date; it was not very long before we had a suspicion about the deeds—I had no suspicion before Mr. Newnes came to us—I did not know that he had been suing Mr. Newnes—this was his private account; there was another account of the Mortgage Agency—he reduced his debt by paying 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on 6th December—there were many large sums paid in and drawn out after the loan—I see one entry here of 6,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we closed the account after Mr. Newnes called—490<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is owing to us—if he had repaid us there would have been a surplus of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think if he had also paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he would have been entitled to the bill of sale, because that was lodged as security against the loan—if he had paid us all he owed we should certainly have given him the bill of sale—when we closed his account I believe it was in credit to the extent of about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on his paying us the difference, 483<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would have been entitled to the bill of sale and these deeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined.</hi> This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill of sale—the actual loss to the bank is about 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he had paid that he would have been entitled to have the deeds and the bill of sale.</p>

               <p>Messrs. Craven and Brett, solicitors, at Manchester—he was my manager at a salary of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he remained in my service till February, 1885, and I always had the highest confidence in him—in February, 1884, while I was in Manchester, I had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to invest, and I spoke to the prisoner about advancing it upon some freehold property, and I left him to carry out the transaction—he told me the property was in Copenhagen Street, Ardwick, near Manchester—I then told him to go and inspect it and report on it, and after that he said he had seen it, and it was an excellent investment at 5 per cent.—I then told him to carry out the transaction; I employed no solicitor, I left it entirely to him to get the deeds and do everything for me—he said he had examined the title and he was satisfied—I then gave him this cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is endorsed by him. (<hi rend="italic">This was a cheque on the Consolidated Bank to the order of "Mr. Joseph Smith.</hi>") I cannot be sure whether up to that time he had mentioned where the property was, or who the vendors were—I left the whole matter entirely to him—after I paid him that cheque he gave me what purported to be the deeds—they appeared all right, and I told him to put them in the Consolidated Bank at Manchester, and I thought he had done so—I regularly received the interest through him—in June, 1884, I removed to 83, Farringdon Street, and I told the prisoner to get the securities from the bank at Manchester and lodge them in the Capital and Counties Bank in London—I had written them a letter authorising them to give up all securities to him—he continued in my service till February, 1885—I received my interest from him during that time, and I believe I got some interest by cheque from him after he left—I know nothing of Mr. Cripps or Mr. Haynes—I left the whole matter in the prisoner's hands—in March, 1886, I was desirous of calling in the mortgage, and I directed my clerk Mr. Woods to write to the prisoner—this letter of the 31st March, 1886, is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a cheque for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for the interest, and stated that he held a power of attorney on behalf of the mortgagor who was abroad.</hi>) Upon that I communicated with my solicitors, Messrs. Pitts and Savage, and they were to arrange to pay off the mortgage—I was to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and take a transfer of the mortgage—the attesting witness to this conveyance is in the handwriting of the prisoner, and so is the attestation to the signature of the mortgagor Haynes—my solicitors obtained the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I then transferred the mort<lb/>gage to the prisoner by this deed—in September, 1886, I had a clerk in my office named Pearson—the questions on this requisition appear to be in the prisoner's handwriting, and the answers are written by Pearson—at the bottom there is also, in the prisoner's handwriting, "Answered personally by Haynes at office"—the abstract of title is signed by the prisoner I should say, but I could not swear to its being his writing so much as the others appear to be—I gave my solicitors authority to get these deeds from my bank—I knew the prisoner as Joseph Smith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The publication of <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> commenced some time before 1882—a competition for a prize of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was won by the prisoner—that is how I came to know him, and then I thought he might be a regular contributor to <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi>, while he was at Brett and Craven's he contributed to <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi>—I then offered him the management of it—it was, probably, a year after the competition that he became manager—from 1883 I had money to invest, and I employed the prisoner to invest it for me in the names of Fish, and Clyde, and Banks, and various other</p>

               <p>names—it involved large sums—he conducted the whole of the matter—that went on to within two or three months of his leaving—I had no cause to complain of him with the exception of this one case; on the contrary I had the greatest admiration for the way he conducted the business—Haynes' name was brought to my knowledge as early as February, 1884—this cheque is dated 18th February, and this letter is the 19th February—I, probably, knew the name of Haynes a few days before I sent the cheque—I am familiar with Manchester—I did not know that there was no Copenhagen Street there—Ardwick is a very large district of Manchester—the prisoner ceased to do any work for the paper as early as February, 1885—there was an action for his salary and wrongful dismissal, and I paid him down to February, 1885—I after<lb/>wards stated in a letter to him that I parted with him rather in sorrow than anger, that was my feeling—from Christmas, 1884, to March, 1886, I had received no interest from the prisoner, and about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due—I found that there was something wrong in the description of the deeds, but I did not imagine for one moment that Copenhagen Street was not there—if I had had any knowledge of any forgery or wrong I would not have accepted the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I didn't believe but what the property was there, but I thought there was something wrong with the deeds—that informa<lb/>tion came to me somewhere about March, 1886—the prisoner was then spoken to about this, and he said he would take the mortgage over himself as he knew it was perfectly right—my solicitors completed the transfer in July, 1886—this is their bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that would reach my hands about the same time—I believe I was in Manchester when I first saw the deeds upon which the advance was made in February, 1884—I don't know whether I was told at that time that Haynes was going to the Cape—I could not really say when I first heard about the Cape—the prisoner is married and has a family, he has visited me when I was living at Ealing—I know that after this money had been paid to me, Messrs. Pitts and Savage retained the requisition of title and the abstract of title—I would not express an opinion whether it is usual to give those documents up upon the transfer of a mortgage—I put myself in communication with Mr. Glyn, and he showed me the deeds, and I inspected them—I did not see the deeds in the hands of Pitts and Savage till after that—Pearson has been constantly writing in my presence, daily—I don't remember saying at the Mansion House that I didn't recognise the answers on the requisition as the writing of Pearson—I don't remember being asked that—during the last few days I have communicated with Pearson as to why he wrote them—after Mr. Nether<lb/>clift had been employed by the prisoner to look at the writing, then I knew it was Pearson's handwriting, but not before—I did not know these deeds were at Glyn's, but I was informed Messrs. Glyn had advanced 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon some documents upon which my name appeared, and I went to see them—when I send securities to the bank I always get an acknow<lb/>ledgment back from them—I have not got the receipts from the Man<lb/>chester Bank—they say they cannot find ever having received any of these deeds—I got a list from the Capital and Counties Bank after the deeds were transferred to them—I could not say that I found these very deeds in that list.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the time I wrote the cheque for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was at Ealing—I cannot say when I first heard the name of Haynes mentioned</p>

I am a solicitor, and a member of the firm of Pitts and Savage, of London Road—we have for some time acted as soli<lb/>citors for Mr. Newnes—in July, 1886, I received instructions from him as to a supposed mortgage of the Ardwick property—I got authority from Mr. Newnes to get from his bankers this conveyance from Cripps to Haynes, and also the abstract and requisition of title—I am acquainted with the prisoner's writing—the questions in the requisition I believe to be in the prisoner's writing—in consequence of what Mr. Newnes told me I communicated with the prisoner, and saw him several times at my office—Mr. Newnes handed me a letter from the prisoner asking to be allowed to examine the transfer of property, and I then wrote to him; he wrote to me the letter that has been read, and this is my reply—it was arranged that a draft of the mortgage to him should be made, and that he should take it over—before the completion I made inquiries as to Cripps and Haynes—I went to Manchester, and made inquiries through a solicitor there—I did not go to Ardwick—I was not able to learn anything about Cripps and Haynes—I saw the prisoner on 23rd August, after coming back from Manchester—I told him what I have just stated with regard to my inquiries at Manchester—he then said that the mortgagor was a personal friend of his, and that he (the prisoner) had been collecting the rents of this property under a power of attorney for Haynes—I told him I believed the property and the mortgagor to be fictitious; he said the property was a most eligible security, and that he was anxious to get a transfer of it—I ultimately received a cheque from him through the post for 574<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest and costs, and I forwarded him the deeds B and C, also the requisition and abstract of title—he asked for them, and threatened proceedings by letter and also verbally; I declined to give them—this letter of 24th August, 1886, is my writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Hankinson was the solicitor at Manchester that I went to see; I went no further—I told Mr. Newnes exactly what took place at my interview with the prisoner—I told him what my belief was, after I had been to Manchester—when a transfer of mortgage takes place it is usual to give up all the papers connected with the transaction—Mr. Newnes handed me a letter from the prisoner dated 28th July, 1886—the transfer had not been completed till the cheque of 27th August, 1886—this letter was my first knowledge of his wanting a transfer of the mort<lb/>gage—I looked into the matter, and found that he had given the reason that the loan was for a certified time—I proceeded to get the money for him and prepare the transfer—he objected to the form of the transfer—I would only waive any objection on his signing this document (<hi rend="italic">marked J</hi>)—I saw him sign it on 23rd August, it was prepared in my office. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi> "I am willing to accept a transfer on the understanding that it is in statutory form.") I made an objection to the amount of the stamp—I wanted the transfer to show on its face the irregularities in the title—I filled up the body of it and he signed it—I do not remember whether the documents were done up in brown paper when I got them from the bank—the abstract and requisition were included—I believe they were in a</p>

I am a solicitor, of 11, Birchin Lane, and am one of the firm of Murray, Hutchins, and Stirling, solicitors to Glyn, Mills, and Co., bankers—in the beginning of this year we were consulted by Messrs. Glyn Mills about the loan of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which remained unpaid on these deeds—I made inquiries on the subject—on 11th March, 1887, I wrote this letter to the prisoner for payment. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that, having made inquiries, they were unable to find such persons at Charles Francis Haynes or Cripps or any such property as was represented.</hi>) On 7th March, 1887, I received this reply, stating that he would go down and investigate the matter—on the 17th I wrote again, stating; that unless we received satisfactory information we would take such steps as we might be advised—some time afterwards I saw the prisoner, my clerk, Styleman, was present—I showed the prisoner the deeds B and C, and the signa<lb/>tures to the attestation—I don't think he made any remark about his handwriting, he treated it as a matter of form—I made this memorandum of what passed at the time on 22nd March. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Haynes had gone to the Cape about three years ago. Cripps and Haynes came together; I was acting for Mr. Newnes. Mr. Newnes lent the money to Haynes. I acted for Haynes, who wanted to borrow money on the property. I did not prepare the conveyance of Cripps to Haynes, Haynes brought it to me; they brought me the conveyance unstamped. I believe Mr. Newnes was not present when the deed was executed; it was executed on 20th February; there were two abstracts with the deeds. I handed the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Cripps, and Haynes provided the 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Very likely I received the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Newnes before the execution of the deed. I did not see the property, and never made inquiry as to the addresses on the mortgage. I know Pitts and Savage; he said they had made inquiry about the property and could not trace it, but I did not think it worth while to make it myself. I knew of the result of the inquiry before the result of the mortgage. I deposited the deeds with Glyn's.") That is the substance of what he stated to me—it was in answer to questions b—except</p>

I live at 20, Prince of Wales Crescent, Kentish Town, with my mother-in-law—on 23rd April I went into my room on the ground floor, where I slept, at 11, and went to bed—a few minutes after 11 I heard a knocking at the street door, and then heard the door fly open and hit the wall, and then some one tried the door of the room that I was in—I commenced screaming, and some one in the passage called out "What is the matter?"—then I heard some one turn to the street door and try to fasten it, and I heard a man say "I am going to bed"—I heard a man's footstep going up the stairs, and I ran out into the street and called for Mr. Walton at No. 22, next door—he came in, went upstairs, and brought down the prisoner and detained him until the policeman came—he was asked why he was there, and he said he did not know; he had made a mistake—he was quite sober—he was kept till my brother-in-law came home, and given into custody.</p>

On 2nd June Cox gave me information—I went to 32, Jewin Street, and saw the prisoner there—I said "I believe you have got some bad money on you"—he said "I have not"—I said "Turn you pockets out," and he turned out one, which was empty—I then said "What about the other?"—he said "All right; I will let you know about the others; I have got some"—I took him to Moor Lane Station, searched him, and found these 25 florins in his left trousers pocket, done up in four packets, with paper between each florin, and eight shillings in the same pocket done up in the same manner—before the Alderman he said "If I can clear myself will I get clear?"—he was asked his address at the station—he said "I refuse to give my address, as my mother is ill; she has been confined"—he was charged before a Magistrate the same day, and asked to be allowed to make a statement in private, which he did in my presence, and I took down what he said—this is it: "Yesterday afternoon I met a man who makes this bad money in Hoxton Street, Ivyhouse public-house—we went there in St. John's Road, and a gentleman came in with him, very fair, and had a conversation with him, after which the maker's foreman told me that this man wanted 20 load to take to Manchester Races with him, and that I was to go to a man named John Brampton, and to bring them away with me, and he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my trouble, and I was to have met him this morning at the ice cream shop in Jewin Street, when the officers came in and took me to the station before the man came."—I found a good half-crown upon him—he said to the Magistrate "If I can bring the makers to justice will you let me off?"—the Magistrate said, "I cannot make any promise of the sort; you need not say anything unless you like"—that was a voluntary statement on his part.</p>

About 24th April I received this memorandum from Holroyd and Co.—about 11th May, in consequence of a communication I received, I went to Ashton-under-Lyne, and called at 21, Warrington Street, the address of Holroyd and Co.—I did not find any Holroyd and Co. there, it was a butcher's shop; I then called at No. 11 twice, but never saw Holroyd and Co. there, or the prisoner—I don't believe there is any such firm in existence—it was solely on the prisoner's representations that I parted with my goods—I have since disposed of the 15 tons to the Atlas Paper Mills Co.</p>

I am a seaman—I was discharged on 7th June—I am now living at 6, Harris Terrace—on 7th June I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the shipping master on Tower Hill, and next day, the 8th, I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the rest of my pay, from the same man—when I went on the 8th the shipping master was very busy, and I did not have a chance of seeing him, So I went up the street and told my shipmates about it—I saw the prisoner at the gates when I was talking to my mates, and he said he was going to bring me down and see me all right—he was quite a stranger to me; he heard me talking about the money—I followed him up the steps, and we went round a corner, and he asked me where I was going to bank my money—I told him I did not care about banking my money, and he told me to bank 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, so that when I had spent the other money I should have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fall back on—I told him to bank it in the Board of Trade Bank, because the prisoner was a Board of Trade man—I knew that, because he had a uniform on—I agreed to give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was going to bank it for me—after that we had a couple of drinks, and I gave the prisoner 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his trouble for banking it—this was in the evening—I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and shook hands with the prisoner, and said "Take care of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he slapped his hand on his pocket, and said the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all right—a mate of mine, Johnson, was there at the time; he is not here now—the prisoner did not tell me his name; he had mine on an envelope—I knew how to find him again by his features—he gave me an address when I gave him the money—he said he would see me again in about a quarter of an hour—I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a post-office—I told him to bank it in the Board of Trade Bank—I did not know where that was—when he told me to wait for a quarter of an hour, and he would give me a receipt, I said I did not like to wait so long, because the cab was waiting, and I asked him to call down next day—I went down again on the Saturday and went into the inquiry office at the Board of Trade, but I could not find the man—the 8th was a Wednesday—on the Satur<lb/>day they asked me if I were to see him whether I should know him again—I said "Yes"—they told me to come down on Monday at 11 o'clock—I did so, and they brought a man before me, and directly I came inside the door I said "There is the man I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to"—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up of three sovereigns and four half-sovereigns—I was with him 10 or 15 minutes on the 8th—he said by putting 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Board of Trade Bank I could draw it out in any part of the world—I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

On 20th June, about 2.15 p.m., I saw the three prisoners together in Cheapside—they went into a public-house in Honey Lane Market, and then into a silk warehouse in Lawrence Lane, and then to a large warehouse, 14, Gresham Street and then to another warehouse on the opposite Bide; then to Messrs. Bradbury's in Aldermanbury, where they stopped about half an hour—after they left I spoke to the manager—I then followed them into Basing hall Street; then to a public-house in London Wall; then to a warehouse in Gresham Street; then to Wood Street Square, to a silk warehouse—they came out and went into another silk warehouse next door—they then went to a public-house in Monkwell Street, and back to Graham Street and Old Change, where two of them went into Sharp, Ferris and Company's ware-house—they then went to David Evans and Co.'s, and then to Messrs. Cook's where Wilson and Cleveland went in and Ward remained outside—I went into the warehouse and saw Wilson and Cleveland in a corner to the right where there were a large number of parcels of silk—they were lifting up their dresses, readjusting their jackets, and looking about—they spoke to one of the assistants and went outside—Ward joined them, and the three went a few yards and stopped in Cannon street—Wilson looked round and appeared to be watching Messrs. Cook's premises—they again adjusted their dresses, and Ward lifted up her jacket—they all seemed as if they were hiding something—gentle<lb/>man from Messrs. Cook's spoke to me, and they walked away; Wilson towards the Mansion House Station, and Ward and Cleveland into Old Change—I followed Wilson called a uniform constable, and then said to Her "You are suspended of stealing a parcel of silk from Messrs. Cook's Warehouse just now, and you must come with to the police-station"—she said "I have not stolen any Silk"—I sent her to the station, and went after the other prisoners who were in Old Change talking to Mr. Adams—I said "You are suspected of stealing something from the ware-house just now; you will have to come with me to the police-station"—Cleveland said "I don't know what you mean"—Ward said "I was not inside the warehouse, Sir"—we started for the station, but they stopped and refused to go on—Cleveland had her purse in her hand, and dropped a half-sovereign—I saw it roll and turned to pick it up, but did not—I turned round sharp and saw this roll (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at Wards feet—I said "You will be charged with stealing this"—they were searched at the station, and this apron was found upon Cleveland with this pocket in it.

I am a shoeblack, and live at 12, Wellington Square—I know all the prisoners by sight—on 18th June, about 11.15 p.m., I went to the Olive Branch, Gray's Inn Road, with Parkinson—I should not like to swear that the other two prisoners were there—I heard Park<lb/>inson ask James for a penny for beer—James used a bad expression,</p>

               <p>and told him he worked for his money the same as he did—a few words passed, and Parkinson struck James—James wanted to strike him back, but me and another man prevented him—after that I saw James hit, and he staggered back against the wall—he then went outside, and I saw Parkinson strike him, but I did not see him on the ground—I do not know whether the other two prisoners were there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). About 7 o'clock on the evening of 1st June I was at the corner of Liverpool and Broad Streets, and saw the two prisoners standing outside Bishopsgate Station, Metropolitan Railway, talking together—that is where omnibuses stop to pick up passengers—the footway at that time was very narrow, in consequence of the space in front being made into shops—as they were talking I noticed Mrs. Armour standing just in front of the prisoners, holding a child by each hand—the male prisoner stepped away from Day about two yards—Day went up close to Mrs. Armour, pushing up on her right-hand side, and while she was pushing up I noticed her hands at the folds of Mrs. Armour's dress, near the pocket—Day then turned round and motioned with her head to the male prisoner, who was about four yards off, nodding twice—an omnibus came up going westwards—Mrs. Armour went towards it with her children, and Trequelle placed himself close to the step; Day pushed up behind Mrs. Armour on her right-hand side—I next saw her hands again in the folds of Mrs. Armours dress, the same part on the right-hand side near the pocket—just before that I noticed Outram just behind me—we spoke together; I ran round the front of the omnibus by the horses' heads, and when I got to the entrance of the omnibus I could</p>

               <p>not see either of the two prisoners nor Outram—I communicated with the omnibus, and in consequence of what I was told I went after Outram and found him half way up Liverpool Street, about 50 yards off—I saw the two prisoners walking together, and I rushed across and laid hold of Day, and Outram laid hold of Trequelle—Day had this purse in her right hand—She was also carrying a sealskin bag—I said to her "What about this purse?" she said "That is my purse; how dare you?"—I said "What does it contain?" she said "Five or six shillings"—I kept hold of her hand all the way to the station with the purse—Outram had hold of Trequelle, he was struggling violently—another officer, Dowse, came up, and the prisoners were taken to the station—I examined the purse at the station, it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a Civil Service Supply ticket made out to Mrs. Armour, and a quantity of memoranda—shortly after Mrs. Armour, came to the station and identified the purse and its contents—some ques<lb/>tions were asked her by the inspector, after which Day said "That is my purse, I picked it up"—I had watched her the whole time, I did not see either of the prisoners stoop at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was on the other side of the road—there was only one omnibus there, I am certain—it is the usual spot for omnibuses to take up—there is a policeman in the middle of the road more particularly to keep his eye on the traffic and assist passengers across the road—there were other vehicles in the road, and six or seven persons on the pavement on the side the omnibus was—Outram was not on duty with me, he was there on his own account—the omnibuses which pick up at the place where the prisoners were standing go to all parts of the metropolis—I have noticed people go up to an omnibus, speak to the conductor or look at the destinations, and finding it is the wrong omnibus go back to the pavement—Mrs. Armour and her children and about one other person were going towards the omnibus—I was on the other side of the street, I could see pretty clearly—I was not in uniform—Day knew I was a policeman; she could not see from my clothes that I was—at the station she said "That is my purse, I picked it up"—Mrs. Armour said she was not certain if the purse was in her hand or if she had dropped it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). A little before 7 o'clock on 1st June I saw the two prisoners in Liverpool Street—I saw Trequelle push in front of a lady, not Mrs. Armour, about to get into an omnibus, while Day put her hands in the folds of her dress—they then stepped on one side and stood talking together for a short time, when I noticed Mrs. Armour standing there with a child in each hand—Trequelle stepped in front of her, and Day pushed up on the right-hand side of her and put her hands in the folds of her dress—she then looked towards the man and nodded—as Mrs. Armour went to get into the omnibus Trequelle stopped in front of her, and Day pushed up on the right-hand side of her and put her hands in the folds of her dress—I noticed Sager was watching them, and spoke to him—I was in plain clothes—the prisoners turned away from behind the omnibus—they did not see me speaking to Sager—Sager went to the omnibus, and I followed the two prisoners up Liverpool Street—I was afterwards joined by Sager, and from what he</p>

               <p>told me I went with him and caught hold of Trequelle—I said to him "I am a police officer; I must take you into custody for being concerned with this woman in stealing a purse from a lady"—he struggled hard to get away, and said "What do you mean?"—Dowse, another constable in plain clothes, came up and assisted me to take him to the station—he struggled violently to get away—at the station I heard Day say it was her purse and it contained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Day said nothing about the purse when she was arrested first of all—Trequelle at the station said, also "That is her purse, it contains 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—after Mrs. Armour had come to the station and said she did not know whether she had it in her pocket or dropped it, then Day said she picked the purse up—Trequelle was asked his name; he waited for some time, and at last he said "Charles Trequelle; you can call it Treacle if you like"—he is English—the inspector asked his address; he said "I will not give my address"—Day was asked her name; she said "I will not give any name either," but afterwards she said "My name is Day."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say before the Magistrate that Trequelle said it was the female prisoner's purse and contained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was only corroborating Sager then—the lady was not present when he said that—Sager and Dowse were present—I was close to the prisoners when I first saw them—when Day put her hand into the folds of Mrs. Armour's dress I was in the road—they were pushing up behind the omnibus—the lady would be between me and the prisoners, and a few persons also getting into the omnibus—I have been some time in the force, and keep a sharp look-out—the prisoners walked fast up Liverpool Street; I told the Alderman so.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook and ship steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Lady Doug<lb/>las</hi>, of London, a British ship—on 11th January last we sailed from Gascoigne, in Western Australia—the prisoner Cocks was the captain, Evans the mate, Gleaves second mate, and Webster an ordinary seaman—there was also David Thow the carpenter, and three able seamen, one an Englishman named Charles Hunt, Carl Christian son, a Norwegian, and Spitz, a German; and also two apprentices named Smetherst and Collinson, and two Malay seaman, Hassin and Cassin—I am a German—about two days before we reached the Cape of Good Hope Hassin behaved very strange; he was excited, just as if he had something to hide—he did his work as far as I know, I cannot say as to that—all at once, one morning before we reached the Cape, he disappeared, and after searching we could not find him—about 10 days afterwards the second mate found him sleeping down in the fore peak—we did not call at the Cape—I did not see him in the fore peak, but I saw him on deck when he was speaking to the captain; the captain asked him why he had stowed himself away in that manner, and he said that he was sick and that the captain was stupid; the captain said if he was sick he ought to have turned into his bunk or told him and he would have given him medicine—he asked him if he would do it again, and he said he would not, and Evans, the second mate, also asked him and he promised not to do so again—the captain then ordered some food to be given to him, and some water was brought and he washed himself, then he went to his work again—this was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—he then turned to work till 4—the next day we missed him again, and a seaman saw him down in the fore peak again; he had then with him a carving-knife which he had stolen out of the galley, and his own knife—the captain spoke to him while he was down there and asked him why he did it again and told him to come up, but he refused, and defied anyone to come down; he said "Suppose I kill one, I die"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two knives—the captain told him to come up lots of times, and tried by every persuasion to get him up, but he refused still—the captain then ordered the carpenter to batten the hatch down, as we did not know what his intentions were—the next morning we opened the hatch, and the captain and chief officer asked him again to come up, and he would not come—Gleaves also asked him to come up—on that occasion I went down in between decks, the second place on board from where he was, and tried to go down and secure him, but he had a knife in each hand—on going down I had to lower myself eight feet, and the captain said to me "You had better not do it, it is too dangerous"—I then went on deck—the captain was down there also, and he tried to frighten him with his revolver, and told him if he did not come up he would shoot him, and he</p>

               <p>fired into the coals to frighten him, but it had no effect on Hassin; we asked him a minute or two afterwards to come up, and he said he would not—the hatch was then shut and we left him for two days without any food or water, on purpose to see whether he would come up—we then wanted some coals which were in the fore peak where Hassin was, and the captain asked him to let us get the coals, but he would not let any<lb/>body come down; then he asked the captain to give him some water and he would fill the buckets with coals—the buckets were then filled with coals and he was supplied with water and biscuits—he stopped down there between a fortnight and three weeks, and during that time we sup<lb/>plied him with biscuits and water—he was kept battened down, in the day<lb/>time the grating was put over—during that time he supplied us with coals when we wanted them—one morning I saw Hassin on deck in the custody of Thow and Gleaves, and I was present when they took him from outside the ship, hanging by his hands—the captain told me that he awoke of a sudden and found some one touching his hand, and believed it might be one of the Malays, and sung out to the second mate's watch, which was on deck, and within that time; when the captain came up the carpenter and second mate had secured Hassin—this was in the morning about half-past 4—he was then put, with irons on his hands, in between decks, in the fore peak—I think these irons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the same—by in "between decks" I mean the upper compartment in the fore peak—I understand this drawing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), this would be the first compartment, and then underneath that is the second compartment, and then there are the coals, and he was down below on the iron frame—this is the only way down to the fore peak—this is the bulkhead which separates the fore peak from the hold—the deck goes the whole length of the ship—the irons were put on his wrists, and he was battened down that night—next day we found he had slipped them and was between decks—the same irons, by the captain's orders, were then put round his ankles, and the next morning he was in the same place, but he had got free of the irons—the captain then ordered irons to be put round his legs—there were two pieces of iron on each side of his legs, and a chain in between which was secured to a big block between decks—he remained secured in that way about a fortnight or three weeks, and Mr. Evans got the full allowance of food from me and gave to him—during the last part of the time he said to the captain that he was sick, and he gave him medicine, and more liberty, by leaving the hatch open—he was asked on several occasions if he would work, and he said he did not want to do so—either when he was secured like this, or when he had stowed himself away, I could not say exactly which, we were off St. Helena, and I recollect the crew speaking to the captain—they wanted him to put into St. Helena and put the Malays on shore, for they didn't trust themselves that they were safe, and they would sooner work the ship with less hands on board, but the captain said that he could not land them there; he would have to take them to England, and if there was a fault to find with him they could find it out in London—about a fort<lb/>night or three weeks after he had been in irons I saw him one day out of irons in the old place where he had been confined, at the bottom of the forepeak, and he had again the carving knife and his own knife—he had given the carving knife up when he supplied us with coals and kept his own knife, and I found him on this day with the carving knife again,</p>

               <p>which had been kept in my galley—I mean by out of the irons, he was quite free—when we had him on deck one iron was fastened on one leg, and the other was tied up along the leg with string; he had got the chain away from his leg iron—when the captain saw him he asked him why he had done that, and told him if he would come up and work he would forgive him everything, but Hassin said he would not do so, and he said again "Suppose I kill one, I die"—the hatch was then closed, and a watch was kept on it during the night—I could not say exactly, but I think it was the same day we found him loose, the crew assembled in the cabin, and an agreement was come to amongst us that we should kill Hassin, because he was dangerous, and he seemed dangerous—when he was down below he seemed not to be human, but looked wild, and for that purpose we agreed to kill him, for our safety and the safety of the ship—after that the captain gave directions that if we could by any means get hold of Hassin to kill him—the other three prisoners were there when that direction was given, and when that agreement was entered into—on that day the captain made an entry in the official log, which I signed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the entry, and that is my signature—I saw the captain write this; it is his handwriting—I also saw these other signatures put to it by John Webster, James Gleaves, and Henry Evans. (<hi rend="italic">Entry read</hi>: "At noon Hassin got out of irons, and supposed to be provided with the means to enable him to do the same; the steward previous to this told me he had missed his carving knife from the galley, and the second mate, on looking down the forepeak, saw that Hassin was out of irons, and had got the knife in his possession. We, the undersigned, do hereby swear that Charles Hunt, A.B, has been an, accomplice of his, and at various times has been known by the under<lb/>signed to have given him things to enable him to get out of irons, one of the articles given to him being matches, thereby endangering the ship by fire, and has also been known to have given him a knife, and every day has been known to communicate with him, and has been known to incite the other coloured seaman Cassin to mutiny, and we all believe he is the cause of Hassin being in this mutinous state. I, the master, suggested to shoot him, Hassin; every one acquiesced with this suggestion, with the exception of Charles Hunt, provided he could not be secured by fair means.") Hunt was not at the meeting in the cabin, but I heard the captain ask him before the meeting if he would agree to do away with Hassin, and he said "No," he would not agree—the next day after this agreement was entered into the hatch was undone by the carpenter, and the captain asked Hassin to come up—I noticed then that the tarpaulin over the hatch was cut, and that in the night-time Hassin had tried to break through—when the tarpaulin is cut the hatch is easily lifted out—the captain then ordered the carpenter to open the hatch, and all the crew went forward except Hunt, he was at the wheel, but he afterwards joined us—the captain and mate and myself and the carpenter then asked him to come up, and told him if he would only come on deck and work nothing would be done to him, but he would not—the captain then told us to fill the place with water to get him up from below—first we used cold water, and then we used two buckets of hot Water—he then came from the lower compartment up on to the next one—I then went down 'tween decks, which would be the compartment above him, and tried to shoot him with the captain's revolver, which the</p>

               <p>captain had given me—I lowered myself down to try and get sight of him, and he then threw a piece of wood at me—I asked the captain for his revolver, to shoot him—the carpenter then came down and cut the planks between decks to get a sight of him; the captain told him to do that—when I was between decks I had a boarding pike in my hand, and Hassin caught hold of it, and wanted to draw it down, but I prevented it, and in his so doing he exposed his foot, and Evans fired at him with a gun loaded with shot, and wounded him in the foot—Hassin did not fall at all then—the captain and other officers asked him again to come up and he would be forgiven—he had the carving-knife in his hand then—the hatch was then secured for the night, and a watch was kept—I saw the knife in his hand in the morning when the hatch was taken off, but I did not see it at the time he was shot; nobody could see him then—next morning at 8 o'clock the captain and myself and the three other prisoners and the rest of the crew went forward, and the hatch was ordered to be removed, and Hassin was then lying 'tween decks—I could not say whether he was asleep or not—we afterwards found the carving knife alongside where he had been lying—I could not see whether it was in his hand then—the second mate Gleaves had an old gun, and Webster had the captain's revolver—as soon as the hatch was opened Gleaves shot the gun and struck Hassin by the side of his body—I could not say whether Webster fired as well—Gleaves told me afterwards that his gun was loaded with a slug—I could not say whether I heard more than one shot; we were all so excited—the captain then said "Who will go down and hook him on to something to bring him on deck?" and Hunt went down and a hook was put upon the irons of his leg, and he was hauled up by the crew—it was then that we saw the knife, Hunt fetched it up—when Hassin was on deck we noticed he was bleeding from a wound in the side, and he had also two small shot wounds in his foot—he appeared to be conscious and looked wild round about him—he did not speak—at that time all the prisoners and the crew were there—when we saw the condition he was in we all agreed that he was so badly wounded the best way was to kill him right out—no examination of the wound was made before that agreement was come to, nor were his clothes removed or any steps taken to see what the wound was like—Webster then having the revolver in his hand shot him in the head—I could not say whether he had had the revolver from the time Evans had fired at him—Hassin died about five minutes after that, and about half an hour afterwards the body was thrown into the sea, the irons having been taken off—I afterwards saw Evans bring a crowbar up from below—I had never seen it in Hassin's possession, but I saw it on the deck—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the captain's handwriting—these entries in the log book are in his writing—this is my signature to the entry of the 23rd—that was written after Hassin's death—I could not say if I saw the captain write it—these other signatures are those of Cocks, Gleaves, and the others.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. This was the first voyage I had made in the <hi rend="italic">Lady Douglas</hi>, and it was the first time I had sailed with Captain Cocks—I had gone out from England in her—she was a three-masted</p>

               <p>barque of 507 odd tons burden—that means she would carry a third more than her registered tonnage—eight men went out in the ship who could go aloft—I did not go aloft—there were not too many to work the ship—upon arrival in Australia the men refused to work, and there was an in<lb/>quiry, and five of the eight men were sentenced to imprisonment—I don't know whether they were discharged from the ship; they did not come back—I don't know that for the purposes of their sentence they are sent by a small steamboat 80 miles, and then they have to get back the best way they can—to replace those five men some Malays were taken on board at Gascoigne, and one of them tried to stab Evans because he would not let him go on shore—there was a boat alongside, and he wanted to go on shore, and Evans would not let him, and he then took his knife out and went behind him—I did not notice it until Smetherst called out to Evans, "Look out, he has a knife." and Evans turned round and got the knife from him and put him in irons—these Malaya are very nimble and also very quiet in their movements—they are deceptive rather in that way, you cannot trust them for anything—they all wear knives in their belts—the crew positively refused to have the Malay on the ship, and re<lb/>quested the captain to take him ashore, and he was taken ashore next day—I don't know that Hassin and Cassia came straight from a gaol—they were shipped a couple of days after this Malay was taken on shore—I noticed the strange behaviour of Hassin when the ship was 35 days out from Western Australia—we were coming by way of the Cape—we had had good weather all that 35 days—this crowbar was not down amongst the coals—I saw it several times on deck, where it generally was kept, on the forecastle head—I saw it there up to 14 days of Hassin being killed—I saw nothing of Hassin for 10 days—I could not say whether any person on the ship gave him food during that time, or whether he came up in the night and took food, but when he came up afterwards he said he came up in the night and stole water—I don't know how he got food during those 10 days—Spitz went down to get up coals just before he was discovered, and he saw nothing of him—he said that some one had put a bucket of water on the 'tween decks, and he thought there was something extraordinary, and then the mate saw Hassin sleeping on the coals—I heard Hassin say that when Spitz came down for the coals he was very near to him, and if he had touched him he would have killed him—I have not had any experience of Malays, and I do not know much about their passions or their temperament—when Hassin came up food was given to him, and he was told to wash, and he was put on a two hours' watch and was properly treated, and no punishment was given him, but he only remained a few hours in that way, and off he went down amongst the coals again the next day—the fore peak is the space of the ship in front of the mast—there is a ladder from the deck hatchway to the 'tween deck but not below that—the fore peak is a water-tight com<lb/>partment, and is separated from the other part of the ship—you have either to sling or jump down from the 'tween deck to the coals—we used to sit down on the 'tween decks and jump down—any one sitting in that position could be easily killed by a person below, he would be perfectly defenceless—when he was discovered, after the 10 days, an examination was made below, and biscuits and empty bottles were found there—it is easy to get up from below, berause the ship being lower at the bow you can step on the plates and climb up to the hatchway, and then swing</p>

               <p>yourself up—the coals are pulled up by a line on to the deck—I did not miss my knife the first time, when we thought he had committed suicide, and when the mate found him, but he must have taken it with him on the second occasion when he went away—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my carving-knife, and this is the knife he wore in his belt—my attention was not called to whether or not the crowbar had gone with him on the second occasion or whether it was handed down to him—he was asked by the captain and crew two or three times a day whether he would come up, and was pro<lb/>missed if he did so no punishment would follow, but over and over again he said, "Me kill one, me die"—I understood by that that he meant to kill himself after he had killed one—the effect of this on the crew was that they could not sleep at all, they were afraid to take their usual night's rest, and one man would not go alone on watch, they were in great fear of Hassin—Cassin, the other Malay, had to go and sleep in the çaptain's cab in at night; that was requested by the crew, as they thought for their safety—Hassin looked something like a madman—I had seen a strange appearance about him before he was missed for the 10 days—there were no indications of madness about Cassin, but the crew made the captain put him in his cabin at night, as they were afraid there might be some communication between them—although we did not see Hassin smoking, we smelt he was smoking—Hunt told me that when Hassin was secured the second time, with irons on his legs, he went down to get up coals, and that he left a box of matches there, and gave him some tobacco—it is necessary to have matches to get coals in this place, it is so dark—after he was dead I found a large quantity of firewood col<lb/>lected down there, which I should have in my galley for my fire, and he had also clothes down there—the place 'tween decks was where the ship's tar, and tarpaulins, and stores were kept—after the man was dead I found his trousers were smothered with tar from the tar barrel there—when he was secured the captain ordered him to have his clothes and blankets to lie on—he over and over again said he would not go to London, and said, "Me kill one, me die"—I did not hear him myself knocking with the crowbar against the bulkhead of the ship—when this fear had spread amongst the ere w, Hunt supplied them with tomahawks for their own defence—I could not way whether he had one himself—I saw the cuts in the blanket, Collinson showed them to me, and I was told that the prisoner had come up and done them, but the apprentice was not sleeping in his bunk, but somewhere else for safety—a grating was put over the hatchway in the daytime, so that air could go down, and there being no mark of the grating having been removed in the night, he must have concealed himself on deck on the occasion when the captain felt his hand upon his arm—after he was dead I found these pieces of twisted wire down where he had been, I think they could be made by a dextrous man to open the keys of the handcuffs—the crew were of opinion that he was so badly wounded, and near dying, that it would be a mercy to him to put an end to him—I could not say that before that Hunt said anything about throwing him overboard while he was alive, and that Evans objected, and said it would be better to kill him—I have seen Hunt dancing about in front of the captain, and saying he would meet him in London; that was before Hassin was killed—I have heard Hunt on several occasions swear about the captain one day, and then perhaps next day swear at him—I have stated that for two whole months the ship</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188706270042"/>
               <p>was in a state of alarm, and that the crew believed one of them was helping Hassin to get out of irons, that was the most belief—it was almost im<lb/>possible to get the men to go aloft, they always feared they might meet the Malay when they came down—we were short-handed after having got two Malays in place of five seamen—we believed all our lives were in danger every day by the Malay, and I believe so now, and I would have done just the same as the men now on charge—the log was kept in the usual way, the entries being made every 24 hours.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. No one was sent down into the forepeak after Hassin was pulled in from over the side of the ship, and before he was put down there again—he had his own knife with him at that time when he was on deck—he gave the carving knife up when he gave up the coals for food before the second confinement—I do not know of anybody going down into the forepeak and looking round there before he was taken down—I saw the irons on his legs afterwards, and I saw canvas had been put round his legs also, in order to prevent the iron from chafing him—he might have stove in the side of the ship with that crowbar—that could not be done noiselessly, but he could do it during the night—during the last two nights before he died, we had a watch on deck—with the crew we had on board it was necessary sometimes for the whole of them to be aloft—I have not heard Hassin saying his prayers, or anything to enable me to judge of his religion—I did not hear him making any noise before he was pulled up on deck, or while he was on deck—battening down the hatch morely means fastening the tarpaulin over the hatchway—there are some irons outside, and the tarpaulin goes in them, and they are plugged up with wooden plugs—if the tarpaulin was cut, he could lift the hatch and get out—you have to drop from the lower deck to the bottom, there is nothing between them—these stringers are iron plates put up to strengthen the bows, but they don't come right across—you cannot see them as you look down—if anybody went through the hatchway he would fail to the bottom—Hassin was frequently under these iron plates when we looked for him, and we could not see him; and he made himself a hole under the bottom one, so that when we looked down the hatch we could never tell under which plate he might be.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. The forepeak was the only place where coals were kept, and for two or three days cooking had been put an end to, as we could not get any coals, and when they did come up the smell from them was so foul I could not keep myself in the galley; I got sick over it—when the crew came aft to the captain at St. Helena, Hunt was spokesman, and I think he said he wanted the Malays put on shore on account of the great danger the crew ran—Evans's gun was loaded with small shot when he fired at Hassin—I did not see Evans save Hassin from committing suicide, but I heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Hunt requested the captain to put in at St. Helena, and put the Malays on shore, because they were dangerous—before he went up to the captain and put the request, they all agreed and asked me if I thought the same, and I said "Yes, by all means"—I could not say the date of that—when Hassin was pulled up on deck one of the irons was locked on him, and one was tied by a string—he must have done that himself—the piece of iron that was found might possibly unlock the handcuffs; I have never tried it—Thow had charge of the tools—he had</p>

               <p>a carpenter's chest with him, and he gave out the tomahawks to the sailors—Collinson, the apprentice, and Christianson took them—one was a chopper, and one a mawl—when I say Hasain was mad, he was inhuman in his behaviour, he had such a strange manner, he could not look in anybody's face, he seemed as if he wanted to bide something—I have several times asked him questions, and he would not look at me, and went away.</p>

I was carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Lady Douglas</hi> on the voyage home—I am a Scotchman—I knew the man Hassin who was killed—he disappeared, and we thought he had committed suicide—after that he was put in irons—I saw him on one occasion come from the captain's cabin; I don't remember the date—it was one morning between 4 and 5—he went over the ship's side—he was pulled back, and was taken aft, put in irons, and put in the forepeak—I remember the 21st April, when the agreement was made to kill him—the captain asked if we were all agreeable to do so—we said of course something had to be done to secure the man as he was in a wild state—we agreed that he should be killed—this entry was made in the official log, and I and the other men signed it—that same day I went down between decks and cut out three planks so as we could get better at him, to get hold of him—he was at one side of the ship, just wanting a chance to get a dig at us with the knife—Evans was standing by to protect me while I was at work—after that he fired a gun and wounded him in the foot—I did not see it, but I saw the wound afterwards—he called out; I don't know what he said; I don't know the language—only that one shot was fired that day—the day after the Malay was lying in the forepeak, and Gleaves, the second officer, fired at him with a gun, it hit him in the side—I could not say what the Malay was doing at the time—I had</p>

               <p>just turned to other duties—I did not see him exactly at the time the shot was fired; I saw him just after; he was then lying down—Webster was then on deck—he had no weapon that I saw—Gleaves was the only one that had a gun that I saw—the captain had him revolver there—he did nothing with it—I saw Hassin hauled up on deck—I then saw the wound in his foot—I saw nothing of the wound in his side, because he had some clothes on—I could see by the blood that he was wounded—he was quiet at that time; he was alive—we passed the remark that it was a pity to keep him confined, and to kill him outright—we all agreed to that together—then Webster got the captain's pistol, and fired a shot at him in the head—I don't know how he came to get the captain's pistol; I suppose he had asked it from him—the Malay was then lying on the deck—I don't know how near to his head Webster put the pistol; he was some little distance—he died 5 or 10 minutes afterwards—before Webster fired at him nobody pulled up his clothes or examined his wound—I only saw the blood through the clothes—then they tied a weight to him, and he was thrown overboard—I do not understand navigation—I cannot point out the position of the ship at this time.</p>

I joined the ship on the outward voyage—that was the first time I served under Captain Cocks—I remem<lb/>ber the time when the Malay was missing, and it was supposed he had committed suicide or fallen overboard—he had a strange manner about him before that—after that he came on deck and worked for a few hours, and then went down again—I did not know that he had taken the carving knife with him—the crowbar was in my possession before that—with that crowbar he could easily have stove in the side of the bows—he might have stove in the bulkhead if he had had time, and made a hole in the ship—I did not see him use the crowbar against the rivets of the ship, but I heard him—that was after he had slipped the irons—I heard him knocking; I did not see him knocking the ship's side; I judged from the sound it was there—I was on watch on deck at the time—that was the night we were all on watch, the night after he had been found in the captain's cabin—I heard the captain call out—I did not see him running from the cabin—I saw him coming in the direction from the cabin—when I caught him he was outside the ship's chains—he had the knife on him then; that was his own knife—I did not see Collinson's blankets with cuts in them—we had not been without coal to cook our food with for two or three days, but we required coal at the time we asked him—he was supplied with food regularly up to the very last—he was told up to the very last that if he would come out and give up the knives he would have no punishment—I don't know the mean<lb/>ing of "running amuck"—for two or three days before his death the crew was in a state of alarm on account of him—we kept watch on the hatch for several nights to see if he tried to escape—when I was cutting the planks he tried to attack me with a knife—he was a source of danger to the crew and to the ship—I saw the knife protruding through the tarpaulin, and I tried to break it, and failed—I don't know what the shot was that wounded his foot—at the time he was taken up from the forepeak I saw from his appearance that he was dying—I have no medical knowledge—I knew that he had been shot in the side, and from his appearance I knew he was dying—I did not hear Hunt suggest that he should be thrown overboard—I did not hear any one suggest</p>

               <p>it, but I knew he would have to be thrown overboard—I did not hear Hunt suggest it before he was dead—when he was down in the fore-peak I asked him where he got the carving-knife—he laughed, and showed it to me, and said "One man die, me die"—he expressed that to me twice, when I asked him where he got the knife—every morning and night when he was given food he was asked to come up and give up the knife and he would not be punished.</p>

When he showed me the knife it was that way (<hi rend="italic">holding out his hand</hi>), and he said, "Suppose one man die, me die"—I was one of the men who assisted to pull him in from the ship's side, Gleaves was the other; he had not been hanging there over five minutes, we pulled him up close—after he came out of the cabin he got over the ship's side, and we immediately went and pulled him back, he had a box of matches under his armpit, I suppose they were cabin matches, they were Bryant and May's, there were no such matches anywhere else except in the cabin, that was the only place where they were kept—I had noticed the hatch the night before I saw him coming apparently from the cabin; I had battened it down myself under the belief that he was down there, the chief officer was with me—I saw it next morning after I saw him on deck; it had not been disturbed as far as I could see, it was quite clear that he was not down below when I battened it down—it was a day or two before he was shot that he refused to send up any more coal—he had sent them up previously, till he was confined in irons, after that he was not asked to do it, he could not, he was between decks then—while he was secured with the irons we were able to go down and get the coals ourselves; when he got free we could not go down and get them—he did not send up any more coal after he got free from the irons.</p>

When Evans fired the shot that wounded him in the foot Webster and I were close by—it was when I was between decks that he tried to make a drive at me—he made a blow at me three times before Evans fired, I don't know what sort of shot he fired with—one time, when he tried to jump overboard, Evans prevented him—the crew were afraid to come near him because he had a knife in his hand, and Evans ran and caught him—that was before he went below the second time—Evans did that at great danger to himself.</p>

On one occasion I was present when he attempted to stab the chief officer and Webster; they were trying to get at him, and he said, "If you come near me you shall die"—he then had a knife, not both knives—I don't know where he attempted to stab them, he made a run at them to get at them with the knife, they were all three down between decks at the time, the chief officer and webster; the Malay was down below, he was making an attempt to get up to them, and said somebody should die—he was not in irons then, that was before he came up the second time, before he had been put in irons—he flew at</p>

               <p>them with the knife, he repeated several times words to the effect, "I will kill somebody first, and die"—that was almost his daily word when asked to come up; he said it then—when I saw him on deck after he had been shot in the side we were all close by—when it was said it was better to kill him, and put him out of his misery, I don't know whether Webster said "Is that the determination of all of you?"—I did not hear him say so.</p>

When I say there was danger to someone, I mean if he had got out of the fore peak with his knife—I did not know till after he was killed that he had the crowbar down below—I had heard a knocking, he was hammering the ship's side on both sides—I did not afterwards go and look to see whether the ship's sides were damaged by the knocking—the ship was built of iron, about five-eighths in thickness—the bulkhead compartment was three-eighths or half an inch, I could not say exactly—the fore peak was a water-tight compartment, there was no lining—when the man was brought up on deck I thought he was dying by the looks of him—I did not look to see what sort of a wound it was, or feel his pulse, nobody did—I had seen a man die before, I have seen them fail from aloft and killed—I never saw a man killed by a gun-shot wound.</p>

Erard, of 23, Great Marlborough Street, that it was not one of their manufacture—some one in the room said nobody said it was Erard of Marlborough Street, but Erard of Paris—our trademark is registered—there is no other but this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that I know of registered—there is no Sebastian Erard a member of the firm now, he is dead, but the name adheres to the firm—I looked inside the piano; there was no impression of any trademark of ours inside it—that was only put in our Paris ones—this is the label we put on the fail of our Paris pianos; it is "Erard" without the "Patent" and "London"—the majority of piano-makers put the name on the piano in black and gold—we decidedly do not claim any special property in the black and gold—the label we put on the fail of the Paris pianos is usually a brass one—it is not usual to put a paper label on the Paris pianos—we make no Paris cottage pianos—this piano was a cottage—we have discontinued for some years making cottage pianos in Paris.</p>

Erard—we have only dealt with one label printer to my know<lb/>ledge—I have made no application to any printers as to when and where these labels were printed—we have not tried to ascertain where the, labels were printed; we have heard of them.</p>

                  </hi> I am an auctioneer, of Station Road, Finsbury Park—I have been there about seven years—I have known the two prisoners a few months—their place of business is a piano shop in Seven Sisters Road, Holloway—the name up there is Allen and Taylor, I believe—they have pianos, but not many in the shop—I bought a cottage piano there on 27th April, and paid 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—neither of the prisoners was there then—I sent that piano to Vale House, Tufnell Park, to be put in the sale of furniture there on 5th or 6th May—I sent it a few days previous to the sale, on the 4th or 5th—I saw it at Vale House on the day of the sale—on the fail was "Sebastian Erard, Paris"—I did not think it was an Erard, and I do not think anybody else would have thought so—I have never seen any other pianos in that shop with a similar label—I have seen loose labels at the shop on thin paper; some time in April, I suppose.</p>

I don't understand that I was threatened by Erard that if I did not disclose all about it I might be prosecuted—they summoned me to the police-court—when I visited the shop and saw these labels, and when I bought the piano, on 27th April, neither of the prisoners was there—I knew perfectly well when I bought this piano that it was not one made by Erard, of Marlborough Street—I believe they only put "Erard" on theirs—it was a new piano—I hold sales at my own place—I did not put it up for sale myself, but put it into somebody else's sale—that is not an uncommon thing to do—auctions are sometimes held without <hi rend="italic">stuffing</hi> of this kind—I put it in another auctioneer's catalogue, because the piano in the house was taken out, and the auctioneer asked me if I had a piano, and I put a better one in—I was present at the sale—the auctioneer told everybody that this was not one of Erard's make—I got this piano as cheap as I could—it was worth 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

I am a printer and stationer, at 186, Seven Sisters Road, next door to the prisoners, and I was asked by them, about 27th or 28th March, to manage the financial part of their business—on 1st April they ceased personally to attend to the business, but did not cease occupation—their names remain up now—on 27th April I was called into their shop and saw Mr. Denny, and made the bargain with him about the piano, and sold it to him—one of the men received the money—I afterwards had it, and I have accounted for it to the two prisoners—I believe when they left on 1st April there were two pianos for sale in the shop—I first saw piano labels in the shop somewhere about the time Mr. Denny came in—I had not looked for any before—there were workmen there—I did not print the labels; that is a different trade altogether—neither of the prisoners told me where they were printed—I did not ask them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. There were very few pianos sold unless I was consulted about the price of them—if any body came in and there was a fixed price, and the purchaser was willing to give it, there would be no necessity to consult me—the lowest price of the piano that Denny bought was more than 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was called in to authorise the fore<lb/>man to take less than 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know the piano sold on 27th April was neither of those two that I saw in the shop at the beginning of April—I know the partnership between the prisoners is dissolved, and the place but up—when I sold the piano there was no fail—it was not completed—the keys were exposed to view—I had nothing to do with fitting the fail afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Allen.</hi> I have been in the habit of selling pianos without labels—I have sold a great number on account of the defendants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The fail was put on afterwards, but not when I sold it—pianos are not sent away without falls, but the fail was no trade when I sold it—I first saw it that morning when I was called in; it had not been commenced the week before—the falls are not all the same size—the case of a piano can be made easy enough—it is taken into considera<lb/>tion in fixing the price that there will be a fail, it is easily taken off and put on.</p>

"—I said "That is better than nothing; why have you broken the chair?"—the deceased came into the room and said to the prisoner "You shall not break any more of my furniture, it belongs to me, I paid for it," upon which he threw her on the bed, and took up the back of a chair as if to strike her; I snatched it away from him and threw it under the table—after that he was quiet and I went up to my room—I went to bed, and heard nothing in the night, but about 4 o'clock in the morning I heard the bell ring and went down and opened the door, and saw the prisoner with his hands bandaged—I said "What have you done?"—he said "Emily is dead, burnt, at the hospital"—I said "Then it is you that has done it"—he said "Yes, she threw the lamp on me, and I threw it on her, and in the act of trying to save her from being burnt, I burnt my own hands"—I said "Why didn't you take a blanket and throw over her to save her?"—he said "It is done"—he said he was afraid the police would come and fetch him for man<lb/>slaughter, and asked whether he could come into my room to sit down I said "Certainly not, you have two beds in your own room"—I after<lb/>wards went into his room, and there saw a small kitchen lamp with no glass on it—the deceased was about 20 years of age—her name was Emily Pottle, but she passed by the name of Schultz.</p>

I have offices at Winchester House, Old Broad Street—about 11.5 p.m. on 13th June, I was in Oxford Street, near the Princess's Theatre, with my son—we crossed from the theatre side of the road to the other side, to avoid the people coming out; some man lurched against me—I put out my hands and said "Stand clear;" he said "I beg your pardon," and at the same time made a grab at my chain and pulled it off and ran away—he used so much violence that he tore out both pockets and my button-hole—I gave chase with my son—a policeman then ran across, and in the confusion the man was lost, the policeman being run over, and we had to help him into a cab—soon after I saw the prisoner in the custody of two constables—I was shown my watch next day, this is it, the value of the watch and chain is nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the confusion I cannot say who the man was who lurched against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness—I was with him and saw the prisoner about 12 yards from us, rolling about as if he were drunk—he came rolling up against my father and said "I beg your pardon, Sir"—I saw my father shove him off, and he made a snatch at my father's watch-chain and ran off with it—he walked a little, but when we turned to follow him, he ran up Oxford Street and down a turning; there were two constables at the bottom, and when he got nearly to them he turned round, and when he was near Oxford Street again he slipped over an area grating—I then saw a crowd round the constable, who was on the ground, and saw him put into a cab—I saw the prisoner four or five minutes afterwards in the custody of two con<lb/>stables—about half an hour later I went with a constable to the grating exactly where the prisoner had slipped, and the constable turned on his light, and the watch and chain were at the bottom—that was the exact spot where the prisoner had slipped.</p>

I did not do it"—I told him he must come back with me, and a Mr. Hart said "That is the man who snatched something of the gentleman up Oxford Street"—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to that—he became very violent on the way to the station, and it took three of us to take him, and he said what he would do for us—about half an hour afterwards young Mr. Balfour took me to the corner of Oxford Street and Soho Street, and pointed out an area to mo, I turned my light on and there found this watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner gave his address at the station 3, Rose Street, Soho.</p>

I live at 45, Bedford Gardens, Camden Hill, and am managing director of the Turf A B C Publishing Company, which was incorporated on the 17th January, 1887, as a limited company—the prisoner was a servant, manager from the beginning of the Company in January, 1887, and was bound to obey my orders and to do what I told him and act in every way as my servant—he gave the whole of his time to the company—Bonvalle is a carpenter who prepared the premises for the Company, and they owed him money, and on 25th February the prisoner asked me for a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Bonvalle, and then I drew in the prisoner's presence this cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., saying "This is a cheque for Bonvalle"—he made no answer but took it and went away—he had no authority to change it—his duty was to give it to Bonvalle—on 4th March the prisoner again asked me for a cheque for Bonvalle for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I drew this cheque in his presence and gave it to him—I said nothing then, it was understood that all cheques going through him were to be delivered to the persons for whom they were written, he had no authority to change them into money—his duty was merely to hand it over to Bonvalle—on 11th March I drew this other cheque in favour of Bonvalle for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner then said he wanted a cheque for Bonvalle—his duty was precisely the same as on the two previous occasions, to give it to Bonvalle—these cheques have been cashed by the Company's bankers and returned to me—all the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing and should have been paid to Bonvalle.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 47, Poland Street, Oxford Street—I became acquainted with the prisoner about March, and on 7th April he came to me and asked if I knew Holden Brothers and Mr. Kaye in Leadenhall Street—I said "Yes"—he said "Mr. Kaye has a daughter about to be married; have you anything suitable?"—I showed him a ruby suite, value 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which he took away for Mr. Kaye on approbation, and said that Mr. Kaye was a partner in the firm of Holder Brothers—he came back in the evening, and said that Mr. Kaye liked it, and I was to charge it to Mr. Kaye—I made out an invoice to Mr. Kaye, which he took away, and I posted another to Mr. Kaye at the same time—I believed that Mr. Kaye had a daughter about to be married, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188706270075"/>
               <p>that it was a bona fide order, or I would not have parted with the jewel<lb/>lery—Mr. Kaye returned the invoice with a note which I cannot find, but this is a copy from the letter-book. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mr. Kaye had not purchased the goods or authorised any one to do so.</hi>) I have not been paid for the jewellery or received it back—at the end of March the prisoner came to me and said that Mr. Greenhill, of Bramber Road, Fulham, wanted some things to give his wife—he ordered a pearl and cluster ring first, value 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a pair of earrings value 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he also had other things—I have not been paid for them or received them back—on 14th April he came and wanted a pin of some sort for Mr. Carruthers, of Bramber Road, Fulham—I showed him some, and he took away a sapphire and diamond cluster pin—I believed that that was a bona fide order—I made out the invoice to the prisoner and gave it to him, as he wanted an extra commission on it, and did not want the invoice shown—he asked for it to be made out to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A man named Millicent introduced the prisoner to me, he is a friend of a traveller of mine, Frank Taylor, who I have known for three years, but he is not in my service now—I never had any reason to suspect Taylor of dishonesty—the prisoner was introduced to me for the purpose of his introducing customers—I was to pay him 5 per cent. commission on some articles, and 2 1/2 on others—the first person he intro<lb/>duced was Mr. Struger, who purchased 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery—he paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and gave me bills for the rest, which were dishonoured—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice I made out to Mr. Kay on April 7th—it is dated April 14th, that is a mistake of my traveller who made it out—the prisoner has had three or four transactions with me for which he paid at the time—I made a charge against Mr. Kennedy, who I had known since the beginning of April, and had dined with him twice—I went on board his ship when I went to worry him for the money—I never went to theatres with him—I issued a warrant against him a few days after his bill was due—I never had a quarrel with him about a woman who had been with him in America—the prisoner proposed to me that Kennedy should give me a guarantee, and I went to Kennedy's office—I never asked the prisoner to assist me in prosecuting Kennedy—I accepted the guarantee, it was for 14 days—the Magistrate did not reprimand me at the police-court for the manner I was giving my evidence—I am prosecuting Kennedy on a charge of stealing the jewellery—I believe a man named Min swore at the police-court that I asked him to pledge the jewellery to obtain money for him—Kennedy's bail was 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each and himself in 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after the lapse of some days—24 hours' notice was given—the bail were perfectly respect<lb/>able men, but he was locked up for a fortnight—after I found Mr. Kaye had not ordered this jewellery I accepted the guarantee for what it was worth, and when I found it was of no use, which may have been six weeks afterwards, I issued the summons—I saw the prisoner frequently during that time; we went down together to get money from Kennedy—I did not frequently ask him for the money when I saw him, I under<lb/>stood that the goods were going to be returned, but nothing has been returned—he gave me no date when they were to be returned, and would not tell me where they were—he had a set of studs and a collar stud, on 7th April, which were paid for—my transactions with him for himself amounted to about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the jewellery was supplied for Greenhall it was for the purpose of seeing whether Greenhall would buy it.</p>
