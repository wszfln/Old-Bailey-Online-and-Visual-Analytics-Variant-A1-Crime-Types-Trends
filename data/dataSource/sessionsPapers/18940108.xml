                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Drewitt, a stationer in the Borough—we supplied this journal and this cash book to the prisoner; they are charged in our day book on March 24th, 1893—when we sold them there was a label inside the cover of each showing our name, the date when sold, and the stock number; those labels are not there now, but I can see an impression on the cover of each showing where the labels have been; I can read the impression of our name—the cash book was returned to us to be paged—the prisoner had dealt with us for many years—in May, 1884, this ledger was made to his order—these entries in our day book are in the writing of Francis Low; my employer—our account books are manufactured to stock numbers.</p>

                  </hi>. In March, 1893, I was employed by the prisoner as warehouseman—the warehouse was at 204, Bermondsey Street, and the office at 44, Borough High Street—towards the end of March there was a change in the business, and I became servant to Mr. Isaac Beeman, junior, the prisoner's son—about 20th or 24th March, some days before the business was changed, I received instructions from Mr. Springett—after that a warehouseman, Franklin, brought a number of books to the warehouse, and in consequence of my instructions from Springett I burnt the books in the warehouse yard—they were business books connected with Isaac Beeman senior's business—I did not look inside any of the books and cannot tell what they were—I had been in the prisoner's service since 1872, for twenty-one years—this was the first occasion I had ever destroyed books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hop merchant, and a member of the firm of Woodfield and Hanbury, of 25, Mark Lane, in the City—on 26th October I bought from the prisoner the thirty-nine pockets mentioned in this contract note sent to Asshenden, at £6 per cwt.; this is the invoice at that price, which works out at £373 14s.—I paid the prisoner that sum to be devoted to the purchase—on 6th October I made another purchase from the prisoner; I then bought nineteen pockets—on 13th October I bought fifty-one pockets; those two lots were invoiced together, and worked out at £401 1s.—I sent a cheque for that amount to the prisoner—I speak from this invoice; I may not have been there on the day the cheque was sent—the invoice shows the date the hops were paid for; they are taken from the books—I have no doubt my firm paid the amounts in this invoice—it was paid on the Saturday fortnight after the hops were sold; that is prompt payment—I did not give bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say the sale of 26th October was paid for on 12th November, because I see it written here, and I know the number of the cheque—we always pay prompt, unless it is a very large amount, and then we might have an arrangement to pay in a month or two—we never have running accounts—we might pay half down and half in two months—we do not, as a rule, pay interest in that case; we might make an arrangement—unless we do so, the factor does not get his balance for two months, and does not get interest for his money in that case—it is the practice for the factor to always pay the grower prompt—if we did not pay for the hops prompt the factor would not pay; I know he would not pay—it is put on the bought note as half prompt, half in two months; that is as between himself and me—I don't know anything of what there is between the factor and the grower; but I should not say that such an arrangement between them was at all uncommon.</p>

               <p>have dealt with the prisoner since 1876; he has sold my hops—on October, 1892, I left with him twenty-two samples of hops to sell for me—I received on October 7th this advice note, and on 22nd October this account sale, amounting to £188 9s., less charges £9 3s., and enclosing a cheque for £179 6s.—the purchaser was not mentioned in the course of the correspondence, and I did not know who he was—I thought this was the price the hops were sold for—all the knowledge I had was from this communication.</p>

               <p>after his first examination—I find no trace of it among the books; it is not part of a set of books—after his examination on 21st June, I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had given up all his books, except some which had been destroyed</hi>)—some memorandum books and cancelled counterfoil cheques came with that letter and the collecting book—there is no book to enable me to trace goods from the vendor to the purchaser—I communicated with the merchants and growers, and received from them the advice notes and contracts sent to them—on July 5th, in answer to a question of the Senior Official Receiver as to why he destroyed the books, he said there was no further use for them, and it was not pleasant to have old books overlooked—I sent him a requisition for a commission account of ail transactions on commission in 1892, and there has been a second requisition since that which I think extended the period to October—I got this answer to the letter of July 31st. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed an account of all sales in</hi> 1892 <hi rend="italic">up to the receiving order, and explained the practice of the trade in selling hops.—Signed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">ISAAC BEEMAN</hi>)—this is the account which he filed—the cases before the Court are cases in which he says "Taken into account by Beeman"—he does not give the name of the purchaser, but represents that Beeman and Co. are the purchasers—it was before I received that account that I communicated with the merchants and growers—the price per cwt. at which they were sold to the grower is given in the account, but not the price at which they were sold to the merchant; no book showing that has come into my possession, and it is not specified in any transaction—on August 2nd there was a further examination which I took, and put questions on the original contracts from the merchants which I had in my hand—I find entries of Pearson in the growers' ledger—the total price given here is £88—at the end of 1892 I find "Extra commission, differences, etc, £347 3s.," and commis<lb/>sion is charged in addition to that in different items—in 1891 here is a similar entry, "Commission, difference, etc, £786 14s. 6d.,"and in 1890 £2,097 3s. 4d., and commission is also charged—in 1889 there is entered "Extra commission and differences, £3,070 7s. 6d."—that is a very big year—commission is also charged that year—in 1888 here is "Extra commission, weight, etc., £2,250 4s.,"and in 1887 £1,601 8s.—in 1886 here £1,460 2s. in the same place, but there is nothing against it—in 1885 here is "Extra commission, profits, etc., £6,087 18s.,"and commis<lb/>sion is also charged—in 1884 here is "Extra commission, profits, etc., £1,804 8s. 9d,"and in 1883, £2,093 19s.—in Asshenden's account, folio 264, 12th November, 1891, here is a credit of twenty-eight pockets—that is posted into the book from another book—the name of the mer<lb/>chant who bought it does not appear—that book only contains the growers' names, not the merchants'—turning to Pearson's account in the ledger, page 420, under date of October 1st, there is a credit of ten pockets carried out, £81s. 13s., posted folio 360—that does not show what book that is contained in; it is not in any book that has been handed to me—I find in the ledger two posting folios, 360 and 297; those are the same folios as in the growers' account—I find the name of Thomas Asshen<lb/>den in the account sales book, folio 86, 28, Stern Street, Surrey, posted £361 12s. 7d.; after deducting commission and insurance, £343 13s. 6d., that is the net amount; the posting folios are 268 and 306—there are two references to books which have been destroyed, both in pencil—the</p>

                  </hi>. I was managing clerk to the defendant till he ceased business in March, 1893, and since then I remained in the same office until November in the employ of his son, who is now carrying on the business—I have been with Mr. Beeman about thirty years—I kept all the books except the cash book and some minor books—he would receive samples from the growers, and try and sell them—when he sold them he or I wrote out a contract note, and handed it to the merchant—they were torn out of a counterfoil book, and I kept the duplicates in the office—I believe the duplicates up to January, 1893, have all been destroyed—when a contract was made I posted the contract note into the ay book from she counterfoil—the day book would give the pockets, and the name of the buyer, and the grower, and the price—the duplicate contract would sometimes be marked with the folio of the day book, where it would be found, but not always—the journal had nothing to do with the contract note—after that I advised the grower—it would be posted from the day book to the journal—after the advice note was sent to the growers the hops would come up to our warehouse and would be weighed—the grower does not attend the weighing as a rule—the day of payment would be the second Saturday after the contract—when we are ready to send the money to the grower we send him an account sale—folio 74 contains an entry of the account sales—this 360 refers to the journal and 297 to the day book—the account gale book only shows what is returned to the grower—the day book shows, the merchant's name, and the price paid to the grower in the book destroyed—I believe a merchants' ledger was destroyed coming up to December, 1891, and a letter book and a collecting book and other books, but I was not present—the journal was sent down to the warehouse—the day book was sent down a month before—I made the entries in the day book, and continued to use the old one till I got the new one—in the account sales book the last entry, 371, refers to the journal on December 10th, 1892—the old journal was paged—there are hardly any transactions after December 10th, there is one on December 25th—the reference to the last page of the day book which is destroyed is November 19th, 1892, folio 308; the day book contained about that quantity of folios—the first entry in the new book is January 11th, 1893; that was made some time after the book was bought—I purchased it some time in February from Messrs. Drewitt and Co; it was before Hubbard's writ came to the office—I do not know the date when I bought the books; I am not prepared to say that I did not buy them at the end of March last year—I recollect sending one of them back to be paged—I copied the entries from the day book; the first entry was taken from the old book—this mark inside the cover is that of a bookseller's label, which I believe was on it when I got it, and I removed it at Mr. Beeman's suggestion—he did not assign any reason—that was soon after the books were bought—when I had copied the old books they were sent to the</p>

               <p>warehouse at Mr. Beeman's suggestion—in the big ledger at the end of the balance for December, 1892, here is "Extra commission and difference, £347," that was posted from the journal which is destroyed—the differences are between the price paid to the grower and the price obtained from the merchant—the details are not kept in any book; they would not be found in the journal, but the facts would be in the journal and day book—the contract made on October 26th is for the whole lump at one price—I wrote this advice sale at Beeman's suggestion—I was not in the saleroom when they were sold—I said before the Magistrate that varying the price would make it look like a better market transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What Beeman said was: "If you don't want the books any more they might as well be destroyed"—growers came to the office to press him to sell—the prices vary very much, and they are quoted in different papers—the growers discuss the price in the market when they bring the samples up, and if they do not sell promptly they will take it out of the agent's hands—I remember eight pockets of hops to Mr. Stuttle, the grower, being sold on October 22nd, 1892; they were taken over at £6 3s. on the joint account of the prisoner and Mr. Husband, and were sold by them at £6 per <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> on 22nd October the same year, which was a loss of 3s. per <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi>—the eighty pockets realised £768 188., therefore, apart from the ordinary charges, there was the difference between £779 11s. and the £768 actually realised; there was a loss on that transaction—in these transactions he ran a risk of winning or losing, according to the market value—it is the almost invariable practice to pay prompt on the second Saturday after the sale—it some times happened that he had to take acceptances—that was at nearly the same rate as the bank charges him—hose bills were sometimes renewed even in cases where he had to pay prompt to the grower—in December, 1890, Messrs. Collett gave an acceptance which bore no interest—that would appear in the old ledger—it is usual in the trade that credit is given for a short time without any charge—he takes the interest and he loses the risk—the defendant did not com<lb/>municate that fact to the grower—the growers expect their money down—the merchants' ledger went down to November, 1890, and the balances from it were carried into the new one—the ledger was full—from that time downwards every transaction between the defendant and the mer<lb/>chants appears in the ledger—the details of the contract sent to the merchant would be put into the journal and day book; no price would be put in the journal, but in the day book I should put the details, and the amount would be posted in the ledger—I should have the record in the ledger of what was in the day book—the growers' book goes back to 1858, and therefore the whole of the records between Mr. Beeman and the planters appear in the books—they only show the net amount, but in the other books the original prices appear—the collecting books are kept some considerable time, and then the merchants' and the planters' names are brought together—the same entry which appears in the day book would appear in the ledger—the ledger which is in existence would show the same as the journal, but it would not show the entries to the merchants—that would be in the merchants' book-Baker, White, and Morgan were dealing with Mr. Beeman, and if you look at the merchants' ledger, you will find the complete transaction, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189401080013"/>
               <p>would find the name of Pearson—I should then turn to the growers' book; she only difference would be that in one book would be the date of the sale, and in the other the date of the prompt—all the dates in the growers' book are on Saturdays, the second Saturday being the prompt—from the merchants' ledger, the growers' ledger, and the account sales book I can trice the whole particulars of any transaction, and the collecting book would show where I could find the names of any people brought together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In Asshenden's case there was a sale of hops on October 26th—that transaction gave the price per <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi>—I find that in the collecting book the entry is "November 4th, thirty-nine pockets, Asshenden, £374 14s."—the price per <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> is not given—I cannot tell it from any of the books preserved—I should not read the collecting book through to find the name of Asshenden; I should refer to the date—I find Dungey's name in the ledger by turning over two pages; it is not Henry Dungey—there are a great many Dungeys growers in Kent; we dealt with three or four, and this is Henry, I recollect—the Official Receiver would refer to Kennard's account in my book—the entry in the merchants' ledger is "October 11th, 1892, thirteen pockets, Dungey," not Henry—I only know by my own knowledge that it was Henry—there are no means for a stranger to find that out.</p>

On 9th December Miss Evans made a complaint and I went and saw Susan—from what she said I went to 25, Sinclair Road, and saw Emily, who had been in service there for a short time as cook—I said to her, "Is your name Emily Mortimer? I am a police officer, and have your sister Susan in custody for an extensive robbery at 66, Hailsham Road. Have you anything in your possession that does not belong to you, that she gave to you?"—she said, "Nothing whatever"—I said, "I shall be able to prove that you have frequently taken parcels out of 66, Hailsham Road; I charge you with stealing and</p>

               <p>receiving property;" and I cautioned her in the usual way, that what she said I should take down and give in evidence—she said, "I have only a dress"—we went upstairs to her bedroom, with Miss Evans—Emily Mortimer produced this cardboard box containing this salmon-coloured dress, and said, "That is all I have"—Miss Evans identified the dress as her property, and said it was worth eight guineas—the prisoner said, "I have three years' good character, and it is not likely I should steal any<lb/>thing "—I made a further search, and found this silk blouse in a drawer (which Miss Evans identified), a petticoat and veil, and in a draw I found three coins and a foreign medal—Emily said, "I had forgotten them. I did say I had not got anything, but I did it to save my sister. The par<lb/>cels my sister gave me I used to bring out and leave at the cloak-room at Addison Road Station. Of course I knew they were stolen, because I knew my sister could not afford to buy such expensive things. I sent the dress to my sister last week"—I went into the kitchen—I said, "Have you anything else that does not belong to you?"—she said, "Only that cloak behind the door"—it was this silk-lined cloak—I took her to the station, where I confronted her with Susan, who was then in custody on the charge of stealing these things—I said to them, "I told your sister when I arrested her that from inquiries I had made your sister constantly took parcels from 66, Hailsham Road"—Susan said, "Yes, they contained some of the property. My sister asked on one occa<lb/>sion where I got the things from, and I said I took them from Miss Evans' boxes, and she helped me down with other parcels after that, and I sent some away by Carter Paterson"—that statement was made in Emily's presence, who replied, "I don't remember it"—when the charge was read to Emily she made no reply—there was difficulty about search<lb/>ing the house then because of sickness, but I subsequently returned, when the prisoner was remanded, and although she had made repeated state<lb/>ments that she had nothing else, I found in the kitchen which Emily occupied a nurse's black cloak, which Miss Evans identified as hers—it had been cut at the bottom, as Emily is short and Miss Evans is tall—I also found that a flounce had been taken off this salmon-coloured dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman and contractor, of 30, Eagle Street, Holborn—I have stables there adjoining the Bricklayers' Arms Public-house—on the 16th October, between eight and nine in the evening, I saw Bush going out of Eagle Street into Red lion Street; he was going away from the Bricklayers' Arms—I went with him to a public-house in Red Lion Street—he said he had lost a good bit of money at the Brick-layers' Arms, and he wanted to be moved out of there quite early in the morning, when nobody was about, and he wanted a man who could hold his tongue as to where he was going—I had previously moved some goods for him, two lots; one lot in the receding August (it was furniture)—we took one lot to a private house at Barking Creek and one lot to the Wood-man, at Greenwich—that was about nine months before, at the beginning of the year; that was also furniture—he said he would see me again about it on the Wednesday morning; that would have been the 18th—I took the furniture out of the back window into the yard—there was about a van load on each occasion—I left him about nine on the evening of the 16th—at about twenty-five minutes past twelve I was in another yard of mine near my yard, near the Bricklayers' Arms, and just afterwards I saw the house closed—I saw some lights put out, and after that I saw a light behind the bar, moving about, and I saw Alfred John Torr come out—I then went down my yard at the side of the Bricklayers' Arms, and I saw that everything was right—I went down Red Lion Street, and about ten minutes after I heard a police whistle—I then ran back, and saw smoke coming out of the door and fanlight—I burst in one of the doors in Eagle Street, leading into the bar, and went into the bar, but the smoke was too dense to go there—the bar was full of smoke, and it smelt like straw—I ran up the yard, thinking it was the yard alight—as I came back I saw Cox looking out of the back bedroom window, with a lighted candle in his hand—the window was open—I said to him, "Do you know the place is on fire?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Where is young Bush?"—he said, "He is gone for the engine"—I said, "Wait a minute, and I will get you out," and with the assistance of a constable I got a ladder, and got him down the ladder—I saw that he was burnt about the hands and face, and his hair was singed a bit—I asked him how he managed to set the place on fire—he said, "I was going down into the cellar to see that all was right, when I slipped and fell, knocking over a half-bottle of brandy; the candle fell into it and it flared up, and in trying to extinguish the flames I got burnt"—I took the candle out of his hand—soon after<lb/>wards he was taken to the hospital by a policeman.</p>

I know the Bricklayers' Arms very well—as far as I knew Cox was the manager, and resided with his wife on the premises—his wife went away on the previous Saturday—when I moved the furniture in August I took away pretty well everything—Bush, his wife, and boy were then living there—on the night of the 16th I saw Torr being let out; that was just after closing time—somebody came to the door with a candle and let him out; I did not see any other light—my attention was not called to it at the time as extraordinary; within five or ten minutes I heard the whistle—the smoke was very thick inside when I first opened the door—the window at which I saw Cox standing was the one over the taproom window—I don't know that the shed under that window was a kind of old urinal; I don't know what it was—I think it would have been dangerous for a man of Cox's build to get out of that window—he seemed very dazed—his face was very badly burnt—he made this statement about five minutes afterwards—he was coming to a bit then, he knew what he was about—it was in the passage leading to our yard.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I live at 10, The Wharf, Barking—I am four<lb/>teen years of age—I am the son of the prisoner Bush—up to the time of this fire I was living at the Bricklayers' Arms—at that time my father and mother were living at Barking—father used to go down at night; he slept at Barking, but came up to the Bricklayers' Arms every day—at this time Cox was living there—he was there about three months before the fire—I remember his coming there; he did not bring in any furni<lb/>ture—Mrs. Cox came with him; she stayed there until a few days before the fire—when she left she took with her two cats and a canary; that was all—I generally slept in the top room front—on the night of 16th October I slept in the first floor back, over the taproom, under which there was a shed or lean-to—I slept there that night because Mr. Cox told me that two gentlemen were coming to sleep in my room that night—I went to bed between ten and eleven—as I was going up Cox said, "You go into my bed, Joe, because two gentlemen are coming to sleep in your room"—I went to bed and went to sleep—I awoke up and saw some smoke in my room, and saw Mr. Cox in the room with a lighted candle in his hand; he held his other hand like that, and was blowing it—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "All right, Jack, all right" he told me to go to bed, that I was all right—I had got out of bed and sat on the side—he went downstairs again and I went into bed—I stayed in bed about five minutes—I was awoke by Cox coining upstairs again—I got out of bed and sat on the side of it—I asked what was the matter—he said, "Nothing; go to bed, you are all right, Jack"—he stopped there till I got out of the window—I was going to get a chair to</p>

               <p>get out of the window—I looked through the door and saw smoke coming from the passage way—I believe Cox remained in the room, I forget now—I then got out of the window—I first threw out my clothes and got on to a ledge, and went for the fire engine—Cox did not tell me to get out and go for it—he did not throw my socks and boots out of the window, I left my socks upstairs—paraffin lamps had been kept at the Bricklayers' Arms, not used; there were some kept there till about six months back, they were sold then—after that there was no paraffin, lamp in the house—on the night of the 17th I went up to bed about eleven—at that time my father was playing dominoes with a man named Kenwick—there were two others; I did not notice them—my attention was arrested by someone screaming "Fire!"—I ran up the stairs and through the bar parlour out into Edwards' yard and through the gate.</p>

It was Cox who told me to sleep in the other room on the night of the fire—I don't know at what time my father left the house that night, I was at work—next morning he arrived about eight—the firemen were then in charge of the house—on the night of the second fire I did not notice how many customers there were in the house; I did not see any—I only heard my father say, "Fetch some more water"—I did not see where that fire broke out—I know the recess under the staircase; spirits were kept there—there was straw there, used for Cox's dog, which used to sleep there—there were two boxes there; they had pint bottles of spirits in them wrapped in straw—I don't know what spirits they were—I think some had whisky—I never saw my father go to that cupboard after Cox had come to the house.</p>

I had been living in the house for some time; I did not go into the cellar very often—I am not sure that there was not a small spirit lamp in the cellar used occasionally; I never noticed one—on the night of the first fire I was woke up by Cox; he was blowing on his hand; I did not notice his face at that time—he left the room and I dozed off—I was awoke by his coming in again; there was more smoke then—he did not help me out of the window—I was rather alarmed, and frightened and nervous about the fire; I will swear that he did not help me out of the window—I threw my things out; my coat, not my trousers—I forget whether I put them on in the room; I believe I threw them out—I got out in my night-shirt; I got my feet on a little shed under the window, and got down; Cox did not prevent me—he was there against the gas-pipe; his face was pretty red—I threw out my boots, and left my socks; he did not throw them out—I did not put anything on in the yard, except my trousers—I went to the Fire-station—Cox did not tell me to go there—I took the window out of its frame; he did not help me to do it; I could take it out myself—it was never properly put up—it had no rope on it, and one part of it was out—I lifted it up; he did not help me—it was an ordinary window with eight small panes of glass—I did not notice that he was very much dazed and confused—I did not know that he was going to move out of this public-house, and go to another—his wife was ill, and was going to some of her friends on the Saturday—I saw she was ill; that was reason she left, she said so herself.</p>

On 17th October, about one a.m., I was called to the Bricklayers' Arms—I went up Edwards' yard, and saw Cox standing at the window of the first-floor back with a lighted candle in his hand—with Edwards' assistance we got a ladder, and got him out of the window—he was burnt about the face and hands and arms, and his hair was singed all over his head—I took him to King's College Hospital, where he was seen by a doctor—on the way there he said he had been down into the cellar to see that all was correct, and, returning back, he stumbled and dropped the lamp he was carrying, he said it was a paraffin lamp, that it exploded, and in trying to put it out he got burnt—he said he found his way upstairs, and put the boy out of the window to get some assistance.</p>

I have charge of the licensing business in my district, which comprises the Bricklayers' Arms—about one in the early morning of 17th October I went to the Bricklayers' Arms; I found it on fire—I saw Cox standing outside—I said to him, "Where is Bush?"—he said, "He is not in town"—I said, "Have you wired to him? If not, we will do so"—he said, "I can't tell his address"—I said, "How did this happen?"—he said, "I was going into the cellar, and broke a bottle of brandy, and then dropped the candle into it"—that was all that occurred between us at the time—smoke was then issuing from the premises, but the fire was well under; the firemen were there, and engines were in the street—on 7th September Bush was summoned to Clerkenwell Police-court for an offence against the licensing laws, for serving drink out of hours on Sunday—he was convicted, and fined 5s. and 2s. costs—he was the licensed holder—before that summons was heard Cox had given notice that he was going</p>

               <p>to apply for a protection order with a view to the license being made over to him—he gave notice verbally, and I entered it on the usual form—the parties attended on 12th August, and Cox told me that he was going to buy the business of Bush, and Bush was going to buy the house that Cox had recently been keeping, namely, the Woodman in George Street, Greenwich—Cox afterwards said that the brewers would not grant him the loan, and Bush subsequently sought my advice in respect to Cox being allowed to hold the license—I said after what had passed at the Police-court I thought Cox would be allowed to hold it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman fireman of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade at Farringdon Street station—on the morning of 17th October, about five minutes to one, I received a call from Holborn—I turned out and went to Eagle Street and found the fire at the Bricklayers' Arms—it was not extinguished when I got there—Munday was there at work with a hydrant; it was eventually put out—I afterwards made an examination of the cellar, both the outer and inner cellar—the cellar was reached by an almost perpendicular step ladder—the cellar was underground and quite dark—the inner cellar was a room about nine or ten feet square—I examined the wooded partition; it had been burnt all round the upper part of it, on the two sides of the woodwork, and the brickwork—the woodwork was all burnt—the staircase was almost immediately over the partition, but not quite—the boarding was burnt all round; the fire had gone all round the partition—the direction of the fire was peculiar; there were no goods or anything to make it take that direc<lb/>tion from where it originated—there was some oust in one corner, right under the window—I should suppose that was where the fire broke out—there were several barrels in the outer cellar; all that I tapped were empty—I might say I tapped all of them—I might possibly have missed one, but I don't think I did; all that I tapped were empty—I saw no bottles there, or any broken ones on the floor—I saw the gas meter in the outer cellar—I examined it; the cock was turned off—I saw no remains of any candlestick or lamp there—I was there for about forty minutes—by the time I left the tire was extinguished—I left a fireman in charge—about eleven the same night I received another call to the same public-house—I went there with a steamer; I was preceded by Hipsy, one of my men—at the time I arrived the fire had been extinguished—my attention was directed to a recess under the stairs on the ground floor, imme<lb/>diately above the ladder leading down to the cellar—the recess had a wooden partition running across it, immediately under the staircase, above the partitioned-off wine cellar in which I had been that same morning—I there saw some straw which had been lighted underneath, and some loose wood—some had been pulled out and some had been left—some of it had been on fire, and had fallen down into the basement—it smelt very strongly of paraffin; it seemed to be all saturated with paraffin—I did not smell anything particular about the recess itself, but about the wood—I saw Bush there, and called his attention to the paraffin—he said, "I generally keep about half a gallon of paraffin in a bottle in that recess"—he also said, "I don't know how the fire occurred, I am sure. Priestley had been in the cellar previous to the fire to put on a cask of ale. Priestley put on the ale and came up the steps or ladder to go into the bar, and he put a lighted candle into this recess. He had a candle in a candlestick, and he put this candlestick with the candle alight into this recess, on the top of the ladder, and then went into the bar and tried the engine to see if he had put the beer on right. During that time, or before he could get back to go down into the cellar again, the fire had occurred"—that was the substance of all he said to me—when I looked into the recess I did not see the remains of any bottle there, nothing except the</p>

               <p>not as much to do down the cellar as I thought for"—he turned the gas off the meter in the outer cellar—the candle was the only light we had in the cellar—we then returned upstairs—I was carrying the candle—he turned off the gas-burners in the bar—they were not alight at that time—the gas was alight when we were going into the cellar—when he turned off the burners we were in darkness—the only light in the house was the candle I had—he then came to the door with me and let me out, and shut the door after me—at the time I left there was no sign what<lb/>ever of fire in the house—it was then about ten minutes or a quarter to one, as near as possible—the candle was never near the box with the straw after I put it there—after leaving the house I went home—I was just undressing when I heard the police whistles, and I went back to the pre<lb/>mises about half-past one—I went into the bar and down into the cellar; the salvage men were there—I went and looked at the place that had been partitioned off, and saw there had been a fire, and saw a small part of the box burnt to a cinder, and the straw was all burnt—I only saw Cox as he was going to the hospital; I did not speak to, him—I saw no more of him after that—I then left the premises—I returned next morning between nine and ten—I saw Bush there—he was having a conversation with Mrs. Hodge and Mrs. Bedou; I heard part of it—I spoke to him—I said, "This looks all right, don't it, being burnt down like this, having a fire here last night?"—he did not answer me—he was talking to the females—that was all the conversation I had—that same afternoon, about five, I was again at the Bricklayers' Arms; I saw Priestley and Bush behind the bar—Priestley had been employed there some few months before, but not then—he asked me to come to a coffee-shop with him in High Holborn, and while we were having refreshment we were talking about the fire that happened on the Monday night or Tuesday morning—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Alf</hi>, they made a bad job of it last night; I will get something to-night to smoulder; if it comes off all right I shall get some money for it"—I told him to leave it alone—he said nothing more—he said nothing about my seeing anything, as I remember—I returned with him to the Bricklayers' Arms—Bush was still there—I remained there off and on—during the evening I saw Bush and Priestley behind the bar whispering to one another—Priestley went downstairs towards the cellar between nine and ten; he came back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and whispered to <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> (Bush) while <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> was playing at dominoes in the public bar—I saw him go over to him and whisper in his ear, and afterwards Bush said, "Go down into the cellar and see what is the matter with the engine, as four ale is all off"—he went down, and was there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I went into the tap-room to talk to a friend, and whilst talking to him I saw flames coming from beneath the staircase, under the flooring of the recess, and I saw Priestley run up the ladder—I saw nothing in his hand—he said, "Tell Joe the cellar is on fire," and he ran out of the house—Bush got up from the table where he was playing dominoes, and stood by the end of the bar—two or three neighbours and myself went and got some pails of water and threw on the fire—I got the water from the opposite house—Bush did not assist at all to put out, the fire while I was there; he was standing there, just by the end of the bar—I did not hear him say anything—the firemen were soon on the scene, and the fire was ex<lb/>tinguished</p>

               <p>—I stayed there till it was put out, and then left—I afterwards saw Priestley with the inspector—I said something to the inspector directly he arrived—I did not speak to Priestley again that night—on the Saturday before the fire, the 14th October, I was on the premises, and I fetched a cab for Mrs. Cox; she was living on the premises up to that time; she paid me for fetching the cab—I saw her go away—she took with her two or three large bundles of clothing, two cats, and the bird—it was about eight in the evening.</p>

It was on the 16th that I was assisting in whitewashing the cellar—Priestley was employed about the premises then; he had been employed as potman before—that was before Cox's time; when Cox came Priestley ceased to be potman, but he used to do odd jobs—I knew that Cox was taken to the hospital and was there on the evening of the second fire, and that Priestley was with Bush—I don't know that he was acting as potman then—I was not aware that something had gone wrong with the engine—I know that Priestley went down to put on the ale—no beer was drawn the first time he went down; the second time there was—when I saw the lames coming from the recess Bush was playing dominoes—there were about a dozen customers in the house then—I did not at once communicate to the police the conversation with Priestley, because I did not believe he was really serious at the time—he did not mention Bush's name in the statement—Bush did not take any notice of the fire; he did not evince the slightest anxiety—I have been a customer at the house twelve years.</p>

I had not much money to spend there; I have been out of employment latterly—I am not a great friend of Cox's, or Bush, or of Priestley, only by working together—when I went down with Priestley to whitewash it was the first cellar we went into—he whitewashed under the stairs; it did not smell of paraffin—there were a good many empty bottles about the place on the shelf; I should think about a dozen—I did not see any full ones; all I saw had the corks out—I saw none with the corks in—it was early in the morning that the cellar was whitewashed—I did not think it suspicious—only one thing caused my suspicion while whitewashing, Priestley did the walls and left the joists of the ceiling—he was down there about an hour and a half—he went up and asked Cox if he should do them or not, and Cox sent down word that they were not to be done, and Priestley came down and told me—later on Cox asked me to stay and go down into the cellar with the box—it was not very heavy, it was nearly full of straw; he could have carried it quite as well as I could—when Mrs. Cox went away on the Saturday I did not know that she was ill; she said something about being ill—the dog was left behind.</p>

On 18th October, about Half-past twelve in the early morning, I went to the Bricklayers' Arms in the company of the last witness; I found this stone bottle—I smelled it at the time; it smelled strongly of paraffin and slightly of beer—I found it in a little place used as a coal cellar at the back of the back parlour; it was a covered court way—I examined the recess under the stair-case where the fire had been; I found there a quantity of rough firewood, straw, and partly-burnt paper—the recess smelled very strongly of paraffin, and the wood I took possession of was saturated with paraffin—I showed this bottle to Bush at the Police-station, and asked him if he could give me any account or explanation with reference to it—he at first said that he had never seen the bottle in his life before—he afterwards said that he had seen it yesterday, when the fireman was at the Bricklayers' Arms—he did not mention any particular time—I asked him if he could ex<lb/>plain how the wood had paraffin on it—he said, "No, only that Priestley might have upset the bottle when he went down to put the beer on"—Bush and Priestley were then charged with setting fire to the premises—Bush said he knew nothing about it—Priestley made no reply in my hearing—on 20th October I went to King's College Hospital, and there saw Cox—Inspector Everett in my presence told him that he had taken</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>: "I turned the gas out, and upset the spirit lamp in the cellar. After I had turned off the gas, or whilst doing so, I fell over a cask, and the lamp exploded and set the cellar on fire. Mr. Hastings had sent about two gallons of gin, two gallons of port, and about two of whisky away; it was taken to the Bricklayers' Arms, in Little Clarence Street, Seymour Street. Bush told me that Mr. Evans and Mr. Salt were going to sleep with me. The reason I asked Torr to take the box containing the straw down into the cellar after closing time was be<lb/>cause I had no room upstairs for it. I bought two quarts of paraffin oil myself on Monday afternoon at a little shop in New Oxford Street I put the bottle in the yard. After I met with the accident in the cellar I went to my bedroom, where young Bush was. He said to me, 'The place is on fire.' I said, 'No; I don't think it is;' but I told him to get out at the back window and fetch the engine. He did so. I threw his socks and boots out of the window, and Mr. Edwards came in, and I was taken to the hospital. After Torr had taken the box downstairs I let him out at the front door, and returned to the cellar to put the gas out. I did not say anything to Edwards about the brandy, to my recol<lb/>lection. I was simply acting as servant to Mr. Bush, and carrying on the business for him")—I read that statement over to Cox—he said it was true—I did not ask him to sign it; he could not, he was in bandages—I arrested him on the 16th November, when he was discharged from the hospital—Bush told me that Cox managed the house for him.</p>

I am a brewer, of Home Park, Surbiton—I was the mortgagee of the Bricklayers' Arms, Eagle Street—on 3rd October, 1892, I assigned the leasehold interest in the premises for the remainder of an unexpired term to the prisoner Bush—this is the assignment—the lease is from 25th March, 1878, for twenty-one years, expiring in 1899. (<hi rend="italic">Other assignments were produced, ultimately one leaving the possession of the premises to Bush upon payment of</hi> £375)—£90 was paid in cash, leaving £285 on mortgage of October 23rd, and costs to be paid by him—a rent was reserved of £50 a year under the original lease—that was paid to the solicitors for the owners, Messrs. Guscott, of Essex Street—Bush took out the license within a few days of the assignment by Guscott and Co.—he asked me to lend him £10 or £20 to pay for the license.</p>

I live at 46, Somers Street, Earl Street, Wands<lb/>worth—I am a managers' agent and public-house broker—I was at the Bricklayers' Arms on the evening of 16th October—about seven that evening I remember some things being removed from the premises, four jars of spirits and one jar of port; I think three were gallon jars, and two two-gallon jars—it is a fully licensed house—Cox and Bush were there, and Priestley was about—he helped to put the jars in the cab—they were brought from the bar parlour by Cox and Bush—the cab was sent for—Bush, I think, made up the things—I heard him say, "The street is clear now"—that was before the cab was sent for—Priestley and the cabman put the spirits in the cab—I got into the cab and drove away with the spirits; first of all to a public-house, another Bricklayers' Arms, in Little Clarendon Street, Somers Town—they would not take the spirits in there; that house was going into the same brewers' trade—I afterwards took them to the cloak-room at Euston Station, and left them there for the night—I next went to the Bricklayers' Arms—it must have been about seven to half-past, on Tuesday morning, the 17th—I saw Bush—I did not tell him what had become of the spirits—he did not ask me, that I am aware of—I was acting under the instructions of the brewers' solicitors in the removal of these spirits—the reason they would not take them at the public-house was because the permit was not regular—there was no conversation about it with Bush afterwards—I did not stay five minutes—I did not see Bush—I returned with the idea of finding Cox, and I then heard he was in the hospital—I believe the spirits have been seized by the Commissioners of Excise—I was informed so at Bow Street—I did not take any more interest in them—Mr. George Crow, the brewers' solicitor, employed me to take them to the public-house, and they had refused to take them in, and I</p>

               <p>then took them to the cloak-room at Euston, as a parcel—I had been trying to get a loan of £500 on the trade done at the Bricklayers' Arms, the third week in August, 1893—the negotiations extended down to the first week in October—I could not get the loan be<lb/>cause the freeholder required between £200 and £300 spent in repairs on the premises before granting a new twenty-one years' lease—it might have been between £300 and £400 in the first instance; it was afterwards reduced—I tried for the loan in more than one quarter, and was unsuccess<lb/>ful in any—I told Cox so, and also Bush.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, of 28, Seven Sisters Road—on 21st November the prisoner came in, and my assistant handed me from him an envelope addressed to me—I opened it—it contained this memorandum, which purported to come from Crisp and Co., about a clock which a customer wished to purchase—I did not altogether like the style of the memorandum, and I said, "All right, I will send it over"—I did not do so—ten to fifteen minutes afterwards the prisoner came again, and said, "You have not sent that clock over"—I said, "No. I was just going to do so"—he said, "The customer is getting very annoyed and impatient; shall I take it over for you?"—I said, "Yes"—he signed for it in the book, "J. Jenkins"—I said, "How do you want the invoice made out, and how about discount?" because I have business transactions with Crisp, and it was rather unusual for them to send a memo of this kind—the prisoner said, "You are to make the bill out in full"—I made out the invoice to Crisp, and gave the clock to the prisoner, who went away—on the 27th or 28th December I was called to the station, and I identified the prisoner immediately from ten or twelve others—I am certain he is the man.</p>

I am surgeon to the City Police—on 28th November, shortly after eleven, Williams was brought to my house; he was stunned—he was bleeding from a wound at the back of the head—I stopped the bleeding, and dressed the wound; he was very collapsed, and I had to give him a stimulant before I could send him to the hospital—he has been suffering from concussion of the brain for over a month, and still experiences great headache—he has done no duty since, and is not fit for it—the wound was at the back of the head on the left-hand side, between the ear and the back part of the head—the wound, in my opinion, was produced by a stick or bludgeon—I think Williams will be the same man again that he was before; time will restore him.</p>

I am in partnership with Joseph Thompson, as turf commission agents—there is one banking account, and we both sign Joseph Thompson—the endorsement to this cheque is not my writing—I do not know either the drawer or the payee—I have seen Fisher at our office, but have not had personal transactions with him; I only make out the cheques—I made out cheque "C" on the day it bears date in favour of Fisher for £30 12s. 6d.—I think I had sent a cheque to Fisher before that—in my judgment the endorsement of the forged cheque "A" has been traced from the signa<lb/>ture to cheque "C"—if you take the tracing "Joseph" first, and then shift the paper you get the other; there would not be room to do it any other way—I have examined considerably more than twenty-three cheques—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all genuine signatures—I have satisfied myself that the tracing is from the one genuine signature "C"—I have tried it with forty others, but it will only fit cheque "C."</p>

                  </hi>. I have practised as an expert in hand<lb/>writing about ten years—I have compared the signature of the drawer of cheque "C" with that of the endorser of "A"—cheque "C" was used, for the purpose of writing the endorsement on "A"—I made a tracing of both signatures, and placed one on the other, and found that the word "Joseph" in each case exactly corresponded—the word "Thompson" did not correspond, the signature being longer than the other; but I noticed that if the tracing had been complete it would have gone over the end of the cheque—I moved the tracing a little just to "Thomp," which corre<lb/>sponded exactly, but the "son" did not exactly correspond, because there was not room, and my opinion is that those three last letters were copied, and not traced; I then put one over the other, with glass behind with a light, and found the same result as with my tracing—by sliding my tracing I find there is a diminution of the space—I believe the endorse<lb/>ment of the £375 cheque was traced from the £30 cheque—I have been supplied with Mr. Hart's undoubted signature on twenty-three cheques taken promiscuously, and it could not be taken from any of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. My opinion is that the endorsement on the cheque up to the "p" in Thompson, is a tracing from the cheque for £30—it might be traced from any other if you had one just like it, but I should expect to see a difference, according to the conditions under which the person was placed—I infer that it is a tracing, because it corresponds line for line—an expert forger does not make the signature exact, because it would lead to his discovery at once; it is absolutely impossible for anyone to sign a signature twice alike, consequently, if you find a signature which actually corresponds with another, one of them is a forgery—a man might imitate a signature by accurate copying and measuring distances with glasses—my reason for saying that this is not a copy, but a tracing, is that it actually corresponds up to the letter "p" in "Thompson"—I cannot say that it corresponds exactly, because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189401080054"/>
               <p>if the paper does not allow the light to come through absolutely, one might deviate in a line or a letter—whether it is a copy or a tracing I ex<lb/>pect to find differences—the more expert the forger the fewer differences I should find—I think a clever forger would not like to copy too close, because he would approach the ground of a <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi>; he would introduce some little varieties—if it was exactly like, and I was the bank clerk, I would not cash it—there are very slight differences in the word Joseph; the "o" fits absolutely over the other—looked at separately, there is a difference in the top of the "o"—there is a dash under the signature of Joseph Thompson; they do not correspond, they are a different length altogether—the difference in the length of the signature is rather more than necessary—I had to move the paper back rather more than one-eighth of an inch—supposing anybody had traced the signature in the £30 cheque, there would be no difficulty in tracing it if it was put a little slanting—the "n" in "Thompson," instead of finish<lb/>ing with a curve, goes downwards—the letters "son" are all different, and in my opinion they were not traced, but copied; they are differently formed—there must have been three different operations, forging or tracing, of "Joseph," then of "Thomp" and then of "son"—it would not have been as easy to trace the "son" instead of copying it, because it would have gone over the side of the cheque, and therefore the end of the "n" is turned downwards—if a person was tracing, his object would be to make it all alike—I think the object of making a different "n" to finish with was to get more room—I think the "n" would not have gone on—in the £30 cheque the "n" is turned up, and in the endorsement it turns down and then up.</p>

               <p>Sergeant Nicholls, of the Metropolitan Police; there have been several bank forgeries in London during the past two months, and two men and a woman are in custody for the same. One of the men is a companion of yours named George Watson, and you are suspected of being concerned in the same; you must go with me to Handsworth Police-station"—he did so—I showed him a cheque, and said, "I believe you are in the habit of betting with a man named Thompson?"—he said, "I am"—I said, "Is this a cheque you received from him, and is this your endorsement?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I believe you let Norton have possession of this cheque before it was cashed?"—he said, "Yes; what if I did?"—I said, "I believe this is the cheque which the forged one was manufactured from, and Norton and the woman are in custody for obtaining £375 on this cheque, and you will be charged with being concerned in that"—he said, "I have been shopped by a woman, but it is your place to prove it"—I found on him four £5 Bank of England notes—he said, "I got them from the London and County Bank"—I arrested Norton on Wednesday, 29th November, about nine p.m.—I knew him as George Montague, and spoke to him in that name—Inspector Marshall charged him—I found on him notes to the value of £155.</p>

I found some gold and silver on Fisher, as well as the four £5 Bank of England notes—I inquired about them and ascertained that they had been received by him from his own bank—I found his own cheque-book on him—there is a great deal of jewellery trading at Birmingham—just before I arrested him I had been to a shop in Handsworth kept by a woman, not to inquire for him, but I was making inquiries—I did not see him go into that shop—I arrested him at a cottage which stands back in a garden, quite a hundred yards off; not in the same street, but in a lane which turns out of the street—he did not tell me that he knew I had been into that shop inquiring—the officer with me was inquiring about Mr. Brooks, who is the person I expected to find Fisher with—we went to the shop to see if we could gather any<lb/>thing—we saw a man and a woman there—Mr. Justice Hawkins asked me yesterday, in the other Court, what business I had to question prisoners when I have gone to arrest them—I said that I and the inspector who accompanied me intended to arrest the man if he was in a fit state to leave the hospital—I have no explanation to give of examining a man who I intended to arrest—I was never told till yesterday that the Judges objected to it, and I never heard it before, that I remember—I wrote these notes an hour or two after Fisher was arrested; they purport to be a narrative of my evidence, not notes of what Fisher said; it is a proof, which I have drawn up for myself, of the evidence I was going to give—Fisher was not rather impertinent in his manner to me, or cheeky, but he did not seem inclined to come—I saw no sign of his being annoyed at my questioning him—he did not seem nasty about answering it; he did not say "What if I did?" in rather a nasty way—I was not doing all this to try and get some admission out of him to use against him—I simply gave him the facts which I was going to arrest him for—I did not know what explanation he would give; any explanation he might have given I should have arrested him—Inspector Marshall had directed me to question him about the cheque; I swear that—I had no conversation at all with the woman in the shop; the other officer had—he asked in my presence where</p>

               <p>Brooks was—that was to assist me in arresting Fisher—I arrested him just before twelve; he had not gone to bed, he was fully dressed—I had searched the house forty minutes before arrested him—I saw a figure I knew to be him go to the cottage, and I followed him in; he came from the direction of the shop to which I had been shortly before.</p>

I am a clerk in the bankruptcy department of the High Court of Justice—I produce the file of proceedings in the prisoner's bankruptcy—his petition was filed on 9th April, 1890; his ad<lb/>judication was on 14th April—the statement of affairs discloses liabilities £11,173 14s. 10d., and assets £213 15s.—application for order of discharge was made on 28th November, 1890, and suspended for two years till 28th November, 1892—he would then have got his discharge by applying for his certificate; but he has not applied—he could get it at any moment.</p>

                  </hi>. In October, 1891, I was employed as book-keeper to Mr. Evans, butcher, of High Street, Kensington—the prisoner came there for meat—his address was 47, Cornwall Gardens—we first began to serve him on October 15th, 1891; he called then to open an account, saying he wanted us to supply him with meat—he asked what credit we gave, whether it was weekly or monthly; I said either—the usual customer's book was prepared and sent to his house—I afterwards saw him at the shop, and at his house—we called for orders, but he came to the shop on several occasions—between October, 1891, and April, 1892, we supplied him with meat—when the account was going on I called frequently at his house—I always saw him—he paid £10 off the account in January, £5 in February, and £5 odd in March—in April £71 was owing—when I called about eight or nine times for payment he each time promised to pay—letters were written to him; I received these from him, and I spoke to him about them afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">The first of these letters stated that the account would be attended to next week; the second stated that he hoped to come to some arrangement with Mr. Evans next week for the payment of his account.</hi>)—he never told me that he was an undischarged bankrupt—I had no idea of it—this is one of the books we supplied him with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew Miss Wallington—I did not know that she was manager of the house 47, Cornwall Gardens—I cannot say if most of the orders came through her—sometimes she called and gave orders—when the account was opened both she and the prisoner came together—I think I have said that before—I don't remember saying</p>

All orders Miss Wellington gave I regarded as given on behalf of the defendant"—I saw the prisoner several times before March, 1892—I could not remember how many times; I will swear it was more than three—I said before the Magistrate, "The defendant came once or twice and ordered"—my recollection of names and dates after this lapse of time is not very strong; it is a large business, and I cannot remember one individual—I called and saw the prisoner before March and April—he called at the shop and changed cheques, and gave orders himself several times—I do not know Mr. Coburn—I was paid in cash for the goods obtained by the prisoner between March 17th and March 25th—this is the bill, but that money was received on account—£5 Os. 1 1/2 d. is the exact amount of goods received during that time, but it was on account—he came and bought the goods and said he would settle the other amount—I drew his attention to the amount owing, and he pro<lb/>mised to pay—he did not dispute his liability—we were also paid for what was ordered the ensuing week, between March 17th and 30th, but that was on account—the prisoner told me when I called about the money that Miss Wellington had left—he said she had left on 16th March—after the beginning of April no more goods were obtained because I re<lb/>fused further credit, and he then promised to pay at the beginning of June—I do not remember when he left Cornwall Gardens—he was not to be seen at his house for three months afterwards—I called and saw the servant once or twice, and on another occasion the house was shut up—I do not remember the date of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In April we ceased serving him, and then I went to 47, Cornwall Gardens—the house was furnished and open then—when the £5 was paid in March he owed about £60—the prisoner asked me what credit we gave about a week after we began serving him—he had about £12 or £15 a month; it was well over a month before £20 was owing—the ledger, which I kept, is here—his account began on 26th October—it came to about £3 or £3 10s. a week—on 4th January he paid £10, and on 5th January the account was £21 6s. 9d.</p>

I know nothing about it"—I took him in a cab to Kensington Police station—the charge; was read to him by the inspector—he said, "That is a lie."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, of Kent, stationed at Hythe—on 1st December I received a communication from the Metro<lb/>politan Police, in consequence of which I communicated with the bank authorities, and had the London and County Bank at Hythe watched, and then I watched the arrival of a certain train—I first saw the prisoners at a quarter to three p.m. on 1st December coming towards the bank—Smith made a momentary halt at the bank, and looked at the brass plate outside—they then passed on for about fifteen yards—I gave a signal, and they were arrested—they were taken to the White Hart and searched—on Smith I found a cheque and letter in his overcoat pocket—I told them I charged them jointly with stealing a cheque from London—they made no reply—when I was about to handcuff Smith he said, "There is no occasion to put those cuffs on me; we don't require them, as we will walk "—I placed the handcuffs on them, and drove them in a cab to Sandgate—while on the way to the station McLockley, who gave me the name of Williams, said, "I only came down here for a holiday. My friend here came with me to return to the owner a cheque, which we had picked up in a tobacco-pouch in the street"—in the reception room at the station I released McLockley's hands first, and while I was taking the belt off Smith's wrist he said to me, in a sort of stage whisper, "This will be a very good thing for you"—I said, "Why so, are you into it?"—I meant by that "Are you guilty?"—he said, "Yes"—if it is of any</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hythe is a seaside resort, and people often go there to get change of air and a holiday—I saw the prisoners about 2.45—I was not alone—the bank is about a mile from the station—I saw them first in High Street, Hythe, about 100 yards from the bank—I at once saw the prisoners were strangers to Hythe—I let them go by me, and they had gone about fifteen yards past the bank before I spoke to them—Smith hesitated at the bank and looked at the brass plate—they did not exactly pull up for any length of time—they had not turned when we arrested them—there were three of us; one constable took hold of both prisoners—McLockley tried to wriggle round the corner—I mentioned that to a gentleman from the Post Office in a statement I made to him; I think he put down what I told him—the prisoners walked quietly to the White Hart—three con<lb/>stables were with them—the prisoners objected to being searched at the White Hart; they resisted the taking off of their overcoats—I saw McLockley searched, and saw nothing found on him in connection with this charge—he had close upon £7 in his possession—Smith did not, when I went to take his coat off, tell me he had a letter and cheque, and offer to give it up to me—I took it out of his pocket; he did not offer it to me and tell me what he was going to do with it—I daresay two or three minutes elapsed from the time we entered the White Hart till the time I took his coat off—in the fly he said he came to give the cheque to the owner—McLockley was standing by during the time we were search<lb/>ing Smith—McLockley did not say he had advised Smith to come down, and that he would get some recompense—I never heard a word about recompense—it was when I was going to handcuff Smith in the White Hart that he said he would walk—I found no envelope.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective E</hi>). In consequence of information received, I went with McCarthy to Hythe on 2nd December—I saw the prisoners, and said to them, "We are police officers from London; you will be charged with stealing a letter containing a cheque for £16 16s. 10d. from a letter-box in the front door of 43, Great Russell Street, some time during Thursday night"—Smith said, "I found the letter containing the cheque in Farringdon Road on Thursday night about half-past nine, in a tobacco-pouch, and at eleven o'clock to-day I met my friend (indica<lb/>ting McLockley) in Piccadilly, and I showed him the cheque, and we both came down here intending to give it in at the bank"—McLockley said, "I told him to bring it back, and have nothing to do with it; we thought it would be a little excursion for us, and both came down here together; but before we got to the bank we were stopped by the police"—I had the cheque and letter in my hand at the time; I had received them from Superintendent Waghorn—I showed the cheque to the prisoners—Smith said, "One of the policemen put his hand into my inside coat pocket and pulled out the cheque and letter; we were then told we would be detained "—we conveyed them to Bow Street—they made no reply to the charge there.</p>

               <p>to give it to the owner"—I am positive about it—I and McCarthy brought the prisoners back—we four were in the railway carriage alone—I could hear everything that was said—McCarthy sat on the same side of the carriage as the prisoners, and I sat on the other side—I heard a portion of the statement made by Smith to McLockley, "Which night did I say we found it, Wednesday or Thursday? Which day was it?"—and then McCarthy turned to me and said, "They don't know which night they found it"—I omitted to say it at the Police-court; I overlooked it—Smith said, "One of the constables put his hand into my pocket and took money out."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the secretary's office of the General Post Office—I have seen McLockley write—the last two lines of this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in his writing; they were written in my presence on 20th October last—I have daily experience of comparison of hand-writing; it is part of my business in that department—in my opinion the diagonal writing, "Willis Brothers," on the letter is in McLockley's writ<lb/>ing; the endorsement on the cheque corresponds with the second writing "Willis Brothers" on the letter, and we believe that to be in Smith's writing—the endorsement on the cheque is not in McLockley's writing.</p>

               <p>Post Office, to 15, Upper Rathbone Place, where I saw McLockley—she lived there—she knew me from my having visited the place before—she was shown this postal order for 20s., endorsed "E. Howard"—I said, "You answer the description of one of two women who cashed the order at Messrs. Winters', drapers, Goodge Street"—she looked at it and said, "I know nothing about it. I never saw it before. I can neither read nor write. I have never been to Winters' in my life. I buy my things in the Tottenham Court Road"—I called her attention to the name of "E. Howard"; she said she could not read—she said, "If you take me to Winters' you will find no one there knows me"—we went to Winters', where she was seen by Jeffreys and Taylor, and identified by both of them—I said to her, "You are identified as the woman who brought this order, and had it cashed, and you will be charged with being concerned with another woman not in custody with stealing four or five others and forging the endorsement thereof"—she said, "I know nothing about them"—I took her to the station—on the way she said, "I am very sorry I had anything to do with it I did not steal the order. Smith, the man who was in custody with my hus<lb/>band, gave me the order and the £5 note too. I was with my sister at the time in Goodge Street, and went inside and cashed it. I did not sign it, because I could not write; my sister did"—I made my note the same evening—I went with Mr. Brookes to look after Mack—I found her at 37, Tottenham Street, Tottenham Court Road—she answered to the name of Mrs. Mack—I told her who we were, and that her sister was in custody at Bow Street, charged with forging and uttering an order for £20, and I said, "You accompanied her to Winters' and signed the order"—she said, "My sister is mad to say that; I know nothing of any orders"—she was taken to Bow Street, where she saw Esther McLockley—they are sister as far as I know—Mack said at once, "What have you been saying about me?"—McLockley replied, "Well, it was no use in denying it, all the girls at Winters' knew me at once"; I am sorry for it now"—Mack made no answer—she was placed with six other women at the station; she objected on the ground that they had no shawls on, and she was wearing one—I gave her the option of taking off her shawl—she took it off—she was seen by Mr. Taylor and Miss Jeffreys, and at once identified—she said in reply to the charge, "I know nothing about any orders"—McLockley said nothing.</p>

I am manager to Mr. John Lowe, potato and fruit salesman, at 125, Commercial Street, Spitalfields—on 9th June the prisoner came in with an old customer, Mr. Filby—these books are kept by Mr. Bird under my supervision; I check them at the time—on 9th June the prisoner bought and paid for ten boxes of potatoes, which came to £5 2s. 3 1/2 d.—on 10th June he bought and paid for more, coming to £4 19s. 6d.—between then and the 17th he had other goods, amounting to £10 4s. 4d., which were not paid for—from then to the 24th he had £15 15s. 3d. worth of goods, which made the total indebtedness £25 19s. 7d.—on June 27th he paid £10 4s. 4d., leaving £15 15s. 3d.—down to June 30th other goods were obtained and other sums were paid—the account was closed on July 15th, when his indebtedness was £53 2s.—we obtained judg<lb/>ment for that amount—he never informed me that he was an undischarged bankrupt—the first I heard of it was through the telephone from Mr. Lowe after 15th July, and after the action had been commenced—the accounts were made out to "Croager, late Benson"—it is entered in the ledger "Benson (Croager)"—he was introduced as the gentleman who had bought Benson's business, and until he started the credit account we did not know his name—he first asked for credit on Saturday, 10th June—after he had incurred the debt I tried to see him on several occasions—on 14th July I sent him a telegram—I received this telegram in reply: "See you about two.—<hi rend="smallCaps">CROAGER</hi> "—on 15th I went to where he was carrying</p>

               <p>on a fruiterer's and greengrocer's business at 3, Egan Terrace, Page Green, Tottenham—I cannot say if any name was up over the facia—I asked him if he had anything for me—he said, "I have been up to your place, and you were closed"—I asked him what time—he said, "Six"—I said, "Of course we should be closed"—he said, "I have sent it on to you"—I understood him to mean he had sent money on—I received that evening or the next day this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Promising to call on Saturday morning</hi>)—I sent a telegram, and received this letter.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner never informed me that he was an un<lb/>discharged bankrupt, nor was it the subject of general conversation between me, the prisoner, and other people—I am aware now that he was bankrupt in the timber and firewood trade—I heard after Mr. Filby's introduction that he had been in the timber trade—I asked him if he knew a Mr. Stafford, because he was an old friend of mine, and had been in the trade—he said, "Yes"—I did not say anything about Stafford having been in the timber trade—I heard about the prisoner having been in that trade from Filby, and from Payne, a man in our employ; it was shortly after the introduction, not immediately afterwards—it might be four or five or fourteen days afterwards—all I was told was that he had been in the timber trade—Filby introduced him as a customer, who had bought Benson's business—I did not made inquiries of Filby about him—he paid cash the first two days—Filby came with him almost every time—after they had been a day out together Filby was talking in general conversation about their going out together, and he said of the prisoner, "Oh, he is a <hi rend="italic">toff</hi>; he must have some money"—I suppose <hi rend="italic">toff</hi> means a good sort of fellow—it did not strike me as odd that he should have a little green-grocer's shop, or want credit for £2 7s. 6d.—I have been a principal in busi<lb/>ness, and am now only a manager; that was a known fact—I may have told the prisoner something about it—Mr. Stafford's name may have been mentioned on that occasion—I remember asking him about Stafford in general conversation; I was never with him above five or ten minutes at a time—that might have been the occasion when I said I had been a principal—the prisoner never told me he was an undischarged bankrupt; he never conveyed anything of the kind to me; if he had I should have at once stopped his credit—I do not remember all that passed—we have a great number of customers—it is impossible to remember all the conver<lb/>sations I have with every customer—I do not know Mr. Sharp by sight; you asked me that question at the Police-court—I went to the Golden Hart with the prisoner on one or two occasions in June—I do not remem<lb/>ber anyone coming in there—I do not know Mr. Brown, a farmer, of Chesham; I should not know him if I saw him—I do not remember anybody being present in the bar whom the prisoner spoke to—I only remember going to the Golden Hart with the prisoner and Mr.</p>

               <p>Filby in June or July—Mr. Sharp never said to the prisoner in my presence, "Fancy you now being in the greengrocery trade," nor did the prisoner reply, "I cannot be doing very much because I am still without my discharge"—had such a conversation taken place I should have im<lb/>mediately stopped his credit—I did not say, "Why do you not get your discharge, as no one knows how the shoe pinches except those that wear it?" or anything of the sort—I cannot say if Stafford's name was men<lb/>tioned on that occasion—when his name was mentioned I said to the prisoner, "Do you know William Stafford?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He is an old particular friend of mine"—I also asked him if he knew Dawe, Brown and Co.—he rather hesitated, and said, "Yes"—I did not see the name over the shop at Tottenham—the prisoner was on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlady of the Marquis Tavern, Douglas Road, Canonbury—from 7 to 9.20 p.m. on Sunday, 10th December, I was serving in my bar—my daughter, Emily Harriett, was in the bar from 8 till 9.20—about 9.20 I took my little girl, aged twelve next April, upstairs to bed—my daughter occupies the next room to mine on the second floor; my little girl sleeps in the same room with me—the door of the next room was open, and my little girl closed it before going into my room—I went into my room, not closing the door after me, and turned up the gas—I noticed a noise in the next room, the door of which was shut—the child said, "What is that?"—the prisoner opened the door, and stood in the doorway in front of me—I saw him full face plainly by the one gas-burner—he was facing the light—he had a moustache, with false Dundreary whiskers—I am certain of it, I was so close to him; he was only two yards off"—I recognised him as a man I had seen in my bar—he was putting his head in and out the bar doors from seven till about 8.40—he had not got the dummy whiskers on then—he had on a hard black bowler hat with an oval top—I had noticed the face of the man who had been in the bar earlier in the evening, because we were not busy, and I drew my daughter's attention to him—I noticed he was very high cheek-boned, a peculiar looking man, with a face once seen not easily forgotten—I noticed the same peculiarity in the man I saw in the doorway—when he stood there my child screamed—I said, "What do you want, you blackguard?"—he said loudly to my child, "Be quiet, you little beast"—he then pulled the door to and held the handle—I heard a noise like someone going down stairs—then he let go the door—I was pulling it one side and he the other—I went out and saw his face again—I was close to him—I said to him, as he was going downstairs, "I shall know you again"—he pulled his hat down and went into a crouching position, and turned to the right and went into a spare bedroom on the first floor, and went out at the window—I watched him over the bannisters—I heard the window open—the window of the spare bedroom looks out on to a billiard-room—there is an interval of twenty feet between the billiard-room and the bedroom window—I looked out and saw a plank which had been placed, by which they could get on to the billiard room roof—on the 18th I went to Upper Street Police-station, where I saw about nine men in a row—after looking at them all steadily I at once picked out the prisoner—he said, after I had picked him out, "Be careful, madam, what you accuse me of "I said, "I know you as well by your voice; you have condemned your<lb/>self. It is the same voice as said to my little girl on Sunday night, the 10th, 'Be quiet, you little beast!'"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a policeman, who came with Inspector Lea, about ten minutes afterwards—I did not see Inspector Nairn till I went to the North London Police-court—I gave a description of the man I saw on the staircase to Inspector Lea on the same night—I did not give a description to anyone else—I was astonished and frightened when I saw the man upstairs—he had a peculiar-looking face, and his cheek-bones struck me—I mentioned that to Lea, and I spoke of his height as the</p>

               <p>same as our potman's—I cannot say what his height is—I did not give it in feet and inches—I did not describe him as wearing glasses, or as having a round, full face—a message was left on 18th December for me to attend at the Police-station to see if I could identify the man who had committed the burglary, and I went with my elder daughter—I was two or three minutes at the station before I was shown the men—I do not think any of them were wearing glasses—I think a gentleman was wait<lb/>ing at the station to identify the prisoner—I do not know that two gentlemen picked out a man who was wearing glasses as a man they saw running away—all the men at the station were not clean shaven—the burglar's chin was shaven, and he had a false moustache and whiskers—I could not see whether he had a moustache of his own underneath—of the nine men I saw some were tall and some short—none of them, except the prisoner, fairly answered my description; he did answer it—he had no particular accent when he spoke to me, but I knew his voice when I heard him speak at the station—the man I saw dodging in and out of the bar earlier in the evening had a small moustache.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I picked out the prisoner he had not so much hair on his face as he has now; his chin was clean shaven—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man I saw on the 10th at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—about eight p.m., on 10th December, the prisoner came in one bar and went out, and came in at another door and went out again, and then came in again without asking for anything—he came in four or five times—then he called for a glass of mild and bitter—I served him, and he sat down for a minute or two, and I walked down to the end of the bar and had a good look at him—as I did so he turned his face up and looked at me, and drank up his beer and went out—I should say that was some time before nine, between eight and nine—I remember hearing my mother call out about half-past nine, and then the police came—on the 18th I went with my mother to the Police-station, where I picked out the prisoner from a number of men as the man I had seen in our bar—he had no Dundreary whiskers, only a moustache that hung down over his lip; except for that he was clean shaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not certain whether I described him to Lea on Sunday, but on Monday I described him to the detective sergeant; that was after Lea had seen my mother—I should say the man's moustache was rather inclined to be heavy over the lip—he was about the same height as our potman, a pretty good height; my mother and I passed no remark about that—he had high cheek-lames—I described him as having ¦a moustache, not clean shaven—he was not a man with a full face—I went into the room to pick him out after my mother—I believe a gentleman went in between us; I am not sure if I went in after her or the gentleman—some of the men the prisoner was with had beards—I knew none of them were he—I picked out the prisoner as the man nearest to my de<lb/>scription, and as the one I saw looking in and out of our bar—I felt cer<lb/>tain he was the man.</p>

I live at 106, Hornsey Road, Holloway, and am a house furnisher—about 9.30 p.m. on 10th December I was on Willow Bridge; I heard a whistle blown and a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw two men come running over the bridge—they turned down Alwyne Road—a policeman was following them, with his hand to his face—I went to the other end of the road to block it—the two men passed within three "yards of me—there was a lamp at each corner, directly over where I was standing, and another within twenty yards—about two p.m. on 18th December I went to the Police-station, and picked out the prisoner from about twelve men as being one of the men I had seen—he had no whiskers when I saw him running, only a slight moustache—I could see the faces of the men plainly; they were facing me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Union Square, Packington Street, Isling<lb/>ton, and am clerk to a bookmaker, Murray—I have known the prisoner about fourteen months—on Tuesday, 5th December, I attended a coursing meeting at Witham, Essex—on Friday, 8th, I met the prisoner in Grace-church Street, and invited him to dine with me on Sunday 10th, at 26, Union Square—my wife, the prisoner, and I dined together on that day about a quarter to two, and the prisoner stopped till 11.10, having tea and supper, with us; he did not go out of the house at all during that time—in the evening, after tea, about seven, or a little past, Mr. Clayton and Mr. Coleman came, and about nine Mr. Hunt came—Coleman and Hunt were strangers to the prisoner; I introduced them to him—he knew Clayton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mentioned going to Witham on 5th to fix the date, because I brought home a hare from the coursing meeting, and we had it on the 10th—I have been in Mr. Murray's employment about eight years—Coleman is a great friend of mine—I have known him for ten or twelve years—we only call him Herbert—I believe his Christian name is</p>

               <p>Harold—I know him very well; we were in the same circle—I do not know anyone of the name of Howard—I call the prisoner Bill, not Joe—it would surprise me to hear that he answered to the name of Joe—we were in the house the whole of the night till eleven, and did not go out—my wife was there the whole of the time; she is not here to-day—Mr. Murray lives at Florence Street, Islington—I did not know of the prisoner's arrest till I was sent for on the Wednesday after, the 20th—on that day he went before the Magistrate again—I went to the Police-court; I did not give evidence—I went to the Police-court on January 2nd, and was there when he was committed for trial—Coleman was close by, in the precincts of the Court—Hunt was there—we talked about different matters on the Sunday evening, nothing specially—we finished the hare for dinner—we talked about racing matters, and lots of things, I could not give you any par<lb/>ticular item—when I was sent for on the Wednesday I saw his solicitor—I was told I should be wanted at the Police-court—I was not asked what had taken place on the Sunday—I told him about the hare, and that I got it from Witham—I first met the prisoner at Leicester, where he stayed at the hotel I was at—we were attending a race meeting—he does attend race meetings—I never heard he attended a race meeting in 1891.</p>

               <p>the basement for the purpose—the room above he occupied as an office—he furnished it with a writing-table, two or three chain, and odds and ends; there was nothing of any value there—"The Eldon Dairy" was painted on each side of the doorway—the office was only one room—he said he should want a manager, and I recommended Dunham, who had been in the dairy business, but was out of employment at the time—Dunham came there as an <hi rend="italic">employe</hi> of the prisoner, and several men were engaged in the business—the business went on from April till about September—the prisoner came there daily as a rule; he came in a brougham, which used to stand outside the door, in the Waterloo Road—after he had been there some time I received frequent inquiries, and I spoke to the prisoner about them—one night a man rang the bell at about ten p.m., and said he wanted money—the prisoner was there at the time—next day I spoke to the prisoner about it, and said I wondered he did not answer the door, and pay his own debts, and not send the people to me—he said, "Come in my office"—I refused to go—he went inside and shut the door, and said, "D——you, go"—I have heard a good many people come there for money—I heard him say to one man, "Send the milk on; you shall have the money "—as a rule, he had the people in his office, if he was there—when the man rang the bell the prisoner put his head out of window, and said to him, "Go to the man at the area-gate downstairs, he is the one you want," and then he shut the window—if people came to the area gate they would come to me—that is what I complained of next morning—about the latter end of August a sheriff's officer was in possession, and the furniture was removed—the business did not come to an end just then; they had one or two more things in, and kept it on for three or four weeks longer, I daresay, and then it ceased—they were doing something there, I could not exactly say what—Dunham was there only two or three months—after he left another man came in his place—I should think Dunham left early in the summer—I heard that the prisoner had an accident, in the early part of August, I think—about the time of the accident they were going to take some of the milk-cans out one night—the milk-cans were decreasing.</p>

I live at 81, Broomwood Road, Wandsworth Common—I was formerly a milk contractor—in the early part of 1890 I was out of business, and I was introduced to the prisoner at Waterloo Station by a policeman—the prisoner asked me if I would manage his new milk business—he said he was trying to make a business at Waterloo, and hoped he should do so—I was to be very particular, and everything I bought I was to pay cash for—I said I should be very pleased to take his business, and do the best I could for him—the business was to commence at once; I believe he had some milk there previously to engaging me—I saw some milk when I went—he engaged me as manager of the business—I don't think he had an office at that time, but soon afterwards</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Clement's Inn, Strand—at the end of 1889 and beginning of 1890 I was solicitor to Messrs, Smith and Philpott in one transaction, relating to the business of the Eldon Dairy Company, and that only—on 13th January, 1890, an agree<lb/>ment was come to between them and the prisoner, by which he was appointed their manager of the Eldon Dairy Company—this is a plain copy of the agreement; we cannot put our hand on the original; it was signed at my office—I believe Smith and Philpott were proprietors of the Eldon Club in Chancery Lane at the time—the Eldon Dairy was carried on by Smith and Philpott down to March, 1890, and then it was trans<lb/>ferred to Mrs. Scott Jervis by this document, dated 11th March, 1890.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner came to me in September, 1889, when he was carrying on some business in the name of Scott Jervis and Co. at Barnstaple, for the purpose of being served with a bankruptcy notice from some people in Darlington, in respect of a debt of £79 19s. 10d, which he had incurred—we had a long talk then—I waft very favourably impressed with him—I understood that a member of the firm who were the judgment creditors had been defeated by him in some local election,</p>

               <p>and he attributed the bankruptcy proceedings to political spite—I was admitted in 1878—I believed his story, and I arranged to raise money for him to meet the amount of the judgment creditors' claim—they were Emly and Sons, of Darlington—he told me that was the only pressing claim of any kind against him—as the result of my conversation with him I spoke to a friend, Mr. Philpott, a barrister, and he and I jointly advanced him £80 for the purpose of setting this bankruptcy notice—Philpott, Smith, and I afterwards advanced him other sums for the purpose of the Eldon Dairy Company milk and butter businesses at Exeter, Barnstaple, and London—Philpott, Smith, and I paid, £150 into an account, in the name of Smith and Philpott, at Exeter—there was an arrangement that he was to furnish weekly accounts, he being the manager—so far as I know he never remitted any account—Smith and Philpott went to Exeter to endeavour to get some account—I have not seen them here to-day—Smith and Philpott were dissatisfied at not being able to get accounts, and, as I had introduced the prisoner to them, I was anxious to get the matter closed with as little loss to them as possible—I communicated with the prisoner on the subject several times, personally, and by letter, and, a few days before 11st March, 1890, probably, I suggested to Smith and Philpott separately the terms I thought I might be able to arrange to get back some of the money which they had put in (I communicated this to the prisoner)—for the £80 I had advanced I took the prisoner's bill at six months for £100—that was not met at maturity; it was in con<lb/>nection with the bankruptcy notice, not the Eldon Dairy—I spoke to the prisoner, Smith, and Philpott about the terms embodied in the agree<lb/>ment of 11th March—I understood that the original Barnstaple business of Scott Jervis and Co. was Mrs. Scott Jervis's, and that this agreement was practically merely a re-transfer to the original proprietors—his bank<lb/>ruptcy was frequently spoken of between us; I think he knew more about the bankruptcy law than I did—I don't think that it was suggested that the Eldon Dairy should be his business—they were his wife's cheques which were given for it—they were either post-dated, or it was arranged that they should not be presented, one for three months and the other for six months—Smith and Philpott did not see Mrs. Scott Jarvis, so far as I know—I know nothing about the business at Waterloo Station—after March I ceased all connection with the matter; when I found it utterly impossible to get any part of my money repaid I gave up wasting my time—I had nothing to do with the cheques—I paid Philpott £40, his share of the £80, with ten per cent., and I had also put £50 into the Eldon Company, which remains there now.</p>

At last I did find her, and put her to bed; but I could not find my wife. I afterwards saw her in a public-house in Blackfriars Road, and asked her if she intended to come back to me. She said, "No"; what she had done could not be undone. I heard no more of her for about three years, and I was told that after seven years I could marry again. I came across Mrs. Tomkins; she was a widow; she knew my real name, and asked me if I should like to marry her, and I did so. She kept telling people she was still a widow, and she would not allow her children to call me Dad. I said, "I had better get out of this." I do not suppose I earned more than fifteen shillings in four weeks, and she told me to go, as she had got a man who could keep her; so I went away.</p>
